"Quickly became one of my favorite soundtracks and I will be listening to it on repeat for a long time. This was brilliant. A sincere and depressed blend of drama and dry humor as a college graduate struggles with love and the inadequate feeling of not being a post-grad success. A film that transcends generations. It‚Äôs timeless in its looks at loneliness and lack of identity. Almost 60 years after its release and this films‚Äô commentary still lands as post-grads continue to struggle with a time in their personal life of heavy transition. 
Dustin Hoffman is a revelation. He was funny and the film itself was funny but his display of pain and suffering carry more weight. His performance of this young man who‚Äôs entire world feels like its collapsing on top of him is stunning.

"Terrific directing, but everything else ages like milk. The plot plays out like a straight white man's ultimate sexual fantasy and declaration of independence, and the fact that Dustin Hoffman groped Anne Bancroft on set only makes things worse. However, Mike Nichols' golden touch proves to be the saving grace.
If viewed from a completely artistic perspective, The Graduate is for sure one of the greatest feats in cinema history. The ingenious shots, frame composition and cinematography levitate an old-fashioned story to the next level. A young Hoffman's newbie charm works perfectly here against the milf energy of Bancroft, creating abundant sexual tensions that ultimately characterize The Graduate. Also, the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack fits this whole experience in a truly odd manner. I just wish they didn't play Scarborough Fair three times in a row.",3.5

Still a 5/5, obviously. Still in my top 20 of all time.",5.0
"‚ÄúBen, this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs completely baked.""
Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is half-baked. He exists at that uneasy convergence of adulthood and adolescence, communicating inarticulately, careening between sullenness and exuberance. He is us at our most dangerously na√Øve, at that insufferable early-twenty-something phase when we believe we suffer no na√Øvet√©. Most of all, he does not want to become his parents‚Äîwho does? But in his ignorance and spitefulness, he enmeshes himself in his parents‚Äô world with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft).
Mrs. Robinson is completely baked, and then some. She is sardonic, intelligent, and world-weary. She is disappointed by the life she has made for herself, but not content to reside in her disappointment. She reaches for ephemeral distraction with Benjamin but wants more for her lovely but insipid daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross)‚Äîcertainly more than the unmoored dope with whom she‚Äôs had a summer fling.
It is the great achievement of Mike Nichols‚Äô The Graduate that its nominal villain, Mrs. Robinson, is the only character with whom one would want to hold a conversation. The audience‚Äôs alliances are always uneasy. We root for Benjamin to break free from the shackles of his ennui and for he and Elaine to be together‚Äîbut not wholeheartedly, our enthusiasm tempered by their vacuity. We are wary of Mrs. Robinson and her latent (and then patent) anger‚Äîbut while she may have ‚Äúseduced‚Äù Benjamin, we know she didn‚Äôt take advantage of him.
Ushering in the second ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù of Hollywood together with Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate was an enormous hit, speaking to a generation that saw a chasm between itself and its forebears. That it was insightful enough to recognize the real-life complexity its protagonists could not grasp maintains its relevance today.",5.0
"If you feel worried, confused, and concerned about your future, this could possibly be the movie for you (or not). This film has that melancholic feel to it and it has a lot to do with Benjamin's facial expression that he does throughout the movie. His face of 1000 words and only 1 emotion: worry.
The whole idea is that Benjamin is concerned about his future and then throughout the rest of the movie, he's still worried and confused.
Only to get to the end of the movie-

* s p o i l e r a l e r t *

where he finally feels he has a reason and purpose to do something (like all of us these days) only to end up being worried about his future again. It's like, was it all worth it?
*e n d s p o i l e r *
I don't know but It's a great ending to a great movie.
Another thing I liked was how they used Simon & Garfunkel's Sound of Silence while there is literal silence going around. It's like if Ben's character mutes the outside world because he's too busy focusing on his own state of mind. Which we see at the end, Elaine does the same exact thing when they show the reactions from everyone's face. Silence everywhere..
Man, there are so many great directing decisions that were made with this film.
I mean the directing itself is definitely something to talk about. The angles, the focusing, the zoom in's, the transitions, and a whole bunch of other directing things I don't really know about. It all works so well. I just wish i knew more about it so I can talk about it more but that's okay.
Either way, it's a great film and it was my lovely girlfriend's idea for us to watch it. It was our first time seeing this and that's because i've had the Criterion copy for a while.. so I'm glad she picked this one out before it got too dusty üò¨",4.5

"takes the framework of an antonioni movie but makes it comedic through nichols' uncommon sensitivity and dreamy episodic cascade of stifling upper-class social mores -- old hollywood chauvinism and new hollywood neuroticism being forced to occupy the same space in time. the cerulean serenity of the braddock's pool is the emotional reservoir of post-war life -- small surface variation above a shallow depth, fenced in by concrete and only given expression in reflecting the blinding shimmer of an all-night 24/7 global solarscape economy. hoffman is central to the picture and does so well as a blank-slate hyper-sensitive creepo with nothing behind his eyes except for anxiety and anger who graduates (hah) into having a purpose and a heart, but anne bancroft achieves a genuine maturity that's so often faked in the american cinema -- her knowing eyes, the way she comfortably allows hoffman to orbit her like a planet, her resolute stillness concealing a deeply bitter misery. to a contemporary viewer, it's as easy to inhabit her perspective as it is hoffman's, and nichols utilizes long and zoom lenses to allow for multiple subjectivities, not to mention the godardian musical refrains straight out of contempt, the exhausted tones of a half-transcendent simon & garfunkel.
really glad i finally saw this, its influence is etched across so many future works like american gigolo and risky business -- you can especially understand how tom cruise gets a lot of his nervous confidence from how hoffman handles things here, especially that famous running shot. the graduate is so effortlessly able to juggle worldly cynicism and a budding youthful vitality; one of the great american pictures, and further proof that the 1960s might very well be the height of cinema as an artform.",5.0

"Drifting. Sinking. Drowning. Mike Nichols builds ""The Graduate"" on these visual metaphors, crafting a melancholy comedy about the uncertain transition to adulthood. An observation of waning youth, an indictment of inexperience, and a dirge sung to jaded maturity, the film is spritely and solemn, hilarious and heartbreaking. A look at life, love, and their consequences, Nichols' film is rich and wonderful.
Beginning with Simon and Garfunkel's plaintive ""Sounds of Silence"" strumming in the background, ""The Graduate"" introduces us to Benjamin Braddock, fresh from college and clueless about his future. With obvious familial wealth but few prospects of his own, Braddock stumbles through an affairs, parental advice sessions, and a tangle of relationships. These stumbles and relationships inextricably tied together, Braddock is dealt lessons on love, sex, and the cyclical nature of it all.
The story is both authentic and cinematic, and it is a compelling blend of light and dark. Braddock is a memorable protagonist. As excellently portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, Braddock is gawky, unsure, and driven to let life come at him at its own pace. Anne Bancroft's performance as Mrs. Robinson is also remarkable: seasoned, knowing, and bored until her foundation is shaken by envy for what is genuine. Katharine Ross and William Daniels round out the cast with accomplished and sharp supporting roles.
Nichols' display of comic melancholy is lovely. His camera observes faces quietly but also captures the depth of landscapes. His characters are specks in the grander scheme of things, but they are deep and real in closeup. Compositions are varied, detailed, and lively; colors are sun dappled and real. Nichols employs editing that seamlessly pushes his story forward. Collapsing time and space, the editing reflects the blink-and-you-miss-it nature of endless summer.
Punctuating it all are the songs of Simon and Garfunkel. Paul Simon's words and music temper the comedy and underscore the longing of the characters. The songs reinforce tone and sell the drama. The combination of song and story is beautiful.
Narratively pleasing, aesthetically lovely, and technically rich, ""The Graduate"" is wholly appealing. Outstanding performances, direction that marries tone to deft cinematic storytelling, and a deep but gleeful authenticity, weave together a film with impact, grace, and spirit. Funny and meditative, confusing and promising, ""The Graduate"" is a lot like life.",5.0
"Poor Elaine. All the discussion about this film focuses on Ben, when it's her fate that haunts me the most. She was only guilty of falling in love with an impulsive and entitled (but charming and exciting) guy. And now she's collateral damage in his manic-pixie-dream-boy quest, doomed to the same awful life her parents lived because of one snap decision.
Everything about post-college uncertainty still stings some fifty-three years later, of course, but would it be a stretch to say this (with the benefit of hindsight, of course) feels like a swan song for Baby Boomer counterculture? Because despite being made two years before the Mansons and Nixon, that final stare into an uncertain future, soundtracked by that famous Simon and Garfunkle song, stings as brutally as anything in Inherent Vice. I know Tarantino cribbed the opening for Jackie Brown, but it now feels like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an attempt to earnestly make the ""happy ending"" this film is mistakenly considered to have.",4.5

How will he handle it?
Benjamin is Charlie's (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) older and weirder version if you think about it, they are almost the same person during the first 30 minutes. I don't know if it's because I've just seen it a couple of days ago or something, but he also kind of reminded me of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. He has the same obsession to have a purpose, the indefinition of what to do next, and his fixation with the women that enter his life are quite similar across these two movies. I'm also sure Benjamin isn't 100% mentally stable, so one more comparison between them. Also, this was released first, so do with that what you will. It could be just me though.
This was the first serious movie Dustin Hoffmann starred in, and his first Oscar nomination too, which honestly I wasn't too surprised to find out about. He's slowly becoming one of my favorite actors, I really have to watch more of his work. I don't know what the Academy's parameters of evaluation were like back then, but it seems to me Katharine Ross was nominated for 'Best Actress in a Supporting Role' just because she screamed really hard a couple of times. I'm not saying she was bad in it, but I didn't see enough to justify it. 1967 must've been a weak year I guess.

"I know, I was expecting a five-star-review, too. The truth is, I don't think The Graduate is that phenomenal. I mean, on the technical side of things, it is. There are some amazing montages and shot compositions in here. The way one scene flows to the next, skipping over the money shots ala sex scenes in favor of a scene of Hoffman floating in a pool, or just a close up of a face for a whole minute - and all that to the tunes of Simon and Garfunkel ? Yes... God, yes.
I mean, heck, the very first shot in the movie, where Hoffman stands on a moving walkway in an airport, has been copied time and time again. There are so many great and quotable lines in the film, too.
Then, what's the matter? Well, the crux of this movie hangs on a relationship that I just don't think works at all. Now, the affair with Mrs. Robinson I'm actually fine with - it might be a little far fetched (like, why does she want him specifically?) but I'm not too bothered by it. It's the relationship between Hoffman and Ross I don't buy. There seems to be no reason to me that Elaine should want to be with Ben. He's a sleazebag, and she absolutely knows it - and he doesn't treat her with any respect through-out the film. Their only connection is that they're the same age and Ben's parents expects him to be with her.
Now, there is a scene where they hang out eating burgers in his car, which is supposed to spark the connection. It's a scene where the noise and music around them drown out their voices. It's really cool, stylistically, but it hardly drives their relationship home. Also, Ben just decides he's gonna marry her - for no good reason. He's also already decided she'll marry him. First I didn't mind it, I thought it was just a character flaw - but then we see Elaine actually considering it, and I'm totally taken aback.
The Graduate started out as a sweet, slightly dysfunctional coming-of-age story, about a bewildered post-graduate rich kid just wanting to break out of the system for a moment. I think the movie devolves when it suddenly revolves around stopping a marriage and I felt no sense of why.
Three stars because I did still have a very good time with it, I think it's a prime example of visionary filmmaking, but I was plenty disappointed by the story.

"A May-December affair looms over Mike Nichols‚Äô iconic work, starring Dustin Hoffman and the great Anne Bancroft in The Graduate. While its story might seem to be outdated in today‚Äôs times, its release in 1967 broke new grounds, scandalous almost. Yet, it ushered a phenomenon in the American cinema that speaks and probes on the experiences of the younger generation during that time. Nichols‚Äô understood this generation‚Äôs collective angst, curiosity, desperation, and resistance to the pressures of tradition. In doing so, Nichols‚Äô elevated the thinness of the story and carved something more significant and deeper in scope.
The story relays the affair between a young college graduate and a mature woman. Dustin Hoffman who plays the graduate Benjamin Braddock, puts on a convincingly awkward performance in the first half. But Hoffman maturely calibrates Ben‚Äôs immature decisions as the film progresses. At once humorous, Ben‚Äôs life becomes more and more sad and melancholic once he dates the mature woman‚Äôs daughter. Anne Bancroft is stellar, giving depth and classiness in a role that sounds and feels predatory by nature. Katharine Ross is heartbreaking as Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter as she slowly loses her innocence by falling in love with Benjamin.
I‚Äôm not sure about the repetitiveness of the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack in the movie, but it sure was engraved on my mind while watching the film. However, there‚Äôs freshness and vitality to what Mike Nichols‚Äô is doing in The Graduate. It‚Äôs a film that represented a generation, and regardless of its said drawbacks, it definitely stood the test of time.",4.0

"Really close to a 4 because so much of it is great but I had some issues that were big enough to make it not super great. I thought the cinematography was incredible and they used a lot of cool techniques I wouldn't expect to see in a 60s movie. I thought I wouldn't like it because of the plot, but the writing and the characters are well done, so it ended up not bothering me. I also thought the inclusion of Simon and Garfunkel was neat.
My problem is that I think they should've shown more scenes between Elaine and Ben because it just wasn't believable that she liked him too after he literally banged her mom. Their relationship seemed to feel more forced and I would've liked for it to be more developed considering how many scenes Ben shared with Mrs. Robinson. It's probably a large reason why the last act didn't seem as good to me as the first two. 
Overall, I did like it more than I expected and I totally get why it's a widely loved movie.",3.5

"The Graduate is a movie that's had a profound effect on pop culture. The movie has been referenced, parodied, and praised in nearly every form of media you can imagine. It's for good reason too. It's a well made film with great performances, and a Simon and Garfunkel fueled soundtrack that hits just right. It definitely has some questionable morals at times. After all, this is a film about an older woman having and affair with a younger man and the repercussions of those actions. However, it never pushes the envelope too far into the realm of crassness. Which is part of why it has become such a classic over the years.
The movie also captures a very particular feeling. A precise moment in time that everyone reaches eventually. One where you're considered an adult by age, but mentally you're still stuck in the valley adolescence. Everyone always tells us when we're growing up that ""you're young, you've got your whole life ahead of you"". Well, this is the moment you've been waiting for.

"Hold on while I sound pretentious for a minute.
This is the perfect example of how to present a film. Now not to throw shade at the plot, because I think it's great and the themes of the film hit way to close to home and that's part of why I love it (although I do think it loses a bit of steam in the second half). But this plot could have easily been presented in the most basic, shot reverse shot kind of way since it isn't the type of story you would expect to demand expert film making.
Instead an incredible amount of detail is put towards the shot composition, framing, lighting, camera movement, and focus. Almost every frame oozes with intrigue and meaning. There are literally shots of this film ingrained into my mind, the shot under the leg, the underwater scuba shot, the Elaine clueing in shot. I would never expect to remember so many frames from a film about a guy banging a milf.
This is just the kind of movie that makes me appreciate film as a medium. It's refreshing to see so much effort put into the visuals of a film that on the surface doesn't really need it. It's why I feel disappointed when I watch films that seem to only think of presentation as an afterthought. The graduate shows that any movie can be so much more.
The film does push it though with how many times it plays scarborough fair.",4.5
"I love the stylistic choices and what this film is trying to do, specifically tackling that terrifying time after graduating. I‚Äôm not there yet but I do dread it existentially, and that unclear foggy time is perfectly encapsulated. Simon and Garfunkel also absolutely elevated this film to classic status. They are integral to the story (I‚Äôll get into that more in a second). I also thought the first half had a lot of genuinely hilarious moments, particularly surrounding Benjamin‚Äôs awkwardness (when he grabs Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs breast and then just stands there I laughed really hard), but I also just don‚Äôt quite think the movie comes together on the whole.
I think the introduction of Elaine into the love triangle really turns Ben from awkward hero to a creepy loser, which I understand is the point, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite executed effectively. Elaine May worked on the script and that much is clear, but I think her having even more creative control could have turned this into a black comedy and fantastic satire of middle class discontent and family boundaries but instead The Graduate gets stuck in a wishy washy area where it‚Äôs almost a straightforward romantic comedy and almost a satire about shitty people. It‚Äôs just awkward and frustrating and muddles the message. 
I do really like the ending. Using Sound of Silence at the beginning and the end shows that Ben really hasn‚Äôt gotten anywhere by the story‚Äôs end. He and Elaine aren‚Äôt going to last, and he‚Äôs using her as the only thing propping him up from a deep depression. He‚Äôs gone through a lot but he hasn‚Äôt learned anything from it.

"It‚Äôs a wonderful thing to watch a film for the first time and not click with it, only to be in total awe the second time you give it a chance. This film is not only the most meticulous and precise film from a technical standpoint but one of the most powerfully resonating films from a narrative standpoint. Benjamin is a young boy recently graduating college with no sense of purpose and direction. As well as family and friends who expect him to conform and follow the regulations of American society. He feels lost and empty, and so becomes entangled in a affair with his parents friend, Mrs Robinson. But the beauty of this film is how it shows that the true driving force in our lives isn‚Äôt the societal expectations put on us but love. The first time we truly see Benjamin flourish as a human is in his love for Elaine. The daughter of Mrs Robinson who he recently had an affair with. The transition from seeing this lost boy turn into a man with ambition and purpose is beautiful. And it‚Äôs all for a natural and wonderful thing. Love. Not for qualifications or becoming a cog in the American system, something that Mrs Robinson has so tragically fallen into. Which is clearly the reason she feels resentment towards Benjamin near the end. He could have something she never did. The use of Simon and Garfunkel throughout is also wonderfully placed. Not only within the film to create atmosphere but also in the lyricism of the songs and how they mirror the story.",5.0

"If I were to isolate this movie, only considering its directing by Mike Nichols and its script as a work of literature, then the movie deserves the analysis and accolades it's received.
But there's more to look at, a lot more.
Has this movie seemed reasonably plausible to anyone? The character of Ben is not only unattractive but also a wimpy pathetic loser. And yet he's seduced by a lovely 40-something who gladly puts up with his incessant whining. Exactly how desperate is Mrs. Robinson when, frankly, there's a larger world of 21 year-old males out there. I must've missed her motivations for going after Ben. Is she that bored? (I shall ignore the fact that Hoffman was 30 years old at this point. He doesn't look like a college-age male --
Who identifies with Ben or feels sorry for him? He's a rich college graduate with an older woman trying to seduce him. Ben is such an idiot that he can't talk straight to a hotel clerk. He whines in bed to Mrs. Robinson, insisting on calling her that. He takes Elaine to a stripshow on their first date. What??
So what is this movie about? The malaise of college-age Boomers? Is Ben supposed to represent the uncertainties of youth culture circa
1967?
If so, these people are, or were, losers. Modern viewers aren't going to identify with Ben. Warriors, weightlifters, boxers, athletes, genuises, go-getters, entrepreneurs, inventors, or basically anybody with some talent and drive -- if you are any of these, you will probably despise the main character as much as I do.
And I don't see the point of representing this character, in this way, in a work of art. Perhaps, for future historians, ""The Graduate"" will end up signifying the dissipation and absurdities of the late US empire. And it's a nostalgia thing for early Boomers. That's about all it's good for, other than the clear skill shown in the directing (which I did really like a lot).
This movie lowers my testosterone by 95%, in spite of it being about a young male's affair with a very willing cougar. Ben is the loser's loser. He's the gamma's gamma. Do you really think I believe that he's a good athlete?

"üéµ Hello darkness, my old friend üéµ
I think I underestimated the quality of The Graduate before going in. I certainly expected it to be great, but I didn‚Äôt expect a film from 1967 (for some reason) to be this relatable, honest and mature to some teenage boy in the 2020s.
Nearly every choice The Graduate makes, from the precise cinematography and transition scenes to the subtle performances, is absolutely inspiring. There‚Äôs something about the innocence of people and the responsibilities of growing up that terrifies, but fascinates me. I‚Äôm still a very young man, dreaming about a family, about a love, about being a screenwriter in the future or better a director and I‚Äôm still afraid of not reaching these goals, like Benjamin I‚Äôm worrying about the future. In some sense The Graduate is a very simplistic film, but that‚Äôs what I like about it.
The Graduate doesn‚Äôt jump much during the scenes and often just lets the camera rolling, at some point you forget it‚Äôs one shot or it doesn‚Äôt occur to you. It‚Äôs something that older films did much often than film nowadays, which doesn‚Äôt mean it does it better, but for a coming of age story it feels more human. There‚Äôs this patience in this film that pays off, the pacing of this is amazing, maybe also because the film lets the visuals speak, but when it uses dialogue it‚Äôs as strong as no other film.
The soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel is beautiful, some songs are overused in this film, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the music creates a mood of the future or maybe even the past. The music is simply fantastic and heartwarming.
A journey, a coming of age story that impressed me throughout with wonderful directing, sweet performances and a soundtrack that is simply unforgettable. An instant favorite

"Post-grad is a weird time. Some people have a career plan and stick to it (for some reason I find they're usually business majors) and some decide to immediately pursue graduate school, but I think most kind of just float about with some vague idea of their goals and aspirations without the drive to fully pursue them. It's not laziness or lack of motivation, it's just that the shock of exiting the academic world and entering the ""real one"" is kind of traumatizing in its own way.
""There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?""
Currently, from the moment you start forming cogent memories you enter the school system. You get through this and hit eighteen and now have the choice to enter college, but while that might have been a real choice a few decades ago it's now frowned upon if you don't. Media has greatly mythologized this experience, and not only is it the expected route but you'll miss out on so many things if you don't go! Besides, you tried so hard with standardized tests and extracurricular clubs and sports teams and leadership positions, so you don't want all that effort to be for nothing.
So you graduate and you hit your early twenties and now your life is about a quarter of the way over. School is all you've known your whole life ‚Äì which you've constantly been pushed and pressured to excel in ‚Äì and suddenly it's over and you're faced with the real possibility of exiting it. To some the natural extension is graduate school, and I know quite a few people who've said that one of their reasons for continuing was because they don't know how to ""leave"" school. I felt the same way and spent quite some time looking into PhD programs, because while I do love academia I also wanted to become a professor and never actually leave. And honestly, I still might do that.
The Graduate captures that feeling of post-grad paralysis really well, and it's kind of scary how relatable the first scene is. Benjamin Braddock aimlessly shuffles about his parent's house and all their friends shower him with praise for his accomplishments that every other college grad also has. Yeah, I got that award and won this scholarship and earned my degree, but this was all in the itinerary. And now that it's all over, I'm suddenly expected to make a real decision for my future? That sudden freedom is legitimately terrifying.
Even though it came out in 1967, the themes of early-20's aimlessness will never stop being relatable and it feels even more relevant today. Now college degrees are just the norm, career options are more limited, and wages have barely increased while the cost of living has skyrocketed. Except unlike Braddock, most people don't have the luxury of daddy's money to help cushion their ennui.",0.0

I didn't know that this film would hook me as much as it did, I didn't know it would resonate with me as much as it did, and I didn't know that this film would be so amazing to me that it might actually make my top 10 personal favorite films of all time. This movie is beyond fantastic. Again, I really want to give this film five stars. However, there are some aspects of the plot that are incredibly dated, there are some cuts between shots that are really obvious (cuts in time are really obvious because the center of the shot moves a bit during the cut, so you can tell there was a cut), some of the music editing is repetitive, and there are continuity errors in some of the lighting in this film (admittedly, my parents noticed those, not me). There are so many minor glaring flaws like that that don't affect the story that I can't give this film five stars. However, that doesn't mean I didn't adore this film.
Just like The Master, all three of the Oscar-nominated actors for this film-- Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross-- are all phenomenal. It took me a while to appreciate Hoffman's performance, but I absolutely think his social awkwardness is completely genuine. Hell, it reminded me a lot of me in some aspects, which was really scary. We both have the same one-track mind and are bad liars, and that can get us into some tricky spots. I loved that about his character. Bancroft gives it her all in this movie and definitely pulls it off. She's not the Glenn-Close-in-Fatal-Attraction type of person, but she definitely has her moments, and she is really great here. Ross' performance is also really great and very likable. There's one scene in particular where the tension of a certain situation just gets to her more and more until she finally just screams to let it all out. That scream sent chills down my spine in the best way. She was really good in this movie.
The thing I loved the most about this movie was the direction and camerawork. Mike Nichols really directs the hell out of this film. Everything about his direction and the camerawork of this movie just feels tight and focused, and I really loved that. I knew I was in for some good, creative directing when the opening scene shows Ben at a party celebrating his achievements: when he's in the middle of the party, a shaky-cam zooms as close as possible to his face to follow him, but when he has a chance to breathe and relax from all of the noise and tight space around him, the camera zooms out and becomes more steady. That kind of attention to detail is why I am so happy Nichols won a directing Oscar for this movie. If the film was to win any Academy Awards, I'm honestly really glad it won for that aspect. I'm completely blown away that this guy directed The Birdcage. That was such a massive shift for him tonally from this film, and I really love that. The direction and camerawork in this film are truly immaculate. There are a couple of scenes where the camera is positioned on the back of a car as the main character drives through the streets. Those shots were incredible. I felt like I was actually in the car. Along with that, there's an action sequence at the end of this film that is exciting, satisfying, and fun at the same time. I just loved it.
There apparently was a musical score composed by Dave Grusin, but the music I paid more attention to was, obviously, the music by Simon and Garfunkel. This music fits so well into the film and really emphasizes the emotional moments on screen. It does slightly annoy me that some songs are used over and over again for, like, five or ten-minute sequences, but at the same time, they fit so well in those sequences that I don't really care. There's a scene where the song ""Scarborough Fair / Canticle"" plays over a shot where the camera zooms out to look at this bridge that Ben drives across, and I think it choked me up a little. The combination of the beautiful cinematography and the incredible music that both fits well into the movie and is also just really good music in general just really made me happy. I loved the use of music in this film, and I've heard that this film was apparently one of, if not the first film to use basically an entire score of re-used music instead of an instrumental score because films didn't do that a ton back then. That is super, super cool to me, and it still holds up really well.
I think the reason the main character is so likable is that you can see he has a solid moral code at the beginning of the film. Even though he at first rejects Mrs. Robinson and shows he has good instincts, he eventually ends up going back to her, and at that point, the audience knows enough about the character to know that this is not how he would normally act and that they should empathize with him. That's how you make a character like this likable: show that they have good morals and that they usually wouldn't do something like this, but then something comes over them and the audience doesn't want that something to come over them. Does that make sense? Regardless, it's what Nichols and the screenwriters (by the way, this is a great script, too, not in the sense that the lines stand out like in Aaron Sorkin's screenplays, just in the way that it feels natural) did here, and it works beautifully.
Guys, this movie legitimately blew me away. There are some strange editing and continuity errors that are very jarring and some very dated aspects of the way Ben goes about getting the attention of a girl and how quickly she seems to forgive him, but this movie really touched me. It's an incredibly-directed film with great performances, music, and camerawork to boot, and the story is incredibly engaging. The Graduate may just be one of my top 10 personal favorite movies of all time, which must mean I like it a whole lot.

"N√£o sei o que mais admiro neste filme, se a dire√ß√£o sagaz de Mike Nichols - com s√≠mbolos inteligentes, movimentos de c√¢mera significativos e uma mise-en-sc√®ne impec√°vel - ou se o elenco encabe√ßado por Anne Bancroft e Dustin Hoffman.

"I can‚Äôt tell if I watched The Graduate at the best possible time in my life or the worst possible time. As someone who just graduated high school (I know it‚Äôs not the same as the movie, but still), it struck a deeply personal chord with me, but also stoked the fires of my anxiety, all revolving around the simple question facing all young adults: what now? The chains, yet also the security, of childhood has been cast aside, leaving no defined path to travel down. Is it best to look upon every possible avenue and choose the best path for yourself, or is it better to just skip that part of the process and just bury your head in the sand right after graduating? There are no true answers, and the ones offered by the adults who supposedly know better than you aren‚Äôt always the most appealing. Dustin Hoffman embodies the sort of aimless youth that we all become at a certain point, unsure of where to go, trapped in a seemingly endless string of detrimental decisions, often led astray and deluded by those who have already gone through what he is currently experiencing. Will his nihilistic viewpoint of his situation continue to drive him closer towards ruin, mirroring the adults whose fates he tried to avoid? Or will the snap, impulse decision made at the end of the film finally put him on the right path?
Most likely, no, of course not, but I guess it was worth a shot.",4.5
"10/10
My fourth watch.
This is gonna be a long one and a bit personal, just so anyone who wants to steer clear of emotional shit can do so. Also, this review will seem really sad and maybe sappy or unnecessarily complainy. But I have some shit to say, so here we are. Continue at your own risk.
It's impossible to overstate this film's impact on me. There's something about it that truly resonates with me, whether it be the humor, the melancholy mood, or the brilliant editing, dialogue, acting, soundtrack, and I could go on. For me, I feel Ben's experiences every time. I'll get into this more in a minute, but I want to emphasize that I believe that this is one of the greatest pieces of art ever conceived and is a perfect film on every level. I just want to put that out there. I rewatched it today because of that.
Ever since elementary school, I've felt sort of cursed when it comes to love (already it sounds overly dramatic...we're off to a good start). I've always been a big nerd and was never very popular. I liked a few girls in elementary school, one of whom I was close friends with despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that I'd told her, but we were never more than friends. In middle school, I was rejected once again. As I entered high school, though, a friend and I began to like each other. We were together, and then apart, and then together again, and ""split up"" (if you can call the end of a ninth grade relationship ""splitting up""). I won't get too into the specifics, but she and I really hurt each other on an emotional level and it left a huge impact on my attitude towards love and life. Not only did I feel that I was cursed to fail in terms of love, but the heartache I felt also left me extremely stunted emotionally and for a long time afterward I didn't really let out any emotions.
Throughout this all was film. I already loved film and The Graduate at this point in my life, but its themes of hopelessness and failure and isolation resonated with me more and more upon each watch. I love this movie wholeheartedly because it helped me understand my emotions and my worldview in a beautiful and powerful way.
If you've read some of my reviews recently, you may know that I've been having a rough eleventh grade year. It's been just about the worst few months of my life and I've been deeply depressed for much of it, despite that I have the best friends right now than ever before in my life. But, in the midst of that darkness, I began to feel something I hadn't been able to feel for a long time: I have begun to like a girl. This probably isn't a big deal to most people, but it's really important to me right now. It's so refreshing because for the first time in a long time, I can enjoy the feeling of some semblance of hope and love, and I know that if The Graduate had anything to do with it, I am forever indebted to this film. It truly is perfection.
EDIT (2/2/2021): Haven't thought about this review in awhile, but I don't really like parts of it. Feels too self-pitying, which is obviously part of both depression and loneliness. Or maybe it's how weird the situation with this girl got, idk. Just glad I'm past this point. Ight bye.",5.0
"Benjamin Braddock isn't really the embodiment of any whole person, but I feel like the fact he's living his life an empty shell is what allows him to resonate through many viewers across all generations. He's indecisive, but it was all the result of the fact that the adults around him have basically formed him through societal pressures of what they expect their children to become upon finishing school - with a clear path set in mind.
But I think it's just the fact that The Graduate sees that life can't be decided right away by adults, through the emotionally resonant Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack, that allows it to last for so long. It's often incredibly funny, but realizing that there's no clear path even if it looks happy within the moment, is just all you need for something so devastating.",5.0
"And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared

Did I wake up this morning and immediately watch this again? Absolutely.
I'm just...so impressed with this movie and how it chooses to tell the story it does; it's something that, at a different time or from a different director, would have looked wildly different. Yet we are lucky enough to have this particular version. The editing style, the thoughtfulness of the framing, some really, truly inspired direction...this has been one of my favorite movies ever since I saw it a few years ago, but I've somehow underrated it.
Rewatching this somehow served as a reminder that movies are, for me, like memory - experienced, catalogued, lost, misremembered, relived - and they are often more real than my own memories. Whew.",5.0
"Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?
As I was watching Dustin Hoffman making an awkward ass out of himself in The Graduate, I kept wondering to myself: What is the point of all this? It wasn't as funny as I had been lead to believe, and indeed perhaps it's a more drama-focused dramedy than laugh out loud hilarious. But then, a certain scene in the middle of the film when Mrs. Robinson reveals her secrets to our protagonist (I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it yet) brought the film up to a whole different level for me. It revealed a deeper meaning to the characters and their motivations, and I was hooked from that point on.
Hoffman plays Ben Braddock, a recent college graduate who is seduced into having a steamy, though awkward, affair with the tantalizing Mrs. Robinson, the wife of one of Ben's father's business partners. Though he is completely against the relationship at first, he seems to be more and more involved as time goes on, but their relationship never really seems to go beyond the scheduled sexual encounters. Things get even more complicated for Ben when he falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's even more astounding daughter, Elaine. Now he is torn between keeping his past affair with her mother a secret, and revealing everything to her, which could obviously be devastating to their relationship.
The plot elements presented in this story are what really drew me into watching The Graduate in the first place. I couldn't help but be somewhat disappointed at the lack of a lot of comedic moments, but I soon began to realize that this film was more of a drama with some light comedic moments, rather than an even mix. Perhaps that's what lost my interest near the beginning- luckily the second act begins to swing the story into full speed, and it all finishes up in one of the best romantic endings in cinematic history.
My favorite part of the film would have to be the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack. I'm a huge fan of 60's music, and the soundtrack provided in the film really added a nice atmosphere to each of the scenes, whether romantic or dramatic. I may go as far as saying that this is the epitome of 1960's music as a whole- it just rang of everything that music represented during that time, and really helped me connect with the story.
It may not be quite as good as Mel Brooks' The Producers, but The Graduate does have some really great, memorable moments. Young Dustin Hoffman gives an ecstatic performance as Ben Braddock, and his awkward nature is what provided most of the comedic moments throughout the film. The story itself is classic in every sense of the word, and the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. One of the best relationship dramas ever put onto celluloid.",4.5

The Graduate it‚Äôs a classic, a work ahead their times, I really enjoy re-watch this masterpiece sometimes
It‚Äôs a beautiful movie that overflows huge class and love in their realization. The rhythm is enjoyable, in any moment in lost the line of the history and where the story want to show us.
Dustin Hoffman it‚Äôs a dream, maybe his performance is not to noise it‚Äôs enough to love the character performing the handsome-boy Ben Braddock, I enjoy how we‚Äôre growing up with the character according the history is passing, or in the tension moments almost the end.
Anne Brancroft made a legendary character in this movie, performing the loved-hatred Mrs. Robinson, the crush of our grandparents, her sarcastic comments are the best part of the movie, love her.

"I just want to say one word to you.
Just one word.
Are you listening?
Awkwardness.
The Graduate must be one of a select few films ‚Äî maybe even the first, I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî to spearhead the subgenre of comedy that heavily relies upon unnerving the audience through awkward interaction upon discomforting situation. And it‚Äôs still one of the best to ever do it.
The whole film is chock-full of metaphors, some of which I understood, most of which flew over my head, but all of which are greatly entertaining nonetheless.",4.0
"Unexpectedly, The Graduate on rewatch turned out to mirror my life as a cinephile; or of my life in general, even. The first time I've seen this I was 20, exactly as old as Hoffman's Benjamin is in the film. Back then, I thought it was fine, but this sure was no American Pie - this being my brain-dead criticism back in the day is probably the ultimate irony. Now, as it turns out, I am just a few years younger than Anne Bancroft at the time of the film's release. Let that sink in. Fortunately, I am now seeing the film with completely different eyes.
How the film portays Benjamin's aimlessness and anxiety is spot-on, if not exactly subtle. Especially the generational conflict with his parents struck me. These are all members of the ""Greatest Generation"", they won the War, mind you. None of their conceptions make any sense to Benjamin. Yet, I need to hand it to them, they are quite chill about him drifting endlessly in the pool. Mr Robinson, on the other hand, couldn't care less about what Benjamin has to say. He couldn't even pour him a Bourbon, even though he explicitly asked for one.
Mrs Robinson, though, she is on the prowl for Ben. There is just no way she mistook his room for the bathroom. I love how quickly the film cuts to the chase when it comes to her seduction. We're about 10 minutes in when tiny Ben is iconically framed under Mrs Robinson's legs. When their affair sets in motion, we get treated to a beatifully shot montage of weeks and months of them meeting in their hotel room. That one edit from the air mattress to Mrs Robinson: chef's kiss. And of course, Simon and Garfunkel's The Sound of Silence plays over it - again, not the obvious choice but it is a perfect choice.
That scene is so great that director Nichols just plays another Simon and Garfunkel song afterwards; why the hell not? I love how visually the affair comes to an end when we can see fallen leaves swimming in the pool. Something tells me that this film, for better or worse, must have inspired so many mumblecore indie dramas. As a 2000s kid, I saw a lot of the O.C. in these scenes. Anyhow, this is when Mrs Robinson's daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Katharine Ross, comes into play. At this point the film should probably have a dip in quality, but it just doesn't.
Then there comes the big reveal, and that's when I expected the film to finally take a turn for the worse. Yet again, it doesn't. Benjamin, though, he goes off the deep end. His behaviour in Berkeley is unbearable, and the movie knows it. At this point I am rooting for them to not get married, neither Ben nor Elaine know what they want from life. Also I don't want her to marry that other guy. So, with the often-spoofed finale the film is right on the money. Hoffman fending off the wedding guests with that huge cross is a riot - I was convinced this idea was from the end of the Wayne's World sequel.
Recently, I've learned that the final shots of the film on the bus were only a lucky accident. This was supposed to be a triumphant finale, but Nichols discovered the shot with the awkwardly fading smiles in his dailies and just put them in the film, again playing The Sound of Silence over that image. It is a bold choice that ultimately turns this movie into that special experience that it is. All of a sudden, it says something profound about growing up, about becoming a fully formed person. What a nasty gut-punch.",5.0

"Have you ever seen those Black Friday videos of a store not open yet but people bust through the glass doors anyway and trample over everyone? That's basically what Mike Nichols did to the Hays Code. Technically the Code didn't end til 68, but it was almost completely inept and inefficient by the end, partly due to Nichols making a mockery of it.
It basically went like this...
Hays Code: Guys I think we are getting close to being over, but can you still make sure you make films that show the family and marriage structure in a positive and stable light?
Mike Nichols:
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? -FUCK
The Graduate - YOU
Hays Code: Alright, I think we're done here.
The Graduate is just magical. Nichols pushing the envelope and directing contentious and sparring dialogue like no one else can. The explosive introduction of Dustin Hoffman. The continuous use of one the greatest bands or musicians ever.

"I will confess something about myself to you all: I am not given to writing reviews of this type of film because everything has already been saying about it and I think that sometimes my words may be unnecessary as well this review.
The Graduate is a film that for me is in the same league (without any problem) along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Goodfather or The Shining, films that are more than just cult films, which have become public domain and popular culture not only in the United States but the whole world and being so it is difficult to enjoy them personally because they are so well known by everyone that they become crowd-pleasers, but wow, I have nothing against them and they are respected.
Mike Nichols made a film so autonomous that he does whatever he wants without warning: at times it's slow, at others it's not. The script is sometimes simple, but at other times very intense and the characters are simple, but at the same time they are well constructed. A film that, like the ones I mentioned before, also has its own philosophy and I think that's why it has the title of being a great classic because it surpasses many of the typical ideas that existed in the years when it was released. What I like most about the film is its ending. It's so outrageous and improvised, one of those so bad it's so good that it's really great to watch.
The Graduate is and will be one of those films that you may never love fervently, but you will hardly hate it, and it's not that I didn't like it, but it is respected and should be given credit for having a place to be a little ahead of its time, iconic from beginning to end, not to mention that it has one of the best debuts that exists in an actor like Dustin Hoffman. A story that will remain with great value and essential over time.",3.0

"When my new housemate, excitedly casting her eyes over my collection, spied The Graduate and immediately insisted we watch it, I knew this latest domestic arrangement was going to work just fine. What do I love most about this film? Is it the way it manages to be one of the funniest comedies ever filmed whilst nonetheless managing to make me so very sad? Is it the countercultural tendencies at its heart, questioning the dominant values of contemporary society? Is it the magnificence of its soundtrack, flooding the film's soundscape with melancholy? The Graduate is, to me, the great masterpiece of New Hollywood, its ability to so comprehensively and concisely summate the disillusionment of the then-maturing baby boomers nothing short of heart-wrenching. It says everything that needed to be said at the time, wrapping up one of the most relevant social commentaries ever put to film in what is essentially a raunchy sex comedy. Yet even with that specificity, that is a film no less relevant today; indeed watching it now, yet closer to being a graduate myself, it affected me a good deal more than the last time I saw it. The Graduate takes a serious, stark look at the society of the 1960s and reveals the underlying dissatisfaction of the human experience. 45 years on, it's scary to see how true it all still holds.",4.5
"I think everyone knows it, it's iconic to this day. One of the first lines spoken in the film that is so true to life I think everyone can connect or relate to it on some level. ""I worry about the future."" Doesn't everyone though, the older you get the more you are aware of what surrounds you and not what's ahead of you. Swimming with a school of fish is easy you have everyone to guide you, it's like a team effort and no matter what they always stick together it's only when someone gets separated from them that they have to navigate the big, mysterious and ominous sea all on their own. Just like how in school you have teachers to attempt to tell you how to navigate life by sharing useless information with us we won't need in the real world, but nonetheless they can be helpful, obviously that's their job. But when you reach the point where you don't need an education anymore they send you out of those buildings that you called a hellscape for the past 20 years and into the real world where it could either be your playground or the death of you. If you couldn't tell by what I just wrote I worry about my future a lot, there are so many possibilities for what I could do and each second that goes by feels quicker than the last and I haven't even considered a collage I would care to apply to, granted I am probably too young to worry about that but seeing my classmates talk about what they would want to do with their life and where they would want to go creates an internal unease within me. One that can somewhat be explained in the character of Benjamin Braddock. When we first see him he seems disconnected with reality as if life is some convoluted illusion that throws everything at you if you aren't ready, staring at everything and looking at nothing. The adults in Ben's life aren't really a big help as well especially one I will get to in a moment. Out of the many themes this film deals with communications between different age gaps is the most noticeable. We see this at the party scene with people from Bens past, most if not all are only concerned about what he is going to do with his life. This scene in particular was uneasy to watch and not in a creepy way but the looks on Bens face say it all. Knowing you can't slack off anymore like you would do in school because everything you do has major effects on you now, but unsure what you want to do causes more tension in the mind of a naive young man. The pool scene is another perfect example of the misadventures of life. How the swimming gear represents responsibilities that weigh him down Ben frantically stands at the bottom of the pool trying not to get humiliated by everyone watching him, or he could be drifting in a raft not paddling in a certain direction just him letting it take him where fate wants to.
There is a unequivocal feel that comes with this movie like some sort of hypnotism while we see the sides of humanity that people of the time were so unaware of. You can argue and say that there was a clear hero and villain of the movie but I believe that there was neither, in reality there are people who do things for the sake of doing things, obviously i'm talking about Mrs Robbinson. A cynical alcoholic probably having a mid-life crisis so for the sake of it she tries to seduce Ben. Who knows very well that she will have full control over what he does because of his seemingly timid social awkwardness to easily take advantage of. In the most uncomfortable scene in the film with the lines uttered so brilliantly by the apprehensive and perturbed cries of Dustin Hoffman and the wickedly derisive chants said by Anne Bancroft. The whole connection between Ben and Mrs Robbinson feels really inhumane. Given the fact that Ben calls her by her last name makes the power dynamic heavily one sided, and like I said before she knew what she was getting into with Ben but even when he felt uncomfortable she reassured him that no one would find out. Those scenes of them talking in the dark symbolizes their lack of communication, when you (probably) can't see each other you have a hard time to try to figure out what the other one wants.
Maybe the relationship Ben has with Mrs Robbinson represents his desire to grow up because when he first encounters her he doesn't exactly know what to do like a naive child but soon he gives into her devious ways and seems more sure of himself but the innocent relationship between him and her daughter Elaine brings back the unaware of what's to come side of him. Most of their relationship is about ""Living in the moment"" and as we build up to the climax. Once Ben finds the church Elaine is getting married at they make the impulsive and childish decision to run away together kind of like how children do in those fantasy novels only this is heavily grounded in the real world once they get on the bus they second guess their decision (was it all worth it in the end) or is the world going to eat the two of them alive if they don't have a proper plan. This in my opinion is one of the best endings some may say that i NeEd MoRe ClOsUrE but life is one for curve balls and sometimes ambiguity and I think this ending stays true to what it wants to be close to life because life sometimes gives you questions you didn't even know you'd be asking.
As for the sound track it perfectly reflects what Ben is feeling in a somber yet meditative tone. The tunes that play out subtly hint at whats in store for everyone, Mrs Robbinson being the most obvious. The cinematography takes the hazy summer days and puts you in a trance. I think it's hard to talk about films like this a story that seems so simple but has layers upon layers of meaning and thoughts that bounce around your head for days, and i'm not gonna be one of those basic bitches who says this movie is sUcH a ClAsSic because everyone already knows that so no need to say that again. But the brilliant social commentary was sure as hell what made it what it is today, and if there are more movies being made like this I will no longer worry about my future.",4.0
"52 Years in 52 Weeks: 20/52
Well if someone had kindly told me the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of Simon & Garfunkel, I would have made time for this long ago! Obviously I knew to expect ""Mrs. Robinson,"" but the other inclusions also work so well.
I was transfixed by The Graduate. The camera work and editing all throughout is iconic. The claustrophobic closeups of Ben as he navigates his graduation party in a state of detachment are so effective. His movement and position in space is used time and again to convey a feeling of isolation, whether he's drifting aimlessly in an empty pool or sitting at the crowded Berkeley campus. His body language and way of speaking is awkward, even robotic. No, Ben is not a happy guy.
Though melancholy, this film is also very funny, deftly moving between the awkward moments and the outright hilarious. When he blindly goes in for that kiss while Mrs. Robinson is puffing away on her cigarette, oh that was gold.
Despite the relative simplicity of its plot, some aspects of The Graduate perplex me. There's some strange complexities to these characters, particularly in the way these women respond to Ben and their different motives in doing so. I find them all unlikable, yet sympathetic, in some way or another.
And boy, what an ending.",4.5

"This is Benjamin. He‚Äôs a little worried about his future. 
The Graduate had me right from the tagline. There have been a lot of great Benjamin characters over the years, but this one might be my favorite. Full of uncertainty and weighed down by expectations. Every aspect is so relatable that it leads to a timeless film that will never feel dated. The initial seduction and following hotel scene were hilariously cringe-inducing.  Dustin Hoffman has that uncomfortable shyness down pat that just makes his character so charming. Besides the fantastic acting, the direction and editing stood out. Lots of framing that suits the melancholy and precariousness. To make everything even better we get all those amazing Simon and Garfunkel tracks...even if they play one too many times. Normally I prefer a more somber ending, I‚Äôm glad this ended on a joyful note. Wherever you are, Benjamin, I hope you‚Äôre happy.",4.5
"The Graduate is film that many people can relate to, even if they arent going through some problems our lead character was cause story had that real feeling around it and like we could pass on street people we saw in this movie .
Speaking of characters ,I must say how they were done in remarkable way and it was easy to understand theirs problems and flaws .
Music choices were great to listen and even though they may seem random ,I still enjoyed them cause they had that 60s feeling in them .
The Graduate is one classic that deserves to be that or even more .

‚ÄúOh no Mrs. Robinson, I find you very desirable. I think you are the most desirable of all my parents' friends.‚Äù
Even though The Sound of Silence is iconic to this film, I can‚Äôt hear it without thinking of this. 
An enjoyable 1960s romantic drama with plenty of comedic edges. I do think it succeeds in the filmmaking front more than the plot. The editing and transitions are brilliant, with an amazing soundtrack that really adds to the entire feel of the film. It feels like something new and different for this era of filmmaking, trying new techniques and making them work for the film. 
The second half of the film lost its way for me a little bit, becoming a bit too predictable and slapdash compared to the first half which feels like it takes a much deeper look into the lives of its characters. The first half deals much more with Benjamin‚Äôs worries and angst about life, in a total arrested development of where his life should be leading, his chance encounter with the formidable Mrs Robinson helping to find himself. It‚Äôs the latter half with Elaine that didn‚Äôt work for me as well, it becomes more of a standard rom com trope, and the relationship never quite felt built up enough to earn the finale. 
Dustin Hoffman is great as our lead, likeable and charming, someone confused by his meaning in life and stuck at a crossroads. His interactions with Mrs Robison are all brilliant, with some excellent comedic moments but also smaller moments of reflection for both characters. Anne Bancroft as Mrs Robinson is fantastic too, she sells the older sexualised woman role so well, adding plenty of depth to her character to keep her feeling developed. The moment of her own reflection in bed is perfectly pitched and performed. 
It‚Äôs an enjoyable watch, and the first half certainly earned it iconic status for me. I just wish it had kept that momentum and drive for the entire run time.",3.5
"This movie is ridiculous, and it genuinely makes me angry that people actually think it's good. I get that at the time it was subversive to show an affair between a young man and an older woman, but that doesn't excuse this monstrosity of moronic film.
First of all, no 20-year-old male is that naive. It's kind of insulting. You think a guy who graduated from an ivy league college can't figure out that a lady is throwing her bosoms in his hands? He's a little nerdy--he's not an idiot.
Secondly, how is this ending supposed to be ""romantic""? Dude literally has sex with the girl's mom and then shows up at her wedding banging on the windows. Anything short of calling the police at that point would be unforgivable.
Thirdly, couldn't they have gotten anyone else besides Dustin Hoffman to play this role? We're going to make neurotic character actor a sex symbol now? What's next, Abe Vigoda as Don Juan?
In conclusion, this movie sucks. Anyone who doesn't agree isn't thinking rationally and needs to be under house arrest.",0.5

"The Graduate is a brilliant tragicomedy about the eternal moral decadence of the bourgeois class, dissatisfied in its materialistic zeal, unhappy in its wealth, seeking in alcohol and sex some ephemeral satisfaction that usually leads to greater disappointments in the long run. It‚Äôs a film that is designed from the first minute to the last. Apart from being a film that can perfectly serve as an example to follow when learning to make a script, all the scenes, situations, and so on are designed in the smallest detail: nothing comes out just for the sake of it, everything has a coherent explanation and everything helps us guide us with what happens or is going to happen.
The film is an unforgettable character because it invites us to relive that time of uncertainties and doubts, in which many things are lived with the illusion of novelty, but in which feeling the pride of family and friends ends up having a weight similar to that of fame, which perfectly understands the act of rebellion, the explosion into the forbidden, the morbidity and the escape valve necessary to release the stored hormones.",4.0

Anyhoo, so Mrs Robinson is clearly a complete lush and the young Dustin Hoffman didn't stand a chance. Like a female spider on the nest she just called him in. I think I also spotted some single frame flashes of her, erm, womanliness during that last drink and assuming I wasn't dreaming this would have certainly sealed the deal for the socially inept Dusty. Anne Bancroft was certainly a beautiful thing back in the day and wonderfully cast in the role.
The Graduate is a really easy to watch rom-com, with added twists and turns along the way to keep it interesting. The performances are solid from all involved and the soundtrack, courtesy of Simon & Garfunkel is just lovely.

"This is one of those movies that you can go on through a lifetime listening about HOW GOOD this is while you keep delaying to watch for a long time for some inner feeling of laziness or thinking that this has to be some sort of mind-blowing cinematic achievement to do justice for those long time expectations set by every single fan that puts The Graduate on a pedestal. But after you've FINALLY watched, it might not be none of the stuff said before, in fact, something else far different and better.
At the same extent that it openly assumes itself as this straight up laugh out loud ""romantic"" comedy about teen's misfortunes in the blind (and lunatic) fight for love. As it is also shows to be this minimalistic with a Nouvelle Vague-ish editing, almost surreal and European-like-experimentalistic like if it was a Alan Resnais film, and shot like a Neo-Noir flick (if Mrs. Robinson it ain't a Femme Fatale type character, I don't know anything about cinema), that deeply dives into a complex analysis of the decreptling state of human's mind facing the suffocating reality that surrounds it. Provided by some phenomenal storytelling and the visual guidance from the forever snubbed Mike Nichols, that has an amazing power of using music as a emotional key ignition, I mean, using Simon & Garfunkel's The Sound Of Silence three times over the film and ALL OF THEM WORKS? Is a work of genius damm it!
Also marking this perfect tragic portrait of an era that nethless to say, still strongly reflects itself till today. Where society's constant need to build a life's system order of phases and stages of studies and works, only eyeing for creating 'image' and sucess, destroys all the real meanings of what is to feel alive and living. Love itself equally in crisis Just as all of them, treated here at first as a mining of survival while Ben escapes his prison of upper middle class life style when the affair with Mrs. Robinson starts, even though he is confusing love with lust (and neediness). But when the passion and affection for Elaine starts to blossom, the cold and controlling treatment of their parents, still bound to the ego and arrogance of their time, forces them to escape the claws of oppression and strongly hold on to the only sign of love that they have and allow them to escape from that life imprisoned by stagnation and pressure. But, as the hauntingly brilliant ending showcases, it was a human mistake to trust something so new and abruptly, that may not suffice to end the forever internal loneliness and loss of perspective that guide us in life.
That‚Äôs just might be scratching the overall impact and importance that The Graduate actually had on its time and forever in cinema, one of which includes teaching some valuable and genuine life lessons that people still seems not to fully grasp, but enough to validate Nichol's masterpiece as one required viewing once in a lifetime AT LEAST!",5.0
"I heard this one was a classic but this was closer to legendary status if anything. 
Completely down-to-earth and relatable with its depiction of the post-college phase of life and the uncertainty that comes with it. But also absurd and hilarious in ways that can‚Äôt be predicted with some of the best examples of dry humor I‚Äôve seen. The satirization of rom-coms here hasn‚Äôt aged a day and the feeling of drifting off in your existential dread and fears of unfulfillment are fascinating simply because it‚Äôs something we go through at some point in our life. 
Dustin Hoffman disappears into his character and the precision in direction, editing, music choices, and use of repetition is astounding. This is the kind of film that can be enjoyed on its own merits but also begs to be analyzed by film fans for decades.

"The August Project - Yes, I Know I Should Have Seen These By Now
No I've not been to Scarborough fucking Fair, but why not ask me one more time in case I forgot.
The Graduate is one of a few films in this project that I should have watched by now but almost feel as though I don't need to. Because it's The Graduate, you know, and if you don't know what happens in it then you've done some pretty amazing spoiler guarding all these years. And avoided that song. Both versions. And the music video.
It portrays that brand of suburban boredom that the 1960s were really good at worming out. The middle / upper classes pushing their relationships around like chess pieces, except the ending is almost always a stalemate, and even on the odd occasion when you think you've won, it turns out you haven't.
Mike Nichols doesn't give us a single goddamn reason for us to feel sorry for anybody here either, just to make the thing work way better than it would have done in most other hands. Dustin Hoffman is a privileged, dithering idiot whose 'love' for Katharine Ross is nothing more than a way to create some excitement and drama amongst his family and their friends and neighbours and his own life. Ross embarks on a revenge marriage, of all the dumb ideas, and Anne Bancroft wants control of her daughter's life simply because she has no control of her own.
Nichols is making incisions from the moment we clap eyes on Hoffman's miserable face and is doing so right to that iconic final shot, which isn't so much 'What the hell have we just done?' more 'What the hell do we do now?' Just push the chess pieces around some more until you get that rare checkmate, I guess.

"it‚Äôs crazy to think that when i first watched the film, i was maybe 17 or 18 and about to graduate high school. now i‚Äôm the same age as benjamin! watching it in high school, i didn‚Äôt really relate to ben because i knew where i was going to college and i was pretty excited. flash forward a few years later, i‚Äôm one year away from graduating and it‚Äôs already weighing heavily on me. i feel like i have an idea of what do next, but it‚Äôs so terrifying to even think about it, i decide that it‚Äôs best to get it out of my mind. and that works‚Ä¶for the most part. with ben, he constantly thinks about what the next step is and seeks a distraction in mrs. robinson. the future is a stormy cloud that follows you and it feels like at any second, it‚Äôs going to drench you. and instead of waiting for it to come to you, you do everything in your power to push it away.
what i noticed during this rewatch is how we are placed in ben‚Äôs point of view mostly around the time before the affair begins. that‚Äôs when his crisis of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù looms over him the greatest and the audience are forced to feel that dread. the scene with the scuba suit was great because it felt we were all trapped and suffocating and the only way to emerge out of that is to have a set plan. we were constantly looking at the parents, hoping they would provide us with an answer, but in the end we have to escape them by jumping into the pool.",5.0
"If I were kidnapped in a van, I would be dumped by the kidnappers 30 mins later on the street because I wouldn't stop talking about how Mrs Robinson is such a misunderstood character deserving of sympathy as a victim of extreme patriarchal biases towards older women. Or maybe the kidnappers would just pull duct tape all over my mouth to shut me up!
Oh don't get me wrong, Ben's anxieties are very real and relatable to people like me who just finished college yet overwhelmed with how to traverse life in a meaningful way; just a vague feeling of wanting to make a difference in an ever uncertain world. But my heart has always gone out to Mrs Robinson. She is who I wanted Lester from American Beauty to be. Ben is the perfect embodiment of overprivileged youth - not necessarily entitled but fortunate enough to not know what to make of his life yet. It's no wonder Mrs Robinson in her midlife crisis and loveless marriage chooses to metaphorically drink from that fountain of youth as an escape. The world is not that kind to older women past their supposed prime.
Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson! I'll love you more than you'll ever know!
It's a testament to the classic status of this movie that it still feels oddly relevant. The filmmaking is so next level for '60s standards. The conversation around generational gaps is just timeless. But give it a rewatch if you haven't in a while. Watch it from Mrs Robinson's perspective. No matter how much the material tries to make an Oedipal caricature of her, there's a nuance to Anne Bancroft's more quieter moments that reveal inner destitute.
In our current pandemic, we are all sitting in that bus as ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence"" plays out loud. Like Ben and Elaine, we have no idea what this future we face might hold for us moving forward.
P.S Notice how there are no young people at the wedding. The Graduate is more subtle about its generational divide than something like Rebel Without a Cause. Even the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack is a throwback to '50s music like the Everly Brothers. The Graduate is removed from its era, is about its era, and is forward thinking beyond its era.",4.5
"Mr. Braddock: Would you mind telling me then what those four years of college were for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Benjamin: You got me.
Took me long enough to see Dustin Hoffmans master work. And not once does this film come across as some sort of perverted mess, which I always thought it might (under these circumstances) . Even tho eventually Benjamin develops a little bit of a stalker-ish vibe, we‚Äôll just ignore that. But the whole idea doesn‚Äôt berate the situation or beat the dead horse. Simply Lost individuals merely searching for meaning in their ordinary lives is what Nichols captures and achieves so well. The aged 60‚Äôs cinematography is such a treat. It has a style that almost feels suave , debonair , but even precarious through its conundrums. 
I love the post college moody and apathetic  temperaments that the film addresses as well. Fits kind of well with my current life and career situation (lol) but it‚Äôs funny to see that these things never change. These topics don‚Äôt ever come out as insensitive , they‚Äôre seemingly fun and super intriguing. But it goes back and forth between the idea of being lost and confused but also searching for love? I found the composition from Simon & Garfunkel to be nice and relaxing at first , but then it got old when I started singing It the rest of the movie.  And even the mothers reaction to Ben getting ‚Äòmarried‚Äô when she screams was a bit absurd but funny as hell. Another point, the car driving scenes and shots from behind Bens head are great as he weaves in and out of traffic and flies towards his destinations. Such cool shots. 
The last 30 minutes of the film take another odd spin and honestly become an unexpected mess (not in a bad film way, just messy for Ben and the whole love triangle or whatever you want to call it). Eventually the bitter sweet ending is what makes this movie what it‚Äôs Known for. Incredible shots for such a simple category of film, witty lines, exquisite humor, and an overall fun bizarre love story. 
But hell, thank god I‚Äôll be a college graduate myself soon, so cheers everyone.",4.5
Hello darkness my old friend,4.5
"For me, The Graduate is best viewed as a generational peep show.
The scuba section, being forced to parade in front of your parents friends and pushed back down into the pool to put their desired time in. The post-grad malaise and existential dread that's compounded by parental pressure has been universal since the baby boom. The cross generational moment is echoed in the closing seconds of their post-rebellion; a destructive, freeing moment that doesn't quiet the dread of the future and what comes next, where their path is taking them.
Dustin Hoffman being 30 softens some of this for me. It does feel like cosplay. And the ""plastics"" line hits different decades later, however, as the generational revolution of the 60s was cosplay, too, as most youthful rebellions end up falling in line (mine, too).
Roger Ebert's journey with the film, extremely potent in his youth but then faded decades later and, for him, becoming less funny and more sad, is something we all go through in revisiting films we identify with when you're younger but no longer reflect back. Growing up increases the frequency of our nuance antenna. With distance, Ben looks less rebellious and more selfish and creepy. Generationally, the film that I have Ebert's journey with is Fight Club, which still has many filmmaking merits and even ends the same way as The Graduate except with an attempt at global rebellion instead of just against parents. (Fight Club was downgraded in importance to me pretty early on I think due to the scope of it, The Graduate still works well because it's an individual story.) Like that film, what remains decades later for me in The Graduate isn't the revolutionary spirit, it is the fantastic filmmaking; the blocking and focus pulling is astounding. The focus on the zooms, the distance between people, the use of Simon & Garfunkel. It's a well-made film that sits atop the shoulder of decades of being the voice of a generation.",4.0
"Another classic off the watchlist done! I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect but it wasn‚Äôt this bittersweet and kinda depressing story. Thematically very relatable despite what stage of life your in and just an amazing  film all around. It did bother me that when Ben was driving to Berkeley, he was heading westbound on the Bay Bridge towards San Francisco, but whatever, I‚Äôll let it slide.",4.5
"The Graduate feels like the sort of thing I'll have nightmares about in college. Waking up at 5 AM, after a night of hard partying, hungover as hell. You have fine grades. You're taking the classes you like. You have friends, you have freedom. This is eternal. And then you suddenly have this nightmare that it isn't eternal, and that it'll end in a couple years. And then what? And then you panic.
But it's only for a second. You go back to sleep, you wake up and you forget your worries. We're human beings; we plan ahead, but we like to live in the moment. It's why younger people (myself often included) don't exactly care too much about ""wearing sunscreen"" or ""getting x disease"", not just because we're less biologically vulnerable, but because we're in the moment; and by the data, this moment isn't close to the end of our lives.
At least we'd expect that Ben won't die soon. If you think of dying in the biological sense. But we also see the effects of his ""living in the moment"". It's sort of the thing I'm suffering from right now. Going through each day, relaxed but more than relaxed - lethargic. Slipping in and out of the pool, in and out of bed. The time of day doesn't matter, and whenever it does it's only to signal that it's time to eat lunch or dinner. Even so, you're constantly eating out of boredom anyways. It's fun, isn't it?
I'm quite a few years away from being Ben. But as we all know, time flies. And whether you define living by ""existing"" or by ""doing"", it's probably important to make sure you're doing something with your life. Or you can get sucked into Ben's cycle of despair and disappointment.
Seriously, I did not laugh once. And I don't mean that as an insult. I can't fathom that this was ever intended as a laugh out loud comedy, yet it shows up in plenty of ""comedy"" lists. I get that movies can have dark comedy, but Dr. Strangelove's bizarre end-of-the-world humor is hilarious in a different way. This is just depressing. And sort of gross to watch. It's icky people doing icky things, and I sympathize with all of them to some degree, but it's also just like Alice constantly falling down the rabbit hole. And the nightmare isn't that she will hurt herself when she lands; it's that she'll never land in the first place.
And then the final, wistfully blissful scene. The Sound of Silence creeps in, and we sit there and watch as 30 seconds pass on the bus - and the characters' faces change, become frantic, and then depressed, and then confused. What will they do now? Have they thought about how they're going to live? What did Ben even do in college? How will he use it? Did he get a degree to say he got a degree, or because he's legitimately interested in a career in that field? Do many people even like their occupations in the first place? Do people work because they like their job or because they want money, and more money at that? When you die, can you say ""it was worth it"" if you made money to pass along to your children? Will your children use that money in a wise way? Are you giving your own children the opportunity to forge their own path, even if you in a way sacrificed your life for that?
Life is a cycle of madness. Every corner is a new beast. I'm dreading the day when the beast will be a void of nothingness. A slap to reality but a slap that'll make me lazy and bored. Each day the same, each day how you want it, but not how you want it. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" as Andy Dufrane said in The Shawshank Redemption. Some of us would love to get busy dying, but we no longer have the drive to even get out of our beds and tie a noose.",0.0
"This feels so ahead of its time, and that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs such a big deal for the film industry today. This doesn‚Äôt feel like a 60‚Äôs film at all.

The score is SO iconic and now The Sound of Silence will not stop playing in my head for the rest of the week. I loved the way this was shot and the transitions were really cool.

"In the annals of cinema, few films capture the existential ennui of post-collegiate life with the wit, depth, and visual flair of Mike Nichols‚Äô The Graduate. Amid the backdrop of the swinging sixties, this seminal work not only vaulted Dustin Hoffman into stardom but also firmly etched itself into the cultural zeitgeist. The film‚Äôs plot is deceptively simple: Benjamin Braddock, portrayed with a compelling mix of naivety and disillusionment by Hoffman, returns home after college, only to find himself ensnared in an affair with Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner. The narrative, however, is anything but straightforward, weaving a complex tapestry of themes that explore sexual freedom, generational conflict and the suffocating pressure of societal expectations.
Nichols‚Äô direction is masterful, employing innovative cinematography and editing techniques that were groundbreaking at the time. The use of Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs soundtrack underscores the film‚Äôs mood and accentuates the protagonist‚Äôs isolation and confusion. For example, the iconic shot of Benjamin framed in Mrs Robinson‚Äôs leg is emblematic of the film‚Äôs visual ingenuity and thematic depth. However, The Graduate is not without its flaws. The film‚Äôs second act suffers from pacing issues, and the character development of Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) feels undercooked, a product of the era‚Äôs gender norms, which the film both critiques and, paradoxically, sometimes succumbs to. Yet, these criticisms are but minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable film. Bancroft‚Äôs portrayal of Mrs Robinson is both seductive and tragic, offering a nuanced look at the disillusionment of the older generation. Hoffman, meanwhile, delivers a career-defining performance that resonates with anyone who has ever felt adrift in the sea of adulthood. The Graduate remains a landmark film that is both a product of its time and timeless in its exploration of human desire, alienation and the search for meaning.",4.0

"This has been on my watchlist forever and watching it for the first time was a magical experience. I have heard so many great things about this film and I‚Äôm glad to say that it exceeded my expectations. Dustin Hoffman is incredible as the worrisome college graduate, Anne Bancroft is the definition of evil, and Katharine Ross is so good at displaying a wide array of conflicting emotions. The direction by Mike Nichols, however, is the glue that holds everything together and when coupled with the insanely good writing, you get a fantastic film. This movie has a lot of great aspects. The visuals are amazing and some of the transitions are breathtaking. My favorite was when Ben was swimming in his pool and as he took a plunge underneath the water it transitioned to a bed with him and Mrs. Robinson on it. The music by Simon and Garfunkel was also magnificent and truly iconic. This just feels like an iconic movie, nearly every single scene feels iconic to me. Ben is worried about his future and it is obvious that he feels like he is being controlled or simply going through life without living it. I could tell that his affair with Mrs. Robinson and his subsequent disinterest in the future was a sign of his rebellion against this control and his desire to rid himself of the worries that had dragged him down. However, it was through this liberation that he began to be controlled by the very thing that he himself thought was supposed to help him feel free and that was Mrs. Robinson. The love Ben grows for Elaine is one filled with drama and watching that final scene play out was extraordinary and shocking to say the least. All in all, this is a great film that is still super duper relatable even after nearly 60 years.",5.0

"My parents played Simon & Garfunkel around the apartment all the time while I was growing up because of this film, so there's something I find deeply comforting about watching it.
Strange, I know, given how disconcerting this film really is, a classic tale of post-graduation anxieties doubling as a eulogy for a certain kind of American innocence, soon to be lost in the tumultuous year of 1968. Nichols' camera often feels off balance, pushing through people and places, constantly zooming in and out of new characters entering the frame. This effect is accentuated by the film's use of montage, collapsing not only time and space but also Ben's subjective state into a pervasive, eerie hollowness. His awkwardness gradually starts to feel more sinister, especially when it gains an obsessive telos, drowning the film in such an overwhelming sense of misguided passion it teeters on the manic. The ending is so bleak to me, transcending a banal uncertainty towards something far more terrifying. Elaine is just collateral damage. There is no real alternative presented for her.

"Really wanted to love this as it was one of my most anticipated movies but I hardly enjoyed it due to the film being rather strange. The plot is so ridiculously stupid that I struggled getting fully invested, despite me liking the opening, and I'm not sure it had anything to say plus I doubt there will be much rewatch value.
The opening fourty minutes or so were actually quite good in my opinion but once the daughter got involved it all went downhill from there. I found it so weird that she considered marrying him, even though he treated her terribly and once had a relationship with her mother. The soundtrack had some good songs but they were overplayed to the point where it became annoying. I also found the second half poorly paced and it seemed to last much longer than the opening half which didn't really help my personal enjoyment at all.
However, there it still had its fair share of positives which is why I'm not giving it too low of a rating. First of all the cinematography was absolutely sensational and really impressive considering it's fifty six years old. The zoom ins, long takes and overall camerawork were used to good effect throughout the entire runtime. All the acting performances were great aswell and the actors had amazing chemistry together, in particular Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. There was also some nice editing and well written sequences.
It's a shame that the film really dropped off in the latter stages because I feel like it had potential to be a new favourite of mine, but the film took a path that just wasn't for me.

"The great grandmother of American coming-of-age cinema. 
Yes, I know of the existence of Rebel Without a Cause, but this one has a great swimming pool scene (plenty of them actually) which is absolutely essential in this genre. And more importantly it‚Äôs about one‚Äôs sexual awakening upon graduation, pretty much definition of a coming-of-age film.
Obviously the relationships in this film are quite creepy and toxic, and our protagonist is way too depressed, anxious and childish to date, let alone marry, anyone. Still, this feels like one of the most timeless, ageless films of the 60‚Äôs, with it‚Äôs brilliant screenplay, stylish visuals and the fantastic original music by Simon and Garfunkel. Mike Nichols directs the shit out of this and the editing is too cool.
It‚Äôs all just so bold and‚Ä¶beautiful, and the wickedness of this so-called love story makes it all the more intriguing. There are plenty of things and moments that just scream iconic; from the seducing to the original music, to the brilliant, quietly ambiguous ending. Pure perfection.",5.0

What a goddamn classic. Funny, heartfelt and sweet but also surprisingly thoughtful and bold for its time. Totally understand its place in history as one of the pioneering films of the New Hollywood era.
And man what a goddamn SOUNDTRACK üòç",4.5
"Went into this expecting nothing more than an outdated and irrelevant time-capsule, only to find myself proven completely wrong from the film's very first frame (a close-up of Hoffmann set against a white background which zooms out to reveal his faceless surroundings, already hinting at the central character's total isolation from the outside world). Nichols use of the camera here is nothing short of inspiring, every zoom resonating with interior meaning, every composition utilising both space and semiotics to further the film's broad and complicated drama - a film which is expressive in its elucidation of isolation (something as simple as Hoffman floating in a pool turned into a hazy montage of cross-fades and refractions) whilst remaining keenly aware of how to use the frame to turn something as small as a glance into something powerful.
From the very beginning of the film there's a crucial disconnect established between parent and child - one generation dictating a future informed by past regrets, another generation confused about whether they find themselves on track to a life in which they truly desire. It's from this uncertainty that the affair with Mrs Robinson is born, a parent perhaps hoping to grasp something that they'd thought lost, and a man who want's to pursue something that's not informed by his own parents materialistic ideas of 'what's best for him'. It's made clear that this isn't a healthy relationship for either individual, Hoffman playing up the insecurities which drive his character to continue the affair (it's telling that he only consummates their mutual attraction when it's suggested that he may be inadequate), and Mrs Robinson painted as someone who's confident exterior seems to house years of pain and wistful regret. Robinson is constantly framed within Hoffman's point-of-view, either a looming figure who seems to follow him within the frame, or a romanticised representation of his lustful desires (see the iconic shot of him framed between her legs) - in small moments when Nichols breaks from this POV we see the complicated individual underneath, but it is continually established that what is shared by these two people is just as much projection as it is affection (this makes the scene where Hoffman attempts to truly 'connect' with Mrs Robinson all the more interesting, as we see a genuine sense of warmth shared between the two, but also begin to grasp how empty this affair is for both parties).
This is what makes Elaine the crucial point of difference for Braddock - their connection isn't one brought about by feelings of inadequacy or rebellion, but of actual understanding (however flimsy it may seem). On their first date they are framed sitting together in Hoffman's car, the outside world moving around them whilst they converse for hours upon end - there is no longer a disconnect established between Hoffman and his lover, both now sharing the frame with equal measure. And yet, even in this small, beautiful moment, there is a certain falseness, a romanticised view of love that Nichols subtly teases out as we see their relationship progress. They may be sharing a special moment of understanding, but it's an understanding once again created and informed by the very forces which they think they're fighting against. This is why the ending remains so utterly effective, Nichols fully immersing us within the youthful rush which both characters feel as they outlandishly fight against those who want to persecute them (the soundtrack combining with the frantic camera-work to make it almost farcical), yet even as the two seem to have won this romantic battle, a creeping unease begins to seep into the frame. The future is no less ambiguous, their relationship may very well come to reflect that of their parents and the connection that they share is one more fleeting than either would care to admit - one cannot fight the terror of uncertainty, no matter how hard each character in this film tries.",0.0

This was so much more fun that I thought it would be. The funny moments hit even harder, but I also laughed my butt off at things that weren‚Äôt even intended to be funny. Dustin Hoffman has already become one of my favorite actors, and watching him so young in this was a treat. This would‚Äôve easily been 4.5 stars for me, but how quickly Elaine forgives and relinquishes her interest in Benjamin was way too unrealistic. Elaines whole interest in Benjamin post her moving away could have been written much stronger. Other than that, The Graduate is a consistently entertaining, hilarious joyride that blew away my expectations. This is the most fun I‚Äôve had watching something in a long time.

"This film is so masterful at balancing a sincere exploration of depression with gut-busting comedy, sometimes in the space of a single sequence. I love how the Scarborough Fair montage makes it abundantly clear how Benjamin is acting from a place of extreme melancholy and sadness, but that doesn't make it any less comical when Ben responds to his mother's question of if Elaine wants to marry him with ""She doesn't. To be perfectly honest she doesn't like me."" For all the film's great bits though, my favourite might simply be when Benjamin gets up at the hotel bar to get he and Mrs. Robinson a room and bumps into the table. For all the big, sweeping gestures and heightened conflicts, beats like this are so profoundly human and relatable. Then again, the cutting between Benjamin and the two monkeys in the cage, followed by the snap zoom to the one lonely gorilla, is also pretty good.",5.0
"ive seen this movie 2 times in my life:
1) at 16, young and naive, freshly entering my first relationship, a bit anxious about the future but focused on the present filled with a happiness i had never felt before. i enjoyed this movie a lot, i thought anne bancroft was so beautiful, and the stark california whites reminded me of the california i was living in, driving down to santa barbara to see my grandparents. i didnt think much of it beyond just a prettily shot and smartly written comedy.
2) tonight at 20, young and naive but less so, that relationship lasting 4 years before vanishing, im older, sadder, more ill and detached, drifting, drifting. i still think anne bancroft is beautiful, and subtle and cunning and sad and amazing, and the stark california whites remind me of the california i used to live in, trips into berkeley and san francisco, warmth, tenderness, desperately trying to escape being lost before finally succumbing. i look in the mirror for hours and i cant recognize myself, i dont know who i am. i worry ill never be able to actualize myself, i worry that ill never have that feeling again i once had at 16 and lost, i worry love is dead and god is dead and that we are all stranded alone and i try to convince myself this isnt true but i can be hard to convince.
from a technical standpoint this film is gorgeous, so aware of color and distance and light and connection of images, and its just so visually playful, the affair montage still blows me away how simple but expressive it is
maybe at 22 or 23 or 24 or 30 or 40 or 50 ill revisit this film and it will serve as a reminder of who i was at this moment, and ill see myself in the past just as naive as i do now. thats what this film does, it makes you reflect on your failures and your anxieties, it tells you that everything will go right while trying not to get your hopes up. absolutely wonderful and soul crushing and amazing film.",5.0
"guys my goal mostly everytime i write a review is to articulate what exactly struck me as profound or just flat out ingenious, and for me The Graduate with young Dustin Hoffman is honestly one of the great american films without a doubt.

Anne Bancroft is absolutely stunning, what can i say that hasn't already been said she's just perfect. The screenplay here is sooo good, so many moments i can specifically remember smiling or busting out laughing especially that scene at the end lollll. So well crafted, lightening in a bottle kind of film here, everything worked for the most part for me. That ending man... im speechless. Also big shoutout to Criterion Channel for allowing me to see this film in beautiful quality you can literally see every drip of water on Ben's face when he runs up to Elaine's room while Ms Robinson chased him, so great.

"What did I ever do to deserve this movie
It is not only one of the best written, directed and acted (most especially by Dustin Hoffman who gives the single most relatable performance of all time) films ever, but it is also quite possibly the best edited, paced and musicalized film ever made. The film is (and I will paraphrase Kubrick here) a progression of moods and feelings that never stops, more than a film it is a like a piece of music exploring the psyche of a character and how he confronts the world outside the bubble of studies, which keeps us all imprisoned but also protected for the first years of our lives.
The final minutes explicitly mark the beginning of a new movement which rebels against all traditions. The protagonists escape the church (representing the conservative order that had imperated since Hollywood's inception) and choose to live life outside it, lost but with a completely new horizon to explore. Cinematically speaking, Benjamin and Elaine represent all the filmmakers from the New Hollywood, and the inconclusive ending represents a new beginning for the artform in the USA.

"‚Äúhello darkness, my old friend‚Äù
i‚Äôll start this by stating the obvious: this movie is a masterpiece and a classic for a reason! 
one of the reasons i watched this movie was because this is where the song ‚Äúmrs. robinson‚Äù came from and my mom is a big simon & garfunkel fan. the soundtrack is spectacular! one of the best i‚Äôve ever seen in a movie. specially the fact that the movie starts and ends with the same song. it shows how the main character is just as lost in the final scene than he was in the initial and still has no idea of what he wants to do in life.
the cast was perfect! dustin hoffman was the best person to play an awkward and lost adult. anne bancroft was stunning! (milf was milfing) she was able to play the powerful woman that takes control over the situation but also play the vulnerable burned out woman that have to give up her dreams to take care of a family. that‚Äôs something i loved about this movie.
there is so much to analyze in this film. all camera shots were mesmerizing. there were also so many metaphors and symbolism. his father described his future in one word ‚Äúplastics‚Äù. and this is what benjamin sees in his future, a fake and artificial life. he also denies himself in the beginning of alcohol and smoking, as a way to detach himself as an adult because he is not ready for that stage of his life yet. something i only noted after hearing the directors‚Äô notes is how mrs robinson is always wearing some kind of animal print, such as leopard or cheetah underwear to portray her as a predator. water is also present in most of the movie, in the form of aquariums and pools. that portrays benjamin‚Äôs constant feelings of drowning and his inability to tread water. he is just a fish in a vast sea. i love analyzing metaphors so i instantly loved this movie!
oh god, i have so much to say about this movie. it is way more than a weird taboo story and it has so many messages about identity, conformity and coming-of-age. it rightfully deserved the oscar for best director.",4.5
"A Rom-Com with a baby-face Dustin Hoffman. I grabbed this one one a friend's suggestion. I'm not typically into Rom-Coms but this one seems to be a classic. It's average ratings don't lie either. It starts kind of slow and awkwardly, but that seems to be the point. The film seems to start as awkwardly as a young graduate virgin would be having an affair with an older married woman. As the film progresses there's a few really funny moments and several WTF moments. Up until the end of the film, to me, was merely above average. I don't think I would be exaggerating if I just said that it has one of the best endings in the comedy genre and earns this film its high marks. Thanks for the suggestion Jordan!

"‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is a highly influential dark comedy, character study, and coming of age movie that many people regard as a cult film.
The strongest aspect of the film are definitely the complex, fleshed out, and fascinating characters, first and foremost protagonist Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman), whose insecurities, fears of the future, and general lack of direction in life are relatable for several generations of university students. Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, a seductive older married woman in her midlife crisis, is the other standout of the movie, and the beautiful Katherine Ross as her daughter Elaine leaves her mark as well. All three actors deliver nuanced, believable, and truly impressive performances, especially Hoffman.
‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is also brilliantly crafted and has a mesmerizing atmosphere. Cinematography and editing are innovative and outstanding, and there are several iconic shots. I especially loved the scuba scene. The wonderful soundtrack further elevates the already great movie. Simon and Garfunkel are among my favorite musicians and their songs have a contemplative, sentimental, and profound quality that perfectly fits the tone, themes, and characters of the film. The film could have featured a wider variety of their songs, though.
Still, I have some minor gripes with the film. Overall, the humor doesn¬¥t really work for me, some of the story beats seem weird (especially concerning the Elaine/Benjamin relationship), and in the second half, the movie loses some of its captivating atmosphere and drags at some parts (though the ending is great again). Nevertheless, it is an engaging and rewarding cinematic experience.
Since ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù was one of the films that paved the way for the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s and was the starting point of Dustin Hoffman¬¥s career, even purely from a film historical perspective, it‚Äôs a must-see. Fortunately, thanks to its timeless look, themes, and performances, the film has aged really well and can still be enjoyed today.",4.0

"This is one of those movies that I like and revile at the same time, and have watched lots of times over the course of my life.
I think the first time I saw it I was 11 or 12.
Things I like - the camerawork is really creative. The underwater stuff with him jumping in the pool is beautifully and masterfully done. All the Simon & Garfunkel songs are the perfect match.
The stuff about the dad working in plastics makes me laugh. My uncle had a friend who worked in plastics, and was always rattling factoids to me at barbecues about the plastics industry.
Things I don't like so much - the movie is kind of harsh making Mrs. Robinson into a villain. Sometimes women just wanna fuck, and these movies written and directed by dudes make that out to be the worst thing ever. I don't think I'd be happy about my daughter dating this guy. That is a genuinely difficult conversation to have and a tough situation.
The way he (Benjamin) won't take no for an answer from the daughter, and stalks her at school, not romantic to me. Life too short to get hung up on any one thing.
I do like the last scene on the bus, where you just read into the facial expressions, whether this can last or not, or they just made a mistake in the moment.

"Benjamin: Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me!
This is another beloved classic that I failed to connect with. The story follows a young man, who is more or less reluctantly seduced into having an affair with an older married friend of his parents. It first starts getting problematic when he falls in love with her daughter.
The story obviously had some family drama, but I found it a bit slow and often a bit dull, since there were few of the real dramatic moments and we mostly just followed some not very compelling characters as they awkwardly had an affair. 
The first part of the story felt especially dragged out and like it forced comedy a little too often, which felt weird. The middle was decent enough and then the last part was a bit stalkerish.
The movie was very well directed and it looked great and made use of some nice techniques, but the story and themes didn‚Äôt catch my interest and it felt dated.
I was not a big fan of the music either, since it didn‚Äôt seem to match the tone of the movie and it got a little repetitive to listen to.

"This film would've been an easy 4.5 if it wasn't for the ending. Damn was that ending great. 
The Graduate is a film that has been on my radar for some time, and today I finally had the chance to see this masterpiece. This film truly is one of the best films ever made, no doubt about it. 
Ben Braddock is an insecure young man. He gets very overwhelmed when he's the center of attention and is very awkward when trying to take the initiative to do something. In a way he reminded me of myself. His life is full of uncertainty. Even though he graduated college, he still doesn't know what he wants to do. He also hesitates on going to graduate school, which his parents try to push him towards. This uncertainty factor is a major part of the character, but a minor part of the story. The main focus is Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson,  a older women who seduces him one night. They develop a relationship, but Ben then develops feelings for Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. This really is the main focus of the film, Ben finding himself torn between these two women. At its core the film is a drama, but it has some comedic elements. The ending is a bit comedic in its own right, but there's a sense of satisfaction as well. The dialogue in this film is also great, especially Ben's dialogue. Ben is an awkward character, and the dialogue reflects that. There are also so many quotable lines. I mean, who can forget ""Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me"". Classic line right there. There are so many aspects of this film that make it a masterpiece, and the story is only one part. 
Dustin Hoffman gives his best performance in this film in my opinion. He plays Ben, an awkward young man who is torn between two women. His performance is oddly charming in some scenes, especially the scene where he tries to rent a hotel room. Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross also give great performances as Mrs Robinson and Elaine, respectively. Bancroft gives an almost hypnotizing performance, which is a good thing. Her line delivery felt hypnotic, almost as if she was trying to entice the character of Ben. All in all, the performances in this film all around were great. 
A lot could be said about the direction of this film, but one element that really stuck out to me was the cinematography. Some of the shots in this film looked so great. One that stuck out to me was when Ben met Mrs. Robinson in the bar, and as she walked up the camera focused on a reflective table, showing her entering the frame. What I said probably makes no sense but when (or if) you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. The cinematography stays consistent, with every scene looking great. 
Who can forget the amazing Simon and Garfunkel songs in this film. Everything from Sound of Silence to Scarborough Fair was a delight to hear on screen. Granted I felt like some of the songs were repeated a bit much, but the rest of the film makes up for that. 
The Graduate is a perfect film, no doubt about it. With a perfect story, characters and music that is a delight to the ears, this isn't one to miss. I'm excited to check out more of Mike Nichols's films in the future.",5.0

"This should not be allowed to be so funny.
The first time I watched this was about a year and a half ago, watching this again a week before I turn 18 with only a few months left until I go to university is pretty surreal.
I loved it then and I love it even more now. It‚Äôs the best film that captures a feeling of aimlessness that everyone experiences at one point or another. Leaving high school soon, I‚Äôm 99.99% sure that the decisions I‚Äôve made regarding my future are the right ones. It‚Äôs the stuff I‚Äôm passionate about, it‚Äôs the stuff I‚Äôve been interested in for years, it‚Äôs the stuff I think I‚Äôm pretty good at. 
But there‚Äôs a part of me at the back of my mind thinking that it‚Äôs not right for me. That by some random chance the path I‚Äôve laid out for myself isn‚Äôt the best course of action. There‚Äôs a fear that the second I reach the ‚Äúadult world‚Äù I‚Äôll just aimlessly drift about trying to find some purpose to latch on to.
The Graduate taps into that universal dread of aimlessness perfectly. For some, it could be a horrifying piece of existential nihilism, but for others, including myself, it‚Äôs oddly comforting. It‚Äôs a reminder that everyone at one point experiences this drifting sensation. I‚Äôm reminded that I‚Äôm not the only one who has no idea what‚Äôs coming. 
Nobody has one purpose, we just latch on to brief splashes of happiness before becoming disillusioned and moving onto the next one. Yeah, maybe that‚Äôs scary, but in a sense that‚Äôs life, and The Graduate invites us to stop trying to avoid that fact and embrace it. 
It‚Äôs not really feel good, it‚Äôs not really feel bad, it‚Äôs The Graduate, a completely unique and incredible cinematic experience that nobody has dared try to replicate.",5.0

No, but seriously, this was absolutely sensational. Truly one of the best coming of age films ever. It‚Äôs brilliant script, along with immaculate camera work and cinematography make this one the most iconic films ever. Plus it has a fantastic score.
Dustin Hoffman is astounding in this. No wonder why it was his breakout performance. Easily, the best performance that I‚Äôve seen from him. The way that he was able to be funny, but also show pain & conflict within himself was incredible.
I‚Äôve never heard of Anne Bancroft, but I‚Äôve heard of Mrs. Robinson so many times growing up. I was so curious to who played this iconic character and I was not disappointed. The pure aura and raw sex appeal that Anne brought to this character was astonishing. She was able to draw the viewer in, just as much as she did Ben.

It‚Äôs blend of dry humor, intense drama, & riveting romance, is what makes this film so compelling. It‚Äôs
a rollercoaster of emotions. It also provides one of the greatest endings ever, to a coming of age film. You can see the impact this film has had on so many films throughout the years.
It also has a wonderful soundtrack, by Simon & Garfunkel, one that will be stuck in my head for quite some time.

"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little worried about my future‚Äù
I‚Äôve tried writing about this movie several times in the past, and every time I was unable to muster up anything more than ‚ÄúI deeply relate to this film, and it means a lot to me‚Äù, but I think now is the perfect time for me to attempt to articulate my thoughts, despite still not being able to fully organize my them.
At the time of writing this, today is the day I graduated high school. It didn‚Äôt really dawn on me just how close I was to being done until maybe a couple of weeks ago when I started to see some of my old friends from elementary school posting pictures of their high school graduation. When I saw that it felt like I was being pushed full speed ahead into the ‚Äúadult world‚Äù, the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. Unlike Benjamin, I do have some sort of idea of what I want to do with my life, but that doesn‚Äôt alleviate any of the pressure and anxiety I feel around the subject of the future. I think that is probably a universal experience, being afraid of all the infinite possibilities that lie ahead of you in your life. What will come? Who will you become? What kind of a life will you live? Mike Nichols‚Äô portrayal of youth does not trivialize the struggle of these questions, but he instead sympathizes with the character and completely immerses the audience into that headspace. We see Benjamin constantly being asked by the adults of the movie about what his plans are for the future, what he is going to do with himself, and why he isn‚Äôt doing anything productive. I‚Äôve seen some people assert that the adults are the ‚Äúvillains‚Äù of the movie, but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. For starters, I think to say that The Graduate has a ‚Äúvillain‚Äù or a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù is just an oversimplification of the film. Secondly, Buck Henry‚Äôs screenplay depicts both generations in almost the same light. The only reason that the older generation is seen as the villains is that we see everything from Ben‚Äôs perspective, the younger perspective. However, all the pieces of advice that the adults have for Ben come from a well-meaning place even if they are not received that way. A lot of the adult‚Äôs life is depicted as empty and insincere, but the advice is sincere even if they aren‚Äôt as close to Ben as they are socially obligated to pretend they are. Societal expectations are something that plays a big part in The Graduate. Things you should do just because that's what people do. ‚ÄúShould‚Äù is a word that I often associate with The Graduate because of this. You should go to graduate school, you should get married if you‚Äôre going to have a baby, you should get married for security, and you should remain married even if you hate your life. This is particularly the case with the most central marriage of the film. It is made very clear to the audience that Mr. and Mrs. Robinson have no real connection. They got married because Mrs. Robinson was pregnant, and live out their life side by side because that‚Äôs what you are supposed to do when you have a child out of wedlock. They tough it out despite no longer having any sort of sexual or romantic relationship with one another because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do. Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs character is equally as interesting as Ben‚Äôs in my opinion because of details about her that I overlooked in my first couple of views. Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs life was completely stopped in its tracks because of Elaine‚Äôs birth and her subsequent marriage to Mr. Robinson. Everything in her life is defined by her husband and her family, the character doesn‚Äôt even have a first name, and is only ever addressed by her married last name. By seducing Ben, she is exercising one of the few liberties that she still has in her vapid and seemingly pointless life. I‚Äôve also seen some people say that in their eyes Mrs. Robinson is the villain of the movie, but again, I couldn‚Äôt disagree more.
I am a person with a lot of anxiety about a lot of different things, but the big one for me tends to be social anxiety. Social anxiety is something that tends to be misrepresented in film. There are a lot of good representations out there, like Punch Drunk Love, Frances Ha or really any Charlie Kaufman screenplay. However, no other film seems to get social anxiety quite like The Graduate gets it. The way that Nichols and Robert Surtees use the camera to isolate Benjamin from those around him was incredible for the time and still holds up. Right from the opening shot of the film, Robert Surtees establishes the feeling that when you are a very nervous person, the things around you tend to feel like noise. The writing for Ben‚Äôs character is brought to life and elevated by the virtually unknown at the time, Dustin Hoffman. Everything about his performance makes it a favourite of mine. His movements are uncertain, almost every uncomfortable moment in the film is accompanied by a little whimper from Hoffman. They‚Äôre small but very frequent throughout the film, especially in the first half. Ben‚Äôs trajectory as a character is what makes me think that Buck Henry‚Äôs screenplay is not taking any sides when it comes to the generational divide. Benjamin might be painfully relatable at times because of his social awkwardness and naivety in certain situations, but as the film goes on Benjamin‚Äôs character flaws begin to show themselves more and more. The older generation in the film never does anything, but the younger generation is too impulsive with their decisions. Benjamin is shown to be very indecisive with his decisions for the majority of the film, however, sometime in the middle of the film Benjamin starts making lots of rash decisions that push people away from him, and isolates himself further. I think that the assertion that Henry‚Äôs screenplay is making is that both generations have their flaws, and simply can not understand one another‚Äôs life choices and perspectives, not that one generation is wrong and the other is right.
I sometimes see people complain that the film recycles the same Simon and Garfunkle tracks over and over, but I think they‚Äôre missing the entire point of Nichols‚Äô decision to repeatedly use the same songs. These songs are not just needle drops for the sake of needle drops. The Sound Of Silence is the song that is repeated the most in the film, and it is used to underscore a point every time it is played. It establishes Benjamin‚Äôs headspace, his thoughts, and his overall mood during certain scenes. The track Mrs. Robinson might be considered The Graduate‚Äôs theme song so to speak, but in reality, that title should go to The Sound Of Silence. Garfunkle said that The Sound Of Silence was about ‚Äúthe inability of people to communicate with each other, not particularly intentionally but especially emotionally, so what you see around you are people unable to love each other"", which ties in very nicely to the themes and ideas presented in The Graduate, and explains a little bit more why Nichols would decide to repeatedly use it. The entire soundtrack is pretty incredible though, especially when it is used in tandem with some of the lovely editing in the film. The montage during Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin‚Äôs first affair is easily one of the best-edited scenes in any film, and the melancholic tunes of Simon and Garfunkle bring it to another level and give the edit even more life. Simon and Garfunkle were the perfect groups to do a soundtrack for this movie, sonically their music is both depressingly melancholic while maintaining a glimmer of hope, which matches the tone of the film quite perfectly.
The Graduate has one of the most iconic and memorable endings of all time. In my eyes, it is the greatest ending of all time. Mike Nichols does not shove a conclusion down the audience‚Äôs throat at the end of the film, he allows the audience to make their own meaning. For me, the ending is Benjamin and Elaine breaking away from their parents' control over their life and their decisions. This is a scary decision for the character and this choice is putting them both back into an uncertain and unknown future. A future where their relationship could easily devolve into something as emotionless and vapid as the marriage of Elaine‚Äôs parents, hence the use of The Sound Of Silence once again.

About three decades ahead of schedule. What this has that many of its kitschy Nineties counterparts don‚Äôt is an awkward and bumbling protagonist that feels genuinely consumed by his own maceration of anxiety and, to some degree, guilt, and not in an exaggerated, played-for-humor kind of way. Jason Biggs was goofy and in many ways hilarious - as was his equally nerdy father (god bless Eugene Levy) - but Hoffman carries a briefcase of uncertainty with him at every juncture, to the point where his situational unawareness constantly calcifies into a social ineptness that borders on Asperger‚Äôs. (That‚Äôs a good thing, mind you, precisely because his character gives no indication otherwise of any sort of inhibitions, meaning the performance registers as legitimate and not overly theatrical like it does in, say, RAINMAN.) Nichols also tosses in an occasional artistic flourish - e.g. shooting Ben‚Äôs ‚ÄùYou‚Äôre trying to seduce me, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù from beneath Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs bent leg, or capturing her first arrival at the hotel through the upside-down reflection of one of the lobby‚Äôs glass tables - without getting stale or lamely denotative. The humor is surprisingly humorous, too‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if the barometer of comedy has dwindled through the years or if people thirty years ago were inherently funnier, but I was cracking up at even the smallest throwaway jokes, like Ben‚Äôs dad twice shoving him back underwater during his cookout diving demonstration, or how Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs attempt at getting the room number - ‚ÄùIsn‚Äôt there something you want to tell me, Benjamin?‚Äù - is instead met with trifling sweet nothings and hesitation forms.
But for as much as I love this movie as a bit of lewd postulating, I despise it for the misshapen motley of rebellion, submission, and sociopathy into which it eventually mutates. The prickly dynamic between Ben and one of his classmate‚Äôs mothers is dandy‚Äîobviously taboo and obviously wrong but also obviously not unfathomable, a crossthread of morality and logic at which most of the succulence is acquired. Ben‚Äôs sudden - and suddenly relentless - obsession with Elaine is a diversion that bothered me the first time I saw this (over a decade ago) and greatly upset me this second time around. One can always posit that it‚Äôs a side-effect of Ben‚Äôs malaise and controlling, ultra-reflexive personality, but that only superficially accounts for his behavior, and gives no real indication as to why he‚Äôd be so interested in her in the first place (after previously having shown no interest at all). Tried to convince myself that it was some sort of surrogate mind trick at work‚Äîi.e., he wants Mrs. Robinson, knows he can‚Äôt realistically have her (beyond, you know, sex), and attempts to rectify that by dating her daughter‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt find that satisfying enough, nor do I think his rash and aggressive conduct reads as a mindless act of mutiny against the elder generation. It‚Äôs too farfetched to think that any boy could be simultaneously this aimless and assertive, so the only real ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù becomes a diagnosis of psychopathy, and this hasn‚Äôt quite the energy to pull off something that grim. Even if any of those half-justifications placated me regarding Ben‚Äôs trajectory, I‚Äôd still be scratching my head at Elaine‚Äôs blank-slated display of what essentially boils down to Stockholm Syndrome. Literally no woman in the world would put up with the shit she puts up with in the small time frame in which she does.
But clumsy narrative and thematic addling aside, the shitbag antics are composed as elegantly as the sublime first-half, shot with the same keenness and coordinated with what has to be one of the era‚Äôs finest and most well-integrated soundtracks. The final shot is magical, too, even if I‚Äôm bothered by nearly everything it took to get us there. Not sure how I‚Äôd rewrite this to jell, though. Part of me thinks that having Elaine actively pursuing Ben while he continues to sneak around with her mother - unbeknownst to both of them, at least for a while - and keeps prolonging the inevitable choice he must make would create something more stable and less frustratingly impulsive. Then again, I look at how iconic this move remains over fifty years later and concede that the writing is probably best left to professionals and not everything will make me happy.",3.0

Strong Performances - Anne Bancroft
Many of us find ourselves trailing along a life that is assembled for us. There is a compulsion to conform towards the idealism of those that raised us, presuming that their guidance would always be best. There is a lingering fear that cripples us in our youths to break against the mould that is shaped for us; a fear of implying disrespect against those who have sacrificed so much for us; a fear of dabbling our feet in completely daring and uncharted waters; a fear of reaching a dead end that only reminds us of our failure and cowardice.
This was the essence that is conveyed across within a matter of minutes with it‚Äôs protagonist, Benjamin Braddock, played here by Dustin Hoffman. An introduction so effective, the audience is able to immediately identify with the vulnerabilities and complication that lies within this individual and opens up the possible outcomes that may exist ahead for him, thus pinning our intrigue and keeping us thoroughly engaged.
Caught by the gaze of Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), she sees Ben as a potential prey, a source of relief from her own issues. She is a woman suffering through alcoholism, driven by her depression from the life that she has led; a woman who has endured so far in that no longer could she turn back and restart. Could it be that she sees a quality in Ben that finds his situation and empathetic and therefore would try to pin him as long as she could, stunting him from growth and happiness; or simply has she found a new form of substance, an addiction that would temporarily escape her from her swallowing sadness and insecurities. Despite the character seeming so unlikable, she is, however, a fascinating creature on screen, seeing and feeling the pain and desperation that sits beneath her sexual aggression; she is a wonderful contrast to the internal angsts that drive beneath Benjamin.
Many laughs are to be had with The Graduate. Mike Nichols succeeds in reflecting the awkwardness and desperation of Ben, a young man who finds new experiences confronting and when finally faced with something genuine, he finds himself self-destructive rather than productive in his attempt to preserve it. Elaine (Katharine Ross) is that shining beacon that enters into his seemingly bleak life, almost as if a living angel, a solace from the suffocating taunts and pressures from his current life, one that manages to show true empathy for the experiences that he currently suffers. It was in the juxtaposition that Nichols demonstrates between Ben‚Äôs experience with Elaine and her mother that succeeds in pushing effectively the thematic intentions behind the narrative.
Given the issues and angsts that Ben is battling, and the outcome of the story, The Graduate could be seen as a counter-culture film, one that rebels against the traditional conformity that has plagued prior to the 1960s. Ben feels the unhappiness from the pathway that was thrusted upon him, now faced at a crossroads where he fears in advancing forward as deep inside him, he knows that pursuing such a path would only bring him a life of regret and resentment; a life that may mirror the tragedy that has befallen Mrs. Robinson. The choice to rebel and be free from the shackles is inspired by the presence of Elaine, which I personally feel the film didn‚Äôt explore enough of, but her impact on Ben is well reflected. Despite the choices that both Ben and Elaine have chosen at the film‚Äôs end, the price of relief comes with a swirling pool of excitement, fear, anxiety, and elation, unknowing of the trials that may lie ahead, but at the very least the canvas is clear and from there they can create a life to their heart‚Äôs desire.",4.5

"Really wish this would have gone heavier on the identity crisis and the immense pressure weighing on a young man who had his whole life ahead of him in which he was unsure where to take it. Because early on, it's clear that's dragging Ben down.
One of the opening shots features him staring straight ahead, a white wall next to him as the automatic airport path carries him through. The camera stays fixed as his expressionless face is not taken out of frame once. He's set on a path not made by his own decisions. And when he conversates with others, their faces invade his. The camera work is simply tremendous, full of deeper meaning.
Instead the film chooses to be about the pitfalls of sex and love. I'm not against a good romance plot, but this wasn't that. I held off on critiquing the characters because I felt something in the middle or end would force their emotions to the surface and put us in their heads, where we understood the decisions they were making. Tragically, that never came to be.
To put things bluntly, I don't buy the romance between him and Elaine. I don't buy the physical attraction of Mrs. Robinson, although Anne Bancroft was a very gorgeous woman. The forgiveness was too easily earned in the end, and the music was starting to drive me crazy. No, I will not be going to Scarborough Fair, now quit asking.",3.5

"My Top 100 Films of All-Time
It‚Äôs time to accept that as relatable Benjamin‚Äôs situation can be, boy is he a creepy weirdo. The first dates with both Mrs and Elaine Robinson are Bickle-level. 
Also, every time Mrs Robinson cuts more and more sympathetic a figure. I mean yeah, she‚Äôs kind of awful as are most of the characters in this, but you see more and more cracks in her every time. Anne Bancroft was incredible and it‚Äôs also quite impressive that she was nominated as Best Actress since she really has a supporting player‚Äôs screen-time.

The Good:
Mike Nicholos does an absolutely stunning job in the directors chair. I love all the odd zooms and sleek movement. He also does a great job of capturing the mood of the scene; for example he really makes you feel the claustrophobia of the party scenes and the intimidation of Mrs. Robinson. The Technicolor cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, the colors are so vibrant. 
Anne Bancroft is a complete show stopper! She is completely manipulative and devilishly sly in an intimidating mature way. Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs transformation throughout 
the duration of the film was magnificent. 
The Graduate is hilarious look at loneliness, sexual repression, and lack of direction in life after college. Thematically The Graduate is a much deeper film than I was expecting and that made it just that much better.
I loved the tone of the film overall. It‚Äôs got a very awkward sense of humor with some serious undertones, however they never clashed; it was always very intentionally separated. 
The Bad:
I just have some sound design issues that annoyed me alongside some questionable one scene performances.
Fun Fact:
None of the older characters is called by a first name in the film; only the younger characters of Benjamin, Elaine and Carl do, increasing the sense of a generation gap.

Benjamin Braddock hat den College-Abschluss mit Bravour gemeistert. Jetzt kehrt er vor√ºbergehend zu seinen Eltern zur√ºck und trifft auf Mrs. Robinson, die attraktive Ehefrau eines Gesch√§ftspartners von Benjamins Vater. Mrs. Robinson verf√ºhrt den unsicheren und orientierungslosen jungen Mann und geht mit ihm eine heimliche, rein sexuelle Beziehung ein. Doch als Benjamin die Tochter von Mrs. Robinson n√§her kennenlernt, √§ndern sich die Verh√§ltnisse.
Mit starken Darstellerinnen und Darstellern ‚Äì allen voran Dustin Hoffman als Benjamin ‚Äì hat Regisseur Mike Nichols (WHO‚ÄôS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; CATCH 22; SILKWOOD) nach Charles Webbs Roman eine bissige Gesellschaftssatire inszeniert, die dezidiert filmisch √ºber vorz√ºglich komponierte Bilder erz√§hlt und deren Soundtrack (Songs von Simon & Garfunkel) das Geschehen perfekt unterstreicht. Im letzten Akt schl√§gt die Geschichte allerdings absurde Kapriolen ‚Äì und nimmt sich damit viel von ihrer Kraft. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich bleibt ein sehenswerter Film mit deutlichen Schw√§chen im Abgang. Der allgemeinen Begeisterung kann ich mich nicht anschlie√üen.
PS: THE GRADUATE wurde vielfach zitiert, u. a. in der Er√∂ffnungssequenz von Quentin Tarantinos JACKIE BROWN.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin Braddock has graduated from college with flying colors. Now he temporarily returns to his parents and meets Mrs. Robinson, the attractive wife of one of Benjamin's father‚Äôs business partners. Mrs. Robinson seduces the insecure and disoriented young man and enters into a secret, purely sexual relationship with him. But when Benjamin gets to know Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter, things change.
With strong actors and actresses ‚Äì above all Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin ‚Äì director Mike Nichols (WHO‚ÄôS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; CATCH 22; SILKWOOD) has staged a biting social satire based on Charles Webb‚Äôs novel, which tells a decidedly cinematic story with excellently composed images and a soundtrack (songs by Simon & Garfunkel) that perfectly underscores the action. In the final act, however, the story takes a turn for the absurd ‚Äì and thus loses much of its power. For me personally, it remains a movie worth seeing with clear weaknesses at the end. I cannot join in the general enthusiasm.
PS: THE GRADUATE has been quoted many times, including in the opening sequence of Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs JACKIE BROWN.

"I think in some way, regardless of age, gender, school grade, or social status, we all have a little Benjamin Braddock inside of us. Outwardly, one may appear jovial and excited to advance onto life, but there's also the inner confusion, emptiness, and fear to be found in Dustin Hoffman's eyes and body language. I'm no college graduate, I'm a high school freshman. And yet, I still feel lost. To be confused on what to do, what I'm learning, what's gonna happen next, and how hard it's gonna be for my concerning future. Sure, one may have advantages through planning beforehand, having very supportive friends and family, and the such, but not many people are lucky enough to have that privilege. If there's anything that feels like a thesis to The Graduate, it's probably the word 'Now what?', as it's shown heavily. Yet this film understands youth, in a way, earlier than any other film before it. And shockingly well.
For its time, it's one of the most visually creative films I've ever seen. Symbolism is captured so effortlessly and efficiently. Water as a way to describe where the fuck we are in the world. Benjamin is shown suffocating in that scuba suit in the early beginning, yet when the second act kicks in, he's all chill and nonchalant. In a way, we're all like that at some point. I slack off a lot, not caring about my future, much to the dissatisfaction of my parents, but I suppose it's just denial of my worry. And in a way, sometimes I just fall off that raft, my fat ugly ass. Yet when there's water, one can swim. I'm still in the water, but at least I'm not drowning. And in a lot of ways, the movie's style, alongside the film's just absolute brilliant writing and developed story, just captures Ben's mental state in so many ways. Mrs. Robinson is basically a wild animal. Her jungle-y lounge, her leopard print outfits, all animalistic, and Ben is her prey. The zoom-ins, the lighting, and that iconic leg frame showing his trapped nature, it's all really brilliant to me. Moments like that scare me, not just physically or mentally, but emotionally. Our confusion wraps us up in manipulation, like tapestries encasing a surprise gift. I feel trapped in life sometimes, and I don't want to grow up. One can have goals, and I guess to certain extents, go too far. Perhaps we indulge too deep in our fantasies but growing up is tough to a lot of folks, and much like Ben, we too feel anxious and prepared, simultaneously. A shadow on one end, gleam on the other, it's all just perfect to me. The music also beautifully fits the movie a lot. Needle drops like Mrs. Robinson and The Sounds of Silence play so naturally and perfectly capture what is going on with each character. It's a little depressing to listen to them a thousand times in context, but we all feel a little fitting in those shoes. Those times of regret and sadness come back at times whenever we feel like we matter, only for that inevitable doom and post-clarity to surround you for some reason. It just perfectly captures that sense of emptiness we have in life; hence its resonance still stays.
I tried watching this film 2 separate times. This is the 3rd time. I planned on watching this by the time I graduated. Yet I caved in and watched it. I was expecting to love it and I did. But I still have no idea what the hell I'm doing. And for a while I probably won't. I'll be there, eventually, but right now, I guess the best way I can truly cope with it is the art of cinema. The Graduate is probably the sincerest example of this, and it endears as a classic. It's perfect as a movie and as a touchstone for me. I may not enjoy it in the future, or who knows, maybe I'm seeing it too seriously right now. Really, everything is confusing to think about. It's hard to understand what I'm going through, but hey, how should I know. I'm just a freshman. I've got time, right? But when the time to start thinking again comes to a close....now what?",5.0

"After discovering from this lovely list by LinusMxx that The Player, a film I planned on seeing soon enough, spoiled 1967's The Graduate, I decided to watch the latter film in order to not be spoiled and it was also a great time for it since I had Bleart and Sam hyping me up. Safe to say that this did not disappoint.
This was one of the first originators of the idea known as the ""love triangle"". Today, it's a trope that's overused and overly-played out yet to see it being unravelled in The Graduate was truly a sight to see. Furthermore, this film also covered the important topic of college and more so how we feel lost afterwards. I know what I want to do with the rest of my life but there are still many times where I've felt lost in this cruel world. It's just second-nature to us. And with that comes a certain relatability that the The Graduate greatly holds in the palms of its hands. Nichols and the three writers worked out an insane yet fairly believable plot and created something so incredible and emotionally resonant. I hope this doesn't come off as me bragging but I have felt the same way Hoffman feels in this film as he's constantly praised by family members and friends. It can get a little exhausting at times yet it's still something to be joyful about, and that relatability that this film clings onto is so greatly and effectively used here.
Speaking of Hoffman, damn he was amazing in this film! His performance felt so natural and similarly to the themes portrayed, his portrayal of Ben also felt relatable. With each passing film I see Hoffman in, my love for him grows further and further. Plus, the rest of the cast also did marvellous jobs at portraying their characters well.
Another thing is that I saw a handful of reviews stating the three Simon & Garfunkel songs were profusely overused and I can see that but it never got old for me. The songs were just so hard-hitting and they were used perfectly within this film. Just a small detail that I wanted to mention.
I was originally going to give The Graduate a 5/5 yet that climax kind of made things fall apart for me. I don't wish to enter spoiler-territory (I'll probably do so on a rewatch) but I'll just say that things got a little too crazy and unbelievable for me. Other than that, this is amazing!! Really need to see more from both Hoffman and Nichols.",4.5
"Honestly, I expected something more....the film is certainly flawless in showing the traits of a society that now disintegrates the dreams of young people and traps them in a situation of absolute control and planning of an often unwanted way of life. Some sequences, such as the final or initial one, are emblematic, in which one can hear, even if only through glances or the magnificent and unforgettable soundtrack, moods, thoughts and the imprisonment of a society from which one would only want to get away.
Leaving that aside, it is a very smooth, well-acted and technically perfect film but it has disappointed my expectations, not reaching me as deeply as I had hoped.
In the future I will definitely have to do a rewatch, to reconfirm my ideas or re-evaluate my opinions about it.",4.0

A Cinematic Watershed
1967: arguably one of the greatest year for movie-goers across the globe enjoying classics such as Cool Hand Luke, Bonnie & Clyde and the Jungle Book. But audiences flocking to see Mike Nichol's 'The Graduate' in such huge numbers that it remains the highest grossing film of '67. But why did this modest drama starring unknown an new- comer - Dustin Hoffman - captivate society? 
The Graduate epitomises the sexual revolution in the most elegant yet audacious manner. The film oozes symbolism from the fantastic screenplay to the striking direction. Not only do all three leads - Hoffman, Bancroft and Ross - deliver tremendous performances, but they embody this new generation of post-war America: seeking sexual liberation to fill a void left by the disintegration of familial bonds in the wake of a resort to materialism.
Needless to say, this movie evokes a broad array of reactions within the viewer - only emboldened by the incredibly iconic and poignantly ambiguous finale. You'll by no doubt have heard the soundtrack, which is brilliant in it's own right whilst cementing 'The Graduate' as (in my humble opinion) a perfect film.",5.0

This is one near and dear to my heart. Some will say it has aged poorly. I say it's timeless. Maybe I've been seduced.",5.0

It‚Äôs pretty unfortunate that the abstractness if the subtextual elements subtracts from the autonomy of certain characters that would otherwise be a lot more important, but I understand where that‚Äôs coming from. I think this is a film where I could either see my opinion staying completely the same if I return to it or my appreciation growing a lot more because of a change in my personal perspective. It‚Äôs hard to tell which of those would happen, but I don‚Äôt consider those options bad at all.",4.0

""Our greatest fears lie in anticipation""
- Balzac
The Graduate couldn't have arrived at a better time in my life. This year I will be graduating from university, and, like many others before me, I am starting to become more and more afraid at what the future holds. The expectations of people all around me, from friends to family, are overwhelming, and I am perfectly aware that all this will disappear once I actually start a master's degree or a job. But, until then, I am afraid, and I get lost in the anticipation.
This can be felt in many other aspects of life: asking out the girl you like, taking a vacation all on your own, going to a school where you know no one, emigrating to another country... You can easily get lost inside the fears you create in your mind, and you completely lose tracks of what makes life beautiful and worth living.
The Graduate is very much a film that encapsulates this feeling. Our main character, Ben, has no real goal in life, and the only thing that keeps him going is a purely-sexual relationship with the infamous Mrs. Robinson. But, once he meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter and sees how much they have in common, he feels like he has found a new purpose in life: to get the girl.
On a purely superficial level, this should be one of the most romantic movies ever made, where a young lad follows his heart and goes against all odds to reach the love of his life. However, this film is so much more than that. There is almost a cyclical nature to this story: we open up with Ben having graduated from college and going back home, with no real purpose in life, and The Sound of Silence playing in the background, and the film ends with Ben finally escaping with Elaine, yet having once again no goal in life (and Sound of Silence closes the film).
It's a rather dark ending to a film that is one of the best dramatic comedies of all time, with the first half especially having really clever moments in both its visuals and the dialogue. And it's said dialogue that makes this such a great film: every character is fully realized, everyone feels real and you have enough information about them without needing much exposition. For as much fun as the first half is, there is an underlying sadness in the film from beginning to end, and it can be felt in every character other than Ben.
Mrs. Robinson is a fascinating woman, one who has made mistakes in life that many others have done and (most likely) will do, and her seducing Ben feels (in a sick way) like she is trying to protect her daughter, shielding her from the same life she has led. But, as we all know, that is not the case, and the daughter falls in love with Ben. But is it really love? First she is mistreated and brought to a strip club, then she is revered and treated like a princess. She, like Ben and other characters in the film, is quite shallow, naive, and confused, more focused in the pleasures of the now rather than the careful planning of the future.
Everyone is the victim of their parents here, with Ben feeling the pressure of doing something with his life, and Elaine (probably) feeling the need to find someone to start a family with. That is not what both want, and they try everything they can to avoid the future their parents have planned for them... yet, by doing the complete opposite, they end up fulfilling a self-fulfilling prophecy, with Elaine and Ben likely becoming the new Mr. & Mrs. Robinson in another town.
Not only is this a perfect story, but the way it is presented is nothing short of wonderful. The camerawork by Surtees has some terrific shots, from POVs to wide shots that show the isolation Ben is feeling, as well as one of the best uses of shifting focus in the history of cinema (when Elaine slowly understands what has happened between Ben and her mother). The soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel is a true beauty, each song used multiple times based on the feelings that Ben has throughout the story. The sound design especially has a lot of attention to detail, and the editing is used to great effect to keep the pacing brisk and light, but also to create one of the most unique montages I have seen in quite some time.
Overall, The Graduate truly is a perfect film. Its story has surprisingly affected me in more ways than one, and I couldn't have watched this at a better time in my life. It is a dense a rich film with a truly engaging narrative, beautiful camerawork and sound, brilliant acting, and life-like characters. I loved this film, and I can't wait to cherish it for years to come.

amazing. the script+ dustin hoffmans acting is so hilarious it never gets old. the first and last good romance comedy. everything after it is just a copy. i love how it‚Äôs shot too. mike nichols def invented some shit with this one,4.0
"This thing really started at the pace of a turtle and went out with a memorable crescendo! Killer soundtrack (is this really where Mrs. Robinson song debuted?) THE breakout Dustin Hoffman performance, and a plot, that by today‚Äôs standards is common place, but was sure to carry shock value in 1969. 
This movie is so much about the unspoken, the tensions, the physical acting, the expressions, the shots, the music. I mean the shots and lighting in this movie are just fantastic and so clearly iconic. For example, the lighting and shadows in the hotel bedroom, where Mrs. Robinson and Ben have their illicit affair, are used to reflect seduction, the dark nature of their deeds and the loss of innocence. Most of the dialogue in the movie is pretty superficial, and that is intentional, everything that‚Äôs important is conveyed through other means. The build up on Eliane and Ben‚Äôs first date. Here‚Äôs the progression: wild car ride, leads to high stimulus environment, leads to emotional overload, leads to kiss, leads to more sensory overload at the fast food joint, leads to SILENCE (big theme in this film) in the car. That‚Äôs the formation of their relationship and it‚Äôs all done with little or meaningless dialogue. The more I think about this movie, the more apparent the unique style and genius. 
Ben‚Äôs life is directionless and captures the question-marks a recent graduate might have surrounding life prospects. As this self discovery progresses the movie shows how easy it would be to fall under the influence of a strong, beautiful sexual temptress. Then, the shift back to an interest in a youthful girl shows that Ben‚Äôs interest in the mother was more to satisfy physical desires, and that his heart really craves the youthful Elaine. This movie really did need this mother/daughter sex twist because some of the pacing in the beginning made for a slow start.
I am kind of just spitballing about some of the underlying motivations and themes I took away. What was concrete though was a really unique acting performance that started a legendary career. I loved the scene at the end where Ben sets out in a frantic search for Elaine. This tugged at my heartstrings when it became clear Elaine was headed to marry the wrong guy. Ben doesn‚Äôt give us a whole lot of reasons to root for him, but Eliane appears to be the mechanism needed to get his life back on track. Aside from the standout Hoffman performance, Mr. Robinson really stood out as being given some artistic license in his role as the cuckold. Everyone else just stayed within the bounds of their purposefully tailored roles. 
The last 10 minutes of this film was some GOOD movie making. I loved the Hoffman sprint toward the camera on his way to the church. I loved the escape onto the bus and the total lack of dialogue but a clearly communicated understanding of love between Elaine and Ben. The antagonist in this film is clearly Mrs. Robinson and it was fun to have her thwarted.
This movie just oozed cinematic marvels, and you can tell why it‚Äôs a bonafide classic. I‚Äôd love to get some more input on the shots and the lighting. I don‚Äôt quite have the insight necessary to understand all of that, but I loved the low angle shots, the use of shadow and light and would
appreciate learning more about the cinematic creativity and inspiration that went into The Graduate. 
Bottom line, plot gets spicy toward the end and it‚Äôs a heartwarming finish. I had no idea what this movie was about going in and I immediately felt the sexual tensions. I was hoping that wouldn‚Äôt be the direction of the film, but it developed well and concluded beautifully. I almost feel like we live in an age where the shock value needs to be even higher than the stakes outlined in this movie. I also felt that some of Eliane‚Äôs outfits felt way ahead of her time. I think of her walking around Berkeley and her outfit/hair, worn in the 70s, felt like something you‚Äôd see in 2021. Anyway, this is a great film. I am going to knock it a bit just based on personal preference.  I‚Äôd be selective who I recommend and watch this movie with because of the strong sexual themes. This movie manipulates your emotions and that‚Äôs the mark of talented actors and filmmakers. You get the sense of confusion and meaninglessness in the life of The Graduate. I would honestly be down to watch this movie again soon, solid stuff.",4.0
Can finally tick this masterpiece off of the the list of great Hoffman films,5.0
"Not a masterpiece like many people say it is but still a great film that has a lot to love about it. I'll get the few problems out of the way first. The story can be a little predictable in places and the pacing can be very slow in some moments especially in the first half of the film. Other than those things I loved pretty much everything else about the film. The story while can be predictable at times is mostly engaging, the cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is amazing, the humor can get some decent laughs, the screenplay is phenomenal, the direction is great, the editing is brilliant, the film perfectly captures the realism on what a person would do post-college, the characters are memorable and relatable, the themes are pretty thought-provoking, and the performances are stellar from everyone with the main standout being Dustin Hoffman who gives one of the best performances in his whole career and is one of the best things about the film. As a whole, while this film is not perfect in my eyes I still see it as a great romantic comedy-drama film that deserves all the praise that it gets. If you haven't seen this film yet then go and see it. It's absolutely worth it.",4.0

"As a fellow lost and helpless young adult like Benjamin, I found myself gravitating to the film‚Äôs emotional core on much more of a personal level than I was expecting, and I think that this film is tackling that feeling of being stray and unfocused with life in one of the most honest, hilarious yet empathetic ways possible. While it falters in fleshing out its relationships in a way that feels narratively and emotionally satisfying for me personally, the film makes up for with it‚Äôs subtly hilarious and quotable screenplay, stunning cinematography, a fantastic, yet repetitive Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, and an ensemble of comically and emotively genius performances, led by Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs typically excellent vulnerable portrayal of a young lost soul, looking for anything to take his mind off the inevitable crisis of growing up, capturing a raw humane imperfection like no other actor can.

"""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?""
Well, let's get right into what we have here. The Graduate tells the story of Ben, a college graduate who's deeply worried about his future. What's more, is that he's torn between a forbidden sexual affair with a woman twice his age who happens to be the mother of the girl he likes. What could go wrong?
Everything about this film is gold. There are plenty of things to consider with who's actually the most reasonable character in the end. Still, I stand much with Ben for the reason that he's more relatable. I gotta tell you what: this isn't your ordinary tale about coming of age. Just as how crazy as the premise states, so as the ending or pretty much the whole story in general.
From a technical standpoint, this one's noticeably way ahead of its time. There's so much to adore in every aspect of this film, with the cinematography and editing being my favorite parts. In addition, it's a very funny film. It has terrific use of music, a great cast all around, and brilliant direction.
With the film's ending in mind, I'm pumped to see myself freed from being dictated of what comes next. I'm specifically aware of the future's unpredictability and the inevitability of things happening. We weren't born to be young forever. Growing up is easily the most inescapable part of the journey.
To sum it all up, The Graduate is a film that came out in the '60s that still holds up very well even up until this day. It's a relevant film and a true classic.",5.0
"Benjamin Braddock was always going to tailspin. The film never explains exactly why he's so broken at the start, so full of pent-up nervous energy, and so dissociated from life, everything he says and does as anxious as it is mechanically routine; whatever the audience wants to guess is perfectly valid, and this allows for Ben to become a stand-in of sorts. Ben never attempts to improve himself as a person, and he would've imploded regardless of Mrs. Robinson's proposition, because anyone who willingly forefits their future as Ben does is incapable of getting better.
True, there is a pronounced generational divide in the film, but it would be irresponsible to blame the adults for what happens; every misguided piece of advice comes from a genuine intent to see their children succeed, even when it only ends up intensifying and enabling the self-destruction on display. The scuba scene is one of many brilliant scenes that demonstrates this point, combining witty writing with impressively technical playfulness to translate Ben's point-of-view as directly as they possibly could. With every clever edit and subtly artful shot, the film becomes Ben, showing us how he thinks so that we can pass judgement on what he does.
It would be impossible to say I didn't see myself in him, but the further detached from reality Ben got, the more self-aware I became. Ben never chose to get better, instead clinging to his infantile comforts and obsessions, as he destroyed every relationship he had left. The final shot is the killing blow to Ben, the worst case scenario of malaise that he embodies a sincere lesson to learn from. The fact that this film is so bold, nuanced, playful, and blatantly unsubtle in all the right ways is what makes it a masterpiece, but the fact that Ben's story played out as it did meant that it was always going to be worthwhile. The Graduate hasn't aged a day where it matters most, and might even be more prescient in an era where these comforts have never been so accessible as they are now.",5.0
"With not a single thing in any way flawed or out of place, The Graduate is rich with pitch-perfect performances, interesting characters, meticulous direction from the late great Mike Nichols, clever cinematography and editing, wonderfully dry humor, gripping and hard-hitting drama, and subtle yet powerful social commentary and satire.",5.0
"I can't stop thinking about their faces on the bus. I'm sitting here, the next day, in the office and I want to shout and cry and run madly off somewhere all at once, but I don't leave my desk and I imagine my expression looks just like theirs.",4.5
"I'm at a time of my life where The Graduate is painstakingly relatable. In two years I will be done with my bachelor's degree and will eventually move onto graduate school. I didn't plan on taking gap year in between, but now I am thinking I have to due to everything that has happened this year. Dustin Hoffman as Ben captures the awkwardness of being in that transitional period so well, hitting both the comedic moments and the real ones‚Ä¶",4.5
"Mostly stellar across the board. Hoffman and Bancroft are aces and Nichols does wonders with already strong material, focusing on character dynamics and creating a palpable tension in just about every scene. He sustains discomfort by constantly keeping the protagonist on his toes, and Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock as a perfect blend of neurotic, timid, and kind of a dick. Bancroft similarly isn't painted in broad strokes; it'd be too easy to make her cruel, or concoct some half-baked justification‚Ä¶",4.0
"There's a feeling of exhilaration that one gets when watching a very special film for the first time. It's a mix of high expectations being exceeded, marveling at the technical and artistic components, and being truly impacted by the human elements that gives off a feeling that is almost unexplainable. It's an instant indication that you're watching a masterpiece - or at least something very close to it.
The Graduate gave me that experience, and it's been far too long.",4.5

"I don‚Äôt have the time to write a proper review and I‚Äôm already becoming behind in my film-logging, so I‚Äôll just say this:
This movie has what every other good movie has, but just does it all better than most. It‚Äôs got a meaty, juicy screenplay with a pull-you-in plot, excellent built-in pacing, and contemplative themes about understanding and finding your own purpose when every door has been opened to you, what makes love true, and the breaking-point of lust. Every stage of this film‚Äôs story was equally vacuum-like, sucking me up and shaking me around inside of Ben‚Äôs head, making me feel his jumbled thoughts which all come together by the end like if it were a puzzle that made itself. I love how, at least with my viewing, Ben wasn‚Äôt some perfect, redeemed character by the end, but still a very flawed and very confused boy that has maybe one or two new things figured out than he did at the start. On a technical level, pure brilliance radiates in each scene, from the directing (such tailor-made performances) to the editing (there were some scene transitions like I‚Äôve never seen before, and of course the first time we see Mrs. Robinson unclothed!) to the cinematography (that scuba shot, man). 
What really sells this movie? The correct answer is probably Hoffman, Bancroft, and Katherine Ross, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm gonna say (I just read about all the allegations against Hoffman, what a gross human. He was beginning to become one of my favorite actors, it‚Äôs terrible so many women were treated they way they were by him. It‚Äôs simply disgusting). It‚Äôs the SIMON & GARFUNKEL SOUNDTRACK, MAN!! Obviously this isn‚Äôt some kind of profound take. But I cringed when, less than ten seconds into the movie, ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù started playing. I thought, ‚ÄúDamn, it‚Äôs a shame this soundtrack choice didn‚Äôt hold up.‚Äù But by the end of the movie, when ‚ÄúScarborough Fair‚Äù was playing for its third-time-in-a-row, I couldn‚Äôt believe how effective it was. Like another Hoffman movie, Midnight Cowboy, this movie knew it had something incredibly special with its Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack, and they USED it to its full extent. Hell yeah, I say!

Edit; I lied, this best part is how unexpectedly hilarious this movie is at times, did not expect to laugh as much as I did. I actually don‚Äôt think I expected to laugh at ALL!",5.0
"""Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson, I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends.""
An excellent character study, ""The Graduate"" sees Hoffman's Benjamin go from a shy, over-anxious, inexperienced young man to a manipulative, arrogant, and possessive person. These things he learned from Mrs. Robinson, and thus, by the film's final scene, he truly did become the graduate of her particular schooling. Hoffman and Bancroft are great together, and Ross, Daniels, and Hamilton are all great contributors as well. Nichols and Surtees together create a visual style that feels very advanced for its age, but also very of its time. The famously ambiguous ending is the best shot in a movie of great shots, and really drives home the lengths to which Benjamin will go to get what he wants.",4.0

My sixth watch.
I feel like this ended quicker than I was prepared for, I know it beat for beat by now but that last scene just happens so quickly. Not a flaw by any means, it's one of my favorite endings ever and its rapidity is part of why it works, but I feel like I didn't fully register the emotions of those final moments.
That slight complaint about this viewing aside, god, what an incredible movie. The general hilarity and melancholy makes me forget how strikingly emotional specific moments can be. The rack focus from Elaine to Mrs. Robinson standing through the doorway behind her, then back to Elaine, hits like a punch in the gut. And Mrs. Robinson telling Ben her major in college remains one of the most poignant and honest moments I've seen on film.
I feel like, when you're young, you relate to Ben and root for Ben and Elaine because they love each other. And as you get older, you relate more and more to Mrs. Robinson (the resonance with Ben remains but his flaws are clearer). Yet you still root for Ben and Elaine in hopes that they'll shake up and escape the norms they were raised into, despite knowing they definitely don't love each other. Both viewpoints make for such a rewarding experience. Maybe the saddest comedy of all time?",5.0

"‚ÄúBut what makes you think she wants to marry you?
- She doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.‚Äù Real Benjamin, too real.
Benjamin might be the realest, literally me character ever‚Äîan emblematic, unhinged, insanely awkward roller coaster ride of a movie that seemingly ends exactly where it started, just like a roller coaster. Dustin Hoffman delivers a brilliant and outstanding performance, with an atmosphere that, I dare say, could rival even that of Michael Cera (it doesn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs pretty darn close). It's a slow burn for sure, with parts that felt a little dragged, but not to the point of having a major impact on the film itself. In fact, this film makes use of every single scene, each being wonderfully shot, brilliantly performed, and insanely symbolic.
From beginning to end, the film is a poignant analysis of parental authority over young adults, dictating their lives to make them what the parents want them to be, rather than what the child themselves wishes. Adults discuss and plan someone else‚Äôs future without bothering to listen to their concerns. The film also acknowledges that young adults acting impulsively and without the guidance of someone much wiser and (potentially) much older, is a whole other problem (not to say that someone can‚Äôt be wise enough to make their own decisions, but to say that confiding in someone you know to be much wiser than yourself has always been a better option than blindly making a decision that could change the course of your life forever). It's a film filled with insecurity, uncertainty, loneliness, and fear, all of which often being the predecessors to the mistakes many young adults make at that point in their lives.
I would be remiss not to mention the final sequence of the film, one of the coolest, wildest, and most outstanding final sequences I‚Äôve ever seen in a coming-of-age film (or a film in general, for that matter). The final shot is incredibly symbolic and dynamic, bringing the film full circle. A life full of uncertainty and anxiety because of the decisions ones made. ‚ÄúWas it the right decision?‚Äù Who knows, but in the end, it was the decision you made, and you can‚Äôt change that now.

"captures post-graduation aimlessness most potently at the start as the camera finds the titular character among his family and social expectations like a deer in the headlights. the way mrs. robinson commands the screen and plays wi-- off a hesitant and shy ben is magnetic. sadly the charm wears off completely once it introduces elaine, as it signals the film kicking into underwritten/stereotypically misogynistic gear. her character is utilized as a prize for the taking, pursued by a suddenly changed ben, who is now a creepy, relentless stalker. it loses all suspension of disbelief in how elaine is robbed of any agency or autonomy in this constellation. made to give into his every whim and desire, despite the explictly stated dislike and distance she's built between them. the scene where she goes to his (!) apartment & tells him about that and it is checked off as if they're talking about a forgotten grocery list item is mindboggling. the wish fulfillment angle is taken to an extreme where it completely buries any semblance of sympathy, let alone aimlessness. not that there were ever signs of pressure due to material conditions. the ending does little to alleviate any aforementioned issues. at least ben got what he wanted, right?",2.0

"I‚Äôm quite surprised at how weird The Graduate really is, considering how normal it looks on the surface. A coming-of-age comedy starring Dustin Hoffman sounds quite digestible, inoffensive, and straightforward. Turns out it‚Äôs a lot darker and a lot more bizarre than an awkward love triangle. The Graduate questions direction and certainty in the future, more specifically within the titular graduate, and the direction it decides to go in to execute this is chaotic, unhinged, and off-the-rails. It is absurd in a way that presents the film‚Äôs ideas in an emotionally and visually-compelling manner. For its purpose, The Graduate is surprisingly full of depth in terms of its direction, as Nichols‚Äô vision is clearly the standout here even with Hoffman‚Äôs perfectly hesitant performance leading the way. I wasn‚Äôt expecting such deliberate angles, lighting, and symbolism at all, considering that synopsis.

"No, Simon and Garfunkel, no one is going to Scarborough Fair so will you stop asking me?!?

I abosoutely love the fish tank motif throughout The Graduate. Ben is Initially drowning in a sea of indecision (i.e. in a fishbowl). He's finished the first part of his life and going into his next and he's unsure of what he'll become. Rather than confront his problems, he wants to be left alone to sulk. The diving scene reflects this indecision as he keeps trying to come up to breathe, but his parents smile and push him down. They don't give him time to develop, and instead just expect him to jump into the next phase of his life. They are enjoying watching their son in a fishbowl.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Robinson is a woman who is stuck in her own kind of fishbowl: she feels old and unloved. Her affair with Ben is to bring a sexual spark back and remind/make her feel young again. Her confidence is what compels Ben to her in the first place. The scene where Mrs. Robinson throws the keys into the tank disrupts the fish, just like it temporarily disrupts Ben's life.
The affair changes Ben. We see him fumble constantly in the hotel (booking a room, ordering drink, holding door) and is afraid of the light during his first sexual encounter with Mrs. Robinson (he's also on the bottom).
However, after several months (aka 2 montages later), Ben now tries to let light into the room by opening windows and turning on lamps. He is now on top of Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson then shuts off the lamps. Ben now believes he is confident and wants an actual relationship (not just drifting). Meanwhile, Mrs. Robinson wants to enjoy the moment and is fine if their relationship is still shrouded in darkness.
The period of the actual affair is interesting as the film constantly cuts from moments of Ben at home, to in the pool, to with Mrs. Robinson. This shows that the affair has just become a part of his routine and every day just blends into the next.
Going back to our protagonist, whenever Ben is feeling depressed there are typically two elements present: a fish tank and the song 'The Sound of Silence'. The third time the song is played is at the last scene of the film when Ben and Elaine run away together. For a brief moment it appears that they escaped, but then 'Silence' and indecision begins to creep in once again. There is no actual fish tank present because they are not caught up in a metaphorical one; trapped and unable to communicate with one another.",5.0
"The Graduate is undoubtedly a classic. It's a gorgeous film to look at. It's avant-garde in its technical execution, as well as some of the themes it presents.
The direction and vision of Mike Nichols are absolutely extraordinary. The way this picture is shot and how it's framed is, of course, legendary. In terms of the technical aspect, it seemed rather ahead of its time. I saw so many great camera shots and angles that I've seen modern directors use and can sort of figure how this movie is influential.
The portrayals of indecisiveness, impulsiveness, obsession, entitlement, and lust also seem like something you didn't often see at the time it came out. I liked the story of the strange love triangle in which Ben (Dustin Hoffman) was caught up with between Mrs. Robinson and her daughter. I don't pretend to know how this was received in 1967, but I have a hunch that such a theme was rather unheard of (at least in American film).
Where this film sort of comes down for me is in its very lead. How can a character so easy to dislike have things go his way rather easily? Ben Braddock is dismissive, antisocial, entitled, and kind of a stalker.
Now, it's not that I don't dig unlikable characters and I don't need to root for all the leads. It's really case-by-case. In this one, I couldn't buy into the fact that Ben made terribly impulsive decisions to cover up how lost he felt about his future. And that they fell in his favor. He should be worried because he keeps shooting himself in the foot in the present. I couldn't find him easy to root for or to relate to.
Hoffman seems to get all the attention, when Anne Bancroft is the absolute life force of this film. Loved her here.
I can see why people say this is a ""masterpiece"" (in case you're new to my account, it's one of two buzzwords I can't loosely throw around). Its look, along with the great music of Simon & Garfunkel makes for a lovely picture. Mike Nichols did THIS. But, not a masterpiece, in my eyes.

What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?

A film that I don‚Äôt think will ever age, it‚Äôs a masterful examination of counter-culture. The lyrics of the iconic song Mrs. Robinson displays this melancholiac fever of out with the old in with the new mentality. The act structure of The Graduate is so flawless, the entire picture is so striking and raw. 
Watched with the 2007 Mike Nichols & Steven Soderbergh Commentary from the Criterion Blu-ray. Absolutely impeccable; this film has already taught me so much and this funny and insightful commentary was an absolute treat.

Perfection. Seriously, this movie is perfect. It may seem like I'm giving 5's to a lot of movies lately, but I've been watching a lot of incredible films and this is certainly one of them. From it's amazing opening to its haunting final shot, this movie is just perfect. One of the best movies I've ever seen.
The Graduate( for the few of you who weren't aware) is a comedy drama directed by Mike Nichols, based off of the‚Ä¶",5.0
"The Graduate is one of those films that you keep returning to, and every time you do, you find yourself seeing it in a whole new light. When I was sixteen and doing my virginal viewing, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure of the emotion there, but I realized the professionalism and experimentation of the filmmaking itself. When I watched it again around the age of nineteen, I related to Benjamin Braddock‚Äôs aimlessness in a post-college ‚Äúadult‚Äù world - and empathized deeply with his very naive perception of love and completion among the American ideal. Watching it yet again, at twenty-five, the film became less about Benjamin and more about Mrs. Robinson - and then I realized there was a dual story here that I otherwise brushed over, because I didn‚Äôt quite understand it at that time. Benjamin may, one day, be his own variation of Mrs. Robinson. For all we know, getting the girl at the end means shit. Because it‚Äôs fantasy. It‚Äôs a happily-ever-after trope. And Nichols knew this. Knew to linger. Knew to let the audience know: ‚Äúlife isn‚Äôt like the movies‚Äù. Rightfully iconic as a classic in American cinema, but never really given the credit for being one of the most painful examinations of the American dream.",5.0

Strong Performances - Anne Bancroft
In our youths, we hope greatly for our future, we build upon expectations that may or may not be met, and often times we find ourselves stumbling past the point of no return, left with the pathways in front of us either blurred or uninviting, we hope for a silver lining or a revelation that would hopefully lead us to the right path. It is when we reach such a point, where we feel that dreaded angst towards our lives, we become selfish and demanding of ourselves, while simultaneously harmful and drained, many find themselves building the road blocks of a life unfulfilled.
This seems to be the outlook of the future under Ben Braddock‚Äôs eyes, played by the appropriately stoic and awkward Dustin Hoffman, inexperienced in much of life‚Äôs demands, yet positioned with a great sense of pressure of those around him, realising that he is unequipped with the tools that would pave the road ahead. Innocence lies deep within his heart, thus curiously motivated and also swiftly hesitant towards the seduction process of Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a close friend of his parents, at least initially. It would be Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs impression left on Ben that would stimulate a slight change in his persona, panic-stricken at first, but soon finding immense comfort in her presence, providing him the experience that for so long, through the pressures of high school and college, have deprived him from.
Mrs. Robinson instils a sense of certainty and direction in his life, revolving a life on a particular schedule that brings forth happiness that was previously lacking. It is a relationship that is symbiotic, with Mrs. Robinson herself finding deep comfort in his presence, removed from the crumbling and disarming insecurities that runs through her, hiding away from the regretful decisions that shaped her present life, to once again touch upon the energy and flesh of youth, transferring back to a time where one can feel permitted to attend to such reckless adventure. A performance that is nothing short of insightful, one that is able to convey the deeper complexities of a woman, bringing forth the symbolic gesture of her presence in the story, yet given enough care to be conveyed as a flawed construction of humanity, she may reveal herself as antagonistic towards the latter course of the film, but through such, that human essence that would be found in the many that suffers from similar crutches remain intact and palpable.
Both were in a relationship that proved immoral but personally healthy, but as like any other element of life, random events and figures enter into our lives, our perspective changes, relationships that were once considered solid began to appear as rubble, new decisions and relationships are formed, thus forcing us to adapt and shift our priorities. What was once again a sense of hesitation and cruelty towards Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), became a natural evolution of genuine affection and tenderness, slowly moulding Ben‚Äôs life, earning new pleasures from her company, and began to feel the burden in Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs persistent demands and manipulations.
Much like Ben, Elaine possesses the angst-inducing insecurities that define a sense of vulnerability that is precise of her position in life, and due to the deep focus on the film‚Äôs exploration of Ben‚Äôs experiences, it is doubtful that if it were to place its camera heavily on Elaine that the result would be any different. Elaine and Ben‚Äôs relationship grows in the third act in a recovery process, attempting to make sense of their passions, losing oneself in the heat, unable to reboot their rational functioning. It would have been much easier for Ben to reflect upon his experience and move on with his life, but much like the drive of youth, there is a compulsion to feed one‚Äôs immediate desires, perceiving them as incentives of necessity. It would all lead to the film‚Äôs famous ending, arguably ambiguous in its atmosphere as it finds its two lovers initially enduring through excitement and adrenaline, slowly calming as they begin to analyse the decisions they had made, their faces shifting from optimism to doubt, almost as if presently scaling the benefits and risks of their chosen endeavour; leading us to contemplate, much like the characters themselves, to define whether such a pathway would be a fitting or regretful one.
Of course, The Graduate‚Äôs charms would not have tested upon the challenging nature of time if not for the experimental assembly of Mike Nichols‚Äô construction, creating a film that aims to innovate the incorporated genres, while working through the confines of the Hollywood system, exploring new ways of expression, unafraid to heighten its metaphorical gestures through its mode of editing and cinematography, tightly held together by the achingly somber tunes of Simon and Garfunkel. It demonstrates a remarkable ability to reflect the internal rumblings of its characters, yet also paralleling its method of storytelling with the era of production, the countercultural era that seems to have bled onto the core of its storytelling and characters.
It could have easily conformed to the traditional methods of cinematic craftsmanship, and it could have butchered its story through oversimplification, but instead it defies all expectation, notably of those who viewed it upon theatrical release. It is one that would pave the way of what would be the standard of American cinema, yet throughout the decades, its own charm remain firmly intact, one that would prove further beneficial through subsequent viewings, surpassing beyond the definition of a comfort film, but instead an essential viewing that should be passed along the generations to come.",4.5

"While its not required for this review, I‚Äôd suggest you read my review of Taxi Driver that I posted a few days ago, as their meant to be a double feature of sorts. But you do what you like I‚Äôm not your mother.
Ethan attempts to improve his awful writing skills by reviewing his 50 favorite movies #17B
It's like I was playing some kind of game, but the rules don't make any sense to me. They're being made up by all the wrong people. I mean no one makes them up. They seem to make themselves up.
I think why I like this film so much more over Taxi Driver and why I get more out of it comes in the two ways the films study their characters. From the get-go Taxi Driver has buried itself in Travis‚Äôs brain and spends the remainder of the time attempting to justify and rationalize his actions, obviously sympathizing with him. However, The Graduate takes its time before deciding to sympathize with Ben. His early scenes are incredibly awkward and borderline hard to watch as he aimlessly drifts through various pointless social interactions with people he really doesn‚Äôt know. Our only relief comes with Mrs. Robinson, commanding the scene and giving us something to focus on outside of Ben's extraordinary lack of social skills. 
Once their affair starts though things actually get worse, depending on the type of person you are their first meetup in the room is either drop dead hilarious or borderline unwatchable from second-hand embarrassment (often I find the experience to differ from each viewing, this time was humor). Were still not on board with Ben but we're definitely not on Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs side, as charismatic as she is. Their affair is obviously loveless and only comes out of the mutual boredom each of them feels. Mrs. Robinson is dealing with her picturesque family which is nothing but a front for a loveless marriage. Ben, like Travis at the beginning of both films, has no purpose, though his pushback against the materialistic lifestyle of his parents and their friends is much more subtle then Travis‚Äôs disdain for humanity. 
While we‚Äôre not sure whether or not were supposed to sympathize with Ben, it‚Äôs the arrival of Elaine, much like the introduction of Iris is Taxi Driver, that sets our protagonist towards their final goal. But by this point in the film Ben has started to lose our sympathies while Travis has gained them by the same point, leading two similar characters to two very different outcomes. This isn‚Äôt a slam against Taxi Driver, lord knows I‚Äôve done enough of that, but it's interesting to see how the two films approach their characters journeys. 
So now we're at the second half, each characters goal has been established, Travis wants to really clean up the streets (which he can‚Äôt completely, but freeing Iris will do), and Ben wants to marry Elaine. Each of which finally solidify the theme of their respective film. The Graduate finally shows how hypocritical and empty the adults are while Taxi Driver shows how one man's delusions can go out of hand and there is no rock bottom for our protagonist to hit. I feel that the end of the 2nd/beginning of the 3rd acts are what make or break these respective movies. Ben willingly admits the affair to Elaine and cuts of Mrs. Robinson, choosing to instead pursue the only meaningful relationship he‚Äôs formed thus far. Travis proceeds to lose all good will he gained in the first half, planning random, unmotivated, and puzzling acts of violence and always managing to dodge the consequences. So that, by the time each of their respective climax‚Äôs role around, we genuinely hope that Elaine and Ben can be together while we are simply resigned to Travis‚Äôs murder spree. Leaving us with two very different emotions. 
Now we should talk about the codas that each film provides. Now, I know the death of the author is a pretty popular lens to examine art through but in this case I‚Äôd like to use two interpretations of the endings as provided by their makers. Paul Schrader has said that the ending of Taxi Driver is real and not in Travis‚Äôs head, this leaves us with a sour taste that his violent acts were celebrated by society. In contrast however, The Graduates final shot forces us to really consider the consequences of their actions, they now literally only have each other and no plan going forward, while we got some version of a fairy tale ending those final few seconds call everything into question, which is further exemplified by Nichols explanation as to what happened after the end of the film.
‚ÄúThey became their parents.‚Äù
Maybe you can‚Äôt break the generational cycle of becoming out of touch with those younger than you. Maybe you can‚Äôt make a difference no matter how many people you kill. But the way each of those ideas is presented are what make the Graduate one of my all time favorites and Taxi Driver on of my least.",5.0
Dustin Hoffman must have taken some pointers from Mrs. Robinson based on what he has been up to lately.,5.0
"This blew me away. The directing was absolutely brilliant, some of the camerawork had me in awe. The plot is SUPER engaging, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs emotional, it‚Äôs super intense and the acting performances were all outstanding.

"I‚Äôm a little worried about my future 
Sometimes a work of art comes strolling along into your life at the perfect time. Even on top of that, something that seems like divine powers interfering with everything happens during the film that somehow makes it hit even harder. At the moment, for me, The Graduate is that work of art.  
The fact that the cinematography is used to actually tell a story rather than to just look pretty is really inspiring to me because of the lack of pure visual storytelling we get nowadays. Using blocking and colours to convey feelings of love, isolation, disconnection and hatred. Just brilliantly shot all around with some really nice camera movements throughout. I also really appreciate how the constant use of sound bridges ensures that the film is always engaging as the next scene starts during the end of the current scene.
I dunno. There‚Äôs just something so strangely relatable about Benjamin, definitely not his situation but the way he handles his situation. As a character, he might just be the most relatable ever put to screen. Like I said, I dunno, there‚Äôs something about The Graduate that just clicks. Imagine making a film that manages to encapsulate so many people for such a long time, art immortalises not just artists but the consumers as well. I dunno. Good picture.",5.0

"The Graduate is a haunting movie. It‚Äôs listed as a comedy but I never laughed, but I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt laugh. It‚Äôs perfect at displaying uncertainty and feeling powerless in life. The constant asking of ‚Äúwhat are you gonna do in life‚Äù reminding you more and more that you don‚Äôt know and you don‚Äôt know how to fix that. Benjamin keeps saying he‚Äôs scared about his future and nobody reassures him in any meaningful way. One scene that I never noticed the first time I watched this years ago that I noticed now was at the beginning when Ben‚Äôs mother starts listing off his achievements from college and he runs upstairs and hides in his room. Despite all his achievements and all that he‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs all meaningless. He‚Äôs constantly being approached by people at this party and being told he has his whole life ahead of him. It‚Äôs a celebration for him and yet he doesn‚Äôt want to be there, because why celebrate when nothing meaningful has been accomplished? Is it meaningful? Should he not be worried? Another scene that was great was when he is in the scuba gear and his parents are showing him off like a trophy. And then he gets in the pool, he tries to get out but his parents keep pushing back down, until he accepts it all and just stays down there in the water, they‚Äôre essentially drowning him, metaphorically speaking of course. The beginning is so good at setting up Ben as this uncertain person who just wants to feel like they have a purpose in life and for someone who understands him. Benjamin didn‚Äôt want any of this, he didn‚Äôt deserve any of this. Nobody ever truly listened to him when he was not confident. So once he got confidence, it was unfortunately on something that endangered him and others around him. I don‚Äôt even want to fully root for Benjamin to find Elaine and run away with her because it‚Äôs not a relationship built on trust, it‚Äôs built on spite. But Benjamin is confident and won‚Äôt back down no matter what and he wouldn‚Äôt be this way if someone had truly listened. How could Benjamin have screwed up his life this much when he had everything given to him on a silver platter, one might ask. He didn‚Äôt have it rough, how could someone so privileged throw their life away like that? Well, I understand why, in that, I don‚Äôt understand why. It‚Äôs not simple, sometimes it‚Äôs just a feeling. Like I said, he accomplished so much and felt so little satisfaction. Anyone can feel that way, anyone can feel scared and unsure. And while anyone can get over their fears and find their purpose in life, sometimes, anyone can also lose themselves in their fears and get consumed by them until they‚Äôve lost everything and have nothing to hold onto except whatever delusion they have and keep digging themselves even deeper. 
You know what, fuck it, 10/10 for being such a scarily relatable piece of art. I have my issues but god damn it, this one‚Äôs too special. The acting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, it‚Äôs all amazing and I can‚Äôt help but love it. I need this movie, as a reminder, things will always look uncertain, but it‚Äôs better to make the best of what you can and never let yourself become consumed by your fears.",5.0

Mrs. Robinson has always been and will always be incredibly fascinating.

Thank you, Mike Nichols.",5.0
"""I think you are filth. I think you are scum.""
If you analyze the plot itself, Benjamin Braddock is one of the most despicable protagonists in a movie, period. That it is Dustin Hoffman bringing the level of pathos that a Dustin Hoffman can do definitely makes for an awkward but strangely rewarding experience all the same. There is so much conflict to contend with in regards to this schlub. Does he have a single redeeming quality? I don't know if that is the point here. Hoffman and Bancroft were only six years apart in age but the character is a selfish 21-year-old and I can speak from experience that most 21-year-olds are preoccupied, self-involved jerks so the film isn't inaccurate in its portrayal. And of course the final moments hammer home the gravity of recklessness he is capable of.
The film really rocked my world when I first saw it in early high school. Even as a film buff neophyte I was bowled over by the craft in the editing and camera framing. There's so much artistry in the flow and pacing and the awkward suspense of adultery. No doubt that Paul Simon contributed as much as anyone. The best shot is when Benjamin is about to tell Elaine about the affair and she sees her mother standing in the hallway. When she turns back to camera her face is out of focus and it slowly shifts back to reveal tears in her eyes, beautifully visualizing the revelation coming together for her. It's a powerful moment.",4.5
"Mrs. Robinson : Elaine it‚Äôs too late. 
Elaine : Not for me!
An unconventional love story that unfolds in the latter half of the film. I feel a bit of pressure after seeing all your reviews‚Äîmost rating it between 4.5 and 5. For me, however, it's a 3.5, and here's why‚Äî
The film kicks off with a young man, fresh out of college, overwhelmed and confused about his future. His initial desire for sex as an escape felt realistic, and I appreciated his nervousness during Mrs. Robinson's seduction, as well as his general respect for women. Up to this point, I was set to give it a 3.5, hoping for more depth as the film progressed. Then comes Elaine, the love interest, in the second half.
The narrative suggests he falls for her after just one meeting, and she reciprocates because he pursues her. I'm not questioning their feelings, but the rapid development of their relationship was a hard pill to swallow. Even if I were to overlook that, Benjamin's decision to interrupt her wedding and her acceptance of him post-marriage left me questioning‚Äîif she truly loved him, why did she marry someone else?
I would have appreciated more depth to Elaine's character and a more detailed exploration of their growing affection‚Äîperhaps shown through a progression of events rather than abrupt turns. On the other hand, the soundtracks and sound effects were impressive. And the cinematography, with it‚Äôs shallow and deep focus added a charm to this movie. The film consistently amused me, especially as Ben wrestled with his feelings about his father's partner's wife.
Despite my critiques, I enjoyed the movie. It just needed a bit more development in the romance part to fully win me over.",3.5
"Living for the expectations and custom of people around you, ping-pong-ing through your whole youth waiting for a sense of reliability to magically fall to your feet, trying so hard to make something that you can truly call your own for once and distance yourself as much as you can from the hellscape that is living a life of checklisting through adulthood. This movie captures the sentiment of so desperately wanting to feel something real in a stage of your life when everything tells you to follow a pre-established path, which inevitably means making some brusque and thoughtless decisions that most certainly will take you through a whole lot harder path with even more anxieties and regrets‚Ä¶ but damn does it feel real for at least a couple of seconds.",4.5

"""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me."" - Benjamin Braddock
Can't believe it's taken this long to watch it, but I finally have seen it, and yeah, iz preti gud.
An affair can be a power dynamic. One must give it up to the other because they know they're doing something wrong. It's a tug-of-war of right and wrong and what one party desires over the other. Each side pushes and pulls to get what they want. But they both have something in common: they both want to keep it a secret. They don't want anybody but them to know about it. But things can get complicated. One may want to spill the beans to keep the other trapped or the other might fall in love with somebody else. Who knows? It can only stay hidden for so long before everything goes wrong.
Man, what can I say? Really? Like what can I say that hasn't been said before? The screenplay was easily one of the best I've heard since last month (and I mean, look at what I watched last month. You'll understand why). All of the dialogue and characters felt realized and authentic and there were a number of poignant lines. Oh! And there were consequences! Like I thought this would all be in secret, but no! Actions do have consequences! Wow! It's like that should happen more often in film.
The soundtrack provided by Simon & Garfunkel worked in miraculous ways. Like it actually helped punctuate the intensity near the end when Ben's (Dustin Hoffman) looking for Elaine (Katharine Ross) and every moment the film needed. The cinematography was also astounded me. So many incredibly composed shots. If they're iconic, they more than deserve to be.
The acting was phenomenal here. The whole cast was fantastic, but it really came to Katharine Ross (Elaine Robinson), Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson), and Dustin Hoffman (Benjamin Braddock) who all excelled. Again, as I mentioned previously, it felt like I was watching people interact onscreen and their conversations were so natural.
However, this film had a couple of problems with it. The film felt dated with the way it looked at romance and the stalking is another problem I had with it.
That's it, though! I thought this was really great and I'm happy I finally watched it!

""Goodbye Benjamin.""
I was recently told that this movie was intended to be a comedy. If so, it's one of the worst built comedies I've ever seen. It plays into the dramatic so much that when the ""comedy"" comes, it's unintentionally hilarious.
Because of that, there were aspects of this film that are either too unbelievable or make no narrative sense. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft are fantastic here. He plays the socially awkward college graduate who comes into his own flawed manhood through an affair, and she plays the seductive older woman driven mad by jealousy.
For much of the runtime, it's a very serious drama with some high stakes and messy situations, then it shifts into a classic romantic comedy that is so far- fetched and ludicrous that you're not sure if you should laugh or be concerned.
Here, the performances sell this movie and it's unintentional comedy is truly a riot. Glad I finally got around to this one.",3.0

"""THE GRADUATE"" has been adapted by Mike Nichols, Buck Henry, and Calder Willingham from a novel of the same title by Charles Webb. I like the move much better than the book, but until I had read the book I had no idea how literally faithful the screenplay was to its source. Charles Webb seems to be the forgotten man in all the publicity even though 80 per cent or more of the dialogue comes right out of the book. I recently listened to some knowledgeable people parceling out writing credit to Nichols, Henry, and Willingham as if Webb had never existed, and as if the quality of a film were predetermined by the quality of its script, and as if the mystique of the director counted for nought. These knowledgeable people should read the Webb novel which reads more like a screenplay than any ""novel"" since John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men.""
Webb's book is almost all dialogue with the intermittent straight prose passages functioning as visual tips for the director. That is not to say that Nichols, Henry, and Willingham are not entitled to their credits, but merely that their contributions pertain more to nuance than substance, more to the how than the what.
""The Graduate,"" more than ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", is Mike Nichols's diploma as a director. Whereas Nichols merely transferred Albee, he actually transcends Webb. ""The Graduate"" is a director's picture not because Nichols wrote all the dialogue and acted out all the parts and sang and composed all the songs under the double pseudonym of Simon and Garfunkel and directed the cinematography under the alias of Robert Surtees, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad credit sheetum. ""The Graduate"" is a director's picture because even its mistakes are the proofs of a personal style.
Style is more an attitude toward things than the things themselves. It can be a raised eyebrow or a nervous smile or a pair of shrugged shoulders. It can even be an averted glance. By playing down some of the more offensive qualities of the book, Nichols expresses his own attitude toward the material. The main trouble with the book is its reduction of the world to the ridiculous scale of an overgrown and outdated Holden Caulfield. The catcher in the rye has been perverted by time and affectation into a pitcher of the wry. Charles Webb's Benjamin Braddock expresses himself with a monosyllabic smugness that becomes maddeningly self-indulgent as the book unravels into slapstick passion. Ben even goes ""on the road"" for a brief period to demonstrate his beatification at the expense of the beatniks. He is superior to his pathetic parents and adults generally. He is kind to the wife of his father's law partner even though she seduces him with cold-bloodedly calculating carnality. Ben then falls in love with Elaine, his mistress's daughter, and makes her marry him through the sheer persistence of his pursuit.
The screenplay has been improved by a series of little changes and omissions constituting a pattern of discretion and abstraction. The hero is made less bumptious, the predatory wife less calculating, the sensitive daughter less passive. The ""on the road"" passage is omitted from the movie, and the recurring parental admonitions are reduced in number and intensity. The very end of the movie is apparently the result of an anti-cliche improvisation. In the book Ben interrupts Elaine's wedding (to another) before the troths have been plighted or the plights have been trothed or what have you. In the movie the bride kisses the groom before Ben can disrupt the proceeding, but the bride runs off just the same. And this little change makes all the difference in dramatizing the triumph of people over proceedings. An entire genre of Hollywood movies had been constructed upon the suspenseful chase-to-the-altar proposition that what God hath joined together no studio script writer can put asunder. The minister could turn out to be an impostor, the bridegroom a bigamist, but once the vows were taken, that was the old ballgame. ""The Graduate"" not only shatters this monogamous mythology; it does so in the name of a truer love.
The emotional elevation of the film is due in no small measure to the extraordinarily engaging performances of Anne Bancroft as the wife-mother-mistress, Dustin Hoffman as the lumbering Lancelot, and Katherine Ross as his fair Elaine. Nichols is at his best in getting new reading out of old lines and thus lightening potential heavy scenes. The director is at his worst when the eclecticism of the visual style gets out of hand. The opening sequence of bobbing, tracking, lurching heads in nightmarishly mobile close-ups looks like a ""hommage"" to Fellini's ""8 1/2."" A rain-drenched Anne Bancroft splattered against a starkly white wall evokes images in ""La Notte."" The languorous lyricism of Ben at Berkeley seems derivative of Varda's ""Le Bonheur"" and even some of John Korty's landscape work in the same region. Unfortunately, the cultural climate is such that the intelligent prose cinema of Mike Nichols tries to become the intellectual-poetic cinema of Michelangelo Nichols. Still, I was with ""The Graduate"" all the way because I responded fully to its romantic feelings, and my afterthoughts are even kinder to a movie that, unlike ""Morgan,"" didn't cop out in the name of ""sanity."" Some people have complained that the Bancroft-Hoffman relationship is more compelling than the subsequent Ross-Hoffman relationship. I don't agree. As Stravinsky once observed, it is easier to be interesting with dissonance than consonance. Similarly, it is easier to be interesting with an unconventional sexual relationship than with a conventional love pairing. ""The Graduate"" is moving precisely because its hero passes from premature maturity to an innocence regained, an idealism reconfirmed. That he is so much out of his time and place makes him more of an individual and less of a type. Even the overdone caricatures that surround the three principals cannot diminish the cruel beauty of this love story.",0.0

Story : 7.6/10

Overall : 7.57/10
The first time I watched The Graduate I honestly found it quite boring and ultimately gave it a 6/10. That was over a year ago and this time thorough I found that I appreciated it a lot more. It's an 8/10 now, though just barely.
Dustin Hoffman rides the line between hilarious and pathetic so well that you'd think the role of Ben Braddock was written especially for him. Paired with Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross and surrounded by the likes of Murray Hamilton and William Daniels it's a small miracle nobody won an acting award at the Oscars that year. My big takeaway was that nobody came off like they were hamming it up in any of the really awkward sexual scenes. It seems like that's something that could have easily happened and the fact that it never goes in that direction makes these already amazing performances just that much more impressive.
I guess my big problem with the film, and the reason I was so reluctant to give it such drastically higher rating this time around is the general unevenness of the film in both the writing and production. Story wise it touches on both hilarious and depressing themes (much like Hoffman's character) but it never seriously dives feet first to either side. It seems like whenever it comes close to doing so it kind of steers towards the other direction to be safe. Similarly the entire mood of the film, the atmosphere and setting, the camera work and creative shots all come off nearly perfectly but the Simon and Garfunkel score almost ruined all of that. If a particular piece of music just didn't work then that was a best-case scenario because most of the time it left me smirking and scratching my head - something I'm sure Mike Nichols wasn't intending to cause people to do.
For all it's faults though, The Graduate does do one thing perfectly. It's not a safe move, it doesn't ride the line between any two things and it certainly isn't expected. The uncertain looks that Hoffman and Ross exchange on the bus in the closing moments will forever be one of my favorite cinematic moments. Was it all worth it? What comes next? I just find that whole sequence perfectly fitting.

Just for the record, I don't want to know ""what comes next"" or ""was it all worth it"". So don't make a sequel, Hollywood.",4.0

"I found big chunks of this film absolutely hilarious. Most of it comes from the awkwardness of the situation. My favorite aspects were the parts in which Ben and Mrs. Robinson ""get to know"" each other. The direction, editing, and acting are flawless. Simon and Garfunkel's music obviously is incredible on its own. So it should not come as a surprise that it does its part for this film. The final scene in the church is fucking nuts and I love it.

"‚ÄúAre you here for an affair, Sir?‚Äù
A safari with a cougar. Mike Nichols‚Äô most celebrated film is notorious for its resident seductress, played by Anne Bancroft, of which the renowned term ‚Äúmilf‚Äù was perhaps born. However, The Graduate also unmistakably remains a formal masterclass of cinematography, editing and film direction; managing to be both timely in relation to the new age of New Hollywood, and yet timeless in its confrontation of polarising age dynamics and youthful paranoia and unease. So enamoured am I with the aesthetic that Nichols‚Äô created, with thanks to Robert Surtees and Simon & Garfunkel of course, that the only time The Graduate fails to work for me is when such aesthetic begins to fade. The scenes in which Benjamin practically stalks Elaine in and around Berkeley aren‚Äôt exactly entertaining, but Nichols‚Äô use of montage in this regard ensures the sequence isn‚Äôt ever monotonous or dull. And that final scene, impossible to not mention; absurd in style yet exhilarating in action, and those final three shots sum up the entire movie. Melancholic hilarity, mixed with profound malaise.

I dare to say that it'd go almost completely unnoticed.

"That scene, where you see Benjamin underneath the crook of Mrs Robinson' knee and he delivers the classic line ""Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me"" is justifiably famous but the yin to that scene's yang when Benjamin is finally rejected by her and the camera move separates the two of them should be just as celebrated. It is a masterclass in framing throughout the film as we follow Benjamin, clearly disconnected from his family and society in general and is reeled in by Mrs Robinson, who herself is in a loveless marriage that hangs by a thread. It's a film which rejects the notion of the family unit which was the prevailing way of life in the post-war years. And yet that act is undercut by the final scene as we see Benjamin and Elaine on a bus, seemingly finally finding love but the looks on their faces betray a profound ennui already with that. Here's to you, Mr Nichols.",5.0

Hmm, ok... This was on my watchlist for a long time now, gaining anticipation by the week. Can't say that it completely met my expectations.
The first part, with the shy graduate Hoffman being seduced by the older woman, friend of his parents, was absolutely brilliant. The chemistry between the two leads was amazing. Also humour was balanced perfectly with the serious tones.
Hoffman is terrific throughout, he is the one that carries this one to the end. I just wish I'd see more of Bancroft in the second part of the film.
Where it went wrong for me is in the romance with Elaine, the daughter of the older woman in question. I didn't buy for one second that Ben fell head over heels for her overnight. And seeing that the complete second part of the story consisted of Ben trying to win back Elaine, it just didn't do anything for me.
*mild spoilers ahead*
When it all seemed to conclude in a happy ending, I actually found myself considering if I shouldn't rate this any lower. Than that last scene in the bus just slightly changed, at least the characters did. Have to say I felt a bit relieved that Nichols didn't go for a sugar coated ending.
All in all, a bit disappointing, but saved by Hoffman and Bancroft.",3.5

mike nichols √© um diretor muito vers√°til, acredito que the graduate seja seu trabalho mais promissor, sendo um pioneiro no movimento americano focado em filmes com personagens mais humanos
a princ√≠pio parece ser uma obra que fala sobre a solid√£o, mas √© um dramalhao melanc√≥lico sobre a juventude e o impulso de seu protagonista central, benjamin.
no enredo basicamente acompanhamos o benjamin, um rapaz que acabara de se formar na universidade, e retorna para casa nas f√©rias. ele passa a ser seduzido pela sra. robinson, uma senhora que √© amiga dos seus pais.
a dire√ß√£o do nichols √© muito precisa e grande parte da obra ressoa como um estudo de personagem bem feito, tanto que o primeiro ato √© focado especialmente somente na constru√ß√£o desse protagonista.
a c√¢mera segue seu protagonista tal qual o predador persegue sua presa, com planos cont√≠nuos e close ups que focam em uma pris√£o mental, da qual benjamin se encontra naquele dado momento.
a constru√ß√£o da rela√ß√£o entre os personagens tamb√©m √© √≥tima, e como benjamin externa seus sentimentos e impulsos diante delas
benjamin √© um personagem enigm√°tico que se sente pressionado e √© guiado pelas vontades de outrem, o curioso √© que ele se identifica somente com seus peixes, o que acaba gerando aquela met√°fora que lhe cai bem, um peixinho fora d'√°gua.
o final √© um tanto quanto po√©tico, n√£o tem profundidade porque seu protagonista tamb√©m √© desprovido dela, e √© isso que o torna t√£o po√©tico e inc√¥modo, e talvez, talvez, benjamin esteja fadado a repetir os mesmos erros de seus antecessores..",4.5

""Really enjoyed the music from Simon and Garfunkel.""
They do some WILD things with the camera in this movie. The Graduate is teeming with energy equally excited and anxious; everything's teetering on the brink of...something, and the final scene offers no resolutions.
Not IN the New Wave yet, but it's right on the edge‚Äîthat mix between golden-age romantic comedy and Simon and Garfunkel is one-of-a-kind.

I started off laughing my head off and then i just felt sad?
The cinematography is mundane and minimalistic but that seems to be the beauty of The Graduate. The soundtrack also could not be more suited or more perfect for a film.",3.5
"There‚Äôs something amazing about the 1960‚Äôs classics.  For instance, 1967 gave us both BONNIE AND CLYDE and THE GRADUATE.  The former could have been a typical gangster movie and the latter an exploitive love triangle about a young guy carrying on an affair with a married woman, then falling in love with her daughter.  But, both added multiple layers of subtext to the point that a Viewer could watch them several times and focus on different things each time.
    
THE GRADUATE is particularly fascinating for me.  I first saw it in the mid-1970‚Äôs as part of a film program at college.  People called it a comedy, but ... while I liked it ... I didn‚Äôt find it to be particularly funny.  (Okay, I did laugh at the ‚ÄúPlastics‚Äù line.)  Instead, I saw it as a biting satire, and a lot of that may have had to do with my being about to face the career decisions that so confused the title character.
   
Watching it again today, just over four decades later, I found myself chuckling frequently over the story while ‚Äúgroovin‚Äô on the nostalgia‚Äù of the Simon and Garfunkel film score.  This time, I still could associate with the title character‚Äôs dilemma, but I also honed in on the mature adults, particularly the Robinsons.  There is such bitter sweetness to looking at a young person starting out and reflecting on your own choices at that age.
   
The casting is superb.  No, Dustin Hoffman doesn‚Äôt look anything like the Benjamin Braddock in the book, but he completely nails the character.  He seems to have this surreal rhythm going on in his head that impacts everything from physically how he moves across a room to an unceasing monologue running through his head that he occasionally can no longer restrain.
    
Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson was the villain of the piece when I first saw the film.  Now, it is intriguing to ponder how she has gone from a free-spirit art student to an alcoholic seducer of a young man, and who also has an uncomfortable relationship with her daughter.  There are some expressions on Anne Bancroft‚Äòs face that speak volumes with only the twitch of an eyebrow.
    
Katharine Ross as the daughter, Elaine Robinson, still impresses me as one of the most ‚Äúdrop dead gorgeous‚Äù actresses I‚Äôve ever seen.  When I first saw THE GRADUATE, I didn‚Äôt think that her character was particularly well-written because she made major life changing decisions with little thought.  Of course, now I see the brilliance of portraying the uncertainty and trying to balance logic against emotions.  She is terrific.
   
Murray Hamilton, the mayor from JAWS, plays Mr. Robinson.  Again, from my current age perspective, I can immediately pick up on the image his character wants to create, and the confused lack of understanding regarding the course his life has taken when he has ‚Äúdone everything right.‚Äù  It is a very understated and effective portrayal.
   
Although Buck Henry shares Screenwriter credit with Calder Willingham, the production team for years has said that it is Henry‚Äôs script that was used.  (A feature on the Criterion disc points out that Willingham‚Äôs version was dark and overtly sexual.)  The Director, Mike Nichols, uses it to great advantage as he infuses his Vision into the words, choosing imagery that is interesting to watch on its own.
    
Best of all, I am incredibly impressed by the ending.  Just watch the range of emotions on the faces.  It is the perfect set-up for an extensive after-showing pizza party discussion!

This is one of these movies that I could just throw on when I‚Äôm needing a good laugh.

"Dustin Hoffman is outstanding in his breakthrough role as a troubled young adult who is worried about his future. His awkwardness is endearing and universal.

"‚ÄúMrs Robinson you‚Äôre trying to seduce me...aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù
The Graduate is a timeless story that reflects the coming-of-age experience, capturing the journey, fears and rejections of inevitable adulthood.
The film centres on Benjamin Braddock, a fresh graduate who returns home into the open arms of his parents and family friends, all who await his future to be promising. For Benjamin, his future is obscured by his dwellings on adulthood and his ambitions are seemingly diminished. While his true feelings are invisible to those around him, only Mrs Robinson, his family‚Äôs neighbour and longtime friend, comforts him and seduces him. Though he rejects her ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù advances at first, Benjamin begins an intimate affair with Mrs Robinson, where his troubles disappear as he take in the new life that awaits him. Tensions begin as he is peer-pressured into taking out her daughter, Elaine, who Mrs Robinson permits Benjamin before he begins to fall for her.
The dwelling anxieties of Benjamin conflict him further as his steps into maturity lead him on a promiscuous journey to adulthood.
Benjamin‚Äôs story is one I believe we can all empathise with as a viewer, or perhaps a fly on the wall, as his destiny is decided for him by his surrounding predecessors and succumbs to this dwelling pressure and doubt.
At one point or another in our lives, I think we can all relate to Benjamin‚Äôs character, as his journey into a new, frightening chapter of his life is one that is undeniably real. We watch films for the purpose of escape; to dive deep into a heightened reality that plays with imagination. But this is a film which echoes that time that each one of us will inevitably have or will look back to experience, for the purpose of better understanding ourselves.
Mike Nichols‚Äô film is a perfect visual adaptation of the 1963 novel of the same name, capturing the uncertainties and pressures of Benjamin through its immersive cinematography and extremely visual storytelling. The film itself exists in a sea of imagery and symbolism that makes The Graduate the impressive and appealing story that has aged rather well overtime.
The motifs of water and darkness paint the alienation and pressurising positions Benjamin is forced into, and whether he rises above or is drowning under water Benjamin‚Äôs character continues to be stranded in a sea of uncertainty and depression.
Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs role as the bumbling, anxious graduate Benjamin is remarkably convincing. His portrayal adequately expresses the unfulfilling nature of the unambitious young adult, despite Hoffman being well into his 30‚Äôs and only 6 years younger than Anne Bancroft (Despite Mrs Robinson‚Äôs character is doubled Benjamin‚Äôs age). As Mrs Robinson, Bancroft brings the predatory, desirable and lost mother to life through a strong performance, effortlessly adding depth to her yearning character.
The film‚Äôs score is a fitting companion for the story, as the soothing tones of Simon and Garfunkel reflect the sorrows, brief ups and downs of the troubled Benjamin.
The moment that really jumps out from the screen for me is Benjamin‚Äôs reading of Eliane‚Äôs letter:
‚ÄúI love you but I don‚Äôt think it could ever work out‚Äù

I find this to be a pivotal point in the film, which can be interpreted as a premonition as well as foreshadowing the film‚Äôs closing moment. The clandestine nature between Benjamin and Mrs Robinson provided comfort to the two and they both needed each other as much as the other realises, as both characters found their affair as an escape from their mundane lives. But this escape leaves them just as uncertain as the lives they cannot bare to endure.
From here, the rocky relationship later steaming between Benjamin and Elaine becomes tense and unpromising. In the ending we see Benjamin blinded by his emotions, once more showing that what lies ahead of him is uncertain, as he dramatically interrupts Elaine‚Äôs wedding and ‚Äòrescues‚Äô her from a sealed fate. The elope on the bus is short lived, and makes one of the most hard-hitting, melancholic endings I‚Äôve ever seen. The image of the pair‚Äôs realisation, expressions of ecstasy turning to uncertainty, is indeed bittersweet. We don‚Äôt see what their fate is and are only left to the imagination, but I think keeping Elaine‚Äôs departing words in mind are echoed in that iconic frame.
The Graduate is gripping, charming and intimate all at once. Its relatable story of alienation and ambigous self-discovery darts from cringe-worthy moments to scenes which deeply resonate with its audience in a manner of emotions. The film itself is as much a journey as well as Benjamin‚Äôs own, exploring the trepidation of early adulthood through comedic, dramatic, gratifying and sombre moments. It has left a long-lasting impact as an adored classic that stands the test of time, and one that will forever change the way you listen to ‚ÄúMrs Robinson‚Äù forever, either for better or worse.",5.0

"Ngl, this movie was a bit overrated. I never knew this movie was directed by the same guy who also directed ""The Birdcage"", one of my my favorite childhood comedies of his. Apparently, people consider this movie to be his best work, so I was expecting quite a lot from this movie, and i'm not gonna lie, I was disappointed. I will say though, the cinematography is definitely way ahead of its time and I do respect the message the movie conveys, about the fears and doubts of the future, but I felt like the pacing of the movie was a bit slow. Also the soundtrack was extremely repetitive and annoying, like I have nothing against Simon & Garfunkel, but my god, after they put ""The Sound of Silence"" for like the 4th time, it just got annoying at this point.

"Mrs. Robinson, you‚Äôre trying to seduce me. Aren‚Äôt you?
Back in January, when I watched my second viewing of Rain Man, this time with my parents, my mother asked ‚Äúdo I know that guy?‚Äù. I had recognized Hoffman from Rain Man and Meyerowitz Stories, but I also remembered scrolling past a movie called ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù that used to be on Netflix, with a younger Dustin Hoffman, but the frame they displayed featured a seductive leg so I figured it was more of a perverted film.
Back to my mother‚Äôs question: ‚Äúdo I know that guy?‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have seen him anywhere‚Äù. My father says, ‚Äúhe was in The Graduate‚Äù. I nod, ‚Äúoh y‚Äî‚Äú then both my father and I look at each other with a ü§® look, silently asking each other how we know of the film.
Fast forward to last month, I was finally able to buy it physically‚Äî during the Criterion Collection sale‚Äî primarily off my friend Saif‚Äôs recommendation.
I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have high expectations coming into the film (which I know is dangerous, forgive me), but it absolutely delivered. It‚Äôs performances, it‚Äôs story, it‚Äôs soundtrack, and especially it‚Äôs camerawork, it‚Äôs all so admirable. It wasn‚Äôt what I expected it to be, and I‚Äôm glad.
Benjamin Braddock and his moments of weakness, his mental descent, his inconsistent and contradictory feelings, half of me says ‚Äúit may not be that realistic of a story‚Äù and then the other half of me says ‚Äúif Mrs. Kojo was next to me right now... man... oh man...‚Äù, so yeah, it‚Äôs beautifully told and displays emotions I don‚Äôt feel are captured often.
There‚Äôre specific scenes that have stayed in my mind since the film has ended, but it‚Äôd be criminal of me to give anything away, more than I already have.
After all, the final frame of the film had already been shared quite a lot (like, what‚Äôs your gain out of sharing final frames of movies? I‚Äôm 53 years late... ok? That gives you the right to share any single scene and frame? OK), but I tried my best‚Äî my very best‚Äî to not let it take away from the experience.
I graduated high school in June, a day after my 17th birthday. The feeling of being lost, unsure of what the next step is, doubting I‚Äôll ever build the courage to take a ‚Äúnext step‚Äù, it‚Äôd be shameful of me to say I understand anything I don‚Äôt, but I think I do understand this level of unsureness.

"This was far harder to interpret than I thought it'd be. Looked like a pretty innocent classic rom com or something, but it tosses some serious ideas around amidst an ahead of its time (only sporadically dated) sense of humor.
It's easy to just go with the flow and be all ""oh the bad boy main character gets the girl how sweet"". The first quarter of the movie was a little slow, but then it started to pick up and I really started to like it. I identified with the aimlessness of Ben, and his fear of the future. By the end, when he's running all over trying to get himself out of this mess, I was there with him. I empathized with his melancholy (portrayed mostly through silent sequences with only Simon and Garfunkel music playing) and his search for somebody. At the same time, I also didn't really see the build up in his relationship with Elaine. It was there a little, but I couldn't tell if it was intentionally missing something or not.
It was.
He gets to the Church, beats her father, and runs with her off onto a bus. The iconic second to last shot plays out, and I was expecting it to be overwhelming with emotion... and it kind of was, but questionable sadness rather than joy. They barely know each other. But it's all they both have. The ending could wrap up the entire theme of not knowing what your future is going to be like. Perhaps that's why their relationship lacked development, it thematically relied on them taking a chance, and whether it pans out or not is for them to find out, not us. I actually really liked how this turned out.
Some technical issues, mainly the editing was inconsistent, and the audio editing flat out sucked.
But overall I really liked The Graduate.

"It‚Äôs clever that as much as this is about Benjamin, it‚Äôs about Mrs. Robinson too, the two are basically living separate versions of the same life at different points. 60s college aged kids loved the film since they considered it a satire of everything their parents had stood for and there was finally a film from their point of view about breaking free of the shackles, arriving in cinemas right at the same time the public opinion on the vietnam war was changing. Yet for all the anti-establishment themes the film ostensibly hangs its hat on in the second half, the film is almost seen through Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs eyes, watching as Benjamin and Elaine head down a similar path that led her to becoming the dissatisfied, broken woman that Benjamin only truly gets a glimpse of during that prolonged scene in bed where he insists on having a conversation before sex. Yet despite getting Mrs. Robinson to open up and expose her wounds, he gets offended when she says she doesn‚Äôt want him dating her daughter. He misses the meat of the story, only reacting to what he sees as another oppressive adult. Mrs. Robinson laments the mistakes of the past, resents marrying her husband because he got her pregnant, and doesn‚Äôt want Elaine to make the same mistakes. Yet Benjamin becomes infatuated by the same idealist version of romance his parents fawned over, hence the endless repeating of Scarborough Fair; the same tune playing over and over, the mistakes of the past destined to be made again and again. Mrs. Robinson is the embodiment of what happens after the cut to black at the happy ending of most films, the apex of the final moment of this film when Ben and Elaine‚Äôs fervour dwindles and they have to actually live out the rest of their lives. As Mike Nichols told the kids back in the 60s who asked what happened to Ben and Elaine after the credits rolled: ‚Äúthey become their parents.""",4.5

Esto es una joya del cine americano que amerita muchas referencias a la cultura popular, desde los simpsons hasta Friends entre otros casos. Su direcci√≥n, producci√≥n o incluso el Guion es impecable y no es de extra√±arse ya que fue gracias al incre√≠ble talento de Mike Nichols, Joseph E. Levin & Charles Webb.
Dustin Hoffman y Katharine Ross saltaron a la fama gracias a esta pel√≠cula y debo decir que merec√≠an el Oscar.
Sobre todo ese final me dio tanta risa que lo √∫nico que pude pensar fue en el m√≠tico episodio de los Simpson donde Abe termina perdidamente enamorado de la madre de Marge, un grandioso cl√°sico de los 60s que envejeci√≥ como un vino a√±ejado de sangre de toro.
Definitivamente la Recomiendo, es un cl√°sico del cine americano y del cine mundial, tarde que temprano deber√°s verla, es fabulosa en el sentido anglosaj√≥n de la palabra.
Benjamin finishes college and returns to his parents' house during the holidays. There he can't help but be attracted to Mrs. Robinson, a beautiful middle-aged woman, a friend of his parents.
Wow, I really thought I was going to be disappointed by this movie, but I was wrong. This is a jewel of American cinema that deserves many references to popular culture, from the simpsons to Friends among other cases. Its direction, production or even the Script is impeccable and it is not surprising since it was thanks to the incredible talent of Mike Nichols, Joseph E. Levin & Charles Webb.
Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross rose to fame thanks to this film and I must say they deserved the Oscar.
Especially that ending gave me so much laughter that the only thing I could think of was the mythical episode of the Simpsons where Abe ends up madly in love with Marge's mother, a great classic of the 60s that aged like a wine aged with bull's blood.
I definitely recommend it, it is a classic of American cinema and world cinema, sooner or later you should see it, it is fabulous in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word.

Wow, I can't believe I hadn't seen The Graduate until now.
What a brilliant film, with one of the best soundtracks I've heard (gotta love Simon and Garfunkel) and excellent editing (those cuts with the pool and hotel room scenes were phenomenal). Hoffman is absolutely wonderful as Benjamin Braddock, perfectly portraying the nervousness and anxiety his character feels. Benjamin is a character I hugely related to, I definitely felt for him in those scenes where he's feeling apprehensive about his future, it's a feeling I get everyday to be honest and Hoffman conveyed in such a sincere manner. I have to see more of his films! The great cinematography also really took me by surprise, but the thing I was definitely most pleased with was the amazing social commentary and how its perfectly intertwined into the film. There were also some terrific comedic moments here and there that work really well and make us sympathise even more with Benjamin.
The Graduate has aged beautifully in my opinion and is a timeless coming-of-age story.",4.0
"Although The Graduate was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and resulted in a best director win for Mike Nichols I wasn't very excited to see it. I've put it off for years, and I really only watched it now because I'm trying to get caught up on some of the classics I haven't seen. I've just always felt it wouldn't be my type of thing. Now that I've seen it I kinda still feel that way, but that doesn't mean it's not a solid coming of age comedy. I went in thinking it would be one of those ""classics"" I wouldn't like, but I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.
After recently graduating college Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) finds himself at a party in his honor. Everyone is excited for him and his future, but the problem is he's really concerned about it. He just doesn't know what he wants to do. At this same party is Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). The wife of his father's business partner. Mrs. Robinson finds Benjamin in a room by himself trying to avoid the party guests and asks him for a ride home. After taking her home and reluctantly being invited inside, it becomes obvious Mrs. Robinson is trying to seduce him. Benjamin initially resists, but eventually ends up having an affair with her. It's their secret, but when Benjamin goes on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter at the insistence of his parents and Mr. Robinson, Benjamin falls for her and things get really complicated.
The Graduate is a funny, enjoyable film with quite the reputation. Multiple Oscar nominations and a win for best director. This is where I run into a bit of an issue. It's a good film, but one I don't think is as good as it's reputation suggests. Maybe in the year it was released it was one of the best films I don't know, but I don't think it would get nominated at all in a lot of years. I gotta consider the time it was released I know that, but it's simply a case where I felt sure it's good but not that good. I enjoyed Hoffman's performance, it was funny as advertised, and the story is pretty good. I actually really liked it, but best picture nominee, best actor nominee, best actress nominee? I don't know about all of that. I guess I'd have to see the competition. To me it felt like one of those feel good movies that gets a nomination for best comedy or musical at the Golden Globes (which it won). That makes sense to me.
It's strange, because while I take issue with the awards it was nominated for I didn't dislike it in anyway...well maybe in one way more on that in a bit. Maybe it's because while it was silly and fun I didn't take it seriously enough to think of it as an ""Oscar"" film. I saw it as just a good movie. One I probably won't re-watch anytime soon, but one that is well worth seeing.
The only thing I really disliked was the score. It's comprised of songs written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. I don't have anything against them, (not my type of music) but it was basically the same song over and over again which got old in my opinion. It didn't help that the main song has been used in what seems like a million films. It wasn't a big deal and it didn't ruin the film or anything, I just didn't personally care for it.
Overall The Graduate is a really good film. Had it not been nominated for all the awards I'd probably appreciate it a little more. Sometimes knowing a film is held in such high regard especially an older film can both help and hurt it. Here it hurt it just a little in my opinion. Factoring that in with the fact it's not necessarily my type of thing, I found it satisfying but a little underwhelming. However I would recommend it to just about everyone.",3.5
"a most excellent metaphor for the aimlessness and futile absurdity of existence is the image of a sad young man, fully dressed in scuba gear, slouching despondently at the bottom of a suburban swimming pool during a party he never wanted to attend --- Lord Slaw, an observation while viewing The Graduate (1967)
Benjamin is unsure about his future.
Benjamin, as portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, is a complex character, an aggravating and frustrating character, an enraging character. Hoffman's performance is the biggest reason I'm giving The Graduate (this was my second-ever watch of the iconic film) a full five-star rating. To portray someone so relentlessly irritating, yet have them be compellingly, engagingly watchable, that's a remarkable feat.
Benjamin is a recent college graduate. Coming back home for a graduation party, he is beset by the advice and relentless questioning of his parents and their circle of friends. This scene is filmed in closeup, everybody close to the screen, close to Benjamin, which provides a great sense of unease and discomfort. This early scene is one of the only times I sympathized and empathized with Hoffman's character. Too many people, too close, for too long can be a bit much.
Aimless about his future, Benjamin has an affair with Mrs. Robinson, who is coolly, commandingly, enticingly portrayed by Anne Bancroft. The scenes between her and Hoffman are fantastic: she worldly and in control, he twitchy, sweaty, ill at ease. And I also really enjoyed the scenes between Hoffman and Murray Hamilton, who played Mr. Robinson. Those scenes, both pre- and post-affair discovery, were deeply uncomfortable, Mr. Robinson being a casually domineering presence.
The characters in The Graduate are complex, well-acted, engaging personalities. Their motivations are not necessarily overt, but can be teased out, supposed, from between the lines (or between the sheets). For example, Mrs. Robinson's motivations for initiating the affair, for continuing it after Benjamin calls her ""disgusting,"" and for forbidding him from ever dating her daughter, are not expounded in a thesis statement, but one gets the sense that they may be related to her feeling a sense of entrapment, of loss of relevance. I'm sure multiple other readings are equally valid.
The one character who's motivations I can't quite tease out is Elaine, the Robinson's daughter portrayed by Katharine Ross. Her performance is excellent (all of the performances in The Graduate are excellent). But why Elaine makes the decisions she does, I don't know. I think it's because, like Benjamin she feels pressured and put-upon to make up her mind and decide upon, at a too-young age, her future. On that final-shot bus ride, Elaine and Benjamin's faces are happy. But the shot lingers and the smiles fade a bit. They've escaped, but it looks like they've started thinking about what they're escaping into.
Also loved co-writer Buck Henry as a hotel clerk, and Norman Fell as a landlord who isn't putting up with any weirdos in his boarding house. Marion Lorne and Alice Ghostley, both of whom had recurring roles on TV's Bewitched, have small roles as well.
The Graduate most assuredly deserves its iconic status in film history and lore. It's rich and deep and as rewarding as a good novel.",5.0
"Encore Screening:  if it‚Äôs true that high tide raises all the boats, then Director Mike Nichols 1967 film ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is cinematic proof.
     The film, despite being a difficult project to get to the marketplace, still found a benevolent financier and the resulting effort saw it become the highest grossing film for that year with seven Oscar nominations to its credit.
     Not only did the movie going public benefit with a film that took our minds off the ongoing war in Vietnam, theaters lucky or willing to book it saw their fortunes increase with sold out showings, long lines snaking around blocks of viewers waiting to buy tickets and a film that single handedly saved Embassy Pictures from going under.
     Every studio passing on the project thereby road blocking funding until Joseph E. Levine stepped in to green light it.  Director Nichols the only choice Levine would accept to helm the project.  Nichols casting unknown Dustin Hoffman in the lead actor role working with legendary Oscar winner Anne Bancroft and actress Katherine Ross entering the stratosphere of screen recognition.
     The soundtrack turned down by rising folk artist Janis Ian then developed in a backwards way by plugging in some of the catalogue from folk team Simon And Garfunkel.  Simon encouraged to write new songs for it but too busy touring to do so.  Guess what?  Their music fit the story like a glove and gave their recordings an entirely new level of appreciation.
     Appealing to both the college bound audience as well as the country club set. ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù crossed over and cut through a number of audience demographics.
     The story co-written by Buck Henry, would see him work further with Mike Nichols and Nichols himself would gain respect and notoriety in certain circles with his future films with Avco Embassy.  The company having been purchased by Avco Corp. would see it become a mini major.
     Like the story of ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù or not, you really had to be there when it happened.  The film was nearly a movement.  A crusade for young people not wanting to follow in their parents footsteps and an eye opener for the martini set.
     Hoffman, so perfectly and expressively honest.  Bancroft in stark contrast to her Annie Sullivan role in ‚ÄúThe Miracle Worker‚Äù and Katherine Ross radiantly beautiful as Elaine would go on to steal the hearts of every young man who had dreams of finding the perfect girl.  
     I loved seeing ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù repeatedly at the 1500 seat Colony Theater in Toledo, Ohio with sold out audiences.  I lost count as to how many times I was in attendance.  Later seeing Simon And Garfunkel in concert and hearing them perform the music from the film.

100 Years 212/646
Works as a really good companion piece to High School Musical 3, as both explore transitory periods between youth and adulthood manifesting in confusion and angst due to a lack of preparedness for ""the next step"". There are obviously quite a few points of divergence, notably the overall tone -- this opts for a darkly comedic, and almost constantly awkward tone, while High School Musical 3 leans into an overwhelmingly optimistic exuberance, while still integrating the angst of indeterminacy throughout. That is my main problem with this film -- it goes so heavy on the awkwardness in some scenes that it loses its sincerity(primarily the first hotel scene and the club scene), but this is still very successful overall. Hoffman puts in great work here, and fully sells himself as someone entirely confused and unsure of where he's going, despite his obvious intelligence. He's able to sell some scenes that wouldn't work otherwise(though some are just Too Much, like the ones I previously mentioned), and tie together the emotionality of the film. Probably my favorite component of this film are the accents that are so often employed; it always adds color to each scene that elaborates on Ben's circumstances and emotions -- the Scotch motif particularly strikes me as furthering the idea that all the adults in Ben's life see him as an object rather than a human, and never actually pay attention to his thoughts and feelings. The overall feelings of angst and confusion are all sold very well, and the ridiculous optimism makes it a lovely film as a whole(I suppose this is another point of divergence from the initial comparison as this opts for an absolutely absurd ending, where High School Musical 3 sticks to a more realistic(albeit heightened) ending). All I'm trying to say is that the hype is justified, and I really liked this film.",3.0
"A rather accurate representation of what being in your 20's is like. Chasing things that are really nothings in order to feel something, that's all there is to it. Having passed my last exam just the other day, everyone's been asking me what are my plans for the future. I don't know. Same as Ben.
Despite that little personal anecdote, I watched this mainly because I've been listening to quite a lot of Simon And Garfunkel lately, even put their CD on during lunch and thought to myself how this film has them on the soundtrack and now I'm here.
It's interesting, I was familiar with the premise, but never knew how it resolves itself. I can say that I'm rather happy that I finally watched it and that I rather enjoyed myself.",4.5

As I mentioned, The Graduate was part of a lecture. My first lecture of second year, in fact. The first lecture since returning to university after a summer of pondering whether university was right for me. After tears and panic attacks over moving away from home again. After months of questioning what I was doing, what I was going to do in the future, why I was bothering with anything. After a few weeks of refusing to pack my things and move into the new flat. I watched The Graduate just a few hours after I had snoozed my 7am alarm, cried on the phone to my mum, yelled that I didn't want to be at uni, trudged to the cinema in the rain, and sat alone in the low light making notes about the emergence of New Hollywood and wondering if it was all worth it.
Ben Braddock is drifting. He's confused, hopeless, detached from reality, and finds himself worrying - all the damn time. He's graduated after a series of impeccable achievements at college and now has no real idea what he wants. Post-graduate school? A job? A family? An affair? A pool float and a beer? In an almost constant state of existential crisis, Ben seeks comfort in the arms of other emotionally vulnerable, lonely people. The Graduate is a heartbreaking romantic comedy and a disturbingly relatable commentary on the inner turmoil of disconnected youth. Dustin Hoffman executes a near perfect performance of a young man longing to achieve stability, lose his innocence, seek excitement, and find answers to all his existential questions which play on his mind day after day. The music, of course, is phenomenal and accompanies scenes in this film which are so unique and so perfect it's almost unbelievable. What a privilege it was to be able to watch this film on the big screen.
I'm sitting in my flat now, with my laptop, reflecting on The Graduate. All my flatmates are out at lectures and the melancholy that comes with this film has really set in. Forgive me for being self-indulgent but The Graduate has made me feel some type of way which I haven't allowed myself to feel for some time now.",5.0
"I rarely rewatch films I don't care for, largely because I rarely rewatch films in general. A movie has to be special or captivating to reel me in for multiple viewings. I usually have the mindset that there are so many films I want to see, I have to constantly tread new ground in order to hopefully see them all. On occasion, however, especially if a film is well-loved, I'll give it another try and attempt to see anything I may have missed. Seldom have I been as rewarded by such a rewatch as I was with Mike Nichols 1967 film, The Graduate. Following the point in time in a young man's life that if often aimless, that time immediately following college graduation, Nichols does an exceptional job at conveying the listlessness of spirit once ones expected education level is completed. Caught between deciding between marriage and graduate school while his parent's expectations pressure him, Benjamin finds avoiding the decision as long as possible to be the option he is most content with. Starring Dustin Hoffman, in a breakout role, and the incomparable Anne Bancroft, The Graduate is a thoughtful look at the expectations of others and the soul-searching one has to contend with throughout their lives.
Just home from college after his recent graduation, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is ready to relax after finishing his studies and fill his days by his parent's pool. With no romantic interests or jobs waiting for him, his father pushes him to go to graduate school, and his mother encourages him to go on more dates. Benjamin comes from an upscale neighborhood, and the parents of his friends, all of whom expect him to further his education, wait to hear of a graduate school announcement, all of them except Mrs. Robinson. A friend of his parents, Mrs. Robinson is a beautiful and lonely woman who has a daughter near Benjamin's age. That doesn't stop her from propositioning him and prompting him to ""sow one's wild oats"" while he still has the chance. Surprised and startled by her suggestion, the inexperienced Benjamin attempts to avoid the Robinson's all together before eventually giving in to carrying on a tryst with the family's matriarch. Despite the situation remaining strenuous for Benjamin, as he feels bad for keeping something of this magnitude from his parents, the two carry on both seeming to be fulfilled in some way by the other. As time wears on, and Benjamin seems to be no closer to starting graduate school or getting married, his parents set him up with none other than the Robinson's daughter. This clearly throws a wrench into the lives of both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, leaving the former no other choice but to begin making some decisions about his life.
Perhaps, part of the reason that I didn't initially like The Graduate when I first watched it, is because I don't care for Dustin Hoffman. I can almost never get beyond him to enjoy the characters he creates. Interestingly, Hoffman was initially going to pass on an audition for the film because he was already committed to playing Leo Bloom in the Mel Brooks production, The Producers. So certain that he wouldn't be selected in the role as the suitor of his wife, Anne Bancroft, Mel Brooks released Dustin Hoffman to audition for The Graduate. As much as I may have enjoyed this more the first time with someone besides Hoffman in the lead role, I'm of course thrilled that this paved the way for Gene Wilder's first strong screen role in THe Producers. I appreciated Hoffman's performance much more this time around, as he seemed to embody the character of someone uncomfortably trying to make their way through life, seemingly unsure of anything.
The Graduate begins where Say Anything...ends. Cameron Crowe's excellent directorial debut features a high school senior unsure of what direction to take his life after graduation. The Graduate begins with a long take on a young man with no direction who has just finished college, as he took the route that was expected of him. In my mind, a cinematic universe exists where Lloyd Dobler and Benjamin Braddock are the same person, endlessly wandering through life aimlessly. I anxiously anticipate a post-marriage sequel, perhaps dealing with the pitfalls of a dead-end job or unfulfilling career, I'm flexible. The soundtrack of Graduate is sensational, made up of Simon & Garfunkel songs, perfectly accompanying the mood of Benjamin Braddock. The film was also shot in a powerful way, with Benjamin's face, and the faces of those he communicates with, often obstructed excellently symbolizing the many things that hinder his life and complicate his decision-making.
The character introduction of Mrs. Robinson is beautifully communicated thanks to Anne Bancroft. Embodying the perfect balance of unattainable eminence and fragile regret, Bancroft perfectly exposes both aspects of her character. Making herself at home in Benjamin's room where he retreated to for a moment of quiet introspection, Mrs. Robinson shows her strength and control over the situation. It is instantly clear to see that she knows exactly how her relationship with Benjamin is going to play out. She seems to feed off of his discomfort, never being setback by his initial refusal of her advances. Mrs. Robinson's character is fully fleshed out. She is disappointed in herself for giving up everything she wanted in exchange for the chains of matrimony and motherhood. Benjamin isn't the only one searching for something in life. Mrs. Robionson, who finds her motherly duties nearly complete as her daughter prepares to attend college, and her duties as a wife often ignored by her husband who seems to always be inexplicably absent from their residence. Her character, in conjunction with Benjamin's, goes to show that, as human beings, we are always searching for something just beyond our grasp, and no amount of seeming contentment ever really puts an end to that search.",4.5

"This was another recommendation and overall, I really enjoyed it. This is my first time seeing Dusting Hoffman in a movie and his performance was great. He sold every emotion he needed to and just gave a great performance.
Another thing the movie does great is making you feel the isolation of the main character. The movie does that in a couple of ways with one of the more unique ways is putting him in spaces where he feels very small in comparison to the overall size of the place.
The music by Simon and Garfunkel also compliments this feeling very well with their style of music. I do have an issue with the use of the songs though as I think the movie used the music a bit too much and they used the same few songs which didn't really help. It kind of became repetitive towards the end while in the beginning it really helped to set the tone of the scene.
I still liked this movie overall and even though I don't think it's as great as some other people think, I still very much enjoyed it.",4.0

"It‚Äôs probably not a stretch to suggest that most people feel a bit disoriented and aimless after college. Sure, some folks have their whole lives mapped out from graduation to retirement, if not their funeral already. But leaving behind the campus of your university, a quasi-Utopia disconnected from the real world that allows you to figure out who you are in a microcosm behind closed doors, is intimidating. Up to that point, Benjamin Braddock, withdrawn, sullen and clueless, is a relatable protagonist. As we see in the opening, he is nothing but a pedestrian on the slowly moving walkway of life. He has no idea where he is headed and certainly isn‚Äôt eager to pick a direction himself. Covering the film‚Äôs gorgeous symbolism could fill an entire academic paper, but this sequence, accompanied by Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù stuck with me as a beautifully poetic encapsulation of what ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is all about. 
It‚Äôs probably also not a stretch to suggest that very few recent college graduates find a release for their bottled up frustration by starting an affair with the middle-aged wife of their father‚Äôs business partner. Benjamin‚Äôs panicky accusation: ‚ÄúMrs. Robinson, you‚Äôre trying to seduce me‚Äù, complemented by a perfect camera shot through said lady‚Äôs alluringly positioned legs has become shorthand for the absurdity of this premise, and even though this is one of the most universally agreed upon American classics of the late 60s, I was skeptical it would translate well into 2019. It doesn‚Äôt. But damn is it still hilarious! There is so much wrong with everything that transpires here that you can‚Äôt help but laugh at it. Mike Nichols, who won a well-deserved Oscar for his directing here, makes choices in every scene that overdramatize the situations and dial up the awkwardness and second embarrassment even further than what is already achieved by his actors. 
Anne Bancroft, only seven years Hoffman‚Äôs senior, but carrying herself with the weariness of a markedly more mature woman, marvelously finds the balance between poised seductress and excruciatingly bored wife who is thrilled that some fresh meat walked into her den. But Hoffman, who at times seems just as tongue-tied and socially inept here as his future career-defining role Raymond Babbitt, lays the groundwork for why he is generally deemed one of the greatest leading men of his generation. That includes a particularly hysterical scene of him repeatedly banging his head against the wall that was improvised on the spot. He is pitiable and pathetic, but also comfortable being a total weirdo in the second half and the drastic change in behavior is both jarring and admirable to see pulled off so effortlessly by a young master of his craft. 
When Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter Elaine returns home from Berkeley for the summer, Ben starts to take an interest in her, even though her mother made it abundantly clear to him that such a relationship was never to happen. His parents force the issue and send him on a date with Elaine, during which he behaves like a total jackass and erases practically any of the goodwill he might still have left. It‚Äôs a humiliating scene that exposes him as a selfish jerk, whose perpetual moping covers up his elitist upbringing that has taught him that he is better than everyone else and that he can get away with anything. Even if he makes it a point to distance himself from his parents, he is still very much his father‚Äôs son in that regard. The 1960s were an era of free-spirited souls seizing the day and gleefully giving the previous generation the middle finger. I‚Äôm struggling to think of a climax in any film of the era that finds a more fitting metaphor for this battle than ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù.",4.5

You can see how influential this is for sure. There‚Äôs a bit of Wes Anderson with its humour and tone. The whole concept is obviously reminiscent of what we now know as the coming of age genre, and even more direct influences like its impact on pop culture.

"The Graduate is one of the finest character studies ever created. Benjamin Braddock is an insanely relatable character for myself (and I imagine most young males) with his cynicism, resentment for people who act as if they're doing something nice when really they're being more selfish than you can imagine, awkward demeanor and most of all his complete lack of any kind of future goals or dreams. The film starts off by introducing him as a great, layered character with an uncertain future and takes him full circle throughout the course of the remarkable story. At first it seems like a top notch version of the typical story of a man not knowing what he wants to do with his life and then finding love and doing whatever he can to achieve it. Which is all well and good and still incredibly made, but pretty typical.
It seems like it's going to end on a high note of bliss, with Braddock and his love literally fighting their way out of her wedding to another man (re: a tool) and running away together, happy in love. Then in the last second it slips back into that state of despair with a blank, hopeless look from the master of acting that is Dustin Hoffman and the return of the film's recurring use of the heartbreaking Simon & Garfunkel song ""The Sound of Silence"". Braddock fought for his love and attained what he thought was going to make his life worth living but once he finally gets it he realizes that his life is still empty and he's gained nothing from this whole whirlwind of a journey. Groundbreaking cinema. They really just don't make them like this anymore.",5.0

"It's so easy to be cynical about films that define a generation, especially when that generation is the boomers. When that generation has been grist for the pop cultural mill for decades (shout out to casey on that point). Hoffman: the ""face of a generation"" Hmmm, yes: ""If that generation had a face like a slapped arse!"" I hear you retort, and fair enough. But who is Ben Braddock if not his generation's Donnie Darko? His generation's, oh - I dunno, Ol' Man River in My Own Private Idaho perhaps? Sad boys are sexy I guess. I mean, I certainly pinned my hopes on that assumption throughout my late teens and early 20s, though come to think, it never really worked out for me so mayb-no, no, nevermind - Hollywood definitely wants us to know that sad boys are sexy.
There's also something fundamentally boomer about claiming the cultural space - about succeeding and seceding from the previous generation by literally fucking them, not really enjoying it and then running off with their daughter and not knowing whether that was the right decision either. Just keep on taking until you can figure out what to do with all the stuff you've amassed. Every outgoing generation likes to think of their kids as entitled brats anyway, but I keep coming back to Donnie (OK, not My Own Private River - he was sad but not middle class enough), or heck - even Timothe√© Chalamet's Paul in Dune: Little Lord Emoroys who'll no doubt grow up to become masters of the universe. It's cyclical - it will keep happening until it's 10,191 on the planet Caladan.
Funny then that Nichols and May made almost the same film in this and The Heartbreak Kid, or at least films with the same selfish arsehole at their centre who doesn't know what he wants but gets it anyway. Because of course the generational meta-narrative needs to be about getting what you want even though you're not totally sure you want it. Because it's better to have it and not want it than to be a sucker with nothing, right? Right!?
*sigh*
Take a deep breath. It's not their fault their parents were emotionally distant veterans and alcoholics. It's not their fault they came of age in the greatest period of sustained economic prosperity and cultural progress in the twentieth century. Every generation has its crosses to bear and every generation thinks that sad boys are sexy. At least Mike Nichols was in on the joke even if generation after generation falls for it.

"This has always been a favorite of mine, but like few other films, I feel it more and more profoundly with each watch.
Simon and Garfunkel are one of my favorite artists. Since this movie relies heavily on their music, it would be hard for me not to love it. Yes, it repeats the same songs a lot, but I find that it actually works to great effect.
Besides the stellar soundtrack, The Graduate is one of the most iconic and culturally important films of its time. Its huge status and the countless references to it might diminish its perception, but it actually lives up to all of the talk; even surpassing expectations. It's surprisingly timeless and endlessly funny.
Dustin Hoffman is perfect in this film. I love Ben Braddock a lot more than I probably should. His awkward politeness, aloof and anxious attitude, and spontaneity are perfectly written and superbly acted. He can seem somewhat exaggerated but it just feels so right.
I could go on, but what I feel so strongly about with this film is its timeless portrayal of a young man with no direction, and with little help from the adults in his life. Do I savor my youth or plan for the future?

We could talk about so much in this film. We could talk about the dulcet tones of Simon and Garfunkel, and how their crooning melodies lend a nostalgic romanticism to the vagaries of young adulthood. We could talk about the purposeful cinematography - how each obfuscated view, each calculated visual sweep - compounds on the nerves, the indecision, the manipulative edge in the narrative.
We could talk about the stellar performances, how you could see Robinson hold back tears on her first date, how Bancroft coyly slithers her way around her prey, how Hoffman basically sleepwalks through the first two acts of the film only to have each weak impulse reveal itself in his confidence. And that's just what I could think of off the top of my head. There's just such a strong, clear voice to this entire thing that makes for captivating cinema. But that's not what kept my attention for so long.
When I realised that Bancroft was trying to do, my eyes were immediately glued to the screen. I was hyper-aware that Hoffman - young, inexperienced, and rudderless - is about to have his entire life changed. He's about to find purpose, the first domino in his life about to tumble over into the mother of all metaphorical Rube Goldberg machines. And it's almost like he knows it. He becomes more brash, careless, self-absorbed as his life goes from strength to strength.
I want that life for myself. I don't want to do any internal work. I don't want the burden of having to commit to something sensible, strategic or safe. I want my life to be a whirlwind of decisions where I follow my whims without any consequences, where everything works out for me, where I get to prove that I could pave my own way and I didn't have to follow whatever rules anyone else thought I should follow. But then, as I listen to the same four Simon and Garfunkel songs play on a loop, I realise that this whole thing is solipsistic and delusional, and even though this is a nice fantasy, it's not a sentiment I would be proud to build a life on.",5.0

One of the most powerful and amazing films of all time. The Graduate has taught me more about editing than any other film, so slick and revolutionary. Every performance is just iconic and once paired with the quick and cutting-edge dialogue adds layer after layer of content. A brilliant look at the pressure and tribulations of a changing culture.

"Ahhh Mike Nichols The Graduate was so much more than I expected.
From the beginning we are introduced to a somewhat confusing young man named Ben played by a very entertaining Dustin Hoffman. Uncertain about his future after graduating school has Ben nervous, and not being able to quite focus on anything even if it's spelled out for him.
When Ben (Hoffman) is lured by Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft) for a ride home after a party the intensions, and mood of the film shift to utter seduction from the much older family friend Mrs. Robinson as she wants to have her way with the young Ben.
The Graduate at times touching, at times funny was a splendid film in showcasing the extreme talents of a young Dustin Hoffman, and that of the director Mike Nichols.
A film I won't soon forget, and wished I would have seen much sooner.",4.5
"One of the most brilliant coming-of-age stories ever told. A film that genuinely understands how to use dry humor efficiently, whilst also delivering a plethora of extremely important themes such as loneliness, anxiety, and making your own decisions despite being against your own will.
Dustin Hoffman could not have been a more perfect casting for the character of Benjamin, a very introverted and secluded human being that represents what the film is trying to convey to the audience. While being as funny as he is awkward, his line delivery and mannerisms could not have been more appropriate for every scene where he is present. As for the supporting cast, everyone on display does more than enough to satisfy.
The soundtrack has immediately become one of my favorites in all of film, every song that is played does its job by setting the tone for each scene, and oh man, the cinematography, truly remarkable. During every frame that was shown right in front of me, I was marveling over how well-shot it was. 
If you couldn‚Äôt tell already, I loved this film, I will continue to love it for as long as I can forsee, and I can already sense an endless amount of rewatches down the line. Incredible.",4.5

"I first watched The Graduate back in 2017, and I thought it was pretty good. Now, in 2020, with a much more developed and keen eye for film, as well as being the same age as the protagonist and only being a year away from graduation, I have definitely fallen for the film a lot harder, as its brilliant film-making and now-resonant themes really stuck out on this watch. The editing is very inventive, impressively and smoothly-executed, purposeful and fun, and the cinematography is fantastic, with lots of impressively well directed long takes, good framing, blocking, lighting etc. throughout. The soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel captures the emotional flavour of the film's content very effectively and beautifully. The script and performances do a great job of being very comedic and fun while staying grounded in the melancholic emotional core of the film, which reflects the confusion, sadness, desperation and existential crises of this age incredibly well.
Its a great picture!

"The most pleasant thing is walking into your class expecting a lecture and instead watching The Graduate. Heard someone after the movie saying they ""hated"" this movie because Mrs. Robinson was a bad person. Ugh- guys the people I do to film school with are so dense. I can't freaking stand it. Like please watch a movie and realize not all the characters need to be heroes and there doesn't need to be car crashes and explosions to keep you engaged. You are in film school for petes sake time to broaden your horizons and realize movies just about people and their messy relationships are just as (actually usually more) compelling than your blockbusters.
Sorry had to get that off my chest I just really dislike most of my classmates.
This is a movie about a bunch of lost souls. Mrs. Robinson is a despicable character, but growing up you realize Ben is maybe even worse then she is. His naive worldview gets the best of him. His feeling of desperation and isolation leads him into a world of sin and lust. This is what several of us have to struggle with when we feel like we genuinely have nothing to do left or anything to feel.
After graduating High School, I felt the same pains Ben did. I felt like I was being pushed towards a future that maybe at the time I didn't really want. I didn't want to enter the work force or join the rat race. I wanted to continue to see my friends everyday and run around and have fun. Yet, life there are changes and to The Smashing Pumpkins, ""The more you change the less you feel.""
We try to keep ourselves interested and excited, just for a moment to feel something new. This movie is a cautionary tale about the breaking point of that idea, to morally bankrupt yourself for the moment of exhilaration you desire. Gosh, it's such a funny movie. A really uncomfortable one and the way Mike Nichols frames all his shots and gets every single line of dialogue perfectly timed is just ingenious. Despite the questionable decisions every character makes here- they are just all so fascinating and the movie is just so entertaining you want to see what happens next.
The way the ending of this movie is framed is brilliant. Spoilers if you haven't seen the ending of The Graduate. Okay- look I know I could mark this review for spoilers but who doesn't know the ending of The Graduate?
The ending of The Graduate is not a happy one. A lot of people (including Roger Ebert) find the ending of this movie questionable because Ben gets what he wants with no true consequence. I think that final moment gives us all we need to know though. Ben and his decisions will haunt him forever, and his nihilistic view of the world will always get in the way of him and his relationship. Him and Elaine are two broken people who will never be whole. Will they be as happy as they can be? Who knows. However- the course of this film shows that they will never truly be happy, which is what makes The Graduate a cautionary tale overall.
Anyways, this is an incredible movie. If you love movies and have never seen The Graduate, please just go on Netflix and watch it right now.",4.5

"The Graduate kommt auf meine Top 50+ Liste. Soviel steht schon mal fest.
Man merkt einfach wie der Film die Generationen dieser Zeit beeinflusst hat. Nur bei Ferris mach Blau und Zur√ºck in die Zukunft hatte ich ein √§hnliches Gef√ºhl.
Mein Dad ist das perfekte Beispiel daf√ºr ist mir im Laufe des Films aufgefallen. Eines seiner Lieblingsauto ist der gezeigte Alfa Spider und noch Heute h√∂rt er fast Jeden Tag den genialen Simon & Garfunkel Soundtrack und zitiert ab und an Dustin Hoffmans Figur.
Filme die den Zeitgeist auf solche Weise beeinflussen haben bei mir einen besonderen Stellenwert. Auch die Handlung war f√ºr das Jahr 1967 ziemlich revolution√§r. Ein Mann der eine Beziehung mit einer √§lteren verheirateten Frau eingeht war zu dieser Zeit nicht allt√§gige Filmkost.
Zudem hat mir gefallen wie unsperrig der Film trotz seines Alters wirkte. Die lustige Szenen haben im Laufe der Zeit nicht ihren Witz verloren und die Handlungen der Charaktere sind immer noch genauso nachvollziehbar.
Zudem hat der Film eben auch wie Ferris macht blau eine gewisse Leichtigkeit, welche den aktuellen Coming of Age Filmen (in diese Kategorie w√ºrde ich den Film noch am ehesten einordnen) leider oft fehlt.
Visuell ist the graduate oder auf deutsch die Reifepr√ºfung einfach nur Genial. Einer der sch√∂nsten und handwerklich besten die ich je gesehen habe. Es werden Winkel und Zoomeinstellungen perfekt genutzt um Gef√ºhle und Emotionen zu transportieren und die Einstellungen (besonders bei seinen Fahrten zur Berkeley Uni) sind unglaublich sch√∂n. Untermalt mit dem Soundtrack von Simon & Garfunkel wirklich perfekt.

"Watching 'The Graduate' feels like one of those dreams when the bad guys are ever-encroaching while you just lie there paralyzed.
There was NO WAY that the first two acts wouldn't come to a head in the most inconceivably catastrophic way imaginable.

"Movie #1 of Extra Credit Film Club FALL 2018
‚ÄúMy whole life is just a waste... it‚Äôs just nothing.‚Äù
I am already in my junior year of college and I honestly feel just as lost and nervous as the main character is after graduating from college. It is scary to know that in just a few years, I will be in the same position as Ben is here. To relieve of the stress, I always turn to film and try enjoy the most out of it, whether it is good or bad. I am very happy and grateful that my history teacher has given us extra credit assignments where we can watch these films and write reflections on them and how the reflected the time period. The Graduate, staring a very young Dustin Hoffman, is the first of these films that we are watching... and frankly it is one of the most entertaining and interesting films I have seen in years.
First of all, it is gutbustingly funny and it used very subtle humor to get the message across. It didn‚Äôt need to be loud and obnoxious, but clever and sarcastic. Beyond that, it has terrific performances, fantastic characters, a vastly engaging story for a rom-com, powerful messages about adolescence and finding your own identity, perfect chemistry between the main characters, and THE greatest soundtrack to a film I have ever heard. I still cannot get these songs out of my head. Also, there is this one amazing scuba diving scene that I believe represents this film pretty well. It pretty much symbolizes what happens to Ben in the film. The last thing I want to mention is that I love the way this film was shot. There are many dramatic angles that show the purpose of the scenes within this film. There is not a single dull shot in this movie. I never thought a film like this would make me think about my future as much as it does. Although I am pretty sure that I will not get into an affair with my childhood friends, wife that is a good 8 years older than me.
The Graduate is an amazing film with thought provoking themes, hilarious comedy, and beautiful cinematography. It is crazy that this was made over fifty years ago.

"Mit ""Bonnie and Clyde"" der Pionier des von mir immer wieder in den Himmel gelobten New Hollywood-Kinos.
""The Graduate"" (Deutsch: ""Die Reifepr√ºfung"") ist einer der ikonischsten Dramedys √ºberhaupt. Dieser Film hat bei mir schon seit einer ganzen Weile das Interesse geweckt und da ich generell offen f√ºr Filme mit Dustin Hoffman, war dieses Ding hier ganz oben auf meiner Liste.
Regie f√ºhrte Mike Nichols und dieser Mann d√ºrfte manchen Leuten bekannt sein, die Filme wie ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" oder ""Working Girl"" kennen. Tats√§chlich handelt es sich hier um sein insgesamt zweites Werk nach seinem Oscar-Elefanten ""WIAOVW"".
Es ist kaum zu glauben, was f√ºr einen unglaublichen Start er hingelegt hat und dennoch namentlich so gut wie keinen Nachhall erschuf. Naja, wenn man so sich ansieht, was er in den sp√§teren Jahren inszeniert hat, dann wundert es einen eher weniger, aber konzentrieren wir uns auf seine fr√ºhe, goldene Phase.
Die Hauptrolle namens Benjamin Braddock wird von Dustin Hoffman √ºbernommen, der mit einer fantastischen Leistung den gesamten Film tr√§gt, wobei er selbst den Film eher weniger tr√§gt, er wird getragen. Sonst w√ºrde seine Figur √ºber diesen Zeitraum einen Leerlauf durchgehen.
In den Nebenrollen brillieren ebenso die verf√ºhrerische Anne Bancroft als Mrs. Robinson, die mit einer ungreifbaren Aura den noch heranwachsenden Benjamin in einer Aff√§re lockt, weil es mit dem Mann nicht funktioniert und die Scheidung schon vor der T√ºr steht. Ach so, Mr. Robinson wird von Murray Hamilton verk√∂rpert, den die meisten wohl als B√ºrgermeister Vaughan aus ""Jaws"" kennen d√ºrften. Die Tochter der Mrs. Robinson wird von Katharine Ross gespielt, auch eine Frau, die an der Seite von vielen Legenden spielen durfte.
Benjamin verliebt sich begrenzt in Mrs. Robinson, aber dann macht er Bekannschaft mit ihrer Tochter, die er niemals heiraten darf, aus welchen Gr√ºnden auch immer. Aber das spielt keine Rolle, weil der Film, seine Kamerafahrten, sein Soundtrack und die Schauspieler brillieren auf vielen Ebenen. Wer Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" kennt und die Opening Credits genauso abfeiert wie ich, dann hat man hier den Ursprung des Ganzen. Perfekt kopiert, w√ºrde ich sagen.
Es ist kein Zufall, dass die Figur von Anne Bancroft Mrs. Robinson hei√üt. Sp√§testens diejenigen, die 2019 ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" gesehen haben, d√ºrften den musikalisch und stimmlich himmlischen Song ""Mrs. Robinson"" von Simon & Garfunkel kennen. Daraus entstand dieser sehr oft zitierte Song. Auch das Volkslied ""Scarborough Fair"" wurde f√ºr den Film von den Duo gecovert. Und nat√ºrlich darf nicht ""The Sound of Silence"" fehlen, der den Anfang, das Ende und eine in die Geschichte eingegangene Einstellung im Pool markiert. Diese drei Szenen haben einen k√ºnstlerischen Hintergrund, noch mehr als alles andere an diesem Film. Die inszenatorisch besten Aspekte werden eben von diesen drei Szenen dargestellt. Ansonsten wirkt der ganze Film sehr hochwertig produziert und sorgt f√ºr viele komische und bittere Momente, die zum einen Probleme der Heranwachsenden thematisieren, zum anderen aber auch die Mutterrolle auf den Kopf stellen. Gedreht wurde der Film auf Panavision, sozusagen der Nachfolger f√ºr den damals ausgelutschten Cinemascope, der trotzdem noch heute genial ist.
Es gibt auch eine Szene bzw. eine kleine, aber feine √úberblende, die ist mir echt positiv aufgefallen. Und zwar, wenn Dustin Hoffman an einem Brunnen wartet und er ganz alleine da sitzt und die √úberblende einen gef√ºllten Platz aus der Ferne zeigt. Eine tolle Entscheidung, die Benjamins unaussch√∂pfliche Sehnsucht abbildet. Wenn es um kreatives Dialogschreiben geht, dann gibt es auch diese, wenn Benjamin mit seinen eigenen Eltern √ºber das Thema ""Heirat"" spricht.
Dennoch ist die Message trotz der teilweise genialen Symbolik etwas blass geraten und der Film vermittelt eher mehr die Unterhaltung dieser Dramedy. Aber die Unterhaltung ist selbstverst√§ndlich nicht kritiserbar.
""The Graduate"" ist ein ausgesprochen toller Beginn f√ºr diese unvergessliche Zeit im US-amerikanischen Kino.

"Hmmm... Mon sujet de doc devrait √™tre: comment Dustin Hoffman a embourgeois√©, d√©radicalis√© le Method Acting pour tuer la star et ins√©rer le vide dans le cin√©ma contemporain. C'est assez √©vident ici, o√π l'incapacit√© de Dustin √† communiquer, ses balbutiements et ses h√©sitations, sont plus importants que ce qu'il aurait √† communiquer s'il parvenait √† le faire. Parce qu'en r√©alit√©, son personnage est absolument vide, et il n'aurait rien √† dire m√™me s'il pouvait parler, contrairement √† Dean ou Brando o√π les m√™me mani√©rismes servaient √† exprimer une singularit√©, une diff√©rence, qui faisait √©clater les normes. L√†, Dustin est incompris, mais c'est juste parce que les adultes sont des caricatures d'idiots ; lui-m√™me n'a aucune conviction, aucune volont√©, aucune forme d'int√©riorit√©, outre celle de vouloir du sexe de temps en temps. Rien √† d√©fendre, et quand il n'appara√Æt pas idiot, il est juste un vrai trou d'cul (il n'y a vraiment aucune raison pour se sauver avec lui √† la fin). En ce sens, Rain Man est le r√¥le d'une vie, son r√¥le le plus honn√™te: pas (ou peu) d'int√©riorit√©, juste des mani√©rismes qui valent en eux-m√™mes. M√™me dans All the President's Men, √† y repenser, les personnages n'ont aucune vie personnelle, que du travail, toujours le travail, comme Dustin n'est rien d'autre qu'un acteur que l'on voit travailler pour nous convaincre.
Ann Bancroft, Mrs Robinson, est le seul vrai personnage du film, dont l'assurance, la grandeur, l'honn√™tet√© envers soi-m√™me en fait une star dans le sens le plus noble du terme, condamn√©e √† la d√©ch√©ance dans ce monde de merde que Dustin embrasse alors m√™me qu'on essaie de nous faire croire qu'il se sent √† part. Dans Marathon Man, c'est encore une star, Laurence Olivier, que Dustin devra vaincre pour s'assurer un avenir et r√©tablir le statu quo (dans les deux cas la notion d'avenir est utilis√©e de fa√ßon assez ironique d'ailleurs). C'est une dr√¥le de chose, que ton personnage-type soit un coll√©gien/universitaire impuissant, qui doit conqu√©rir sa masculinit√© parce qu'on s'entend les gars de lettres c'est pas tr√®s tr√®s masculin, c'est g√™n√© pis toutte (il est assez puant id√©ologiquement Dustin, je redoute de revoir Straw Dogs, et j'imagine que Kramer vs Kramer sera assez terrible).
Bref, ce serait un beau prequel au m√©moire sur Tom Cruise, puisque Risky Business s'inspire largement de The Graduate, jusqu'√† reprendre l'image de Dustin avec ses lunettes fum√©es et sa clope. Mais l'ami Tom, √©videmment, n'est pas une coquille vide, et il faudrait relire tout Rain Man, o√π Dustin est la figure paternelle, comme une tentative de ramener la star √† Hollywood et r√©v√©ler comment la M√©thode peut devenir une M√©thode qui n'exprime rien d'autre qu'elle-m√™me (comme quand on mange du foie cru ou qu'on gagne et perd du poids parce qu'on veut des prix, esti que c'est con pareil). Et cette th√®se s‚Äôappelerait : Dear boy, have you try acting?, en l‚Äôhonneur d‚ÄôOlivier, et je me trouverais bien dr√¥le.
Faque le film est correct pendant une heure, mais √ßa devient platte en maudit quand Ann Bancroft dispara√Æt, et je suis pas s√ªr de comprendre pourquoi c'est si r√©put√©, √† part que c'est bien film√©. Et encore l√†, la mise en sc√®ne de Nichols est √† la Nouvelle Vague ce qu'Hoffman est √† Brando ou Dean, faque c'est assez puant aussi comme film. Ou juste cynique, mais √ßa me fait chier le cynisme faque √ßa revient au m√™me. Je vais me garder une p'tit g√™ne pour la note et pas √™tre trop b√™te, parce que c'est assez dr√¥le par moments, mais c'est certainement pas g√©nial.",3.5

Like a Wes Anderson movie that's all the good things about a Wes Anderson movie and none of the bad. It takes all the immature frustrations and yearnings of youth, sexual and existential, and stays true to them, which explains giving us a narrative that's slightly more wish-fulfillment than it really is (the guy Anne Bancroft would sleep with is a jock or a wealthy businessman, not Dustin Hoffman, let's be real), but still hits us with the ramifications of the pursuit of hedonistic instincts and ego-nourishments that baby boomers substituted for real purpose enough that the film is neither over-indulgent nor is reduced to didacticism and moralism.
I don't know. This was really fucking awesome. Top to bottom. Extremely hilarious. Never boring. Although there's too many Simon and Garfunkel needle drops for my taste (one is too many for me). But I found this just so captivating. I thought a film with the title ""The Graduate"" would reduce itself to empty symbolisms, but this doesn't. All the characters are fucking real and interesting and confused and alienated just the same, and they're all caught up in a web of mistakes and consequences. Even the daughter in the end makes her first and only mistake, but the last shot of the film where they both stop smiling is really directorially intelligent and awesome and made me appreciate the entire movie even more.
No wonder this is considered an American masterpiece... it really is.",4.5

Criterion Spine #800
Viewing two. I've seen enough now to be convinced that The Graduate is a bona fide classic. The opening says it all. That brilliant shot of Braddock's head in the porcelain background. Zooming out we see he is on an airplane. That scene is referenced in different acts. It is such a cool narrative lynchpin. But how about that clown art in the Braddock home?
""I'm a little upset about my future.""
The first time Braddock enters the Robinson home, he talks to Mr. Robinson in the bar. The men are backlit. Mrs. Robinson is visible in the background as she descends the stairs. Braddock drinks scotch after requesting brandy, served from a colonial Egyptian coffin flask. This scene convinced me that the lighting of the The Graduate would be no joke. 50 Shades, take notes.
""Are you here for an affair, sir?""
Mrs. Robinson enters the Taft Hotel and we see her upside down reflection in the emerald cocktail table. This woman is reverting Braddock's world, and distorting it too‚Äî which is so tastefully shown when Braddock looks up at the Robinsons from the family pool as drops of water and sun obscure his vision. Mrs. Robinson unbuttoning Braddock like a child. The sleek white of the hotel room referencing the white of the opening shot. That moment when Braddock is shaving and it is not clear to the viewer where he is. His Mom comes in asking where he goes from midnight to noon every day, and she looks like Mrs. Robinson. Uncanny.
""Wood or wire?""
Nichols and Surtees so brilliantly calculated every precise moment of this film. It has to be one the best shot films I have ever seen, if not the best. The phallic candle's reflection in the Taft Hotel room, present on the film's poster. Another shot referencing the opening when the jig is up. We see Mrs. Robinson wearing an emerald nightgown, and then the camera pans out to the white background of the family home. Just like the beginning.
Moe's Books. How the camera tracks Braddock as he stalks Elaine to UC Berkeley. Intimate and in his face, then a wide angle shot of the whole campus, Braddock only a speck of its magnitude. Braddock's behavior is cancel worthy in today's times, but the film isn't. Yes, he is a creep, but Nichols is not condoning his actions. If I have any critique of The Graduate it is that Elaine acquiescing to Braddock's advances feels very ""woman written by man,"" but the ending is so brilliant that I left the film more in awe than anything else. In fact, I had a tear in my eye.
The Graduate is resonating with me more right now as I am a recent grad school graduate finding my place in the world, but as much as I love the story, the craft is my favorite thing about the film. Well, the screenplay, acting, editing, and directing are pretty damn special too. A new favorite movie of mine? It is up there.

"WATCHLIST 
Movies I'm Embarrassed I've Never Seen Before
Clearly I‚Äôm in the mood to watch classic and older movies recently as this is yet another pre-2000s watch! This evening was The Graduate, Mike Nichols‚Äô Best Director-winning romance drama, starring a young Dustin Hoffman, and among the candidates for several of the other leading nominations in 1968. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) has just graduated from college, but now he doesn't seem to know what to do with his life. His parents are not of much help, being more interested in climbing the social ladder and having him help them along as the perfect, dutiful son. Enter Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), an old family friend, with whom Ben begins an affair to relieve some of his inner anxiety; as well Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross) who he also starts a relationship with. 
The Graduate could be seen as a romantic comedy. The plot itself, if a bit heavy, especially for its time, is lighthearted enough and the character archetypes on display are such that the jokes practically write themselves. Yet a dark undercurrent floats just beneath the surface, transforming the whole thing into a scathing satire. The song The Sound of Silence, by Simon & Garfunkel, is often played over central scenes, almost functioning as the theme for the whole film. And anyone who has ever heard the song knows that it's rather dark in its message, despite the light melody. ""Hello darkness, my old friend"" indeed.
What this film is trying to talk about is being trapped in a circle from which you cannot escape. Ben's character gets progressively worse as the movie goes on, but you cannot really blame him, not entirely. You can see from his parents and from Mrs. Robinson and her husband that he's merely imitating the sins of the last generation. It's easy to see that he and Elaine could very easily end up just as shallow and empty as their parents. It wouldn't take much. And that's the horror behind the usual rom-com antics.
A peculiar film. It requires you to look underneath the surface, to question the events that are taking place. And for that it needs to be praised. I‚Äôm now discovering this was Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs breakthrough role, and a commendable one I will admit.",3.5
"It‚Äôs hard to put into words how much this film means to me.
This is the best directing ever put it film. It‚Äôs so rich of symbolism and clever camera techniques that make the story so much more engrossing and beautiful. For example the camera frames Benjamin as either too close and claustrophobic or too far and spaced out. It really helps to reel in this feeling of loneliness and confusion that he is feeling throughout the film.
If you haven‚Äôt seen it even if you think you might not like it, please consider giving this a try. I think everyone that is even remotely into film should see it immediately.",5.0

"The Graduate se sinti√≥ como ver dos pel√≠culas en una, la primera siendo un coming-of-age sobre la incertidumbre de la adultez y los efectos del despertar sexual, mientras que la otra como una cinta de terror donde un psic√≥pata manipula a una mujer bajo una promesa rom√°ntica con todas las de fallar. Pero como quiera que se le vea, ¬°No mames, que tremenda pel√≠cula! Me ha parecido una maravilla, atrevida, arriesgada. Ver la evoluci√≥n del personaje de Benjamin es una locura, el como poco a poco las tentaciones y su enferma percepci√≥n del amor lo hacen perder su decencia y timidez es algo alarmante de ver, y es que sin dudarlo este es un relato tramposo que te hace empatizar con su protagonista para de la nada convertirlo en un monstruo, y a m√≠ me ha dejado tan sorprendido como emocionado.
Ya no me quiero alargar m√°s, solo me queda decir, que tremenda historia, que preciosa la m√∫sica que la acompa√±a, que edici√≥n y cinematograf√≠a tan chula y que final tan desgarrador.

"THE SOUND OF SILENCE
Mike Nichols shows a subject as complex as a university student's sexual awakening for what it is: decision and security, the illusion of choosing a better future. However, it's important to understand that this isn't a typical romantic comedy or tearjerker drama (in fact, it stays halfway somewhere between both extremes), rather it's the conversion of all marital unions (real or fictitious) that, due to the clash between rebelliousness and strictness, leads to chaos, robbery, repentance and an atypical (and certainly bizarre) test of love. The arised apathy from shame and defeat in several inappropriate and erotic decisions, reaffirms the dubious future over the adventure.
Although Dustin Hoffman manages to maintain interest as Benjamin Braddock, the truth is that Anne Bancroft is the real star as the quintessential original sexy bad mother, it's thanks to Mrs. Robinson that the story lives on, due to how scandalous her presence turns out to be for family values. Combined with the music by Simon & Garfunkel and a level of intensity and suspense that keeps the story tense and uncomfortable, it's the perfect portrait of uncertainty as part of life, exemplified in a beautifully illustrated ending that shapes the course of the leading couple in the back of a truck. Ahead of its time.",5.0
"‚ÄúBen, what are you doing?
Well, I would say that I'm just drifting‚Ä¶ Here in the pool.‚Äù
It‚Äôs hard to put into words exactly what I think about this film.
The Graduate is a film I relate to deeply. I think it‚Äôs a film many people my age relate to. 
The future is a scary thing. For my entire senior year, the future has loomed over me, and it still does. Much like Benjamin, everywhere I go, people ask me questions about the future. It seems that‚Äôs all the adults in my life want to talk about. They ask ‚Äúwhere are you going to college?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat do you want to do in the future?‚Äù and I‚Äôve never truly had a good answer. And much like Benjamin, I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt have a good answer.
Life is confusing. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going to end up, or the kind of life I will lead. I don‚Äôt even know what the next 6 months might hold, much less the next 60 years. 
And that‚Äôs what The Graduate is all about.
The uncertainty of youth. The pressure of being on the brink of adulthood, as the adults around you push you into the future. Benjamin is a well-off and intelligent man. His possibilities are so incredibly broad if he just puts in the effort. But there‚Äôs something blissful about youth. You lack the responsibilities of adulthood, and accepting those responsibilities as you grow older can be intimidating. 
The themes of uncertainty and stress for the future are only possible due to the fantastic screenplay and direction. Mike Nichols‚Äô charming direction perfectly encapsulates Benjamin‚Äôs feelings of depression and anxiety. The cinematography is beautiful as well. The lighting and framing is excellent. The dialogue is oddly syncopated, giving the film it‚Äôs awkward, naive feeling. The acting from every member of the cast is great but Dustin Hoffman was obviously the standout. Through the first act he doesn‚Äôt talk much, but expresses a lot simply through his body language and expressions. 
In conclusion, The Graduate might be the realest film of all time. Benjamin is one of the most relatable characters in film, in my opinion. This film found me at a very weird and melancholic time in my life, and I think it found me at the perfect time.

"""The Graduate"" ist einer der Vorreiter des New-Hollywood Kinos und f√ºr seine Zeit revolution√§r. Bricht mit Konventionen, r√ºckt die starren Moralvorstellungen der amerikanischen Gesellschaft und die Weldfremdheit der jungen Generation in den Fokus und nimmt diese gekonnt aufs Korn.
Dustin Hoffman brilliert in seiner ersten gro√üen Rolle und Anne Bancroft und Katharine Ross verdrehen ihm hier erfolgreich den Kopf. Der Soundtrack aus gro√üartigen Popsongs von Simon & Garfunkel funktioniert einfach, auch wenn die Songs teilweise overused werden. Sp√§testens wenn Scarborough Fair das f√ºnfte Mal in 10 Minuten ert√∂nt, hab ichs wirklich mehr als genug geh√∂rt. Die ganzen Kniffs in der Kameraarbeit sind klasse, seien es die ungew√∂hnlichen Einstellungen, die Zooms oder die geniale Kamerafahrt in der Er√∂ffnungsszene. Auch die Dialoge sind gro√üartig, teilweise so absurd und unvorhersehbar. Die Charaktermotive bleiben teilweise etwas unklar, warum darf Ben nicht mit Elaine ausgehen, warum erwidert diese sp√§ter seine Liebe, nach allem was er getan hat.
Trotz alledem ein Film der unheimlich Spa√ü macht, was allen voran an den tollen Darstellern liegt, nat√ºrlich aber auch an dem spitzen Humor, den schicken Pop-Elementen oder der gro√üartigen Kamera.",4.0

"There's a corrupting force that moves throughout The Graduate, rooting itself in whatever existential boredom it can find. At the beginning of the movie, Benjamin is bumbling and nebbish and polite and sweet. By the end, he's a pretty unsavory character. Mrs. Robinson taught him that being unsavory is a possible mode of being. She is aggressively pushy towards him, and her seduction technique is to ignore his protests. But we can empathize with her rationale: she feels purposeless and powerless in life, and Benjamin is one of the few people she has power over, so she takes what she wants from him. Is she respectful of Benjamin's agency? It's hard to say. You can cast her actions as selfish, where she is taking what she wants from a world that doesn't let her take very much; or you can cast them as teaching moments, showing Benjamin how to break out of his shell. Either way, Benjamin is also rudderless and full of existential angst, and susceptible to Mrs. Robinson's lessons... she shows him how to be pushy in love. But he's rich, young, white, and male, so his subsequent rejection of conventional social norms is much scarier. When he becomes a predator, he can bend the world to his whims.
Elaine's decision at the end is so interesting. One would expect Benjamin to have fully repulsed her. Why doesn't it? (Is this a story about a stalker breaking down his victim? That's a take I've seen.) She's less developed than the other two characters, but I think intentionally so: we're meant to extrapolate from the other two characters to learn her situation. She too feels purposeless and living in bad faith. So, Benjamin's attitude toward life overtakes her just as Mrs. Robinson's overtook Benjamin. Everyone gets corrupted! Any moralizing about whether this is a negative corrupting force or a positive self-actualizing force is left unstated.
The Graduate is one of those rare movies that is breezy and hilarious while also deep and psychologically rich. It's a treatise on the contagion of existentialist thought.
I love the existential romcom. Say Anything falls in this space for me, as does The Heartbreak Kid, which was directed by Elaine May, Mike Nichols's onetime comedy partner. Nichols and May were clearly attracted to the same sort of material. (I still haven't heard any of the comedy they did together. I should fix that.) Nichols includes more assertive visual jokes in the cinematography than May‚ÄîBenjamin jumping on the pool mat cutting to jumping on Mrs. Robinson, the well-timed toast pop-up, the focus onto the gorilla, the long run down the sidewalk, the classic shot of Benjamin framed inside Mrs. Robinson's bent legs‚Äîbut Nichols and May are very similar in directorial style. Both movies have a nearly identical shot where the camera looks up from the protagonist's point of view at their love interest silhouetted and haloed by the summer sun.
Benjamin has an awful lot of the behavioral markers for autism. I wonder if this performance is what led to Dustin Hoffman's casting in Rain Man? This feels like a stronger portrayal of autism. Less heightened.

I have to confess that the first time I heard someone talking about this movie, i really didn't give a damn about it, because of its title here, in Brazil (""A primeira noite de um homem"", that means something like ""The first night of a man""). I was thinking that this movie was just one more movie about young people trying to get laid. A terrible mistake. Someday, I decided to watch this movie. At the first day, I watched it at least three times, in sequence. Then I bought a copy for my small movies collection. In the same week I bought it, I watched it everyday.
Everything in this movie is perfect to me. The first thing I paid attention was the soundtrack. I'm a big fan of Simon and Garfunkel's work, and i found simply amazing that they had all the soundtrack of the movie.
I think this movies really shows something very simple: You'll never know what you will want tomorrow, and what will happen in your life. I mean, isn't life ironic?

"This movie seems to wane in popularity and reverence as time goes on, and as much as that‚Äôs a shame it also makes perfect sense.
The Graduate is not an openly emotional or clean film. It‚Äôs curt and absurd, taking big themes and examining them in a method that‚Äôs anything but concrete. Characters are three-dimensional but also ridiculous, they interact in ways that are both natural and comedically uncanny. 
It creates an experience that could be alienating to many, like a snobby version of a Coen brothers film, but damn if I don‚Äôt fuck with it so hard. Nothing else has been so distant yet so innately honest. It‚Äôs so bizarre it that in turn becomes universal. Feelings of alienation, disillusionment, and confusion have never been better communicated. The effectiveness of these themes come across as complete in their distant and muddled execution.
Every single line of dialogue, shot, soundtrack choice (Simon and Garfunkel my beloved), and every other minute detail distinctly belongs to The Graduate. It exists as a microcosm of the late 60s but is still poignant so many years later. It‚Äôs quietly one of the most unique movies ever made and should be considered one of the best ever.

There's an odd sense of comfort amongst the awkwardness of The Graduate.
Setting the standard for the coming of age genre, what really surprised me about this was how timeless it feels - with the latest remaster and the confident direction it could have come out last year, let alone 1967.
Mike Nichols creates a film that feels so vibrant and established with technically impressive shots that must've inspired so many 50 years ago. I did initially feel frustrated that I had waited this long to watch this but on reflection, it feels like it came around at the perfect time. I am a similar age as Hoffman's character and saw a lot of myself in his fear of the future. The tension of undesirable social situations and the conflict of deciding the next chapter were both encouraging and daunting to see reflected on the screen, especially given the age of the film.
Set to the soothing tones of Simon & Garfunkel, it's no wonder that The Graduate stands as an iconic pillar of cinema, and I'm already worried about the amount of repeat viewing this will get over the coming years.",5.0
"rewatching this now being a college student & not my high school sophomore self makes this story so much more resonant. there‚Äôs nothing scarier than being in the wake of reality & having to face our futures without the comfort of youth & assuredness. hence, we turn to love for a sense of meaning & a way to cope with our existential feelings, an act- if done impulsively- can turn out to be either rewarding or detrimental, but it‚Äôs a risk one is willing to take. such a brilliant film (with some pretty awesome music as well).",5.0

As a 21 year old myself who also confused about my own future, I feel like I can't connect/relate/emphatize to Benjamin. The first thing I would do if I were in his situation is to find something that liberates me. Now the question's here *spoiler alert* is that was Benjamin feels liberated when he had the affair with Mrs. Robinson? Also about the ""chasing"" Elaine trope. I get it if that is something liberating for Ben and kinda need to be chased for.

"Truly fantastic filmmaking.
    A nearly perfect film. Hoffman is excellent. Aside from maybe a few problems with the story and some character choices. I think this film was absolutely amazing. I was never bored. The music in this film by Simon and Garfunkel is beautiful. Even though songs are repeated 2-3 times throughout the film, each time those song are played they just hit different and invoke a different feeling or emotion out of the viewer every time. Each time a song is played or repeated it feels like it was a specific reason or to invoke a certain feeling. 
    The cinematography, camera movements, and camera angles are all masterfully done. The cinematography is used brilliantly in order to tell the story. The POV shots where Ben is watching Elaine tell us everything we need to know with just our eyes. There are a multitude of shots throughout the film in which the shots are composed in a specific way in order evoke Ben‚Äôs feelings. It‚Äôs among some of the best composed shots I have ever seen. There are endlesss shots that are just breathtaking, for such a simple story too. 
    Overall, The Graduate is honestly an amazing film. I‚Äôm so glad I watched it. It‚Äôs a great story with amazing acting, a beautiful score and some of the most well composed shots I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs hard to tell a story and evoke emotions just by the way you place the camera, and this film does it perfectly. Nearly a masterpiece honestly. Ben is also a super relatable character. I recommend checking it out if you haven‚Äôt already, it‚Äôs free on Amazon Prime. It‚Äôs definitely worth your time. This film is also one of the films that had the biggest influence on Hollywood during its time, actually being one of the first films to start the New Hollywood movement, along with Bonnie and Clyde.


A film that all cinephiles can appreciate.

"Benjamin es un joven que duda y al que todo se le escapa. No puede lograr lo que quiere, no porque no sea capaz sino porque ni siquiera sabe lo que desea. Lo √∫nico que lo mueve es el deseo de lo prohibido. Pero en cuanto aquello deja de ser prohibido y sale a la luz, la duda aparece de nuevo.
Tras ser rechazado por Elaine, Benjamin corre el autobus para alcanzarla pero ella le da la espalda. Al final, cuando finalmente logre escapar con ella en el autobus, la inseguridad se reflejar√° en el rostro de ambos. Porque no s√≥lo dudamos por ser j√≥venes, sino por ser humanos.

"Time shines paradoxically on The Graduate. Much of the punchlines in the first act encourage the viewer to laugh at an anxious and awkward virgin being manipulated and pressured into having sex with an older woman. The first act is frankly rapey. Not wanting sex but being pushed to carry on is a major part of the film. It's somewhat uncomfortable, especially taking into account the allegations toward Hoffman. Yet at the same time, as the film carries on, a careful viewer will pick up on the fact that the film doesn't seem to really endorse the actions of any character, though it does sympathize with them. By the end, Ben and Elaine get their happy ending, but there's a subtle suggestion in their facial expressions that says ""now what?"" The characters are superficial. The affair was toxic. The final romance was a farce. The film may even be an anti-comedy, upon dissection. I'm not entirely sure we are supposed to laugh with it, but at it. Such is life. This superficial chaotic mess.",4.0
"The Graduate is a bit of an oddity to me. I have watched it a number of times over the years. And I love it. It makes me laugh. It has fun and inventive camera-work. It feels both of its time - a wonderful capsule of the 60's, but with themes that are of relevance to modern sensibilities. You could make the case that the lack of understanding between generations (certainly as depicted in the media) is wider than it was at the start of the baby boom. So it has a point of view to express. And it has the most wonderful acerbic ending. But despite all this I don't really think it is a great movie.
The thing is it is just so damn funny. There is so much wonderful dialogue. The script is peppered with fantastic comic lines. It is simply impossible not to crack up when you hear the word ""Plastics"". It is uttered with such sincerity and yet depicts the divide between the parents and the kids so effortlessly and succinctly. Mrs. Robinson's (the perfect Anne Bancroft) seduction of Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is delicious - filled with desperation, excitement and ennui. The scenes in the hotel lobby - Ben trying to be an adult and in control - when he is anything but. And the splendid, over the top scenes at the strip-club and later at the church. All is wonderful. Truly excellent.
But I'm not sure what it all adds up to. I really struggle with how the main characters get themselves into such a position. Mrs. Robinson makes the most sense. But I really have to look the other way when trying to understand Ben. Is all there is to him out-of-control male hormones and a desire to escape middle class boredom? But the character of Elaine (Katharine Ross) makes the least sense. There does not really seem to be much behind the eyes. The final act is deeply problematic given what she believes happened between Ben and her mother. She would need to be pretty vacant or troubled to look the other way and act as she did.
And yet I wouldn't really want it any other way. I've never bought into the motives and plot contrivances that get Ben and Elaine to the church and on that bus. But 60's cinema would be less rich if these classic moments fell victim to plausibility. So I try not to think about its flaws too deeply - and instead just enjoy the delicious words and the blossoming embarrassment of youthful rebelliousness.",4.0

"A boy trying to become a man.
The feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment, unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college are explored in the Nichols' brilliant direction using water and the swimming pool as a metaphorical representation of Ben Braddock's entrapment. ""Plastics!"" takes on greater meaning as a symbol of falsity in the adult world, the same symbol of escape from upper middle class ""plastic"" society in a public transportation, the bus is filled with ‚Äúreal‚Äù people. A kick against the smug, xenophobic, materialistic, spoiled and sanctimonious middle classes. Mrs. Robinson is a epitome of the devil-may-care LA bourgeoisie who represents the darker side of America's American Dream, sedated by pills, desensitized by liquor and mind dulled by television.

A handful of American films appeared in the late 60s which changed the face of Hollywood. While Bonnie and Clyde pushed the envelope in terms of cinematic violence and In the Heat of the Night dared to tackle race relations, The Graduate was busy breaking sexual taboos.
But just to focus on the way it changed everything (and it still looks extraordinarily ahead of its time) would be to diminish just how stunning a film it is. Dustin Hoffman gives what could well be his best screen performance (and I, as a sufferer of chronic shyness, know just how it feels to want to escape from social situations, which is why the party scene is so effective). Anne Bancroft is perfect as Mrs Robinson, one of the great screen villainesses, and Katharine Ross is suitably na√Øve as Elaine.
This is also the creative zenith of director Mike Nichols, who was rightly awarded that year's Oscar. He works with photographer Robert Surtees to heighten Benjamin's feeling of alienation and disenfranchisement, as well as to increase the impact of some elaborate and borderline-surreal visual jokes. Credit has to go to editor Sam O'Steen for that dazzling sequence (set to Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"") depicting the effects of Benjamin's first encounter with Mrs Robinson.
The Graduate is by no means an ordinary sex comedy, with much focus being placed on Nichols' flashy and off-kilter style, as well as an encroaching sense of melancholy typified by the penultimate shot of Elaine and Benjamin on the bus, reviewing their decision. Better on a second watch, I'd say.",4.5

"Here's the thing with The Graduate, celebrating it's fiftieth anniversary you'd think there'd be some aspect of it that doesn't hold up. Some of the writing or dialogue would seem dated by now. You'd think that, or at least I did. I hadn't seen Mike Nichols masterpiece for quite some time. When I first experienced The Graduate, I might've been a bit too young to fully appreciate it. I must've only been about ten years old, or round about that age. At that age the film struck me as different. The normal things that everyone talks about, the infamous opening and closing shots, the surprisingly serious plot points that seem more fitting for a deadly serious drama instead of a comedy and of course Simon and Garfunkel's iconic soundtrack, it just wasn't what I was expecting. I enjoyed it back then, but obviously I needed to reevaluate it.
This was long overdue another watch and when it was set for a short theatrical release to acknowledge its milestone birthday, I couldn't say no. Well, it came, and went. A week of bad show times that I just couldn't make. I then went on holiday, and missed it again in a different cinema. Once I came back after a two week break, I was pleasantly surprised that I had one last chance. Not only that, but it was the best possible experience out of all three. A cheap ticket, the largest screen in the cinema and to top it all off, a new 4K restoration. The Graduate has gotten nothing but critical acclaim since its release back in 1967. The writing, direction by Nichols and acting from the entire cast has been applauded and awarded. And rightfully so. As The Graduate is not only a hilarious coming-of-age tale with unexpected outcomes, but also an excellent window into what life was like at that moment and time. And more than anything else, it holds up, a lot.
Benjamin has just graduated from college and he's returned to his home. Where all that's waiting for him is loneliness and the incredibly strong sense that he doesn't know what he wants to do with his future. He's lost and doesn't know where to go in his life. Then, Mrs. Robinson walks in and offers him something new, something rebellious.
The character of Benjamin not only set off the career of the very talented Dustin Hoffman, but also provided him with one of his greatest performances. One that is very hard to top. Here, Hoffman is phenomenal. Beginning with his motionless stance on a moving walkway to his final, terrified stare into the unknown. He perfectly encapsulates the fear and sadness that is felt when the future isn't clear, when there's nothing to look forward to or fall back on. In moments where he longingly gazes into his fish tank, or sinks to the bottom of his swimming pool. Moments of utter silence, where all he does is look and think. He gives Benjamin so much depth and personality. He's not just the lead character in a romantic comedy. He's conflicted, a character that wants to be, as he puts it, different. Thanks to this, when Benjamin finally has something meaningful in his life, something to look forward to in the form of Mrs. Robinson, Hoffman's excitement and hesitation mix together perfectly. He delivers the comedy instantly and, it looks like, without even trying. He portrays the shy and quiet aspect brilliantly. He's scared and inexperienced which leads to hilarity. But once these meetings become frequent, he falls back into the meaningless of it all. Hoffman portrays a character that shouldn't always be likeable, as likeable. The events that he partakes in, the consequences from his actions, and he doesn't care. He's only worried about himself, and what he can do to find meaning. But I really like him. He's funny, charming and the character you want to see succeed the most. Especially with the age that I am now, I can relate to Benjamin more than ever. Hoffman's been undeniably incredible in many things, but this performance is the one I'll instantly think of when his name pops up.
Anne Bancroft also delivers an iconic performance. Not only does she define the term ""cougar"" better than anyone else, she also perfectly portrays a person that's living a life that she doesn't want. Up until a certain conversation, Bancroft teases and seduces in a masterful way and that's all she does, but when we finally learn about her, when Ben realises who she is as a person, it's quite sad. She's just as lost in this world as Benjamin, but instead of having a future in which anything could happen, she's stuck firmly where she is. Bancroft and Hoffman together perfect the art of awkward conversations and comedy. Katharine Ross portrays Mrs. Robinson's daughter and her character's the one deserving of the most sympathy. Honestly, Ross gives the character of Elaine such an upbeat, kind and likeable quality. She's introduced with a beautiful smile and in a polite manner. And all she gets is mistreated, lied to and forced into who she can and cannot see. In the moments where she's having fun with Hoffman the film can be classed as a romantic comedy, but those scenes are far apart. She too does a fantastic job in the final moments of the film.
When I first heard about The Graduate, I was lead to believe that it was a romantic comedy. That's what I went in looking for the first time I saw it, and even though it does have romantic plot points, and it most certainly is funny, I wouldn't say that's the best way to describe the story. The focus here isn't so much on Ben and Mrs. Robinson's relationship, nor Ben and Elaine's relationship. It's a coming-of-age drama. One that's not necessarily happy and light. Ben's just out of college and has no idea what he wants to do. Thinking about a future in which there's nothing for you isn't that much of a happy thought. He's expected to do amazing things by his family. When Mrs. Robinson comes into the picture, Ben's not thinking about anyone else. He doesn't see the implications that could happen even if they get caught. He sees something different, which is exactly what he wants. When the fairytale aspect comes into play, the film doesn't forget this. As the closing of the movie drags Ben back down to reality, back to thinking about his future which may not be as open as it once was. The Graduate is a comedy though. It's hilarious and I was smiling throughout most of the film. It's really entertaining.
Mike Nichols won the Best Director award at the Oscars for this film, and it's understandable why. It's really well paced and the subject matter never gets diluted by the tone. Serious matters are tackled seriously instead of just being thrown around. Also the transitions are incredible. There's a montage in the middle of the film that shows the passing of time in which the affair is happening, and it's flawless. The cinematography is also superb. Shots are impeccably framed, creating a very stylish and iconic looking movie. I've no doubt that the '60s were cool, but this makes the '60s look cool. The soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel works with the film. Instead of just being a soundtrack full of amazing songs, they actually add weight to the film and certain scenes. The opening and closing in which The Sound of Silence is played over, or the excellent use of Mrs. Robinson as Ben drives like a maniac to reach Elaine in time. The Graduate can be viewed as a romantic comedy. I enjoyed it like that a few years ago when I first saw it. It's hilarious and extremely entertaining due to the incredible cast. But, when you actually sit down and watch it, when you really invest your time in the film, you'll see that it's much more. Benjamin becomes scarily familiar, and with his story of loneliness and being lost in this world, the overall impact of the film is stronger. It still feels relevant fifty years later. It's perfect.",5.0
"There was absolutely no reason I can think of that Elaine actually wanted to be with Ben, which was going to be my main criticism for the movie, but that final sequence in the church made the whole thing worthwhile and I no longer care about how unrealistic it all was.
One of the strangest ‚Äòromance‚Äô movies I‚Äôve ever seen, with a soundtrack of amazing songs that they for some reason chose to play on repeat over and over which kind of removed some of the enjoyment from them, but my main takeaway from this, which I cannot understate enough, is that Dustin Hoffman puts in one of the most absolutely insane, unhinged, socially awkward, unintentionally funny performances I‚Äôve ever seen. I had no idea how this movie would end once I saw there was 5 minutes left, but watching him fend people off with a crucifix and was better than anything I could‚Äôve come up with.",4.0
"September 2021 - First Watch Personal Challenge #36
One of those classics that for whatever reason I have failed to see. I have seen it on stage at the Dundee Rep, Irene McDougall was the brave actress revealing all that night, receiving all the gasps from the audience.
I find it difficult to like this version of Ben, that wasn't the case on the stage production so I see the issue being Hoffman. I have never been a fan of Hoffman, yeah I like Marathon Man, Tootsie and the President's Men but he remains a big stumbling block for me, especially in things like Midnight Cowboy and Papillion. I didn't engage with Ben here and really didn't want him to succeed, God forbid you should end up married to that little middle class prick for the rest of time.
It's saved for me by a great, very sexy performance by Bancroft. In two contrasting scenes she is both hilarious and then later tragic. The first is where Ben awkwardly moves in for a kiss before she is able to exhale smoke from her cigarette, just done beautifully. Then later when she and Ben are wet from the rain, Ben goes to confess to Elaine about his relationships with her mother, the camera is on Bancroft, panning out to reveal her in the corner of this stark room, seemingly broken by the revelation. Just brilliant.
The music is of course outstanding.

"I've been wanting to watch this for a very long time. My mother brings it up a lot and she's always been a big fan of Dustin Hoffman. I liked The Graduate and I'm rating it a 4/5, but I feel slightly disappointed. I'll get into the negatives later.
The performances are really great. I can't say I've ever had the love for Dustin Hoffman that my mother has, but I thought he was good in this. The cinematography was a surprising standout. There are some seriously gorgeous frames here that I didn't expect at all. Often in films like this the cinematography is an afterthought, but it was towards the top of their priorities for sure. The editing, which is not something ai usually pay attention to, was some of the best I've seen in a while. During the iconic time lapse scene of Benjamin's meets with Mrs. Robinson there are some very impressive cuts and transitions that made that scene so much more interesting.
All that being said, I still expected more. Or rather something a bit different. Based on opinions from others I figured it would be much funnier film. I found it more frustrating than funny. This leads me to my primary issue, the writing. I know it's sort of the point, but Hoffman's character is such a loser. He starts out on one end of loser spectrum and the other side by the end of the film. He never does anything that makes me want to root for him. Even by the end of the film when we're meant to cheer him on for trying to get his act together I honestly wanted him to fail.

Minor Spoilers:
My least favorite part is that I can't possibly understand why Elaine would want to even look at Benjamin after learning the truth. He slept with your mom basically every day for a month and you still ""love him""? Not buying it.

What makes the imagery here as iconic as it is really is the fact that it's a brilliant bait-and-switch, emphasizing and eroticizing the age gap between Ben and Mrs. Robinson (notably both adults); their affair is by far the most socially constructive relationship depicted in the film, wherein he learns about the rules and regulations of dating. By the film's end, he's tried as hard as he can to approximate the cowardliness-masked-as-pragmatism that the world was built for, and lands in a situation where absolutely no one is happy.

"What a journey. The movie presents itself as a shallow, fun and exotic comedy but in reality hides deep in itself so many hints for an existential introspection all for the viewer to explore. The structure, the editing, the cinematography was solo ahead of its time.. The characters are just so deeply studied and brilliantly performed: for more than half of it I thought that Mrs. Robinson was actually one of the good guys and that she had something to her that made her really complex and fascinating to read and I wish I'd seen her more; one of the best villains of all time. Even though we are left with some questions to be answered (like what was the dynamic between the families? Was it something that happened in the past that led the Robinson's to act like that toward Benjamin?) the finale makes us forget everything, answering the question that matters the most. As a big fanatic of music in movies I have to say that I don't mind Simon&Garfunkel being played over and over and actually it worked better than some other movies (it was one of the first movies to have not composed music in a film).

Surprisingly fun and humorous with a lot of slick and impressive editing and camera work. Dustin Hoffman was great as the strange and awkward Ben Braddock. His character is in a very similar situation to me right now (without the relationship with an older woman and her daughter).

"What can I say about a movie that has been talked about to hell and back since its release? It‚Äôs undeniably iconic, and now that I‚Äôve seen it for the first time I can finally join the consensus. The Graduate is very good!
I finally took the plunge and watched this because in the book I‚Äôm reading, ‚ÄòGlorious Birds: A Celebratory Homage to Harold and Maude‚Äô, the author Heidi Greco draws parallels between the two films and talks about how much The Graduate must have inspired screenwriter Colin Higgins. I can definitely see the similarities. Besides the ‚Äòyoung man has an affair with older woman‚Äô plot, the loneliness, awkwardness, and overall dissatisfaction with life on display from Benjamin‚Äôs character is definitely comparable to Bud Cort‚Äôs Harold. However, The Graduate ditches some of the darkness present in Harold and Maude and replaces it with a more conventional sense of humour and a more conventional love story, too.
Being 21 myself, it‚Äôs easy to relate to Ben‚Ä¶ well, besides the affair with a MILF and running away with someone else‚Äôs bride at their wedding. But really, I don‚Äôt think the essence of Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs character has dated at all. Young people are always going to be lost when entering the world of adulthood, and I think that‚Äôs a big reason why The Graduate has remained so popular and relevant.
The camerawork is gorgeous, the repetitive use of Simon & Garfunkel songs to score the movie works brilliantly, and the story is just so exciting to watch. (Oh, and I have to mention that as a vintage Barbie doll collector, spotting the 1960s Barbie wearing the Enchanted Evening dress in Elaine‚Äôs room was pretty cool!)

"Very iconic and very ridiculous. Benjamin, a very young man, is put in a position that borders harassment at the very beginning, with Mrs. Robinson trying to seduce him at any cost driven by her lust. Overcoming his insecurities, Ben finally gets sexually involved with the woman, but entering a space of convenience, leisure and pleasure, that afterwards isn't enough for his young mind, pushing him to desire a deep bond. He realizes that he obviously can't get it from Mrs. Robinson, and that's when he discovers that Mrs. Robinson's daughter has a lot in common with himself, creating a giant mess.
The film is very entertaining, everything is super unconfortable, but is so ridiculous that it works. Instead of making me cringe and not wanting to see, I just want know how are they gonna keep ruining their own lifes just for pleasure.

The cinematography and editing are clever and creative, the direction is superb, the acting from Hoffman and Bancroft are outstanding, and the soundtrack is one of the best and most iconic in cinema. This is a more complex film than I anticipated, and can be interpreted in many different ways. You can view it as a showcase of the fear and uncertainty young people face going into adulthood. You can view it as a study of creepy obsession. You can also even view it as a satire of youth culture.

I keep forgetting that there are good movies that came out before the 70s, and I don't really know why I donmt watch more of them. 
The story of a man who just graduated and has no idea what to do with his life gets seduced by an older woman and is taking advantage of him. It's a fairly simple story, but gets a little more complex as the film goes on. Dustin Hoffman was great, as was Anne Bancroft. They were both perfect for the role they were in and never gave any dull moments. 
The cinematography was also just amazing. If you're going to zoom in and out, there was to be a reason for it and it has to be done in a non-nauseating way. This movie did it just right, and it worked well for the movie. 
I'd need to rewatch at some point just to see if it deserves five stars, but we shall wait for that one as I'm not 110% sure if it's got that yet.",4.5

"IT‚ÄôS TOO LATE!

Not for me. 
An absolute masterwork. One of the greatest, the most essential American films. I feel so alive after watching this again. It‚Äôs such a dense, wonderful tapestry of characters and dialogue and details that Nichols puts there for us. Dustin Hoffman is astonishing, yes, and Anne Bancroft is simply superb - but dammit, this is Nichols‚Äô film. 
It‚Äôs a phase that we all go through, that aimlessness that comes about between the end of our youth and the beginning of our adulthood. Benjamin Braddock‚Äòs just done four years of college, he‚Äôs absolutely aced his work, his parents bought him a car - but for what? *Naturally* a beautiful older woman seduces him and he subsequently falls in love with her daughter. What a fantastical, dreamlike story - I think that‚Äôs why it works so well. So many of the details and shots and supporting characters turn this into an surrealist dark comedy. This movie works in so many ways, it‚Äôs perfect for so many moods, it just *works*. 
It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs happy, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs scary, it‚Äôs unpredictable, it‚Äôs completely wild. The fact that it came out over fifty years ago is just insane so me. It‚Äôs truly timeless, the kind of thing the human race should want to be remembered for. Some of the best filmmaking of all time is present in this thing, and we should never take it for granted. The Graduate is a fucking mammoth.",5.0
"After making his directorial debut (some consider it a surprise) with the excellent Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Mike Nichols‚Äô next film would be this classic comedy drama, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Charles Webb, which was published four years earlier, in which a young graduate who falls in love with an older married woman but then finds himself falling in love with her daughter.
Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) has just ended college and, back at his parents' house, he's trying to escape the one question everyone keeps asking him: What does he want to do with his life?
An unanticipated change pops up when he is seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a fed up housewife and friend of his parents. But what begins as an enjoyable encounter turns difficult when Benjamin falls in love with the one woman Mrs. Robinson wanted him to keep absent from - her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross)
Dustin Hoffman gives one of the most memorable performances in his role as Benjamin, ‚ÄòThe Graduate‚Äô (hence the title) student who is torn between the two loves and he has to make a really difficult decision about who he loves the most. He also acts like he is determined to dodge the question that really keeps bothering him.
Hoffman suits his role really well and this is his breakthrough role. This performance definitely made him an actor to look out for at the time of this release and without any doubt makes the most of the time he has on the screen. He certainly could not have played the part of Benjamin any better.
Anne Bancroft gives one of her best performances in her role as Mrs Robinson, the woman who acts like she makes it very clear to Benjamin that he stays away from her daughter. There is one particular scene involving the two leads which had one of the all-time classic quotes ‚Äì ‚ÄúMrs Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?!‚Äù
This is perhaps Anne Bancroft‚Äôs most memorable role of her career and she suits the part really well and definitely makes the most of the time she has on the screen.
Elsewhere, Katharine Ross is superb in her supporting role as Elaine, Bancroft‚Äôs daughter who Benjamin begins to date, despite what Mrs Robinson said to him.
The direction from Mike Nichols is excellent because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while the script is written to a very decent standard by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry as they make the movie really easy to follow.
The technical aspects that stand out best are the camera and editing, because the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense moments well, which deservedly get the edge-of-the-seat status, while the movie is edited to an excellent standard.
The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack is awesome to listen to.
The movie saw Mike Nichols win the Academy Award for Best Director and because of this, it means that The Graduate was the first and will probably be the last film to win Best Director and nothing else.
But the Academy also deservedly nominated for: Best Picture, Best Actor (Dustin Hoffman), Best Actress (Anne Bancroft), Best Supporting Actress (Katharine Ross), Best Adapted Screenplay (Calder Willingham and Buck Henry) and Best Cinematography (Robert Surtees).
At the British Academy Film Awards, the movie won the awards for Best Film, Best Director (Mike Nichols), Best Screenplay (Calder Willingham and Buck Henry), Best Film Editing (Sam O‚ÄôSteen) and Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles (Dustin Hoffman).
The British Academy also deservedly nominated for: Best Actress (Anne Bancroft) and Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles (Katharine Ross). Ross was unlucky to have been nominated with Hoffman in this category. If I had it my way, this category would have been a two-way tie.
At the Golden Globes, the movie won the award for: Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Comedy or Musical ‚Äì but this a disagree with, because I don‚Äôt consider this to be the funniest film to have been released in this year.
On the other hand, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association also deservedly awarded the film Best Director (Mike Nichols), Best Actress ‚Äì Comedy or Musical (Anne Bancroft), Most Promising Male Newcomer (Dustin Hoffman) and Most Promising Female Newcomer (Katharine Ross). It also deservedly got nominations for: Best Actor ‚Äì Comedy or Musical (Dustin Hoffman) and Best Screenplay (Calder Willingham and Buck Henry).
I am thrilled Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross all won something for their fantastic parts in this film rather than nothing, because they would have been very unlucky to have walked away empty-handed.
Overall, The Graduate is a comedy-drama that absolutely deserves to have its classic status. It works so well due to the excellent performances from Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross, along with Mike Nichols‚Äô brilliant direction and the well written script.",5.0

Listen, I don't love this film, it is however a very well crafted film. Hoffman gives an excellent performance (he portrays the perfect mix of awkwardness and anxiety) as well as Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross. The cinematography is not all that great, but I have to say that the use of long lenses is really quite clever. The soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel is perfect and really adds to the tone of the film, Mrs Robinson being a personal favourite.
I'm not really sure why I don't love The Graduate, perhaps it is pacing or the subject matter, I don't know.

"The Graduate gets better every time I see it. It has taken me quite a long time to recognise its brilliance. I have seen it every few years since I was fifteen, and now in my early thirties I fully acknowledge its masterpiece status. I think most people come to this conclusion fairly quickly and early with The Graduate. The Graduate is an easy film to like, it is remarkably and consistently funny throughout its 100 minutes, it has two superb performances from Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman and an incredibly likeable one from Katherine Ross; it is directed with a wild invention and has one of the great song-track soundtracks. The refrain of ""Hello, darkness my old friend"" becomes more and more resonant every time it is used. A wonderful melding of sound and picture.
The aspect of the film that most stood out to me on this viewing was Mike Nichols ability with the camera and his direction to tell jokes, highlights lines and underline comprehension. There is a lovely moment where the three main characters are in the same space and it dawns on Elaine (Katherine Ross) what has been happening, Nichols draws from out of focus to into focus, Ross has a slight look on her face and all of the audience understands that she understands without the need for any dialogue. It is a small moment, but Nichols is fully in control of the film.
The Graduate is uproariously funny, glib and witty; it treats existential ennui with a perpendicular irreverance. Nichols has a wonderful command of the material, the first half hour is particularly amusing, the initial seduction scene remains one of the great sequences in all film. Anne Bancroft steals the whole film for me. Her character, I think now, is the most sympathetic, there is genuine pain to her performance and the character evokes great empathy, even when she is lashing out. It is a remarkably atuned piece of work. Though, I will say Anne Bancroft is clearly not old enough to play Katherine Ross mother and Dustin Hoffman's older woman, she is easily still in her thirties and, frankly, looks amazing.
Dustin Hoffman's stammering Ben is really fun to watch, I love the transformation that goes through him during the film, particularly towards the end. His passive existential distress giving away to a frenetic desire, willingness to throw everything away for essentially not much. All underlined by Nichols in one of cinema's best, and most ambiguous endings. An ending that gets sadder and sadder every time I see it.
Wes Anderson owes a heavy debt to this film, he has been lifting its style and themes for twenty years, but I am not sure he has ever made a film quite as good. Quite as affecting or effective. You'll laugh through your tears and sing lines from Simon and Garfunkel the rest of the day.

"The best movies tend to be the ones that share both an outrageous plot and a striking sense of relatability.

"The Graduate is amazing. It tackles complex themes and characters in such a timeless manner, that are still relevant and relateable almost 50(!) years later. The direction from Mike Nichols is so strong and the camerawork is very impressive, with certain shots being incredible.

The soundtrack is iconic in both it's usage and the actual music itself. Also that ending, oh man, it's easily one of the best endings to any film I have ever seen. Obviously it helps that the rest of the film is pretty damn good as well.

"Oh no, Mrs Robinson, I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends.
Can't do it justice in a full review after just one watch but wow this really captured me. Was meaning to watch this for ages and was spurred on after starting Geoff King's ""New Hollywood Cinema: An Introduction"" for class and finding mentioned often as one of the key founding texts for the movement. And I can see why: here Benjamin is like American cinema in the 60s, alienated by the older, richer generation and only able to spring into life when youthful passion finally enters his world. I loved the scenes early on, at his parents' party and the diving suit sequence, his impotent desire to be treated like a grown man at odds with his lack of drive to do something with his life. And it's not Mrs Robinson or Elaine who gives him agency but himself, realising the world is moving on beneath him and it won't wait for him to find his feet. Loved loved loved it.",5.0

"Benjamin's shakiness and agitation, his DIY haircut, his clammy face, his wide-open glazed eyes, his bizarre timidity, his feeble whimpers, and his general atmosphere are all extremely unnerving. Actually, he's unbearable. I've had anxiety before; this is a fucking creepy weirdo. Hoffman's‚Äîdare I say it‚Äîshoddy acting (especially his strange intonations) unintentionally heightens this further.
Even the scene with the scuba equipment follows the same tone, as the camera slowly zooms out as Benjamin sinisterly lies motionless at the very bottom of the pool, the cloudy water slowly obscuring his figure. It was at this moment that Benjamin decided to murder his entire family with a corkscrew. That doesn't happen, but after the first 25 minutes that seems more likely than the real plot.
There's no allaying this creepiness. He does get less nervous. He stays just as creepy. ""I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson,"" he says after one date, which started at a strip club where Elaine cries and ended with the admission that he fucked her mother, an admission which tore her family apart. Afterwards, he stalks her and writes her name obsessively his desk. Then he drives six hours to her college to stalk her further. This is, again, after one date.

"Re-watching The Graduate is something I've been wanting to do for a while now. The first time I reviewed this, I gave this film a 9/10. I severely regret this now. 
They just don't make movies like this anymore. 
This film drives by so quickly. It sucks you in right from the beginning. Benjamin is one of the most interesting characters ever developed. His sexual struggles and desires, his often awkwardness, and his worriness about the future is so believable. Hoffman turns into the character itself with so much ease and transformation. 
Do you honestly get better than the ending as well? It's triumphant and insane. 
The soundtrack, especially the songs by Simon and Garfunkel are timeless and so catchy to this day. 
This is the classic that will stand the test of time forever. It's so relatable and iconic. And, I don't mean it's relatable in that you're sleeping with your parent's friend. I'm talking about the struggles of becoming an adult. I'm 15, and I'm worried about my future. What kind of job will I get? Will I succeed? Will I get to marry someone? The people around us expect certain things from us. Benjamin is constantly surrounded by people telling him the path to life. That's why this is so damn relatable. The future is scary to be completely honest. You hope for happiness, but many things can happen. It's just how we make our lives. One last thing, the editing in this movie is flawless. I really don't understand why this didn't win the Best Editing Oscar.

"As every generation comes of age, they think they are the first to rebel against convention and expectation ‚Äì that they are the first to see the world for what it is. No matter how specific the injustices that youth rails against, this energy to rebel always manifests in some form. One view would be that this is a product of the naivety of the youth; the other is that it is the consequence of the ability of previous generations to reconcile an unfair world.
It is in the universality of this generational urge to rebel that The Graduate gains its lasting power. From its iconic opening scene, we see that Benjamin Braddock feels isolated from the strange world that he has arrived into. He is static and expressionless, fixed to the same spot. But the technological winds of change motion him onwards regardless, in the form of the airport travelator. This sense of someone withdrawing and letting the world wash over him is seen again and again upon his return home, surrounded by the mediocrity and conformity of middle-aged suburbia. Day after day of aimless pool drinking and sordid homewrecking compound, blurring into one another.
Benjamin only comes to life when his path crosses with the only other person his age in this middle-class purgatory. Here, our would-be rebel discovers his cause. In Elaine Robinson, he sees an escape from his stifling surroundings. But the film more broadly suggests a sense of social rebellion writ large, highlighting student movements and agitators as the film moves from suffocating suburbia to the restless energy of the Berkley campus. Although Benjamin himself seems ignorant of anything beyond his own desires, his own small rebellion can thus be seen to relate to a broader sense of discontented youth.
Key to communicating this sense of withdrawal giving way to rebellion is the visual language of The Graduate. Images are beautifully composed and lit, particularly in the way that heavy shadows obscure faces and occasionally whole personages ‚Äì the shadowy vices hidden underneath idyllic suburbia. The camera largely moves with the same laconic energy as Benjamin, with zooms at key moments conveying isolation. But are so many flourishes of momentary genius that inject life into this, including something as basic as the slow refocusing of the camera on Elaine‚Äôs face as the truth about her mother and Benjamin dawns.
More important still is the editing, which evocatively captures how Benjamin‚Äôs withdrawal translates into empty summer days that blend into one another. Fades and one iconic match cut reflect the hazy passage of time. But as the film arrives in its final third, the purpose that Benjamin now feels reflects in a more energetic sense of pacing and narrative progression scene-to-scene. We can feel the newfound sense of purpose, as time seems to speed up rather than blur.
Of course, the emotional ambivalence of the ending hangs a question mark over this newfound purpose. Finally, Benjamin and Elaine triumph over the demands and restrictions imposed by the previous generation. As they make their escape from a lifetime of conformity and repression, their exuberance seems to be exploding out of them. But as the adrenaline and novelty of freedom wears off, their expressions become pensive. They‚Äôve won the freedom to truly forge their own lives, but what does that freedom actually mean? Sat in a bus that could be heading anywhere, neither Elaine nor Benjamin can answer that question.",5.0

Mike Nichols' The Graduate is an incredibly well directed, acted and edited, yet flawed, coming-of-age story.
Nichols does a great job conveying this sense of being overwhelmed, either having Hoffman's character among tight spaces or framing him in a way that gives off a claustrophobic feeling.
The score is pretty good, with two classic songs, but the way it's used can get irritating. They literally used the same song three times in‚Ä¶",4.0

"Watching Benjamin and Elaine's bus scene is very relatable to me.

"An excellent work that perfectly captures, more than 'Easy Rider', the dystopian world that the younger generation of the 60's found themselves in, when figuring out whether to acclimatize to the existing establishment or to rebel against it and create their own world, rules and happiness. The soundtrack is amazing, and the climactic sequence is one of the most memorable in all of cinema.",4.5
"As I was looking through my movie collection, searching for a feel-good film to watch tonight to remedy the bad evening I was having, I came across my Criterion Collection edition of The Graduate that I bought on my 19th birthday a little over a month ago. The craving for a stereotypical ""feel-good"" movie went out the window instantly. I hadn't seen the Criterion edition yet and immediately knew this was going to be the right choice for tonight.
First, the transfer. The beautiful 4K restoration. Jesus. Everything looks so vibrant. Everyone looks so beautiful.
Second, I've seen it about once a year since I first watched it as a thirteen year old and it's so interesting to see it now as a college student. This is also my first time watching since graduating from high school. You pick up on the themes a lot better the older you get, I think. You understand Benjamin more the older you get. Actually, this summer I was Benjamin.
Third, ""I've had this feeling ever since I graduated. This kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. It's like I was playing some kind of game, but the rules don't make any sense to me. They're being made up by all the wrong people. I mean no one makes them up. They seem to make themselves up."" Dead on.",5.0
"It's been a bit since I last watched The Graduate. And even the last time I watched it I feel like I wasn't giving it my 100% attention. The movie has a well known reputation for being a comedy film, but this time around I found it tone closer to the drama side of things, edging on pure dark comedy.
In some sense I think I'm beginning to subscribe a bit to the thinking of the great Roger Ebert, who came to see a swap in roles between Bancroft and Hoffman. In the beginning it's painstakingly obvious that Mrs. Robinson is in the cougar role. She is looking for an outlet. We don't really find out why until later, but for the first section the film she is 100% in control.
Then, after the two finally do the big deed, I noticed a massive shift in dynamic through two scenes. The first is the losing of Ben's virginity, with a dreamy sequence of Ben finally floating on the water (as opposed to being under it as we've seen up to this point) and shifting between his life at home and his life in the hotel room now with Mrs Robinson. The whole sequence is punctuated by an outstanding use of Simon and Garfunkel's April Come She Will. We get the passage of time as well as the literal shift in persona on Hoffman's face.
The second scene that truly shifts the dynamic is, I believe, the final time the two meet in the hotel room. This is where Bancroft truly gets the moment to shine and steals the scene totally from Hoffman. She conveys so much through such simple, painful, sadness in her eyes. The conversation concerning where the two are at, how they feel about this morally, and the prospect of Mrs. Robinson's returning daughter Elaine.
Now normally, this first half of the movie or so is where I consider things to be at a perfect pacing. Moving into the second half is where I usually start to take some minor issues with the films somewhat outdated techniques and mindsets. Even some of the plot points I began to question as usual. The idea of wanting to get married after a single date seems antiquated on the surface, even if it ties in with Ben's act first think second mindset. Perhaps my largest issue with this part is Ben essentially stalking Elaine and this being perceived as ""healthy"" or ""loving"". Perhaps thats just a ploy to lure us into thinking these two might have a chance after all. Maybe Ben really can stop the wedding and get the girl of his dreams! Fortunately the film doesn't take the easy way out, and while I never found Ben sympathetic to begin with, this time I found him downright unlikable.
You see after the dynamic shifts I don't believe that Ben is still the dewey eyed moon cow that he is in the beginning. He gets cocky, he gets arrogant and reckless. While some people see this movie in a negative light because of the way it portrays Mrs Robinson as a predator, i'm beginning to realize thats a false analysis. Mrs Robinson, is a depressed, alcoholic and lonely woman who puts on the facade of being the strong, controlling type, but as the film wears on and the mask breaks down we see just how damaged she is. Ben was so clearly taking advantage of her by the end I'm surprised I never read it this way before.
It's all completely punctuated by that final shot. The happy couple on the bus, finally beat the mean, cliche adults who wanted to tell them what to do, only to sit for a moment and realize just how naive and downright stupid their thinking is. As Elaine looks over to Ben with hope in her eyes and Ben looks straight ahead, never looking at her, we see all the pain he's caused to others rush into his headspace. He fucked up. He know's it, and he's not likely to admit it at this point. Yet the two go on towards an uncertain future, and one I picture is just the beginning of his own misery.",4.5

"""Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduuce me.""
What an awesome film. I finally watched this cinema that I have heard for so many years to be a classic. It was very unique for a great start to all love stories in cinema history. Going into this film with very little knowledge on the film, I was very surprised with how the story played out. The cinematography may have been poor, but I didn't let that affect my judging of this film due to the time period. Simon and Garfunkel, what a great movie to kick of the classic song. However, I did like the official version better then the one played in this film.
Oh Dustin Hoffman, you beautiful bastard. You make me feel every time in your films. Coming into this film as just a kid, delivering this performance, I thank you for giving yourself to the cinema age. Many of his films I have seen as him being middle-aged, so it was nice to see him at the beginning of his career. All I can say is, he was definitely born to do this.
I have seen many love stories before, but this twist that I have not seen in too many other films. The complexity of each of the characters' lives had great build up, especially with Ben. It showed him turning from a shy college student, turning into something he is not. The stress given off from Ben could easily show that he wasn't in his right place.",4.0
"Having watched this film for the first time, it is quite clear why this is timeless classic and I stress the word timeless. This film holds up so well considering it being 46 years young.
The Graduate has a simplistic plot but is truly engaging, solid performances throughout from all involved and the music is absolutely fantastic. The film is well constructed and has a twist of comedy and drama. Dustin Hoffman turns in a great performance and I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt a big surprise when he was nominated for an Oscar in this role.
With the soundtrack, direction and performances, The Graduate has become one of the most remarkable love stories, this film is near perfect and I would delightfully revisit this in the future.",4.0
"if you know me and you‚Äôve spoken to me recently, you probably know that i‚Äôve been in a bit of a funk. part loneliness part uncertainty and part just feeling‚Ä¶.off. i didn‚Äôt realize until coming home for thanksgiving that it‚Äôs a really shitty feeling when everyone is asking you ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù and you need to sit there and say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know.‚Äù i‚Äôm graduating college in may and i can safely say that i have no clue what‚Äôs coming next.
when people ask me what my favorite film is, i always say it‚Äôs this. which is strange because i hardly ever watch it. it‚Äôs one of those things where it‚Äôs so incredibly special that i almost feel like my heart can‚Äôt take watching it all the time. so when the american cinematheque announced that they‚Äôd be screening this in 35mm with a q&a afterwards with dustin hoffman, i had to go. 
i won‚Äôt lie and say that watching this in a packed theater with benjamin braddock himself got me out of my funk entirely, but it certainly helped. there‚Äôs a lot of beauty in uncertainty and i think that sometimes i need to remind myself of that. i‚Äôm so happy that this movie exists <3",5.0

A delicately directed swirl of indirect sympathy and a almost disconnection from reality in a silly fantasy that is never complete, perpetually going. With at the center, Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs character being quite literally successful, at something he doesn‚Äôt know if he wants to. He‚Äôs any graduate, clumsily running around in a funny, bleak fashion cause only now, he takes his steps on his own.
He makes big gestures, and is easily taken back and forth, seeing new things left and right ‚Äî doing all the above.
But he looks away right after.
Remaining in bed with Mrs. Robinson, somehow living in complete darkness as they make love, routinely staring off.
Nothing moves forward, Mrs. Robinson, Elaine, and Benjamin are all just sort of forced to or go for it, there is no reasoning. It‚Äôs the most saddest love triangle ever, and one that is meant to be funny. It is quite funny, but then..
 The sounds of silence, creeping in their brains.
 It somehow remains even in the most happy of places.
And so does the legacy of this film, somehow. And at this point you probably even know certain scenes even without watching it. 
It‚Äôs almost ironic that it has become as iconic as it is. As if it should be shimmered in iconography and happy ol‚Äô references.
Trolls uses it as a joke, but it‚Äôs empty reverence for imagery.
The classic interruption, runaway wedding ending that has endlessly lived in hopeful or ironic laughter, is just a road to the same bus stop. Elaine and Benjamin have learned only to scream each others names, not to understand ‚Äî they have learned nothing. And somehow people forget that, a trick of the memory.
For a film about a loss of innocence, and trying to find direction without any teacher, people hold this movie in such happiness.
When it never was, and maybe, we were just trying to ignore the silence.",5.0

"Hello, darkness my old friend.
A movie scientifically designed in a lab to cause an existential crisis in every young person regardless of the generation. A movie that uses humor as a razor-sharp tool to carve open the facade of false promises fed to fresh graduates in general and fresh male graduates in particular. A movie that is supremely erotic and sexually liberating without being exploitative or gratuitous.
The Graduate is a one-hour forty-five-minute long film school disguised as a motion picture. From the opening shot to the very last frame, every choice made by the filmmakers is a reminder of the kind of genius required to create true art. Nothing is ordinary. Nothing is safe. The rules of cinema are taken apart and put back together to create a unique grammar that has been endlessly referenced since 1967. Each scene is a complete story in itself, taking you on an emotional journey through the use of sweeping cinematography, dynamic staging, kinetic editing, and captivating performances.
Performances that are simultaneously incredibly natural and just heightened enough to be both relatable and entertaining. Anne Bancroft is devilishly gorgeous as the seductive Mrs. Robinson. She is heartbreakingly lonely. Just watching her face during each scene is an absolute treat. She paints a picture of a woman who had to make hard choices in her youth and is looking to rekindle the flame that once burned brightly. Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, is wonderful as the dazed young boy trying to fit into a grown-up world. His back and forth (back and forth huh! get it? Nothing? okay) with Anne Bancroft is hilariously awkward and oddly romantic.
And obviously, the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack is mesmerizing, melancholic, joyful, immersive, and frankly way better than what we deserve as a species.",5.0
"Opening half is far stronger than the second, which uses Scarbourguh Fair about four times more than is absolutely necessary - but the surprisingly complex and layered script about disconnection and identity and drifting, landing on some powerful, thoughtful musings. The mighty fine performances from the cast elevate it further: I think this is easily my favourite Dustin Hoffman performance.",4.0
"One of my favorite things in the whole world. This jumped to my second favorite movie and wouldn't be surprised if it became my favorite at some point. I've been dealing a lot lately with people trying to tell me what to do or what I can and cannot do (specifically my parents), not really knowing who I want to be, and the fact that I graduate college next summer with a degree in media theory. I related to Ben so much this time that I feel like I am him, but I'd be suspicious of anyone my age who didn't relate to him.
There's a melancholic feeling throughout but it's also hilarious. It's the kind of humor I love and wish I could write. To me the sadness washes over you as soon as it's over. Even without Simon and Garfunkel's wonderful music this would be a masterpiece, but with it it's one of the greatest movies ever made. This is my 5th time watching it and it does not show one sign of wearing on me.
I know the ending is supposed to be dark, how they got away but they still probably won't make it together much like Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, but I also think it's optimistic. If you're going to fail you should fail on your own accord. For once, Ben and Elaine made their own decision to do something rather than listening to what other people told them. Maybe we're all bound to fail and we should fail our way and not someone else's.",5.0
"‚ÄúSimpsons did it!‚Äù
Gugh! Throughout the entire church scene that line kept going through my head! At one point I just hoped Dustin Hoffman would fall through the window Abe Simpson style. Guess that's what comes with it being an American classic I suppose.
I've mentioned this in my first Force Awakens review, but like Mrs Robinson, classic films can sometimes rub me the wrong way. Sometimes it feels like I'm watching this faded relic made for another audience. Clunkiness sometimes can be more noticeable, the messages can grow irrelevant the more time has passed, and the praise can set it on a pedestal so high a new viewer could possibly never reach it. The Graduate thankfully doesn't fall into (most of) those traps, still holding up as the delightfully cynical tale that inspired so many films today.
The film follows Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) an introvert graduate student that has no clue where he's heading. What course did he study? Who knows. What did he do during his four years there? Beats me. What career does he want to purs- ‚Äúyou know what, stop asking me that‚Äù is what he'll say, since he sure doesn't have the answer himself. From the minute Braddock walks aimlessly into frame, as we hear Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs ""The Sound of Silence‚Äù in the iconic airport opening shot, you understand just how isolated and unguided he really is. Benjamin in a way is like myself, and many other students transitioning from youth to maturity: Existing, without any clue where life will take us. Right off the bat, that's scary shit, man. Really. And it should have freaked the fuck out of its 1967 audience, because even today, god damn.
Once he returns home, he reluctantly finds himself in the arms of Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who wants nothing more than to make it rain, man (10 points if you get that). Her character could have been quite one dimensional, playing the sexual diva role up for pure comedic effect, but the film does make an effort to flesh her out. Yes, in a sense she does just want to jump on Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs tootsie roll (try go for 20 points), but we see she too is lost. Once having ambitions of her own in school, which were blocked by her own aimless actions and inactions that lead her here. Left with a marriage she doesn't care for, having an affair with a twenty-something year old introvert, and raising her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) who Ben of course grows an undying, ungrounded infatuation for.
The way Mike Nichols handles this relationship was quite interesting, particularly because of how annoyed it got me. We see that Elaine is quite similar to Ben, as the two seem to be searching desperately for the privilege they feel due, both of which wanting this through a romanticised, fake version of love and false attraction to one another. While the development of this wasn't as pitch perfect as I wanted it to be, the ending immediately leaves you cold as the characters themselves begin to realise the unfulfilled hole left in their hearts, unsure how long this relationship will last, with their desires still yet to be filled. All told through three shots, facial expression and one simple song. It's brilliant storytelling.
In regards to negatives, I did have a few things I couldn't really get behind. A minor aspect was some of the dialogue and performances feeling a bit ""showy"" and artificial, particularly the parents and relatives, that never really sucked me out of the movie, but it did distract. The part I did find troubling was the execution of Elaine and Ben. I totally understand the relationship is meant to develope quickly. That's what makes the final shot brilliant. One issue I had was it felt almost *too* instantaneous. As though the film took place over the span of two weeks, at least six of those days the two knowing each other and by end she has already considered marrying two guys. One of which she's actually going through with. A rewatch may help, but that transition of time in this viewing just wasn't as clear as I wanted it to be. In addition to that, Ben had this looming predatory vibe over Elaine towards the third act, which didn't reinforce the ending, but instead made me question how they both mutually got to that point. After his affair is revealed to her, Ben constantly tries to win her back, and we see this with him following her to the library, pursuing her on the bus, pursuing her to the Zoo (where she's meeting a guy) pressuring her for details about this guy, and by the end she goes along with the false romanticized idea. The ending still works, but before then it just made me a bit ill and left me wondering how A lead to C. Might need to think that over too.
The Graduate, despite all that, is pretty damn solid, people. And you are going to watch it‚Ä¶‚Äùaren't you‚Äù?",4.0
"Why does everyone like this so much? How is this a ""classic""? I don't get it.
For starters, don't cast a 30 year old to play a 20-21 year old. It looks absurd. Sometimes older actors can be passed off as younger characters and it works but there was no way a 30 year old Dustin Hoffman passed as a recent college grad. As such, any time that his father or family friend would ask him about schooling or any other young adult thing it would look ridiculous because Hoffman couldn't pull it off.
I'm almost certain my main qualm with this film, aside from the fact that it's boring, can be attributed to a generational difference. Maybe in 1967 it was normal for people to go on one date, fall in love, and discuss getting married. Nowadays that is very outlandish. Thus, when Ben and Elaine go on one date after not having seen each other for 4-5 years and claim to be in love and discuss marriage it comes off as farfetched and unrealistic. Maybe in 1967 this wouldn't have bothered me, but now, in 2014, it does. Unfortunately these era specific differences are usually what have caused me to not like the majority of old(er) films.
Had I watched this right after graduating college I don't know if it would've ""spoken to me"". That is what I kept hearing the past--that recent college grads should watch this as it deals with issues that those people will be dealing with. I am not so sure. Not much here seems relatable. Yes, Ben displays feelings of hopelessness and uncertainty regarding his post-college future, like most new graduates, but those sentiments are put on the back-burner and the film moves in a different, unrelated direction.

The timelessness, the relatability, the humor, the music; it all had me entranced from moment one to that oh so beautiful ending, one that I'll probably be thinking about for a while. I loved this! I loved this a whole lot! But as I watched it, I couldn't help but realize how much I'll likely LOVE this someday. It's just that kind of movie. One that'll live forever.",4.0
"If this is what being a graduate is like, oh god I cannot wait to graduate.
This isn‚Äôt just a ridiculously fun and engaging film but it‚Äôs also expertly crafted. There are these masterful parallels between the camera movements/ shot selection and the dialogue to perfectly invoke feelings of anxiety and unnerves. Close and constant movement in the hallway full of people, but still and medium close ups when alone or with Mrs Robinson and then later removing this and replacing it with Elaine‚Äôs presence.
Most notable is that under the leg shot. It‚Äôs just breathtakingly good.
Dustin Hoffmans acting is so ranged as welll- he masters comedy, fear, and excitement, which brings another element to the well-crafted film that truly elevates it to one of the greatest of all time.
It feels as if everything is intentional with the camera but there‚Äôs an experimental side as well, which makes it feel fresh but impressive.

What an AMAZING film! I don't know where to start! First off, the soundtrack, FLAWLESS! One of the best I have ever heard! I will now listen to Mrs. Robinson and Scarborough Fair on repeat! And also hearing ""The sound of silence"" in this film was AWESOME, obviously! The cinematography in this film was INCREDIBLE! Each shot in this film is STUNNING to look at! The lighting in this film was also GORGEOUS! The dark and light were flawlessly portrayed and very realistic to look at! The comedy and jokes landed perfectly and felt very real! I had a couple laughs here and there but dang...Dustin Hoffmans performance in this film was PERFECT! He was incredibly awkward, funny, shy, confused, worried and I absolutely loved it! He is the most relatable character I have seen in a film! Everyone in this film were OUTSTANDING and the chemistry of Hoffman and the 2 woman were BRILLIANT! The ""PG"" rating is definitely outdated which of course was set in the 60s. But overall, I REALLY REALLY ENJOYED this film so much and perhaps be in the list of my favorite films of all time!

I really feel there's two sides to the film: Benjamin's and Mrs. Robinson's. Won't start to analyse either cause it would probably be some poor analysis, but I really enjoyed The Graduate. Loved the humour, the music and both relationships Ben has with Mrs. Robinson and Elaine. Terrific performances from everyone too; and Katharine Ross is so beautiful.

"""The Graduate"" stirs up comedy and drama in its premise and it certainly does blend well together. The soundtrack and the cinematography are what make it iconic though. Throw in some amusing but well thought-out characters and we get a good story out of their dilemmas.
It may not be as grounded in reality as some might like it to be but I think that's part of the charm. It is a 'chasing dreams' sort of fantasy that only happens in our own heads and not in reality. This is probably what makes the Mrs. Robinson character sort of tragic but also devious in nature. While her daughter represents the 'eternal good & innocence' that Dustin Hoffman's character so desperately desires. The fact that they hit it off right away is what makes that desire feel so much more urgent and important than anything else.
By the end though we can see how rash decisions can stir up complicated and ambiguous moments that make the dream seem impossible, even when it is in the palm of our hands. Thus, we are left with the burning question; does everything turn out alright in the end? For me personally, I am left to believe that we are right back where we started when the ending credits roll. It is a great coming-of-age tale that recalls back to the similar works in literature that came before it. The whole 'life after college' bit is the main thing that will hook young adults too most likely. Not knowing what to do with one's future is probably something most of us have experienced before or eventually will. And that's when the rash decisions start coming into play.
Overall it is a fun ride. Dustin Hoffman plays the naive and gullible character very well but also supplies an emotional edge to him as well as the story progresses. His actions are not necessarily heroic but I did find myself rooting for him by the end. We get a good observer's view of all the events that unfold that keeps us entertained. The fact that the viewers get to draw their own conclusions by the end is what makes ""The Graduate"" memorable. The mixed feelings serve as a good statement on what life is like in general. Did Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman's character) make the right choice? To society's standards the answer would most likely be no. And so this film has a hidden cyclical nature to its premise and outcome. This is especially prevalent in the grey and morally ambiguous areas of the film. And since we see mostly what Benjamin sees and perceives, it is especially hard to discern what is going on in the minds of the others.
By the end the characters accomplish relatively little but it is the colorful journey that leads them to where they are at now that makes it all the worthwhile. Uncertain futures make for some great storytelling. It's probably more of a black comedy than anything else really and the 'humor' will most likely go over most peoples' heads. The showdown at the church is pretty hysterical though. Most people will probably really enjoy that one part of the film if not anything else. It's a personal favorite of mine and it is definitely worth a watch for those looking for a great onscreen affair.",5.0
The movie still works like gangbusters BUT I've always had a very big problem with Mrs. Robinson's complexities disappearing in the third act as she becomes just a one-dimensional villain. It really does her character a disservice as she's so strongly written in the rest of the movie!,4.0
Finally got around to seeing this for the first time. This was definitely a very strange film considering when it was made. And thats not a bad thing. I didn't know that it was supposed to be funny. I assumed that it was going to be a dark drama. Dustin Hoffman was great as the insanely awkward Benjamin Braddock. I feel this character and his Rain Man role are almost the same. I had a blast watching this with my mother on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Lately my mom has been recommending some good movies. I understand now why The Graduate is an important piece of American cinema.,4.5
"Wow. 
I really don't know what to say.
This movie is just absolutely perfect in nearly every way imaginable. 
Dustin Hoffman gets so much emotion out of his performance as the desperate and neurotic Benjamin Braddock that by the third act you are just begging for him to come out okay.
Mrs. Robinson is one of the most memorable antagonists ever to be put to screen. She is so despicable and discomforting with her schemes against Ben, yet Anne Bancroft gives somewhat of an emotional center, showing a dissatisfied housewife just begging for something different in her life.
I shouldn't forget to mention Simon and Garfunkel's ominous and soothing soundtrack, creating some of the greatest songs of the century (""Hello darkness, my old friend..."").
I found that the biggest reason for why The Graduate is such an essential film to be studied in classes is not the performances, but the tone set by the unnerving cinematography  and effective drama, mixed with a surprising amount of light-hearted comedy.
This will be a movie that I will think about for years to come, as a staple of my history of film-watching and as one of the greatest movies ever made.

"Love it when a movie is designed for two parallel viewing experiences: the standard romantic drama sexual awakening movie for most people, and a relentlessly anxious bad vibes watch for anyone with difficult family relationships and a history of being yelled at and manipulated by sexual partners. Fortunately (?), I got to have both viewing experiences, the former as an undergrad when I was assigned this movie for a class, the latter this afternoon.
It's so difficult to watch Ben, a terminally square figure destined for a standard, ""safe"" cishetero marriage by tragic circumstance suffer so much at the hands of the Robinsons in an uncommon inversion of the standard ""outsider ruins family"" plot. His desire for Elaine, seemingly motivated purely by it being in line with what his parents would expect of him, keeps him alive through some nasty body blows and truly psychotic behavior by her parents. But it is genuinely thrilling to see him transform from the anxious, autistic sheltered kid at the beginning into a fearless tiger by the end, and this energy sustained me through the totally incongruent happy ending.
The only reprieve from the tension is the road movie in the second half, which is regularly interrupted by the plot. I don't know if you know this, but the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack in this movie is excellent. The way that ""Mrs. Robinson"" plays as Ben drives to the church, has its instrumental parts extended on his pit stops, and then slows and sputters out and ends with a loud chord when his car breaks down and he has to run the rest of the way is one of the best uses of music in one of the best bits of cinema of all time.",4.0

"The first half to two-thirds of this movie were quickly and easily in my favorite movies of all time, because wow, what an incredible set up 
This is a fantastic example of a strong and simple premise executed perfectly, and the viewer is thrust into the film just as Benjamin is thrust into the real world
A million questions about the future, no answers in sight, and unable to enjoy the present. Until Mrs. Robinson. Yet as living in the present goes, eventually you have to move forward or look back, and this film does an incredible job at working through all three realms of time in a way that feels so organic and natural
Reminiscing on a life that is long gone, clinging to what you can. Trying to set up a future that brings you back to a time that is long gone. Doing whatever, or whoever, you want in the hopes of hanging on a bit longer. When the future is uncertain, we look to the last until we can‚Äôt anymore. Hopefully, by the time we look to the future again, there are still options available
Although this film goes off the rails a bit in the final third, that ending is so perfect and eases my qualms about how it gets there
Dustin Hoffman is a gem, and I can‚Äôt believe this is a debut because it feels as if they plucked an actual graduate out of class and into the film
He‚Äôs quirky, he‚Äôs clearly in so deeply over his head, and he‚Äôs just a charm to watch in the early half
Mrs. Robinson is such a fantastically layered character, and she really is the thematic crux of the whole film
I wish Elaine had more, because it would strengthen the ending and final third more in my opinion
There‚Äôs also so many nuances in this that are mind bogglingly great, such as the slow focus change when Elaine has her revelation or the deep zooms in and out with Ben and Mrs. Robinson

"""Hello darkness my old friend...""
+Dustin Hoffman is excellent playing an awkward 21 year old- Ben Braddock. His facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on. Anne Bancroft is also great as Mrs Robinson.
+The film is shot really well, I loved the smooth scene transitions and cinematography. I can see why it was technically ground breaking for the time.
+The plot is enjoyable from start to finish.
+I really enjoyed the dark comedy, especially between Ben and Mrs Robinson.
+The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack fit the tone of the film perfectly. In fact it's like one big Simon and Garfunkel music video.
+The final shot is iconic, I love the fact that the mood changes so quickly from excitement to what happens now?
-In the opening act there is a strange edit where Ben looks down at Mrs Robinson's body, and we see what he sees for literally 1 frame at a time. I get this is the effect that they were trying to achieve, but the edit looked choppy to me.
9/10
Overall- The Graduate is a timeless classic.

DID YOU KNOW- During rehearsals of Dustin Hoffman's and Anne Bancroft's first encounter in the hotel room, Bancroft did not know that Hoffman was going to grab her breast. Hoffman decided to do it because it reminded him of schoolboys trying to nonchalantly grab girls' breasts in the hall by pretending to put their jackets on. When Hoffman did it, Director Mike Nichols began laughing loudly. Hoffman began to laugh as well, so rather than stop the scene, he turned away and walked to the wall. Hoffman banged his head on the wall, trying to stop laughing, and Nichols thought it was so funny, it stayed in the finished film.",4.5

"Ever since 'The Graduate' was referenced in the opening monologue of Marc Webb's '(500) Days of Summer' I had wanted to sit down and check it out.
This film packs an almighty punch. From the melancholy opening credits with Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin arriving home from college, to the movie's soul crushing final moments. This is not a feature for the faint of heart.
Mike Nichols produces a reflection of society that is still relevant today.
If it wasn't, would I really be this taken away by it? 
Described as a ""comedy/drama,"" 'The Graduate' has more in common with an ancient tragedy than a modern comedic adventure. Hoffman's Ben falls for Mrs. Robinson, an alcoholic mother, and wife of his father's friend. Hoffman's neurotic and anxious acting has transcended into so many films these days. A truely remarkable performance.
Now, I finished high school (about) a month ago. And I find myself in a similar scenario to Ben. I'm not having an affair with my dad's friend's wife, don't worry. But I am struggling to work out where I am going to go next. Part of me wants to write, part of me wants to act. Then a whole other part of me feels one of these jobs may be too ""dreamy"" for an Adelaide boy. 
In some bizarre way, 'The Graduate' helped a lot. To see where you go, and what you do when you are not ready. In telling the tragedy of Ben and the Robinsons, Nichols has given this young author a boost in storytelling capacity.",5.0
"Mike Nichols‚Äô 1967 comedy/drama ‚Äì newly restored and special edition-ed by the Criterion Collection ‚Äì was one of the key instigators of the New Hollywood movement, and as such, it‚Äôs hard to work up much of anything new to say about it. But a fresh viewing reveals that much of what‚Äôs stuck in the popular memory is all but confined to the first 30 minutes and the last ten, though the innovative use of pop music and inventive cutting reverberate throughout. Yet what‚Äôs strongest is the overall sense of displacement, the way Nichols uses off-angles, flash cutting, discombobulated sound, and general unsteadiness to create both empathy and detachment, and then ferociously tears those devices down with the rawness of Elaine‚Äôs discovery scene and their subsequent fight in his room in Berkeley. And even the iconic moments maintain their impact; you can watch this movie a dozen times and keep making discoveries in Ben and Elaine‚Äôs expressions in that famous penultimate image.",4.5

"Just brilliant from start to finish. It perfectly captures that depressive mood of having absolutely no ambition about your future.
Hoffman gives one of my favourite performances of all time. It's so dry and sad that you can't help but laugh. The scene where he's waiting behind the doors on his 21st birthday is honestly one of the funniest things ever to me - simply because of how perfectly and monatonously Hoffman delivers those lines.
As a viewer we know his decisions are completely eratic and probably terrible ideas - for instance, moving town to convince a woman who hates you to marry you. But we get so swept up in his spontaneouity that we can't help but root for him. It's so exciting watching him finally take control of his own life, regardless of our nagging doubts over how it will actually end up for him.
Ultimately this leads into that ending where he rushes to stop the wedding like a complete fucking lunatic. Despite being too late he just goes for it and is able to run off with Elaine in the end. And then we get that iconic final shot: one of the best movie endings of all time. The dust settles, the excitement wears off and Ben and Elaine are left with doubt and regret. But at least they finally took charge of their lives, and won't always wonder what could have been.",5.0
"I don't understand why people like this movie. If I could give it fewer stars, I would. I genuinely don't think anyone who worked on the script has ever had a human interaction before. Absolutely nothing anyone said or did made sense. Elaine was the dumbest girl I've ever seen portrayed on screen. Let's look at her relationship with freaking Ben.
Ben is having an affair with her mother. Granted, she's unaware, but she goes out with this idiot who is rude and takes her to a strip joint and is completely humiliated. Leaves in tears, Ben gives one simple ""sorry"" and kisses her without any indication that's what she wants. In fact, she should be absolutely pissed and disgusted by this guy. But nope. Then they talk for like 5 minutes or something, and everything changes. They decide to go to the hotel where he is having an affair with her mother, and then she learns he has been having an affair with someone. They agree to a second date, yet before they are on it, HE TELLS ELAINE IT IS HER FREAKING MOTHER HE HAS BEEN HAVING SEX WITH. She's understandably pissed and wants nothing to do with this douche. Then she leaves for Berkeley, and he straight follows her and precedes to actually STALK her. Chases her down and interrupts her date. At this point, the audience has no clue what she knows about the affair other than what he told her and any unknown conversation with the mother. The next time we see Elaine, it's in Ben's room; how the crap did she know where he lived???? She shows up and basically says Ben was raping her mom. Yet she seems super casual about saying that. She shows up at this stalker's room believing he raped her mom. Smart. He gives some crap excuse with no confidence in what he's saying, and that's it. Elaine completely forgets about the rape because he says otherwise. No further conversation. Then the conversation dynamic flips, and she is kind and asking questions about what's next, and he's a big douche canoe again with his standoff attitude, believing she has the audacity to ask any questions to mister high and mighty. Not even once does this idiot apologize for sleeping with her mom. No sorry whatsoever. Then she returns another night with an indeterminate amount of time and says, ""Kiss me."" He does and immediately follows it up with a marriage proposal, AND SHE SAYS MAYBE. She actually says maybe. Ben then proceeds to be the most annoying human to ever exist and hounds her to marry him as soon as possible. Mr. Robinson finally comes in to confront the dickweed, who is entirely in the right to get him to stay away from Elaine. Buuuuuuut noooo, Ben‚Äôs got to have it his way. So he chases her down and interrupts the marriage, and they run off together. And they are sitting in the back of the bus and they say nothing. Ben's character is the worst lead I've ever seen. Sharknado has a better lead. Ben has no spine and is a hypocritical piece of garbage. Not somebody to root for. I can't believe people like this movie.",0.5

"Why does Ben whimper at some points in the film, is he nervous?
This was one of the films that propelled my interest in film as a whole. Therefore, I feel indebted to it and the other films that did so. However, I have lowered it from a 4.5 to a 4 for now because I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs equivalent to a 9/10. 
The first couple of scenes with Mrs Robinson and Ben are hilarious, the way Ben tries to fake confidence and makes an ass out of himself is great. The performances are all fine, with Bancroft and Ross being the 2 best in my opinion. Hoffman is good too but there are the odd scenes with questionable deliveries. The cinematography is something that I particularly enjoy in this film. The dialogue is good too, there is quite a lot of smart word play but there are very few times the dialogue felt clunky. 
I‚Äôve seen complaints about this film romanticising the subject area and I have to completely disagree. The first time Ben sleeps with Mrs Robinson and his subsequent confidence boost is backed by The Sound of Silence which albeit a groovy song is described as ‚Äúthe inability of people to communicate with each other, and not particularly internationally but especially emotionally, so that what you see around you is people who are unable to love each other‚Äù by Simon and Garfunkel and has clear undertones of sadness.

"The morality of a privileged social class so demanding that it protects its own deserters between the facade of opulence and traditional values. At a time when the sexual revolution was at its dawn, the film directly addresses the various aspects in relation to marriage, sex and power. All these problems are filled with hedonism and love interest. The interesting thing is that this does not lead to satisfaction either. An unhappy marriage of a woman, a young man discovering pleasure in his youth and the ostentation of the rich, while exposing their power projection with young people. And it shows life itself with a beautiful and relevant soundtrack.",4.5

This is easily Dustin Hoffman's best performance, yet I absolutely fell in love with both Katharine Ross and Anne Bancroft. I was having a wonderful time from the minute I hit play, but that ending swept me entirely off my feet despite already being familiar with the final shot. This was one of the most well shot movies I have seen for a while, from the first frame to the last. I already can't wait to revisit this gem, I can see it becoming a firm favourite.

"The Graduate: Having just finished college and concerned about his future, Ben becomes romantically involved with a friend of his parents‚Äô, the intoxicating Mrs. Robinson, soon after having his attention drawn to her daughter. Dustin Hoffman as Ben embodies the angst and confusion of adulthood, having been on the straight and narrow all his life without much deviation. Anne Bancroft is alluring yet domineering as Mrs. Robinson, dissatisfied with where she‚Äôs at in life, trying to recapture her youth. Through their encounters, Ben awakens a side of himself he didn‚Äôt know was in him, taking more risks and putting everything on the line for love. Mike Nichols‚Äôs direction is visually playful and full of energy, conveying a sense of isolation and emptiness felt by the characters. Shots of Ben being carried on a conveyor belt at the airport or walking down a long dark hallway in a hotel emphasizes these moods. The scene where Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce Ben is a great example of camera work and visual storytelling. Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs music adds a layer of melancholy and quirkiness to the events, emphasizing the uncertainty of what lies ahead for their futures. Overall, a classic coming-of-age tale with sharp writing and timeless appeal.

"I watched this around 25 years ago when I was a teenager. I found it unremarkable but ticked it off my list of classic movies that I was supposed to watch as part of my film education.
This time round, to my own surprise, I was captivated from beginning to end. It is interesting how much the a person can change over the passage of time to see something in one moment as average to then become a revelation.
The Graduate is a film more about existential crisis than it is a ""coming of age story"". It is significantly elevated by Hofmann's quick, its post modernist sentiment, Nichols striking symbolism and the ethereal qualities of Simon and Garfunkel's music.
What interests me the most isn't the morality of the film because there isn't any. In fact Benjamin & Elaine probably won't stay together in the future in most part due to his erratic and odd nature. The point is that love shouldn't be governed by pragmatism, its should be free and selfish. It should be determined by individual and not the world around it.
Two of my favourite scenes involve movement and the concept of moving forward. The first is the moving airport walkway in the opening credits that a dejected and pensive Benjamin is pulled along by and taken into the future by the expectation of the world around him. The next, near the end, is after a moment of intuitive agency after an epiphany to stop the wedding. In his red car he hurtles past neon streetlights at breakneck speed as they reflect the electrifying colours of his emotional state. It is in making choices that fulfil our instincts that, for better or worse, we are truly alive.
The Graduate isn't about the outcomes or moral certainties in life. Its about living in a world of sensibility and the animal within us yearning against it.",5.0

Not to sound like some old 70 year old studio executive but man, what a film. What a picture. A marvel in editing and clever blocking. Just completely suffocating and chaotic. Dustin Hoffman gives an insanely great performance, as does everyone else.

"This is Tye. He‚Äôs a little worried about his future. 
It‚Äôs only my second year currently, but I am as clueless as ever about... everything. I have a hard time seeing this world as something worth progressing into. I just don‚Äôt see the point in such misery. Part of me hoped The Graduate would help open my eyes about this uncertainty, while also delivering on the iconic film I‚Äôve heard a decent amount about overtime. Although I can‚Äôt say for certain that I feel assured by watching it, I can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs a solid classic that‚Äôs both entertaining and tense.
Three strong, charismatic performances from Hoffman, Bancroft, and Ross make for a terrific cast, alongside everyone else involved in-front of the camera. It‚Äôs got wonderfully varied cinematography, with clean lighting and quality production design. I was blown away at the sleek editing on display throughout, with flawless transitions at key moments that I could not believe were from a film dating back to 1967. I greatly enjoyed the script, as well as the directing from Mike Nichols. The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, while a tad bit repetitive, provided a nice, fairly calming mood to fill the scene. Like the kind of music one would listen to while going for a long drive on a beautiful summers day. I also picked up some neat symbolism here-and-there. 
This is more-or-less a brief summary of what I think of the film, since it‚Äôs such a well-known feature after all these years, and I‚Äôve got a lot of worrying consuming my mind. Regardless, I had a great time finally watching The Graduate.",4.0

As stupid as Benjamin is, I still relate to him due to him being lost in a stressful world where he is just trying to find both relaxation and meaning. His relationship with Mrs. Robinson can be seen as a way of finding comfort (and excitement) during a stressful time, while his relationship with Elaine represents his desire to find meaning in this world. This simple love triangle speaks more to viewers who are willing to read outside the lines, which as a result, leads to a much more satisfying viewing experience of this classic.",5.0

Even knowing it was coming, the ending hits like a ton of bricks. All that has happened between the first scene and there and still the sense of isolation, alienation and soul-deep depression. Hoffman and Bancroft are perfection, but every character and actor has a moment where we peek beneath their facade, revealing their poignant humanity.
The scene where we realise all the pain just beneath Mrs Robinson's perfectly groomed appearance is heartbreaking, and so much sadder than any of the angst Ben is dealing with. He can still make a new future while her life feels already written.

"A Mike Nichols triumph. The shotmaking is innovative, especially in the scuba diver scene. The dialogue is spotless and quirky (""Alvin Romeo,"" ""plastics""). The story pushed the boundaries of its time and was influential for decades. The acting, helmed by Dustin Hoffman, is nuanced and pitch perfect. And the Simon & Garfunkel is a beautiful touch that anchors much of the film.
By keeping you with Benjamin the whole movie, you empathize with him. As the movie rolls along, you start to know how he's feeling before he even voices it. You can feel how adrift he is, how in love he is, how devastated he is.
It's funny and tragic and ironic and, most of all, human.",4.5

My list | KB Burke's master list
22. The Graduate - watch a film with a Older Woman Younger Man Relationship
This is the second time I've watched this 1967 pioneering youth film, the first ever to include contemporary pop music as part of its mood-setting soundtrack (as opposed to being there to specifically showcase the performance, as with '50s Elvis films for example); but the last time I watched it was over 30 years ago, in a ""Film Studies 101"" class at my university popular among freshmen for being known as an ""easy A"" (spoiler alert: it was), so perhaps we shouldn't actually count that. More importantly, earlier this year I read the astounding nonfiction book Pictures at a Revolution, which examines the five 1967 films nominated for that year's Best Picture Oscar (including this one), as a way of painting a portrait of the growing countercultural of those years and the way it snuck up on the mainstream with almost no one prepared for it.
Famously the second film directed by Mike Nichols, at the time a cynical stage comedian who was unexpectedly hailed as the ""next Orson Welles"" for his film directorial debut the year before, the indelible Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the movie improbably made a sex symbol out of the nebbishly Jewish Dustin Hoffman, in the same years that his contemporary Philip Roth was doing so in the literary world with Portnoy's Complaint; and unbeknownst to nearly everyone involved, ended up tapping into the twentysomething zeitgeist in a far more profound way than even the filmmakers meant, a slacker-like tale of a recent college graduate who doesn't want to join the square world of his plastics-manufacturing parents' generation, but can't exactly picture anything else that he does want to do instead, drifting by default into a hate-filled dysfunctional affair with his father's business partner's bored middle-aged wife (Anne Bancroft, a justly celebrated high point of her career), until meeting the woman's college-aged daughter months later and unexpectedly hitting it off with her in a legitimately sincere way.
Yeah, I know, it sounds like a real bummer; but in the deft hands of writer Buck Henry, a veteran of sharp Mid-Century Modernist comedy (he was the co-creator with Mel Brooks of Get Smart!, and later in life was one of the founding writers of Saturday Night Live), the meandering source novel by Charles Webb is turned into a sharp diamond of black humor, a preternaturally world-weary tale that makes you laugh in all the places you shouldn't in polite company, a logical extension of the work Nichols was doing in the '50s with his writing partner Elaine May that just happened to catch fire with college students nationwide, not the least of which was because of being filmed in the messy handheld style of the then-cutting-edge French New Wave movement.
A must-watch for anyone who considers themselves a serious film fan, it's especially recommended to read Pictures at a Revolution right before it, one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking books about film history that I've ever picked up. Rightly revered as both one of the best film comedies of all time and one of the most principal examples of the so-called ""New Hollywood"" of these years, you should rush out right this second and see it if you never have...and it wouldn't hurt to watch it again even if you have before.",5.0
"The entire first half of this film is a mastery in subjectivity. The way the camera moves and the scenes are blocked reflect Benjamin's state of mind so clearly and heighten the empathy one feels for him. As the film transitions into the second half, Benjamin transitions into essentially the villain. Yes, he is finally acting for himself, yet he is not really thinking for himself, just moving off impulse and gut feeling. He becomes extremely destructive in everyone else's lives, ruining multiple (albeit unhappy or dull) marriages and basically stalking Elaine repeatedly. There's a whole lot of generational shit in this movie that is very muddled to me. I think one's understanding of that stuff changes significantly with age and time period, so I bet it's just that. Overall, I know this is a great film, but I don't feel really any connection to it all, except for all of the parents being annoying.",4.0

"The Graduate contains two distinct parts that coherently play off each other, tell different messages, but also arrive at the same conclusion. 
We have the first half that starts with Ben looking in the fish tank at the diver (who is undoubtedly himself, as we see later) and Ms. Robinson fades into focus in the background, like the manifestation of what is to come. 
This first half ends with Mrs. Robinson saying ""goodbye Benjamin"" in all black and wet against an all-white wall. As it fades to black the Sound of Silence plays again. With this song we get a series of shots that not only act as exposition for the second part, but also reflect Ben's emotions. 
The second half begins completely opposite the first half. The first half began with Ben having no sense of purpose or direction; the rolling sidewalk was his parents, his parents' friends and society pushing him to go places he ought to go (go to graduate school, don't date my daughter). However, this second part is Ben absolutely set on getting Elaine, something that no one wants him to do except himself.
The dichotomy of these two parts makes the ending shot so much more palpable. Ben does achieve his goal, a goal that he intensely desired (just watch him run!). But just like when he graduated he is still faced without a direction or a purpose. The perpetual lack of purpose is shown here by the song, Sound of Silence, which plays once again. Additionally, Ben is on a vehicle that is taking him somewhere unknown, much like the walking sidewalk that was taking Ben somewhere unknown [we are unable to see what's ahead of him (literally) in both situations].",5.0

"Looks like I've finally found a coming-of-age classic I can relate to better than anything John Hughes directed.
Really really excellent cinematography. Cool transitions toward the middle, and I especially liked the sort of simulation of being overwhelmed by the guests in the opening scene -- the camera wasn't just there to record the plot; it was actually utilized to enhance the storytelling process.
Though I'll admit I'm not sure I'd be up for eloping with a guy who slept with my mom -- even if he loves me and my mom's a manipulative bitch -- I was satisfied with Benjamin's character arc, as well as his happy ending. And yes, I say happy because those placid faces on the bus at the end do not equal regret; this core theme of this movie is the concept of the lost young soul, constantly trying to figure out what to do next. It's not that Ben and Elaine don't love each other, they're just not sure what to do next. And given that I feel like that about 3x a day and I'm still breathing, I'm willing to bet they turn out okay.",4.5
"After re-watching this I appreciated and enjoyed it more. I also realised how funny it is while also being one of the most important films in the wave of new Hollywood movies. This is a classic because it still speaks to people today. At the time, it spoke to the generation of teenagers and young people who felt the generation gap, which can best be explained as a result of Post-War, and the change in America.
The plot simply focuses on the young Ben, who has turned 21 and returned from his studying- now a graduate. It isn't long before one of the family friends Mrs Robinson begins seducing him, meanwhile he struggles with his life decisions.
Dustin Hoffman's character is so brilliantly played, and is the reason this film resonates. There are plenty of people in this generation just the same, unable to decide what direction to take, and what lies ahead for them. You may not realise it, but the past 15 years has been a significant change on society globally, with the rise of social media, Internet and technology. But, not to get off track, the film doesn't directly show us the societal and political changes, but you can feel them in the background.
The direction from Mike Nichols (who recently died), cinematography and editing style is also unconventional and noticeable. There are shots zooming out from Ben, showing his isolation, and zoom-ins showing the characters in deep thought, making full use of the camera. The film also has its fair share of laughs with well-timed hilarity, and awkward situations. While it is lighy by today's standards, its head-on look at sex (especially in such a way) was considered very scandalous at the time, and I still think it surprises you today. The Graduate is an important, entertaining and timeless film.",4.5
"""Ben, this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.""
#1 on Berken's Favorite Movies Of All Time
There are quite a few things that make The Graduate a masterpiece (starting with possibly the most effective and enjoyable movie soundtrack ever), but above all it comes down to this - there could be no more even-handed (yet hilariously exaggerated to satiric effect) portrait of the relationship between financially well-off youths and their parents than what's on display here, somehow so timeless in its portrayal that even nearly half a century later not a single scene rings false. Unlike nearly every other entry in the ""parents just don't understand!"" genre, everyone in this movie is fundamentally broken and misguided in their own way and the filmmakers let no one off the hook, despite clearly feeling for the plight of all involved. A shallow viewing of the movie might imply that the titular graduate is in the right and that his actions get him to a better place; yet both the song lyrics and the facial expressions of the final scene combined with a dollop of common sense imply otherwise, to the likely future chagrin of our callow young hero.
That's not to excuse the older generation, however, who here have either A) become so disenchanted with life that they've checked out morally and become something of an unfeeling monster or B) reduced life into a checklist of practical and appropriate actions - graduate, indulge in the pleasures of youth for a sensible period of time, get married, and find a good job (in plastics, perhaps) - which they then pressure upon their children in the form of self-satisfied doses of wisdom. The effect is almost cult-like; in the graduation party scene as the attendees crowd around a miserable Ben to bestow congratulations upon him for behaving as society's definition of a successful youth, it's all too easy to imagine them breaking into chant: ""One of us! One of us!""
On the other hand, while the young characters are clearly dissatisfied with having their whole life already paved out ahead of them, they never come upon a satisfying response to their dilemma. Instead, they drift along in an aimless haze, until something comes along that inspires them to feel feelings in a way that doesn't seem pre-ordained by society, then impulsively latch on to the source of that tide of emotions with a desperation bordering on lunacy. I've been there, Ben. I think we all have.
The movie leaves Ben in the wake of his decisions, while the aforementioned music, facial expressions, and common sense cast doubt on his direction. Yet I don't want to be too cynical - just because a decision was born out of youthful desperation and hormones doesn't mean it won't work out. Sometimes there are worse things than making a bold move that there's a good chance you'll come to regret once emotional sobriety sets in - like, for instance, not making any bold moves. (Living in China, where the rebellious counter-culture presence embedded so thoroughly in American music and movies and so definitive of the American high school and university experience is somehow completely absent, I've met quite a few twenty-somethings that could stand to benefit from a bit of Ben's foolish impetuosity and individualism.)
One last personal digression, I promise - when I was in high school and college my favorite movie was Fight Club because of its obvious iconoclastic appeal to a young person that felt his life was on rails, ever chugging forward without any consideration of the appropriateness of that direction. Since then Fight Club's hyper-masculine, emotionally charged, and combative rejection of society's mores has slowly lost its sway with me, much in the way I expect Ben will feel differently about his actions as time passes. (Though to be fair to Fight Club, it does reject Durden's philosophy in the end, even if that's not saying much when the philosophy in question involves blowing up half a city.) With The Graduate I think I may have finally found a movie worthy of filling the void of ""movie that defines my perspective on the world"" left when Fight Club vacated the spot years ago, one that takes a no less cynical and piercing, yet more measured, truthful, and compassionate approach to skewering both the conformists and their rebellious offspring. It's probably too soon after first viewing to call it my favorite movie, but, hey, it's not like an impulsive decision made under a rush of emotion and an intense desire to define oneself ever ended up looking silly in retrospect, right?",5.0

"An exemplary film of the New Hollywood style, ""The Graduate"" shows how great acting and seamless visual storytelling can overcome a somewhat scattershot screenplay.
To be honest, the film slightly loses its way for me after Benjamin leaves for Berkley - and the less said about Simon & Garfunkel, the better. Regardless, the first act is note-perfect and throughout most of the movie director Mike Nichols maintains a careful balancing act between comedy and real drama.

"The Graduate. For a while I was somewhat disappointed (Hoffman‚Äôs sometimes effortful performance didn't always appeal to me) despite strong points (Bancroft is flawless, Ross very effective). But soon I developed a strong emotion for the film that overrode my reservations. The story suggests a parable in how little it needs to tell us (the omnipresent Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack becomes an abstracting element as well) - in this regard Ross‚Äôs simplicity of effect is perhaps more important to the film than is Bancroft‚Äôs command of the screen. Finally the inevitability of the love story and its happy outcome is what organizes the narrative - right up to the perplexing final scene, the main function of which is to restore the film‚Äôs modernist credentials. It‚Äôs hard to leave the film behind when it's over: it feels almost like a musical, albeit one with forbidding overtones. (21 Sep 2023)",0.0

"What a delightfully sadistic film The Graduate is. Dustin Hoffman is as charming as he is vile, the perfect anchor point for this tale of depravity. In many ways this is almost a fairytale, filled with disgusting people and so many morals to be mined from the experience. Festering with outrageously dry humor that will be with you long after the film ends. Deftly balanced with an original soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel that has become ever so timeless. All while encompassing the landscape of poor choices and the ramifications that reciprocate those decisions. It‚Äôs a never ending lesson on how not to behave. You can take pleasure in the idiocy of others as they attempt to navigate their own hubris. It leaves a mark on you, for as hilarious as the escape from the church is, the final scene on the bus is chilling as you can see into the future that the struggles are far from over. Nothing awaits these selfish individuals but misery and heartache.

"On the surface, ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is a romantic comedy about a young man (literally and metaphorically) drowning because of the pressure and expectations put on him by his parents and other grown-ups in his life. He‚Äôs an object to them, something they can be proud of. They love him, sure, but they suffocate him. Benjamin is living the life they picked for him, which is reflected on his loneliness and his lack of relationships, as well as all his academic achievements. He focuses on school not because he cares, but because they do. So when the opportunity comes to take some risk and start living his life (as advised by Mr. Robinson himself) in the form of Mrs. Robinson, he takes it and starts an affair, which he soon realizes is not a real relationship, but one purely based around sex. Ben cares about Mrs. Robinson, but not in the way he wants to. That‚Äôs when her daughter, Elaine, comes into the picture. They get along, she‚Äôs young, she feels the same way he does. Ben thinks he‚Äôs fallen in love and so he does everything in his power to stay with Elaine. When her parents push her into marrying a man she doesn‚Äôt truly love, it is Ben who rescues her and they drive off into the sunset, unsure about their future.
Now, some problems come with looking at the film this way. The big one is Benjamin, who‚Äôs not really a hero in the story. At first he looks like a guy who gets taken advantage of by an older woman and eventually fights back in an attempt to save the woman he loves. But he‚Äôs not exactly that. He‚Äôs a creep and a fucking stalker. There might be some good in Ben‚Äôs rebellious spirit, but he himself is not a very nice guy. Mrs. Robinson is also not just a villain. She‚Äôs a bit more complex than that. She‚Äôs a lonely woman trapped in a loveless marriage looking for a young man to be with her. That‚Äôs where the real power of the story lies.
‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is a story about loneliness. Ben lives to live up to his parents‚Äô expectations. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have many friends or any previous relationships. The opening shot of the film frames him by himself as he sits on an airplane and ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù plays. The first scene at the house shows us how lonely and trapped he feels surrounded by his parents‚Äô friends, until he comes across Mrs. Robinson. She‚Äôs been married for over 20 years with a man she never loved because of a careless night in a car. She was young and made a mistake, she married him and is still paying for it. Her daughter‚Äôs away in college, so she‚Äôs all by herself at home. She doesn‚Äôt even sleep with her husband. She desires human contact and so she looks for it in Ben, an attractive young man. But he has morals, he won‚Äôt sleep with her. However, after once again being paraded around by his parents, Ben realizes some human interaction (not contact) is all he needs. He wants to truly connect with someone. Now that he‚Äôs an adult, he wants something good in his life. He tries to find it in Mrs. Robinson by talking to her, but all she wants is sex. To Ben, that‚Äôs enough, it‚Äôs more than what he‚Äôs had for most of his life. He changes, he becomes a free soul, just hanging around his house, enjoying life, he finally has something of value in his life. Or so it seems. ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù can be heard for the second time in the film during the second act‚Äôs iconic montage. Ben is still as alone as he was in the beginning. He just doesn‚Äôt know it.
When Elaine gets brought up by Mrs. Robinson one night, she warns Ben not to take her out, ever. He assumes Mrs. Robinson thinks her daughter is too good for him. They fight. We realize how much they both care about their encounters, it‚Äôs the one good thing they have to look forward to in their lives. Mrs. Robinson doesn‚Äôt think Elaine is too good for Ben, she just doesn‚Äôt want her to get him. She doesn‚Äôt want to lose what little she has. When they‚Äôre forced to go on a date, Ben tries to get rid of Elaine. He makes her cry, he pushes his moral compass to the limit, his loneliness allows him to do what he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to before. That‚Äôs how desperate he is to protect his affair. Of course, Ben eventually regrets what he did and kisses Elaine in an attempt to calm her down. That‚Äôs the kind of affection he knows, because that‚Äôs the only kind of affection Mrs. Robinson shows him. This is also why he has no problem entering Elaine‚Äôs room while she‚Äôs getting dressed later in the film. Ben and Elaine hit it off on their first date. They‚Äôre not necessarily soul mates, but they agree on a second date. We can assume from their conversations Elaine is just as lonely as Ben. Her parents are similar to his. Even her friends and dates are selected by her parents. She‚Äôs glad she‚Äôs finally found someone she can connect to on a more honest and personal level. Then everything goes to shit when she finds out about the affair in the most brilliant rack focus ever.
The third act sees Ben go nuts. His loneliness is too much to handle, his morals are gone, he‚Äôs insane. He lost the only people he‚Äôs ever truly cared about. He lost the woman he thinks he loves. Ben moves to marry Elaine, even though she hates him. He begins following her around until she confronts him in his apartment. If she thinks Benjamin raped her mother, why would she go to his apartment at night instead of asking for help from her parents or the authorities? It‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs trying to escape her parents‚Äô grasp. She doesn‚Äôt want to date Carl, the friend of the family. She wants to feel the same way she felt when she first dated Ben. She never really believed her mother‚Äôs rape story, which is why she instantly believes Ben when he tells her that‚Äôs not what happened. Ben thinks he loves her because their date was the realest encounter he‚Äôs ever had. Elaine feels the same way. She spends the next few days being unsure about everything. She might marry him. She might not. She‚Äôs a young woman trying to figure out what to do with her life. She‚Äôs lonely, but not as lonely as him. Not yet.
After finding out about Benjamin‚Äôs plans, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson arrange a wedding for her. The ultimate act of oppression against the young. Mrs. Robinson is dooming her daughter to live the same life she‚Äôs been trapped in for decades. Except this isn‚Äôt Elaine‚Äôs fault, but someone else‚Äôs. This is Elaine‚Äôs darkest moment, where she feels completely alone. And that‚Äôs when Benjamin arrives at the church, shouting her name. Before running towards Ben, Elaine takes a look at her parents and new husband. They‚Äôre mad, they‚Äôre furious. This pushes her into actually running away with Ben. Two lonely young people finally getting their happy ending. But then ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù plays one last time and the couple‚Äôs smiles disappear from their faces. It‚Äôs not a happy ending, it‚Äôs a tragic one. They didn‚Äôt think any of this through. Everything is real all of sudden, they see their actions have consequences, and their actions were all so rushed and fueled by a desire of rebellion, fueled by the desire to escape from the loneliness of their lives. But the loneliness is still there. They don‚Äôt love each other. They barely know each other. They just made their own mistake, like Mrs. Robinson did many years ago. ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is a tragedy, a cautionary tale about the dangers of loneliness. A brilliant story about love, parenthood, rebellion, youth and the future. No wonder Benjamin is a little worried about it.",5.0

"There are pictures that catch you on the first frame.
There are stories so familiar to you, you have no option but to love them. You might even swear that, by some strange coincidence, the director and the screenwriter took inspiration from your life and they're now taking it to the big screen.
Me, personally, I've never felt that... I could vaguely relate with the themes and characters on screen, but not to the point where I'd think that, somewhere in the world and in a specific point in time, somebody felt the same way that I feel.
Until now, when The Graduate (1967) managed to do that for me.
For those that have yet to see it, let me tell you that this film goes beyond that famous quote: ‚ÄúMrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me‚Äù. The journey of Benjamin Braddock to find happiness is one most viewers can relate to. And man, when it ended, I was devastated with most of the choices he made.
The soundtrack is one of the best ones I've heard in the history of cinema. I used to find ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù pretty funny because of all the lol memes that are circling around, but holy shit! Hearing it in context gives you a totally different perspective and it is now a piece of music I can hear over and over and unironically. (I even have it on my favorites playlist)

"Film #133 in MY YEAR OF MUBI
""...we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles.""
A classic that truly holds up both in production and theme. Just marvelous.
Not only is this movie extremely well-written, but Mike Nichols does a masterful job of telling is story through lingering reaction shots (specifically from Anne Bancroft) and clever editing. Just amazing directorial work.
I found that watching it this time around (I've probably seen it 4 or 5 times now), that this would be a perfect movie for the Millennial Generation to watch. The wheel really comes around and these generational problems can easily be related to the current 20-something generation. Very interesting.
I can't give this wonderful film 5 stars as it still suffers from my only complaint that I've always had about this film. Dustin Hoffman is just woefully miscast as Benjamin Braddock. He is supposed to be this studly and dashing track star... but he simply is not. I've always wondered why Nichols didn't change those mentions of his physical description in the script, why he left that in, or why he simply didn't change the script to match Hoffman's personage. It would have seemed to be a simple fix, but who knows. People don't seem to mind, I guess. But it has ALWAYS troubled me about this film. Just not perfection... thus the 4.5 star rating.
But still... this movie is amazing.",4.5

So yeah I'm not gonna analyze this movie because I feel like that would be insulting to all of you who know and love this movie/film/your time. All I want to say is that it's been 50 years since this movie was released and even though the fashion for the time may have changed, the dialogue and composition of the movie still feels fresh today in 2017.

"Both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson are creeps, I don't think that's a particularly controversial conclusion to come to, but they're both creeps who've largely been made that way by the society surrounding them. However, there's a major difference between them in terms of how they've been moulded, and it comes up during the scene where Benjamin tries to find something to talk about with Mrs. Robinson. After initially stating that she has no interest in art, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she was lying, that she was actually an art student in college, and that while studying there, she had a one-night stand with the future Mr. Robinson which resulted in the conception of their daughter Elaine, forcing her to marry him and abandon any plans she might have had otherwise so that she could become what all women would be made to strive for under the insidious guise of traditional values: a wife. She even starts quietly crying, just to hammer it all home.
And therein lies the difference between them. Benjamin is celebrated for graduating college by his rich parents and their rich friends who see much potential in him, but he feels aimless, directionless; he's a creep because he's awkward, not a kid anymore but not truly an adult yet, trying to figure out what normal human behaviour is supposed to look like. Which isn't anything to sneeze at, mind you, but Mrs. Robinson also had potential, also likely had a direction, and instead of those things being celebrated, they were stolen from her; she could almost have been a possible vision of a future for Benjamin if he was a woman, but since he isn't, the worth of his goals - whatever they may be - isn't even questioned. It's no wonder she ended up as troubled as she did; with her life taken away from her like that, why wouldn't she drown herself in drink? Why wouldn't she become a creep?
So it's disappointing, I think, that the second half goes in the weird direction it does, and that the nuanced balance between the two characters seems to end. Benjamin's shiftiness is not only exacerbated through his stalking of Elaine, but it's not even shown in a particularly negatively light; meanwhile, Mrs. Robinson turns into a straight-up villain who falsely accuses him of rape (a hilariously pointless aspect of the plot that's brought up once by Elaine and then never mentioned again). Elaine's behaviour is also really weird; I'm not sure how, when or why she goes from thinking that Benjamin raped her mother to believing that he didn't to falling in love with him (again?), but it's some really dumb writing, especially for a movie that otherwise has writing that's not particularly dumb.
And then the nuance is restored through that ending: Benjamin and Elaine, having fled from her wedding, sit next to one another on a bus, going who knows where. And they go from being happy to... puzzled, awkward, unsure about what's gonna happen now, somewhat dissatisfied. ""The Sound of Silence"", a song used previously to represent Benjamin's insecurities about his life, plays once again. These aren't star-crossed lovers fleeing towards happiness; this is both of them about to become very unhappy because they weren't really sure what else to do. Elaine may even end up just like her mother, and in his own way, so may Benjamin.
In short, this is a very sad film about very sad people.",4.0

There are a lot of themes within The Graduate, so I'll be picking just one to discuss. Has ther ever been a film that best represents truth and realism in regards to early twenties lifestyle? Answering the big questions of ""what to do with my life,"" as we wonder aimlessly around looking for that answer to an unanswerable question. Ben finds solace in a woman twice his age, allowing this to suffocate and vape that fear away. Until Elaine walks in the picture and changes the game; he has found the answer. But the ending, where life finally hits back at them like a bus hitting a cross walker, suggests otherwise. Where do we go from here? What now? Where will this take us?
""Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence""

Benjamin is clumsy and stupid and makes all the wrong choices, and his desire to just drift around is endlessly relatable right now.

"I've never quite dug THE GRADUATE. It has a great cast, excellent directing by Mike Nichols, and all of this is accompanied by a lovely soundtrack of Simon & Garfunkel songs, with ""The Sound of Silence"" in particular being one that has resonated with generations of audiences. But the story leaves me cold.
The first two thirds or so of the movie set up a great premise. We meet Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college-graduate now adrift in the world and disillusioned with life, uncomfortable with himself and unable to connect with others. Ben is constantly alienated from those around him, often framed in water as if he is suffocating. He gets roped into an affair with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft in an iconic performance), a family friend and older cougar who seduces him.
This leads to a lot of funny situations, with Ben being endearingly adorkable to his ever-increasingly uncomfortable arrangement. Many have pointed out that Ben is attracted not so much to Mrs. Robinson herself but to the idea of the affair, and how it is a way to rebel: against his parents, against their generation, against what society expects of him.
But then Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), enters the picture. Ben falls for her, but once she discovers about his affair with her mother she is distraught, and wants nothing to do with him. This is a pretty dark low-point, one that no romance would realistically ever be able to recover from.
And then...this is where the story loses me. The entire last third of the movie is Ben chasing after Elaine, borderline-stalking her at her college, pursuing her relentlessly, until the famous climax of Ben crashing her wedding. The problem is that Ben and Elaine's romance isn't particularly interesting to me. I don't feel Elaine's character has all that much to her and it's hard for me to buy that she ever would want to talk to Ben again. In the case of Ben, I can understand that he's a confused kid chasing his hopeless dream, more in love with the idea of being in love than genuinely in love with Elaine. But as for Elaine...I honestly don't know her character.
I feel the screenplay never gives us time to get to know her personality. There basically is no reason for her to fall in love with him. And he doesn't really grow as a character nor do anything to make her fall in love with him. In fact, how does Elaine feel about what happened? We never get any scene of her and her mother alone, and surely some kind of confrontation between the two must have happened at some point.
The common argument I've heard is that she's a female version of Ben; also a confused adolescent uncomfortable with the world controlled by her elders, and running out on her wedding is a way for her to rebel against her parents. Again, I would buy her running out on her wedding to escape if it was any other guy on Earth...except the guy who had an affair with her mother.
There's been a lot of discussion about whether THE GRADUATE's ending is a happy or sad one, that the entire tale is one big tragedy about how rebellious youth repeat their parents' mistakes, and that Ben and Elaine are heading to a sad future of becoming another Mrs. Robinson and her husband. And again, I would go for this interpretation...if she wasn't the daughter of the woman Ben was having an affair with. I sort of wish Elaine had been split into two characters: the daughter of Mrs. Robinson who shows up and ruins the affair, and a different (and more well-written) love interest that Ben fell for and spent the third act pursuing. But combining these two into one character creates too much baggage and doesn't give the character time to develop.
THE GRADUATE doesn't work for me because I know too little about Elaine. And I don't believe any woman on Earth would ever feel any attraction for a man she was aware had had an affair with her mother. I've heard some people defend this by stating that the film is intended as satirical, but this strikes me as a selective interpretation. ""It's satire"" is not a be-all end-all argument for having poor characterization.
-ADDENDUM-
Years after writing this review, I discovered THE HEARTBREAK KID (1971), directed by Elaine May, Mike Nichols's old comedy partner. It makes sense there would be a lot of overlapping themes in their work, and all I can say is not only is THE HEARTBREAK KID a masterpiece, but it's the answer to THE GRADUATE that I never knew I wanted. For all the people who told me I just didn't understand the satire in THE GRADUATE and especially its ending, all I can say is I find THE HEARTBREAK KID a superior film as well as a superior version of that same ending. Elaine May was a master.

"99: Probably the most unintentionally disturbing movie about how scary the future is‚Äîor maybe it‚Äôs not so unintentional?‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also a film that, on paper, should‚Äôve lost its bravura decades ago; its implied sexual provocation, the voyeurism and experimentation of the camera, the near endless needle-drops of the same four Simon & Garfunkel songs, and Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs Ben certainly comes off as a creep in the second half of the movie, that stuff isn‚Äôt new or ‚Äúdaring‚Äù anymore. But the magic is still there, and it‚Äôs almost undeniably one of the funniest movies ever conceived‚Äîwith Hoffman nailing practically every line, facial expression, and emotional cue in the script‚Äîthough I think most of that charm comes from its technicolor cinematography. It‚Äôs just visually startling eye candy throughout, with everything so well thought out and composed, whether that‚Äôs the tight, claustrophobic framing of Ben‚Äôs graduation party or the neat, calculative zooms and match-cuts scattered in the film‚Äôs runtime. More importantly, I guess, I just find The Graduate really sad, which sounds like a blanket statement, but in comparison to something like Elaine May‚Äôs The Heartbreak Kid, which is also a good film, that second-to-last shot is fucking brutal. It just captures coming-of-age angst impeccably well, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to replicate to full effect.

Week 28: a film that Inspired filmmakers to become filmmakers.
This week's criteria came from Michelle and it's a film that Inspired filmmakers to become filmmakers. For this week, I wanted to associated it to a filmmaker I like a lot. So, I chose Quentin Tarantino and I heard somewhere that The Graduate inspired him to become a filmmaker.
The graduate is a fun romance. I did enjoy this movie and I understand why it got it's acclaimed. However, the comedy didn't entirely land with me and because of that I don't have anything much to say, neither bad or good. It was fun, but not enough to be this well acclaimed masterpiece like a lot seems to think.
Next week criteria is a Drug Crime Movie.

"The Graduate may be one of the most relatable films ever made. Life keeps pushing you along before you're even ready, and before you know it, you find yourself in a world where others are telling you how to live your life. And just when you think you've found where you want to be, more obstacles show up and stand in your way; but you can overcome them with all the motivation you can acquire in just a short amount of time.
We've all felt like Ben at one point or another; unsure of what our future should be; feeling like we're going nowhere. Just keep thinking; just keep going with the flow, and soon you'll realize that the future is full of unexpected twists, turns, and surprises that are sure to keep you on your toes, and get you ready for anything that comes your way.
This film really left me speechless in a way I rarely ever experience.

"I‚Äôm sad to say this just didn‚Äôt live up to my hopes. It definitely wasn‚Äôt bad, but I left kind of lost. I just don‚Äôt think I was on the same page as the director, and I don‚Äôt really know what the point of the movie was. I thought Dustin Hoffman was good, but I didn‚Äôt care for his character much. I didn‚Äôt feel like there were really any likable characters. I found myself getting slightly frustrated toward the end. The comedy didn‚Äôt really work that much for me, and because of this, I think the ending cane off wrong because I couldn‚Äôt really find the humor in it.
However, I do think this was at its best during the more dramatic, emotional scenes. Those carried the movie and made up for the lack of connection to the humor. And I really liked the cinematography, framing and soundtrack. Those technical aspects really contributed a lot for me. This definitely wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping for, but it was solid regardless.

"I am now closer in age to Mrs. Robinson than Benjamin, so perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that I find her far more sympathetic than the childish Ben. Of course, the whole point of the film is Ben‚Äôs immaturity, and we only see Mrs. Robinson as he sees her, but objectively she‚Äôs someone whose youth was stolen from her.

I was kind of letdown by some of the casting choices, the pacing and the story (which is pretty solid dgmw) that included some scenes that I feel we're unnecessary, which are the reasons of why I wasn't satisfied enough to give it a much higher score.

"One thing i noticed when watching The Graduate is how overly dramatic the actors were, ecpecially Dustin Hoffman. This was his break out role. For me its an okay movie. I dont think the story is as compelling as i thought it would be. Though i did enjoy the close up shots and the editing especially in transitioning from one to scene to the other.",3.0
"Appreciated way more this time. The first hour is basically perfect. Incredibly visually inventive and well directed (Nichols deserved the Oscar) but also funny and poignant. Was struck now by how complicated of a protagonist Benjamin is on a rewatch. I can sympathize with his disillusionment but some of his decisions are plainly selfish, at times showing little concern for other characters' feelings or boundaries.

*SPOILERS*

I think where the film loses me (and lost me on the previous watch) is the section where Benjamin is trying to marry Elaine. I understand that the film is saying that they are both sort of deluding themselves by thinking that getting married will fix all their problems and uncertain futures but the film only implies that things might not turn out well in the long term in literally the last two minutes of the movie. So the whole time Benjamin's basically stalking Elaine I'm thinking: ""things probably won't end well for anyone"" and so I've disassociated from the conflict of the film, up until the last 2 minutes where the film states what I was just thinking for the previous half hour.
Keeping in mind my criticism of the last 30 minutes, there isn't a moment in the film where the craft of the filmmakers and actors isn't incredible.
Also the music's good :).",4.0
"""I'm a little worried about my future""
That quote goes so hard and is incredibly relatable. In fact The Graduate is probably the most relatable movie of all time. Benjamins character ticks all the boxes of what it truly feels like to be alone, to love someone but not be loved back and really just not have a clue as to what life really is ment to be. His lack of direction and uncertain, impending future, a desire for experience end up getting himself into a terrible situation. He becomes desperate which led him to begin an affair something he knows is wrong.
I really can see why this movie is so iconic and loved by all and it's utterly groundbreaking in its unique visual style and use of the camera and colours. It changed the face of modern film and is incredibly influential on over films and film directors.
Dustin Hoffmans performance is truly one of the best in all of cinema, the way he encapsulated the feeling of loneliness and confusion. Katharine Ross as Elaine is one of the best supporting roles of all time and one of the best female performances ever as well, same goes with Mrs. Robinson both incredibly great love interests.
The cinematography is phenomenal, shot to perfection. Seriously a great use of the camera every shot is beautiful and means something, shows a certain feeling and feels necessary to the film. The final shot is one of the best final shots ever, for once Benjamin succeeded and got what he wanted, really just shows that good things can always happen.
The score is beautiful and really made the film just that bit more special. Made an already pretty popular song one of the most well known ever, that being 'The Sound Of Silence'

"Somehow I feel like The Graduate is underrated? Which is strange, because its so celebrated by the many who have seen it, but for me there was not much hype going into this. It immediately has some of the most poignant cinematography I've seen to date. The entire movie has this almost perfect camerawork for its genre and presentation. The purposeful and conspicuous zooms get us in the headspace of Benjamin's still relatable struggle. The way he reacts to the increasingly crazy events show us what he's been looking for, or rather what he's trying to avoid. As a recent Graduate myself I too feel the insane pressure to finally ""get off my ass"" and make something of myself. Obviously I'm not scoring any milfs, but that's not the important aspect of the plot. Its the sudden change and disappearance of rules and structure, without the use of a mandated schedule. We take for granted how organized education is, in the real world we very much have to play by ear, and what enters Benjamin's ear isn't very helpful. His parents and colleagues all seem to be giving him directions, but never explaining how to get there. Dating, marriage, and job searching is not something college teaches you, you have to figure it out for yourself. Benjamin is the result of someone who is so by-the-books that it ends up hurting him. He tries to stay in his own lane, but you can't do that for the rest of your life. In an attempt at some kind of control or just to prove to his parents and himself, he goes off and makes his own choices, whether or not they will even prove beneficial. In less than two hours The Graduate taught so much about myself that my 23 years of living never quite reached yet. I'm surprised filmbros don't raise this up with the likes of Pulp Fiction or The Wolf of Wallstreet. Then again, that would imply they might have actually learned something.",4.5

Bumbling and charming, and steamy and sweet all at the same time. It's shot like silk, but it's got dirt under its fingernails. I really loved this film most as a coming of age redemption story, about breaking free of the mundane pressures that come with entering adulthood and righting the wrongs of the fumbling mistakes made along the way. The future is indeed worrying, but it's pretty thrilling too.

The Graduate explores the notion of anxiety an individual may have when graduating college and encountering many unknowns about what to do next regarding transitioning into adulthood responsibilities.

"I was in the mood so I gave this one a rewatch and holy fucking shit I love this movie. Definitely a top 5 favorite for me and maybe a top 3. The direction of Mike Nichols is immaculate. So incredible how he manages to create all these scenes without a single pacing problem. This movie flows so perfectly. Also this movie is fucking hilarious like I was laughing out loud at moments. The acting is very strong as well. Hoffman, Bancroft, and Ross turn in some great performances here. The screenplay is literally perfect. The dialogue is amazing and the narrative is incredible. Cinematography and editing were also off the charts good here. The transitions especially in the first part of the movie were so incredibly good. This is a top 30 of all time type movie right here for sure. My only small complaint and what makes this movie not higher on my all time list is that 1 small section with Ben and Elaine talking while she‚Äôs at Berkeley. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs still a great scene but it isn‚Äôt as good as the rest of the film. Well that‚Äôs a lot of words right here and I probably could write like 1000 more about this film and the intricacies of every shot and the incredibly memorable characters and the perfect direction of Mike Nichols but I‚Äôm tired rn and I need to sleep. Anyways great movie everyone needs to see it right now if they haven‚Äôt.

An absolutely timeless film, the themes explored are very much relevant to this day and it doesn‚Äôt have the feel of a 60‚Äôs film whatsoever thanks to the cinematography which gives it a very sharp look. Hoffman‚Äôs potrayal of Ben is excellent and he has that element of awkwardness and naivety spot on for his character.

Having seen it many times as a young adult, watching as a grown adult, with a child, I‚Äôm now on the other end of the subject and find my sympathies with the adults and increasingly adverse to my own inner rebellion now that I have done enough of it and my life is refined by many events where I‚Äôve felt like Ben and Elaine at the back of the bus.

The Graduate is a classic I just never got round to watching and to be honest I didn't know much more than the Mrs Robinson plotline and seeing clips here and there.
Maybe I missed the depth of the social commentary here but the retrograde attitude of the film really put me off. The first half was really good, Hoffmans character trying to find a purpose in life after graduating, your peers asking you about your future at every opportunity. This situation can be relatable for so many people whether it just be school you have left or what. You can find yourself in an angst ridden phase in life and it really caught them emotions on screen. It shows Hoffmans progression from graduate to maturity with his affair with Mrs Robinson. This is all great stuff some of the editing is outstanding, the camera work is a film students wet dream.
However, it's the second half where I found it not just uninteresting but quite creepy. I thought the story really lost focus at this point, the camera was still a major part and it was always worth it for that alone. It contains an intense courtship of Hoffmans love interest (or stalking would be the best word), a love interest I'm not sure was meant to be taken seriously or if this was a play on the falsity of young love. I don't think it was clear though.
I feel having time to reflect on The Graduate though has only made me appreciate it more and there is probably benefits to re-watching because I'm not sure all is what meets the eye. The soundtrack is grade A classic Simon & Garfunkel though.",3.0
Tfw you saw Wayne‚Äôs World 2 before you ever saw The Graduate.,4.5
"Benjamin Braddock is numb.
Numb from all his achievements and the abundance of options in front of him but mostly numb from his own personal existence in this world. He's numb and so he's drifting on water and through his life because it feels like all purpose was sucked right out of him after college graduation.
Benjamin Braddock is me.
Not all of me, but I have felt the way Benjamin feels in the film and, if I'm quite honest, there are moments when I still do. It's a world weariness that can get overwhelming at times and it's not something that's easy to shake. Perhaps a reason why I've become so obsessed with film because it's a form of escapism into different mindsets but it also is a great teacher that let's you know who you are or who you would be in any given situation that you're watching. It doesn't always reflect the real world out there but it's often a magnifying glass onto human behavior.
Benjamin Braddock rubs people the wrong way.
For all the praise he's getting for being a star track runner, Benjamin doesn't feel well in his own skin. He feels like the compliments he's getting are choking him because they come with strings attached. Everyone expects him to continue to do well because he's done well before and in a moment of nervousness and weakness he falls prey to an older woman, who seems bored and unhappy with herself and who is toying with him at all opportunities and ultimately, the most intimate act between two people becomes numbing in its endless repetition.
Benjamin Braddock shines in the thrill of the chase but not in the catch.
This is just my personal take on the film but it feels to me like Benjamin only does well when he can chase after something. He spends his life running and that also shows clearly in his chosen sport but most definitively in perhaps the most somber endings to a film ever, we see the thrill of the chase wear off in an instant. Benjamin has caught what he was chasing against all odds but both he and his prey are looking ahead at an uncertain future, suggesting one of those famous ""I've made a huge mistake"" moments that Arrested Development specializes in and that's one of the most haunting visualizations of what it means to grow up that I can imagine and I finally fully appreciate the film for it.
Side note: The soundtrack provided by Simon & Garfunkel really captures the zeitgeist of the 60s, the oddness and the humor. Most of all though, it captures the disillusionment right from the start, when the haunting notes of The Sound of Silence first echo across the speakers and the film couldn't be the same without the music.",5.0

"‚ÄúIt just happened. It‚Äôs just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?‚Äù
The Graduate is a sweeping-along. Things seem to just happen to Benjamin Braddock, who is swept along in such a way as to suggest a serious falling out with autonomy. What are the operating forces, then, that cause things to just happen, as Benjamin says they do? Mrs. Robinson is a big one; Elaine is another. But there remain internal causes, like fear and lust, that contribute just as much to Benjamin‚Äôs plight. These dominate his actions for most of the film until other, less malevolent forces‚Äîthose of love and courage‚Äîbegin to swim about in his soul. 
The last quarter of the film still has Benjamin caught in a sort of current, only it becomes more or less one of his own design, like a railway that he‚Äôs laying the tracks for: there‚Äôs no stopping the train, but at least it‚Äôs his railway. This may seem too happily simple, but all he needed to be less miserable was a goal of his own making‚Äîa plan, as Elaine says late in the film. And we who have tasted the perpetual ennui of post-childhood know that Benjamin is to be envied for this sudden fit of motivation. There is not always so romantic a future to fight for.
I should note that this sweeping-along coming across in the narrative hinges quite heavily on the way the film is cut. There‚Äôs a ton of ellipsis here, and it works to effect what might be called lean filmmaking. Mike Nichols pares The Graduate down to the bare necessities, leaving exposition and other assorted fat on the cutting room floor. The effect is such that about half of protagonist Benjamin Braddock‚Äôs character development lies in the title of the film and nowhere else. What isn‚Äôt needed for the story to land simply isn‚Äôt in the movie. 
And yet for all its leanness I wouldn‚Äôt call The Graduate a minimalist work or anything close to one. Nichols‚Äô visual language is dynamic, with zooms both sluggish and wickedly fast, with lilting long takes and one-frame shock cuts and even the odd Dutch angle. The ultra hip licensed soundtrack, though trite by today‚Äôs standards, was a novel innovation in 1967 (as well as a brilliant shortcut to invoke the spirit of the times with a handful of songs). Everything about Nichols‚Äô work here screams movement. And as a product of late 60s America might rightly be, The Graduate is always in motion, drifting between necessity and excess, between pop culture frivolity and spirit of youth social malaise, between teenage perversion and high-flung romance. I couldn‚Äôt dream up a better introduction to New Hollywood.",4.0
"There is this great interview where Harold Ramis talks about people who have watched his film, Groundhog Day, many times. Ramis talks about the many people who come up to him and say how each time they watch it, they feel something different. Ramis then explains that although the movie never changes, it seems to change when you're at different stages in your life. Where you are in your life determines how you view a film.
The Graduate is exactly that. It hasn't been that long since I last watched this, but I still found something different while watching. It's such an amazing thing to make a movie like this, to make a movie that changes even though every single thing stays the same.

"O saudoso Mike Nichols, um ano depois do fant√°stico Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, nos presenteou com The Graduate, onde acompanhamos Ben (Dustin Hoffman em uma das atua√ß√µes mais marcantes e precisas de sua carreira), um jovem rico e rec√©m formado que tem in√∫meras d√∫vidas de como ser√° seu futuro, at√© que se envolve com a charmosa e experiente Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft).
Por mais que a premissa seja muito white people problems, Ben √© t√£o humanamente levado por Hoffman e seus trejeitos que nos envolvemos com seu drama de maneira leve e descontra√≠da.
O trabalho de c√¢mera de Nichols √© um show a parte, reflexos, √¢ngulos, luzes, posicionamento dos atores, fora as alegorias, enfim, diversos elementos que fazem desse filme uma aula particular de cinema.
Talvez meu momento aleg√≥rico favorito seja quando o jovem Ben √© praticamente arrastado de seu quarto pelos pais para que v√° at√© a sala, onde est√£o os convidados para parabeniz√°-lo por sua gradua√ß√£o, a c√¢mera perde os tr√™s escada abaixo e foca no quadro de um palha√ßo.
A trilha √© outro elemento que engrandece The Graduate, sempre pontual e agregadora, principalmente com 'Mrs.Robinson' e 'The Sound of Silence' da dupla Simon & Garfunkel.
Um √≥timo estudo de personagem que culmina numa √∫ltima cena maravilhosa, onde as express√µes dos rostos dos personagens de Hoffman e da bel√≠ssima Katharine Ross, junto da trilha, traduzem o real sentimento de ambos.

"'DvD' Challenge #22
The Graduate was a movie I had super high hopes for. And although it's not bad movie, it's not the great movie I had believed it to be. Dustin Hoffman puts on an acting clinic as the shy, nervous Ben Braddock, as you can see all the emotions clearly and consistent as the movie goes on and the dilemmas he faces and the situations he puts himself into. The story is also intriguing and kept me entertained, with the shift in the middle of the film being a strong point.
And although the music of Simon and Garfunkel is something I do enjoy, it got super repetitive and borderline annoying as the movie went along. I also felt that the relationship between Ben and Elaine was not fleshed out enough, was forced on us too quickly and ended up not believing in their chemistry.
However, those negatives aside, I did still enjoy the film. If you're looking to mark off a staple film from the classics, this is one you should watch.

"I remember watching this back in 2014 and falling in love with it, but forgot it over time. 
I rewatched it today, and I loved it even more. 
The Graduate is such an engaging and relatable film, that it's impossible to ignore it. 
Benjamin Braddock is such a relatable character, as I myself found some similarities between the two of us. 
Mrs Robinson, and this is impossible to deny, is the first true milf, because she and her daughter are both intriguing and beautiful characters. 
The use of editing is also something to take note of.

"I wanted to start 2017 off right film-wise, so I decided to watch The Graduate, a film I first saw over a year and half ago. This was my fourth viewing and it continues to get better every time for me. I love the character of Benjamin Braddock (played brilliantly by Dustin Hoffman), as I find him very relatable and easy to sympathize with. The film moves at a good pace, has a great story, great characters and performances, is very well shot and edited, and has a terrific soundtrack. This time I watched it with my brother, as he'd never seen it and I'm happy to say he really enjoyed it. Simon & Garfunkel will be stuck in my head for a while now. 9/10",4.5
"Incredible job by Criterion on this 4K restoration! Love this film so much and so glad it can finally be seen in such a beautiful format, as it was when it exhibited.
Benjamin is a source of eternal relatability, something that would be self-evident as kinda odd given this is a film rooted in the sphere of the changing world of the late sixties - but his story just seems to be totally transcendental: there will always be aimless graduates - in fact forget the title, there will always be aimless people.
Amazing sense of time and place. Whenever I watch it back I'm instantly transported back into its world - to the second half of the 60s where people are cynical and the films are too, a Panavision America made up of jump cuts and snap zooms and characters who are lost and directionless and a Benjamin who's just as unsure about his future at the end (even after running off with the bride!!) as he was at the beginning.

"As I said back when I was just about to watch it: this is probably one of the biggest movies that I have had on my watchlist for ages without ever actually watching. Dustin Hoffman is an amazing actor, so that obviously had me interested enough on its own, but also the fact that I have seen so many classic scenes from the film by now I feel like I already know and love it before even watching it. And I was kind of right, because I absolutely loved this film... It is not perfect, but there is many groundbreaking things about it and it sort of holds a good balance between controlled and lively filmmaking. What I mean is, that the film hasn‚Äôt got a problem being smart and witty while also pulling of some interesting and inventive shots and frame-compositions.
I think the story it wanted to tell was extremely interesting though quite obvious at times, but overall you just have such a fun time with it that you don‚Äôt care whether or not it departures from what it set out to be ‚Äì or that it wants to have more fun than what it should be ‚Äúallowed to‚Äù.

"March 30 #4: USA
The Graduate is a really interesting movie. There're some scenes that appear to be from a romantic comedy, a light tale about a boy dragged to an affair with an older woman and ending falling in love with her daughter, but deeply it doesn't feel like it. Just like Ben and his circle of family and his parent's friends they all seem living the life, but if you pay attention they are just hollow, sad and numb. Mrs. Robinson and Ben actually are very alike, looking for thrills to feel alive but getting back to their lifeless existence after they get what they want.
The acting and the soundtrack are amazing. They transform the movie in a melancholic journey and the editing is also very smart. I wasn't really sure what I would get out of The Graduate and it was better than I ever imagined.",4.0

Mrs. Robinson

- She's a family friend so she's known Benjamin his whole life
- The scene where she seduces him has a very no means yes attitude coming from her
- She is literally so manipulative in the scene during the scene from the poster, you know the one
Benjamin Braddock
- Could've killed Elaine with his reckless driving on his way to their date
- Took Elaine to a strip club without her consent for their first date. She even cries and he doesn't seem very apologetic
- He stalks her at Berkeley and even follows her onto a bus and invites himself to her date
- He proposes to her after like two dates
- After she says no he crashes her wedding
Elaine Robinson (though I have much less beef with her)
- Says maybe to Benjamin's proposal even though she was already engaged to Carl",0.5

"Watched this again after reading Mark Harris‚Äô excellent book about the 1967‚Äôs Best Picture nominees: Pictures at a Revolution. Kind of one of those movies that‚Äôs so perfect and said perfection so covered upon ground, that it‚Äôs hard to write about. The tight screenplay, Nichols showing off his formal chops in his sophomore effort (insane that he was learning on the fly just a year earlier with Virginia Woolf), Sam O‚ÄôSteen‚Äôs editing, the gaudiness of California‚Äôs Noveau Riche, the lingering mood of generational ennui, the Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs soundtrack, and (of course) just how much of a shockwave this type of European influenced cinema felt compared to the decade‚Äôs penchant for aesthetically conservative musicals and costume dramas‚Äî folks, it‚Äôs all here. 
This is my first time watching this since graduating from a somewhat ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù college in December. Now I‚Äôll be the first to say that it‚Äôs not a 1:1 to my experience, but it does really capture the worst feelings of feeling lost in a world that feels stupid, callous, and emptily superficial. Especially those early scenes where Benjamin has to field the questions about his future to his parents‚Äô friends. Everyone offering what to do when it all feels so plastic. As everyone had said; that final scene is the type of thing that keeps you awake at night with so many ambiguous, mixed emotions.

"1967 | Dustin Hoffman | Murray Hamilton | Richard Dreyfuss | Best Soundtracks
I love the feeling when you go into a film expecting to love it and it still blows you away.
‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù is one of those films that I would have no problem with watching the whole day over and over. 
I love the atmosphere, the feeling, the mood, the tone and just everything.
The cinematography is beautiful. I love the way they position and move the camera, the framing, the lighting, the colors. The soundtrack is absolutely masterful and perfectly complements and emphasizes the mood. I absolutely love (!) the dialogues, which are not only humorous but also very witty and smart and everything is perfectly timed and the film is very funny. The writing seriously is on point and gets you very involved and engaged. And it also is very relatable in some ways and therefore really got to me. And the pacing is PERFECTION!
Dustin Hoffman again is a pleasure to watch and delivers a performance that fits his character as perfect as any performance can fit a character. And both Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross are absolutely fantastic too. The three are all so mesmerizing and enchanting.

"Mrs Robinson are you trying to seduce me?
Yes, as it turns out she was. The Graduate was better than I had ever hoped it would be. Truly brilliant in pretty much every way. Let's start with those performances, my golly Anne Bancroft in all her cougary glory was truly remarkable and Katherine Ross as the sweet yet strong one who gets caught in the middle. But Dustin Hoffman was just the full package, he was a little awkward but confident and headstrong and genuinely funny. His awkwardness contributed to that but ultimately he just made everything seem to have a little edge of comedy, his character was so endearing and loveable he totally carried me through the film.
The music is magical, Simon and Garfunkel are so criminally under-utilized by the film industry, they had 3 songs I think in this film and everyone one of them fitted the context perfectly, added to the melancholia or the panic and boy was there panic, towards the end I was looking at the clock thinking ""no this isn't enough time"" this is one of the few films that I actively wanted to be longer. The whole time I was so heavily invested in this relationship which seemed doomed from the off. But they were so sweet together and one of my only criticisms is that I wish we could have seen more of Ben and Elaine and less of Ben and Mrs Robinson. On top of that it was a really funny film, I laughed hard that I have laughed at a film in a while and this from a non-comedy. As I mentioned earlier the awkwardness was a big part but also Benjamin's whit was outstanding. Right now I'm sort of feeling like I did with nocturnal animals, absolutely loved it but for one little problem which stopped me giving it 5 but for this one I have to go with 5. It was remarkable right up to the last scene which was filled with uncertainty as to whether or not this would work out. Fabulous film.

"Movies don't age but movie reviews do. Some get the two mixed up, perhaps naturally. Ebert, in his unintentionally comical 1997 re-review, said that 20 years later, The Graduate was a movie of its day and not the present; in fact, he's referring not to the movie but to how it was interpreted; many apparently read it as a piece of counter culture, which indeed was naive. But that's not the movie's fault. (I agree, incidentally, that it was revolutionary not in general but for a kind of movie and especially for a kind of moviegoer). Kael picked up on this but left it neither here nor there. She felt, as some do, that the movie starts strong only to go cheap after ""turning"" Mrs. Robinson ""bad"". I find this to be simplistic and cutting the movie short, driven by this wishful thinking that because Anne Bancroft is so sympathetic, and because Mrs. Robinson initially has some degree of psychological mystery, she must also be the underdog hero somehow.
Everyone had good amount of time to notice what the movie is truly up to, which is to tell a story about being young and unsure about the future; this is simply but distinctly contrasted with the adults, who are conscientiously stuck in the dead-ends of their lives. The first scene plants this quite obviously, with Benjamin saying he wants his future to be ""different"". The whole movie is about him trying to make some kind of desicion even though he's shooting in the dark; he's no hero, nor is he a bad person, but he does learn. He takes some kind of charge. This why I prefer the Swedish title over the original (which doesn't happen too often); here it was called ""The Manhood Test"", which admittedly doesn't sound good in English but I like how it randomly notices that, yes, Benjamin is challenged by adulthood; as a title, ""The Graduate"" is much more suggestive to the fact that you should read Benjamin as a symbol for some kind of general societal change (and this was likely not the intention, as it wasn't in the novel, which this apparently follows quite closley).
This is not to say that Benjamin does a very good job of growing up. In fact, his success can't even be measured as the movie ends before any kind of ramifications can be seen; in any case, his quest to retain poor Elaine is in no way an act of maturity or pure will - though again, future romcoms have distorted our view of the ending perhaps, where Benjamin simply doesn't care anymore and where Elaine is possessed by a kind of momentary lapse of judgment; I'm sure there's a psychological term for this. The ending is an act of desperation from both parts; when you don't know if you should stay or go, you can only momentarily run. It's the same thing that triggers suicides, a burst of an impulse that is purely reactive. None of them have any judgment or experience in regards to the realities of life.
All they really know is what they don't want (at least not now, and at least not like this). It is very hard to keep out the notion, and I think it's quite an optimistic one, that they'll both end up fine wherever, with whomever, and that this whole episode will just end up a big anecdote; as the 60s rolls by, an entire world of decorum is buried with it, and in the modern world, one cannot consider this story provocative. Young people are crazy. It was a bigger deal in 1967 than even in 1977.
And since Benjamin and Elaine are crazies, not rebels, the adults are not square fascists but merely normal. Mrs. Robinson, by contrast, lives in a fixed world of set values; she may cheat on her husband, cynically taking advantage of a young man too inexperienced to have a say in the matter and that is precisely why her mellow moment in the bedroom (where she admits to ""sort of"" having lost interest in art) is so touching; because how she allows herself, this one moment, to let her guard down. Notice the sublime ease with which Bancroft allows for Mrs. Robinson to allow the conversation to lead her to an inevitable place of pain. This is not something she talks about easily; it looks like she's flying easy on top of her own psyche, but she is actually doing some advanced manouvering to avoid real pain. (This is why I mention the Ebert review as comical; not only is he provoked as a middle-aged man by what he loved as a young man, walking right into the very same anti-authoritarian trap he set 20 years before; he desperately holds on to this weird case of stubborn projection by claiming that Mrs. Robinson seduces Benjamin ""out of kindness or desperation""; this is not an opinion but a direct lie). And as we see, the moment her lifestyle is threatened she is ready to sacrifice everything to keep it up.
This doesnt make her evil, just predictable; indeed, this trap she's living in is the bad circle that generates her entire behavior to begin with; were she not protective of her destructive lifestyle, she would not mood alter with alcohol and feeble boys (again, it's astonishing to notice how effectively the character blindsided many critics, who simply saw too much of themselves in Mrs. Robinson to allow for her to be an antagonist).
Benjamin is not predictable, but that is to be expected. He may very well end up precisely as dull and gray as any of the adults. But as with many good stories about youth, The Graduate is not actually about speculations about the future but about what the present feels like. The movie, especially the ending, captures the notion of a young person aching along with the world. The same thing happens in Moodysson's Fucking √Öm√•l; both films capture that strange sensation one has but a few times in life, as a young person, when you may cast yourself to the wind and notice a kind of rip in the fabric around you; the feeling that something actually happens now and you don't know why or what it means. He takes the advice from Mr. Robinson, funnily enough, to shackle off a bit and be young. There is excitement in the air, there is somehow nothing between your mind, your body and the rest of the world; as if you're a free spirit soaring in the wind.
The final moment is classic for a reason, it resonates every time you see it. Just like in Moodysson's film, we slowly land in the real world. Everyone who's not present (in The Graduate it's the screaming parents in the church) somehow grow in our minds the further away the bus goes. And as it goes, they suddenly look like prisoners in a jail bus; the destination is the rest of their lives, of course, as we all know. And if you don't, yet, go easy dear child and I'll see you later.",0.0

After watching The Graduate over a dozen times, I am still finding new and unique ways to relate to this film. The shot of the two monkeys cuddling while laughing at a lonely Ben at the San Francisco Zoo is one of the most powerful moments in the entire film that I always overlooked until now. In a way, it's symbolic of the entire film's themes. Loneliness sucks. And when you're lonely, it feels like no one else is.
I'll always be a little worried about my future, but while watching The Graduate, I feel slightly less worried.

"I once went out on a few dates with an experienced theatre actress and director who told me she‚Äôd never heard of Marlon Brando. I‚Äôll just let that sink in.

To me its kind of the equivalent of not knowing what oxygen is. Why do I bring this up? Because, now the shoe is on the other foot. I have my own ignorance confession to make. This is the first time I‚Äôve seen The Graduate. But to my defence I have known what it is and that it exists. Up until now I‚Äôve been able to smartly dodge my ignorance by politely nodding whenever the topic arose. Thankfully, I can now proclaim my instant admiration for this brilliant film.
After watching it twice in succession along with the many supplements on the disc, thankfully now I‚Äôm fully able to be conversant on this seminal film. The commentary track containIng a conversation with director Stephen Soderberg interviewing Mike Nichols is easily the greatest thing ever recorded! The amount of innovation in this film is staggering. It just boggles the mind that risks of this magnitude in filmmaking seem so rare today. It‚Äôs odd isn‚Äôt it? With all our innovation and technology, on the surface it would seem we have so many more advantages now compared to then.

"This film feels mostly like a '60s in-joke, but without the cultural context and angst and ennui of the age, it's just barely mediocre. Or barely bearable. Mostly because of Hoffman's character being thoroughly detestable. How are so many people empathizing with this? You are rich and bored so you fuck your father's partner's wife and then run off with her daughter? I get shit was confusing in the 60s, but goddamn is this film barebones and crude. It has a wink and a nod at the end, but way too little too late. Does not excuse for the rest of the film that made me want to call the Marx emergency hotline.",2.5

My second viewing after many years. I liked it back then, but loved it this time. Only the hotel scene with Elaine still feels a bit too thick and out of joint, but the ending in the church with an almost crucified looking Benjamin is lovely and at all the multilayered story is very rich in text and subtext, expressing the feeling and thinking of a whole generation.
The music by Simon & Garfunkel delivers classic amazeness about the simplicity and yet intoxicating atmospheric value.
This time I realized that the first scene with the here so fabulous Dustin Hoffman predates the introduction for Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"", here obviously in a different context.
The camerawork full of symbols is just fastastic and very creative, same as the editing is successful, delivering some fancy choices. That transition from the swimming pool into the bed with Mrs. Robinson/Anne Bancroft is one of them.
At the end Benjamin has grown up from being a drifter. A baggage carousel wouldn't suit him anymore.

"The Graduate gets better every time I see it. It has taken me quite a long time to recognise its brilliance. I have seen it every few years since I was fifteen, and now in my early thirties I fully acknowledge its masterpiece status. I think most people come to this conclusion fairly quickly and early with The Graduate. The Graduate is an easy film to like, it is remarkably and consistently funny throughout its 100 minutes, it has two superb performances from Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman and an incredibly likeable one from Katherine Ross; it is directed with a wild invention and has one of the great song-track soundtracks. The refrain of ""Hello, darkness my old friend"" becomes more and more resonant every time it is used. A wonderful melding of sound and picture.
The aspect of the film that most stood out to me on this viewing was Mike Nichols ability with the camera and his direction to tell jokes, highlights lines and underline comprehension. There is a lovely moment where the three main characters are in the same space and it dawns on Elaine (Katherine Ross) what has been happening, Nichols draws from out of focus to into focus, Ross has a slight look on her face and all of the audience understands that she understands without the need for any dialogue. It is a small moment, but Nichols is fully in control of the film.
The Graduate is uproariously funny, glib and witty; it treats existential ennui with a perpendicular irreverance. Nichols has a wonderful command of the material, the first half hour is particularly amusing, the initial seduction scene remains one of the great sequences in all film. Anne Bancroft steals the whole film for me. Her character, I think now, is the most sympathetic, there is genuine pain to her performance and the character evokes great empathy, even when she is lashing out. It is a remarkably atuned piece of work. Though, I will say Anne Bancroft is clearly not old enough to play Katherine Ross mother and Dustin Hoffman's older woman, she is easily still in her thirties and, frankly, looks amazing.
Dustin Hoffman's stammering Ben is really fun to watch, I love the transformation that goes through him during the film, particularly towards the end. His passive existential distress giving away to a frenetic desire, willingness to throw everything away for essentially not much. All underlined by Nichols in one of cinema's best, and most ambiguous endings. An ending that gets sadder and sadder every time I see it.
Wes Anderson owes a heavy debt to this film, he has been lifting its style and themes for twenty years, but I am not sure he has ever made a film quite as good. Quite as affecting or effective. You'll laugh through your tears and sing lines from Simon and Garfunkel the rest of the day. ""Hello, darkness my old friend...""",5.0

After watching this I‚Äôm stuck with this magical feeling you get after finishing a marvelous film. A feeling I only can describe as pure joy.

The Graduate is often citied as one of if not the best coming of age film ever made. I can definitely see why. If your a adult you can laugh at Benjamin and say he‚Äôs pathetic while as a young person you can possibly find yourself connecting with Benjamin. Now I am know I definitely have a bias in this case because I am only fucking 12 years old but I think it can work for either side. It is a really good testimony to growing up and finding purpose in life while trying to find love. So why did I only give it a 7? Well it‚Äôs because as I said I‚Äôm 12. The feeling of understanding the film on a emotional level is completely out the window. This film is also a film that suffers from like I like to coin the second act issue. A film that honestly just slows down in the second act and becomes sadly just a bunch of filler. The first act was incredible. Maybe a bit too Glorified a points but still just a really entertaining first act. Also the ending is pretty much perfect. The feeling of being young and then truly understanding your situation. Elaine and Ben just sit there and eternally come to terms with the true sadness in there situation.

""Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. In this pool.""
The graduate is one of the few films that I consider to be perfect. Within an hour and forty-five minutes, Mike Nichols manages to package in everything I was every wanting from this movie, with a well done mix of comedy, drama and romance, that leads to a finale that while a bit over the top, yes, feels appropriate and is absolutely hilarious in execution.
When it comes to the film, there isn't really much I can pick out as my personal favorite element, cause it's all done so damn well. The Direction By Mike Nichols is fantastic, with every scene feeling extremely thought out and well done. It's so damn good, you could say it's oscar-worthy. So damn Oscar worthy it Got Mike his only oscar. The Cinematography by Cinematographer Robert Sertees is absolutely gorgeous, taking advantage heavily of the lighting of each scene to cast lots of shadows over the various characters through the film, making every shot feel unique in how it's shot and lit. Many shots have become iconic because of how great they are, and for good reason. The shots with Bejamin in the pool, the leg shot seen in the poster, and of course many more are all extremely memorable, along with the final shot of the film, representing the entire journey that they have gone through. Amazing work overall.
The productions design is of course phenomenal, and all of those types of technical aspects are great. The editing (Sam O'Steen) is perfection, with various edits helping add to the comedy especially, but also being used to tell the story in unique and interesting ways.
I know I just said that I can't pick out my favorite aspect, but what I can do is narrow it down to my three favorite parts. The performances, the script, and the music.
The performances in the film are top notch. You can tell everyone involved cared a lot about the production, and as a result every single performance feels extremely natural, and it doesn't take long for you to forget that they are actors, and start to think of them as the people they portray on screen. Anne Bancroft is Fantastic as the titularly lonely and alcoholic, Mrs Robinson. Katherine Ross is of course great as always As Elaine Robinson, bringing the right amount of confused and Steadiness to the role to bring her to life and give her a personality unlike any other. The real talent here, However, is Dustin Hoffman in the role of his career. He gives the exact amount of awkwardness his character needs, and delivers every line with perfection. Many of the most memorable Deadpan lines come from his mouth and simply wouldn't be as memorable coming from any other.
In my opinion, the graduate should have won the academy award that year for Best Screenplay the year of 1967. The script is among the best I've ever seen, with every single scene written excellently. Each character feels extremely fleshed out, and the plot at hand has the possibility of becoming unremarkable, but instead is written with the exact tone needed to make it as memorable as it is. Each line if dialogue is fantastically written, and each moment of comedy is hilarious. What's also remarkable is the pacing. It's paced so perfectly with every scene going on no longer or shorter than needed, and as a result of how entertaining it is, the experience of watching it flies by.
And then you have likely the most talked about part of the movie: the music. If you know me, you know I love the duo Simon and Garfunkel, so of course I'm going to adore a film with every track is one of there songs. Many of the usages of the Singers' Various songs have since gone on to become iconic, especially the sound of silence scene. One of the most famous scenes ever made, and it deserves it. Every usage of their tracks fits extremely well with the scene and tone, and adds a lot of emotion and value that I don't think the film could achieve with a more simple score. Definitely a major highlight of an amazing film.
Among the best of the 1960s film stands the graduate, deserving every bit of praise it gets. From the memorable characters and amazing comedy, it rises above the rest of the comedies of the era to give us a unique and expertly told story that only Mike Nichols himself could give us. If for some reason you haven't seen this one yet, make it a priority.",5.0

"Each time I rewatch, I expect this film will resonate less as I get further away from Benjamin Braddock's 21 yr old young man's angst. And yet I just keep loving it more & it keeps gets deeper & it feels much less about a specific age than just being alive.
Like most people, I prefer the pretty much unimpeachable & impeccable first hour to what follows. But the second half has grown on me more & more as a pretty unflinching look at the confusions & delusions of the American psyche.
It may be commonplace -- I dunno -- but it seems clear to me that the major theme of the film is Benjamin & Elaine's struggles to not become mere objects. To avoid the mild affluent inhumane passivity of their parents. Ben & Elaine want to be humans with passions & ideals & dreams.
The basis of their entire torrid, tumultuous ordeal is just one single night of human connection. It's not even that romantic. They just simply feel human around each other in a way that they don't around their parents or the general population.
The famous last scene, where Benjamin & Elaine's elation at escaping her wedding hits the reality on the bus: ""what's next?"" They don't know. Maybe it'll work out. Probably it won't. They've mistaken their escape from objectified status for the confirmation of some kind of love.
I think we're supposed to feel the irrationality & possessiveness & immaturity of Benjamin's stalker-esque pursuit of Elaine. Likewise her strange reciprocation of his obsessiveness. They are trying to flee the same condition, but confuse each other as being the antidote to it.
Within this strange melodrama of stunted individuals -- there isn't one fully self-knowing person in the film -- we get some of the most perfect filmmaking in American cinema. I've noted this before: Sam O'Steen's work here might be my favorite editing in any film.
It's no wonder at all that this was such a smash. It catches the spirit of disillusionment so well -- in Benjamin of course, but also in Mrs. Robinson, who only grows in stature & tragedy for me as I get older. As the movie unfolds, I get almost impatient anticipating each scene.
And the music is genius. There are very few stretches of pure filmmaking & editing & scoring that I love as much as the stretch summarizing more or less the entire summer fling between Benjamin & Mrs. Robinson in the form of the most soulful music video of the pre-MTV era.
Basically, this is one of a dozen or so films that I can watch & internalize endlessly. It always feels fresh & new & urgent & surprising. I can't imagine ever growing tired of it.",5.0

"This diary entry was part of a 52 Weeks Challenge (Week 23: 1960s). The themes of the challenge, my more comprehensive reviews, and theme recommendations are collected in that list & also included below.
SPOILERS FOLLOW IN 'COMMENTS'
Theme: 1960s
Comments: My motivation in picking this movie was really just the way it's referenced in (500) Days of Summer, one of my favorites, so I figured I would get the context around it.
I expected this to be one of those slow-burning, awkward films considered ""classics"" and that I wouldn't play along, but I was genuinely surprised. The real highlight of this was the direction and shot choice. There were a lot of cool focus pulls and interesting imagery that made it a very enjoyable watch just from a technical perspective.
I was also taken aback by the subject matter and the nuance of the actual plot elements. There is so much moral ambiguity and subjectivity in this story that it almost felt like a case study of romantic relationships. The acting is terrific too, and without that, the entire premise would fall through.
My only gripes are the ones I usually have with movies pre-1985; the dialogue feels clunky and shots are often too drawn out, showing unnecessary detail, plus the speech can have weird, awkward cadences. The pacing is also a little off, with a lot happening back-t0-back and the plot advancing super quickly at times.
Theme Recommendations I've Already Seen: Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey",4.5
The cinematography is incredible here man. Every shot feels deliberate. Every zoom and every pan has purpose. Negative space is brilliantly used to isolate the characters feeding into the sense of aimlessness and loneliness. The soundtrack is great as well and I‚Äôm sure my grandparents thought this movie was hilarious. I‚Äôd safely assume that the Better Call Saul team went to The Graduate school of filmmaking.,4.0
"‚Äúi‚Äôm a bit worried about my future.‚Äù
benjamin braddock is waiting for something. he doesn‚Äôt quite know what that something is, and he wouldn‚Äôt know what it was if it came up to him, but he know‚Äôs he‚Äôs waiting for it.
if only it could already show up.
mike nichols‚Äô the graduate is a movie that pretty easily stands the test of time. an existential comedy that touches on the uncertainty we face in life as we grow older, relationships we get trapped into, and the expectations people have of us based on the merits and skills they believe that we have. it‚Äôs about the social situations we find ourselves in and it‚Äôs a perfect example of suburban ennui and the ways in which things that we show to the world may not necessarily be our truest selves. dustin hoffman is amazing in this as well. i love watching the transformation that he undergoes from beginning to end, starting off as shy and anxious, then slowly becoming more confident in who he is after his tryst with mrs. robinson (a seductive and narcissistic anne bancroft). the character of mrs. robinson is such a fascinating one, as she transcends the stereotype of the bored housewife and becomes something all the more sinister. there‚Äôs inklings of depth to the character at times, particularly the scene where she talks to benjamin about how she got roped into marrying mr. robinson, and i would‚Äôve loved to see more of that honestly. her argument with ben in the hotel room where ben berates her and tears her down seems so out of character for ben (at first), but upon closer inspection i think it speaks a lot to the character as a whole. ben is someone who is diligent in his thoughts, who prefers to ponder over his situations and think clearly about them. it‚Äôs what causes his immense anxiety in the beginning of the movie. but we also see that, when backed into a corner, ben is a reactive and impulsive person who throws his careful plans out the windows. he is the one who initiates the affair by calling mrs. robinson, he is the one who closes the door and starts the relationship, he is the one who pursues elaine despite warnings not to and he is the one who drops all plans for his bright future to pursue (and get) the girl. it mostly works out for him too, which says something about how impulsivity often leads him into situations that can be seen as better for him, but are also detrimental in others. another subtheme that i think is really interesting is the very quick mention of plastic at the beginning, the so-called material of the future. it‚Äôs a business which ben has easy access to and yet, compounded by his own fears of what the future may bring for him, is something he chooses to not pursue. it says a tom about the overhanging worry about the finality of choosing a future can mean for one person. the ending for this is one of my favorite endings to a movie i think i‚Äôve seen this year. the triumphant glee on elaine and ben‚Äôs face that gives way to nervousness, the picture perfect look at how even already they‚Äôre questioning the decision they made, the slow fade back in of the sound of silence. it‚Äôs masterful, as is the whole soundtrack and the way it‚Äôs used to highlight moments of change. one of the greatest american films ever made.",5.0

"BASIC REVIEW
A film that communicates very well everything it wants, even when we don't want to face its messages. Many people told me that the ending was sad and the last minutes of the film were an eternal agony for me for this reason, but when Ben and Elaine get on the bus and their faces are deformed in a vortex of feelings with no future I finally understand what the level of sadness Nichols' masterpiece released in theaters in the 60's. It's not a sad ending, but the ending the protagonists wanted and the ending we wanted. The consequences of this romantic impulse that approaches a truly cinematic and dreamy resolution will only appear after the adrenaline. Love, the now, the present is what is enough, or what will continue to be missing. Nichols' brilliant directing is not only enviable, but hateful; Watching ""Closer (üë©üèº)"" before ""The Graduate"" left me ending up as confused and immature as Ben and Elaine, as there isn't the same exorbitant, seductive subtlety as Nichols in the 2000s film, ending up as a merely amateurish, brainless piece of work, different how visually delicious and precise ""The Graduate"" looks when it wants to talk about the guilt of immediate success in a generation born on promises, to perpetuate promises from their parents (the shot of Ben's father's face taking up half the camera and completing the other half of Ben's lonely face is a genuinely complex and sad example of the heritage of our parents' mistakes). Even in the most erotic scenes Nichols avoids controversy and still manages to bring all the sensuality of the predatory desires of a funny and impulsive Hoffman devouring Anne Bancroft. Everything is very calculated, but breathes with a creative care that each symbol and dialogue understood manages to unite drama and caricature causing a strange masochistic pleasure in the spectator. Some passages even resemble a dreamlike reality caused by all this sexual rebuke in constant struggle with the norms of growing up, the social isolation within the brain itself that turns a simple welcome dinner into a horror short film, and the celebration of a dive into a possibility of mental suicide. When things try to be fixed in the end, Ben and Elaine get carried away by the choices, and their barriers come down. Like a Schr√∂dinger's cycle, we will only know who to blame for the unhappiness of the protagonists' lives until everything goes wrong and we observe, trapped, the seduction of the first experiences that led them there. Until we get back to the Robinsons, it's as much the fault of the parents in this story as it is the false graduates of the school of life.",5.0

"Mike Nichols
American romantic comedy-drama film based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Charles Webb, who wrote it shortly after graduating from Williams College. The film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older married woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), but then falls for her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).
Kritiker loben den Film weiterhin, wenn auch nicht immer mit der gleichen Begeisterung. F√ºr die Neuauflage des Films zum 30-j√§hrigen Jubil√§um zog Roger Ebert einige seiner fr√ºheren Lobeshymnen zur√ºck und bemerkte, dass er das Gef√ºhl habe, dass die Zeit abgelaufen sei und dass er jetzt mehr Sympathie f√ºr Mrs. Robinson habe als f√ºr Benjamin (den er als ‚Äûunertr√§glichen Wimp‚Äú ansah), wohl als eine Folge des Alterns und zunehmender Weisheit.
Zusammen mit Gene Siskel gab Ebert dem Film eine positive, wenn auch wenig begeisterte Kritik in der Fernsehsendung Siskel & Ebert. In der abflauenfen Begeisterung sind die beiden Epigonen der amerikanischen Filmkritik nicht allein: In der AFI-Liste der gr√∂√üten amerikanischen Filme fiel THE GRADUATE allein in den Jahren 1997 - 2007 von Platz sieben auf Platz siebzehn...
Ohne den brillanten 60er Jahre Soundtrack von Simon & Garfunkel w√§re der Film l√§ngst in Vergessenheit geraten. Wenn wir jetzt noch die ausgezeichnete BW-Cinematographie (Kamera Robert Surtees, Ben Hur) abziehen, dann bleibt nicht viel √ºbrig vom klischee√ºberladenen Musikfilm-Klassiker.

"Maybe because I'm at a stage in my life where I'm closer in age to Mrs. Robinson than I am to Benjamin, but this is the first time watching this film that I realized it's really about two lost people, not just one. I've always watched this from Ben's shoes, but Mrs. Robinson's just as lost and adrift as he is, trying to reconnect to that lost feeling she had when young. Her story is a tragedy and what she sets into motion over the course of this film really isn't going to work for anyone involved. It's devastating.
That's why the film works so well time and time again. Ben's story of connecting with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine is wonderful, but it also ends in that powerful last bus ride that says everything about their future together.

"All time favourite films

The graduate is a perfect example of what art can generate if one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming combination. 
This film is for anyone who's ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who's been in love with someone their parents didn't approve of, or anyone who's had an affair with one of their parent's friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film. The graduate perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. 
Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood. As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations. He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.
As the movie goes on a far darker film reveals  itself, one which was not about innocent young love but obsession and loneliness. Take Ben Braddock's behaviour: one can accept his gaucheness in view of his seduction by Mrs Robinson and even his tactlessness to the older woman once the affair is underway can be excused, as indeed Mrs Robinson, a woman of the world, does excuse it. But his subsequent pursuit of Elaine, a girl he barely knows, which could all to easily be mistaken for stalking, is decidedly unhealthy. This is not 'true love' needing to find its way as we once thought, it is the obsession of a young man who knows little about the world, isn't particularly aware and quite probably suffers from a bad case of extreme solipsism.
The first part of the film went extremely well but it‚Äôs the second half which is where things start to fall apart. The only problem with the film is Elaine's character. After Ben stupidly humiliates her at the burlesque club on their first date, we suddenly cut to the now happy couple chatting away at a burger joint. What happened in between? Why didn't Ben's cruel behavior end the date right there? The filmmakers don't seem to know. Elaine runs away with Ben at the end without ever mentioning that it might have hurt her when he broke up her family. It's another inexplicable, unearned forgiveness. What real woman acts like Elaine does in this movie? How could someone so flighty and spineless make the stand that Elaine does at the end of the movie?
I don't believe there can be any doubt that the first half of the movie is much sharper, funnier, more intense, and just all-around more involving than the second half. Though I do believe that by the first part being *so* strong, and involving us so well, it does tend to make the weaknesses of the second part less jarring than they should be: we already know and care about these characters ,¬ñ and we want to follow them anywhere, no matter how sketchy and unfocused their stories begin to seem. The point I want to make here is that, though The Graduate becomes a different *kind* of film in the second half (a romance, versus the sex farce/comedy of manners that was the first half), it never ceases being jaundice-eyed and satirical about its characters. I say this because it is an easy enough assumption to make that the film makers expect us to take Benjamin's love for and quest of Elaine at face value: to believe that they were `meant for' each other, and that their ultimate triumph is a resolution to be sincerely wished for. 
Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty. The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue. It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate. Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting. 
Ben has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem. As the last shot depicts , Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future. In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning. He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever. This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his/her/their lives. 
Overall, The graduate is a timeless classic loved by many. It‚Äôs actually a very interesting character study but it‚Äôs not entirely perfect. Accompanied by an amazing soundtrack and incredible shots, this film is definitely worth the watch.

Decided to up it from a 3.5-4.5/5. Guess I just needed to sit back and think about it for a bit.

"This is my 1,000th film that I have logged on Letterboxd, which makes me very happy. My relationship with this film has been interesting to say the least. I saw it towards the end of my Senior year of High School & thought that it was good. However, truth be told, I do think a lot went over my head as I wasn‚Äôt as open minded as I am now. I watched it a again about a year or so later, liked it, but didn‚Äôt love it. I then revisited it a third time in college for a Film class where I analyzed it & I liked it a bit more. However, I hadn‚Äôt revisited it since then. 4-5 years later, I took a gamble & bought it as apart of Barnes & Nobles 50% Criterion Collection Blu-ray sale last month. I am so happy that I did. There are so many details this time around that I picked up on. I never noticed before the jaw dropping editing. Especially impressive are the splicing of shots from one scene to then seamlessly transition into another scene that is somewhere else completely. Cinematography is brilliant too. Filled with many zoom in shots, close up shots & long takes; every shot works. The acting, soundtrack, directing & makeup are all top notch too. The story & character development are also very timely with being able to look at it as a representation of the counter culture of the 1960‚Äôs, as well about young people in general not knowing what they want other then to rebel. Which leads me to the ending which I absolutely love. I think it perfectly sums up the film as a whole in a nutshell, with doing something that you think you want, but that it might actually be anything‚Äôs but that. It‚Äôs the adventure of going against the norms, rebelling, but not 100% knowing what you fully want. The story & characters are all so brilliant because every character has elements of the themes & message in them that the lead character is dealing with too.  In the end, The Graduate is a very well crafted film that gets better & better with each viewing. Filmmaking & entertainment value combined make for a truly great, influential film with many positives & comes highly recommended!

The epitome of an American classic. Thanks to Hayden for mercilessly insisting for me to watch this.
Mike Nichols' The Graduate has been a staple in American pop culture ever since its release. I've heard endlessly about the film ever since my interest in the medium spiked about a couple of years ago, and it somehow delivered on already high expectations.
My personal favorite aspect of The Graduate is the layered, consistently engaging dialogue by the writing trio (Henry, Webb, Willingham), which capitalizes on deliveries by the iconic duo of Hoffman and Bancroft, who each deliver perfect performances in both separate and collective scenes.
For something regarded as such a classic, I was expecting the narrative delivery to be a lot more by-the-books, so it was a surprise to experience how much the story plays out like such a fever dream with the help of the winding chaos of the plot, the swooping, moody camera movements, and sporadic editing by O'Steen. The most particular segment that encapsulates this aura would be the final 20 minutes and the seesaw it has your heart riding.
Many people that aren't huge fans of the film critique that they feel Benjamin is a spoiled child that doesn't deserve any sympathy for his actions, and while I can understand that on a surface level, I completely disagree:
In a lesser film, the audience would naturally be expected to justify the protagonist's actions simply because he's the protagonist, but The Graduate delivers so much more to convince its audience that this isn't one of those films. Through Benjamin's actions and mannerisms throughout the film, it's hard to argue that there isn't a deep-rooted change within his character that causes him to realize the weight of what he's done.
Whether you want to deny that or not, I think it's still wholly apparent that what comes off as a spoiled upbringing is a definite commentary that these issues of sexual repression, disillusionment, and misdirection are inescapable whether you're a rich, Helpingham award-winning track star or not.
My only minor complaint would be the commitment and downright stubbornness of the emblematic reprises of a pure Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack, more specifically the track The Sound of Silence. In most scenarios, it's used well, but there are a couple instances that bugged me.
The Graduate is the perfect coming-of-age film, as it tackles essential themes with immense efficiency and style, in a way unlike anything else being released at the time. Pitch-perfect performances, fluid cinematography, and a daring sense of editing will have you constantly revisiting scenes and shots in your head long after the credits roll. Transcendent.",4.0

I see a lot of myself in Benjamin Braddock: less so in his sexual endeavors, but absolutely in his post-college aimlessness, and increasing stress stemming from a constant barraging of questions from family and friends of family. Braddock is literally and figuratively drifting his way through life. This was a wildly unique take on coming-of-age rites of passage, inhabited by characters I found myself shifting from feeling sympathy for to questioning said sympathy on numerous occasions, in a way that really fleshed the characters out and really kept me engaged. Hoffman, Bancroft, and Ross are all fantastic, though I was truly captivated by the former two and their particularly complex relationship. And Mike Nichols offers some very creative directorial choices, such as the strong cinematography and the editing that masks passages of time under seamless cuts. Really loved this one.

"The Graduate has almost everything I want in a film. Sometimes you watch a film and it just connects with you, I knew I was going to love The Graduate from the first scene. We see the main character being pushed along a moving sidewalk, like he's pushed forward by adults in the first half of the film, with Simon & Garfunkel washing over us as we focus on him.
Dustin Hoffman is marvelous. He's able to play the naive, shy, and nervous college grad so well yet later on play the cocky, lovestruck guy who gets the girl in the end. The whole movie hinges on him and he elevates it to a whole other level.
Mike Nichols direction is fantastic too. You are able to see emotion so well on screen even without any character showing it clearly. I loved some of the shots in Benjamin's bedroom with his small aquarium. There were some elaborate camera movements that really helped the scene move forward and convey new information. Of course the famous through the leg shot.
There are few films that have ""it"" and I knew from the beginning that the Graduate had it for me. The rest of the film did not disappoint. Most films about youthful ignorance towards love I'm going to enjoy but this is one of the best.",4.5

"I have a weird relationship with the work of Mike Nichols. Out of the three films I've seen by him, Carnal Knowledge has been the most compelling, albeit, the least enjoyable. Working Girl was the most enjoyable, but the least compelling. The Graduate seems to fall somewhere in the middle.
On a technical level this movie is pretty much pitch perfect. Camera movements are smooth and effortless, and certain technical tricks are utilized to maximum impact (the infamous rack-focus towards the back end of the movie was magical). The sound design is crisp and the dialogue is extremely audible, especially considering the clunky TV I watched it on. The soundtrack, despite being well known, still fits perfectly. And the acting is fantastic all around.
My one gripe with the film is I just...didn't feel it. On a cerebral level I did. But I don't like watching dramas where I'm simply mentally nodding my head to every beat and going ""yup, I understand the pressure of getting older, I understand the sense of drowning (metaphorically and then in an infamous pool scene brought to life by a scuba diver), I understand the sense of complicated relationships, I understand loving someone you can't, I understand having someone love you that you don't want to"", etc etc (arguably the emotions Nichols is trying to bring to fruition are probably more complicated than I'm making them out to be, but I digress). I understand these emotions because I've felt them deeply. I've experienced them many times since graduating high school, and since graduating college. I continue to experience them and continue to come to a better understanding of them.
I didn't feel like I gained anything or felt any emotional heft while watching The Graduate, though. Part of me feels like this is partially due to how notorious this movie is. It almost felt too relatable. That normally isn't a bad thing but every beat in this movie to me felt like ""hey heres this funny moment, here's this awkward moment, here's this claustrophobic moment, here's this angry moment, here's this gratifying moment, here's this disappointing moment."" Certain scenes felt momentarily subtle, but never nuanced or complex.
I can't even fault this movie for having a lack of moods, I just felt like it was so telegraphed for some reason. I assume if I had watched this when I first started really getting into film, I probably would've loved this, who knows.
However, I have to tip my hat off to the finale of the film that completely deconstructs the ""lost guy gets the girl"" ending every fucking mainstream movie up until that point was intrinsically tied to (out of the three films I've seen, Mike Nichols seems to be very interested in gender dynamics and the way, we, the audience, have experienced them on film). I would've loved to have been there in 1967 when this movie first played and just seen the looks on audience members faces the moment the movie takes this fantastic nosedive from upbeat and assured, back to completely confused and saddened.
Is this another movie that audiences, can go home to after, satisfied? Nah man. Life isn't satisfactory. It's not tied up in a nice bow. You might not get the girl. On the flip side, you might. But what next? What are you going to do now? I think any interesting movie should ask the question ""well, what now?"" and The Graduate's final note feels like the embodiment of that question in a weird way.
Even though I don't think it's a masterpiece or spectacular, I do think The Graduate is a good movie, a good movie I appreciate and respect, and slightly enjoyed. And a movie that was very much of it's time and place.
Side Note: This movie came out a mere four years after the MPAA was formed, eliminating guidelines produced and overseen by the Catholic Church. Despite this being a PG movie, I have a feeling the Church would've probably made some changes to the story, including the ending, as one of their major principles (at least according to this random Vox Youtube video I watched) stated that ""good must overcome evil."" Given the attitudes towards women at this time I wouldn't be surprised -- had this been made pre 1963 -- that things would end up happily ever after. Whatever that means.",3.5
"Definitely one of my favorites. It's classic yet it's new and original. Timeless. Many films are made having this one as an inspiration, but I always come back to this.

Though there are some scenes that are somehow ""rushed"" for me, like it's fast we weren't even given a time to like breathe in what's been happening. Perhaps, that was just normal way back then. And I haven't got used to it. However, I loved it.",4.5

"This is a spectacular movie. Great acting, incredibly shot, amazing music and quite funny. It seems to get to the heart of modern American malaise.",5.0
"Second viewing and much like I expected, The Graduate gets a boost up to a 5 Star film for me. I don't know what it was on the first watch that made me give this 4.5 Stars, but on this second viewing, I loved everything the film does. 
It's funny, it's sad, and there's so many inventive little moments. Hoffman is perfectly cast as Ben Braddock. He plays this awkward, unhappy young man so precisely and everything he does is just amazing. I know there was a lot of other actors considered for the role, but I feel confident enough to say that this film would be nowhere near as good as it is without Hoffman in that role. The same can be said for Anne Bancroft. She plays the cougar role so so well and there's so many layers to the character that her performance is able to bring out. The way she plays the scene where Benjamin wants to have a conversation for once and she asks to talk about art is fantastic and she really elevates some great writing to a higher level. Katharine Ross is also fantastic. Ben falls in love with her character straight away in the movie and it's important for that to seem understandable for the audience, and it is because of how great she is at playing that character. All three leads were absolutely vital to this film being as great as it is.
Then there's the Simon and Garfunkel score, which so perfectly suits the film it's amazing. The little rhythms and tunes that play over some crucial moments in the film are fantastic. I think there's a lot more of their music in the second half, but that's where it's necessary. So many of their songs used in this have gone on to become classics. The perfect marriage of film and pop music.
The cinematography, direction, and editing is almost flawless. The film looks amazing and everybody's skin seems to shine with an orange glow, enhancing the California setting. So many scenes are brilliantly shot and lit, especially many of the hotel room scenes. There's so many genius cuts here too. The song ""April Come She Will"" plays over a montage of Ben's life and the amount of clever cuts and moments is awe inspiring. Every department knocked their job right out of the park. 
Seeing movies like this and Cool Hand Luke from the late 60's really makes me mournsome. They really do not make them like this anymore.",5.0
"I completely understand why everyone loves this and why this is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. Mike Nichols is a masterful director, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross give great performances, the script is tight, the cinematography and editing is great, but I just can't help being bored while watching this. I don't know what it is. It just puts me to sleep. I'm sorry, I really am, but I can't enjoy a movie that I can't stay awake for.",3.0
"Yang aku suka dari film ini:
1. Kalimat demi kalimat yang keluar dari mulut si polos-polos dodol Benjamin. Salah satunya,
""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me!""

"The Graduate is a creative, fast-paced and extremely entertaining film - and was revolutionary in its day.
The story is about the model student Benjamin, who is seduced by Mrs. Robinson, a friend of his mother. The whole thing starts to get problematic when Benjamin later falls in love with the beautiful daughter of his affair, Elaine. A simple and ingenious story that never gets boring.
Dustin Hoffman plays his first big role in The Graduate and does a good job, as does Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross. The staging is also very successful, some settings of the film have even entered the history of film, especially the iconic beginning and end scenes. One thing bothered me about the movie, but it is absolutely subjective and due to that time: Simon & Garfunkel is just not my music. But whatever.
All in all, a highly recommended film that is still worth seeing even after 50 years.",4.5
"oh man its been a while since i felt this connected to a character in a movie but for some reason ben really clicked with me.

"The Graduate is one of the great time capsules in the history of the movies, and captures the deep-rooted generational divide of the ‚Äò60s with a subtle bitterness that still rings true today. And yet it remains a very funny movie, filled with enough laughs to simply pass it off as a fiendishly funny entertainment to those whose its satire misses.
A woman living in blas√© disinterest is unhappy with her empty home and cardboard cutout of a husband, and decides to do something about it. She seduces another soul as disinterested as her, hoping to find excitement again. But his boredom comes not from exhaustion with life like hers. His comes from a lack of aspiration and a mindset seemingly destined for professional and personal monotony.
Together, they share escape. We want them to be happy, and so we cheer when Mrs. Robinson breaks down the walls of her awkward, bumbling lover-to-be, but we‚Äîand they‚Äîknow that what they‚Äôre doing is wrong and unethical, so we cringe at Mr. Robinson‚Äôs every entrance and Benjamin‚Äôs mother‚Äôs inquires as to where he‚Äôs been every night until noon the next day.
This frustration, this dynamic interplay of audience alliances, and this tug-of-war between ethics and sympathy lie at the heart of The Graduate. It‚Äôs a film that encapsulates the modern mindset of justifying your existence, where we count every day as precious and can‚Äôt bear the thought of wasting it on something we‚Äôve lost interest in.
When Elaine Robinson is introduced into the story, her mother‚Äôs affair with her own soon-to-be love interest is already coming to its tipping point. By that point in the film, we‚Äôve already observed how Mrs. Robinson has sidelined her husband in favor of younger excitement. Now it is Benjamin‚Äôs turn to do the same, and the cycle comes full circle. Mrs. Robinson a taste of her own medicine, and we see her both as an opportunist and a victim of that same opportunism, all in under two hours.
Benjamin, who we once sympathized with, now comes off simply as a creepy, self-obsessed stalker. And so we‚Äôre ambivalent about all three major players of this scandalous love triangle: Benjamin is truly in love, but we can‚Äôt ignore the sins of his not-so-distant past. Mrs. Robinson is now ostensibly the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù for hypocritically forbidding Ben to date her too-good-for-him daughter on account of his affair, but we understand her concern, and it‚Äôs not as though she had taken advantage of Benjamin, anyway. Elaine is the innocent collateral damage, but her inexplicable quickness and willingness to forgive makes us think she had it coming.
By the time it‚Äôs all said and done, we don‚Äôt wish a happy ending for any of these characters, but we sigh and accept it when it comes. The people who take the morally questionable path are the ones who end up riding off into the sunset, while we‚Äôre left feeling sorry for the poor saps like Mr. Robinson who are blindsided by the wrongs of the people around them. Isn‚Äôt that how it usually happens in real life?
But following every sunset is a nightfall, setting the same vicious cycle back into motion for the day to come. The film‚Äôs final shot shows the wedding-crashing Benjamin and the nearly wedded Elaine glancing at each other in nervous glee. We expect this from a couple riding off into the horizon together, but the film suggests another reason for their wordless exchange. They both wonder how long their happiness will even last.",3.5
"'The Graduate' is one of the greatest films ever made. Landing with Embassy in summer 1965, 'The Graduate' was a major success, opening in 950 cinemas and grossing $35 million dollars; Nichols won an Oscar for Best Director. In a 1968 press release, producer Joseph E. Levine described the film‚Äôs success as ‚Äúlike an explosion, a dam bursting‚Äù, predicting the film would become ‚Äúthe highest-grossing film in motion-picture history‚Äù.

But 'The Graduate' was equally shaped by the experimentation emerging from the French New Wave, on the cusp of the emergence of New Hollywood amid transformations in technology, film schools and American counterculture. As Mark Harris explores in his 2009 book 'Scenes from a Revolution: The Birth of the New Hollywood', aging executives and the commercial failure of big budget family friendly musical spectacles like 'Doctor Dolittle' left room for new voices. But as Nicholas Godfrey writes, many of New Hollywood‚Äôs lesser-known works display ‚Äúformal and thematic adventurousness that far exceeds the ambition of the films now typically identified with the New Hollywood canon‚Äù, offering ‚Äústylistic maximalism‚Äù and ‚Äúpoliticised self-critique‚Äù; the influence of Godard is ‚Äúdifficult to perceive‚Äù, accounting to a ‚Äúgeneral loosening of intellectual shackles‚Äù.
sensesofcinema.com/2016/feature-articles/outer-limits-new-hollywood/
'The Graduate' was shaped directly by its period. Nichols had directly engaged with the Civil Rights Movement: as he tells in 'Mike Nichols: An American Master', he performed with Elaine May at Selma, recalling the 20,000 marchers and people fainting. Jacob R. Brackman describes in his illuminating 'New Yorker' piece the ‚Äúnational nervous breakdown‚Äù. In his 1987 audio commentary for the Criterion laserdisc, Howard Suber notes a scripted deleted scene with Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) hitchhiking.
‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you there?‚Äù the man would have asked, again and again, referring to, but significantly never mentioning the word ‚ÄúVietnam‚Äù.
‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm here,‚Äù Ben would have replied.
As Frank Rich notes in his Criterion booklet essay, the characters are ‚Äúuniformly upper-middle-class (or wealthier) and white‚Äù; Benjamin never smoked pot and doesn‚Äôt fear the draft; Berkeley‚Äôs students are ‚Äúunreconstructed frat guys‚Äù from ‚Äúthe Eisenhower fifties‚Äù. Brackman offers a different picture, celebrating the film‚Äôs ‚Äúlook of today‚Äù, arguing the Berkeley students aren‚Äôt from a ‚Äúdozen years ago‚Äù. But as Harris writes, ‚ÄúEisenhower was barely out of office when Webb had first gotten the idea for his novel‚Äù (2009:122); Doris Day and Reagan were considered for the Robinsons.
Upon release, 'The Graduate' created a cultural conversation. As Harris describes, ‚Äúthe film‚Äôs release marked the first time in many years that so many American moviegoers had felt the direct sting of a generational insult‚Äù (2009:381), becoming a hit amid college students and baby boomers, no longer relying on the epics and musicals their parents chose for them (2009:382). As Suber notes, what was new was ‚Äúhow many people there were‚Äù; Braddock‚Äôs peer group had increased by 60%, the amount of college students doubling. Writing in 'Vanity Fair', Sam Kashner notes students at Columbia University in spring 1968 ‚Äútook turns sneaking out of the occupied president‚Äôs office to go see The Graduate‚Äù. But some objected to the lack of radicalism; as Brackman comments, the ‚Äúsubversive message‚Äù is that you ‚Äúcannot sustain an opposition to America‚Äù; youth must ‚Äúfind someone to submit with‚Äù.

A 21 year-old graduate from Williams College, the same college author Charles Webb graduated from, Benjamin Braddock conduits the anxieties and uncertainties of drifting in an uncertain world. According to Harris, Nichols saw Braddock as ‚ÄúHolden Caulfield‚Äôs literary descendant‚Äù (2009:50), over a decade after 'The Catcher in the Rye'. As screenwriter Buck Henry tells Harris, him, producer Lawrence Turman and Nichols saw themselves as the ‚Äúprotagonist of the book‚Äù (2009:119). But Hoffman‚Äôs casting was controversial: speaking in 'American Film' in 1979, Levine thought Hoffman was a ‚Äúplumber who had come to fix the leaks‚Äù (2009:276). Hoffman returned to New York registering for unemployment (2009:311). Speaking in a 2007 commentary with director Steven Soderbergh, Nichols described Hoffman‚Äôs as ‚Äúorganic‚Äù; he never contemplated ‚Äúchanging anything‚Äù in the industry of stars.
Benjamin‚Äôs awkwardness and isolation is rarely captured on film. Hoffman ‚Äúworried about his ability to manufacture nervousness on camera‚Äù, shaking through ‚Äúthe entire movie‚Äù (2009:311). In a deleted scene from the screenplay, Benjamin is shown giving his valedictorian speech (2009:291), but Nichols introduces Benjamin as an emptier slate. In the opening, we pan out from Ben upon the airplane, as the intercom announces their descent. He stands in isolation, down the escalator against the white wall; luggage reiterates his isolation, asking if the tags match, when Ben has no match of his own. At his parent‚Äôs house in Pasadena, this isolation becomes pronounced. Family friends list off awards and accolades: a track star, the college newspaper, debating club. Mr McGuire attempts to seduce Benjamin, suggesting a career in plastics. Suber notes a deleted scene from the screenplay where a ‚Äúminiature set‚Äù depicted mute adults as ‚Äúgiants‚Äù hosting a dinner party. But his life is his own. The camera moves through upstairs, drifting through like Ben. Production designer Richard Sylbert achieves genius in Benjamin‚Äôs room: a fish tank, dartboard, model ships, sailboats and a globe, juxtaposing an outgrown childlike sense of play and yearning for escape; a framed picture of a sad clown in the corridor reflects his inner state. In reflections upon the glass aquarium, Buck Henry sought to convey ‚Äúthe disaffection of young people for an environment that they don‚Äôt seem to be in synch with‚Äù (2009:314).
But perhaps one of the most well executed elements is its use of the family pool as communal space. In his commentary with Soderbergh, Nichols recalls conflict with Turman over the scene in the wetsuit, wanting to create an image of Hoffman as a ‚Äúcreature in the corner‚Äù. Shot through an Aeroflex camera, we follow Benjamin through first person perspective, forced into the water by his parents. As Suber parallels, both 'The Graduate' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' encased its protagonists in ‚Äútechnological apparatus‚Äù, focusing on ‚Äúdeep, aspirated breathing‚Äù to reflect ‚Äúa combination of terror, isolation and imminent suffocation‚Äù. 'The Graduate' is built by images; as Harris notes in 'Scenes from a Revolution', Sylbert wanted a ‚Äúcolder, more muted palette‚Äù that ‚Äúrefract[ed] Los Angeles through a prism of East Coast amusement‚Äù, photographing ‚Äúevery ostentatious new faux-whatever mansion with a swimming pool‚Äù in Beverly Hills they could find. One deleted scene from the script panned out in a helicopter to reveal 30 identical homes and pools. Speaking in a 2007 audio commentary with Katharine Ross, Hoffman comments he ‚Äúhad been born into a generation not dissimilar to this‚Äù, his father a Depression baby embracing materialism and consumerism; Nichols and Hoffman wanted to depict drowning around the ‚Äúworship of objects‚Äù. Benjamin must negotiate his relationship with his parents: he sits by the pool sunglasses on, unable to see their faces. As he shaves by the mirror, steam engulfing the room, his mom pries into affairs; learning to shave, but still cutting his thumb. Over breakfast, his mom mixes pancake batter, acting as a clear family construct; suggesting he get with Elaine (Katharine Ross). At the suggestion of marriage, his mom lets out an excited screen; as the phone is picked up, the toast pops, right on cue.
Benjamin exists within a liminal space, without purpose: he sits in his bedroom watching TV over a beer, needing to get off his ass. Benjamin has expectations of what life has in store for him, but cannot put his finger on it; as Nichols tells Soderbergh, those ‚Äúwho expect wonderful things have serious problems‚Äù. Author Charles Webb remembers his mundane existence before the film‚Äôs release, stocking perfume in a Pasadena department store, working as a shipping clerk and in life insurance. The disillusionment of Benjamin extends beyond the generational sense of loss of 60s youth and an unclear path in life; as Harris writes, Nichols realised Benjamin was a ‚ÄúJew among the goyim‚Äù, ‚Äúa visitor in a strange land‚Äù (2009:319), mirroring his adolescence as an immigrant from a German mother and a Russian Jewish mother growing in Berlin. As Nichols recalls in 'An American Master', he attended a ‚Äúspecial Jewish school‚Äù, remembering ‚ÄúBlackshirt kids taking my bike‚Äù. As his boat from Germany departed, he stood as he listened to Hitler‚Äôs ‚Äúunintelligible‚Äù speech. Speaking in 'Vanity Fair', Nichols remembers the Bremen landing in New York, shocked by a ‚Äúdelicatessen with Hebrew letters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRice Krispies and Coca-Cola‚Äù. Hoffman experienced anti-Semitism through his childhood and casting, living in ‚Äúanti-Semitic neighborhoods‚Äù in L.A., returning to those same neighbourhoods where he felt aware ‚Äúof how different I looked from them‚Äù that he‚Äôd escaped in New York.
Pursuing a secret sexual relationship with family friend Mrs Robinson (Anne Brancoft), Benjamin adopts a pseudonym as Benjamin Gladstone. Nichols underlines neat juxtapositions through his awkward comedy: elderly couple pass at the hotel entrance, a vision of the age that will meet him one day; crossing between contexts, the clerk (screenwriter Buck Henry) asks if he‚Äôs ‚Äúhaving an affair‚Äù; the party mistakes him for a porter. Benjamin‚Äôs sexuality is covert: communicating with Mrs Robinson over the payphone asking for the room number; taxis and guests crowding around the booth. The immaturity of his rite of passage is a mess of contradictions; the act of booking a hotel room is a sign of status and adulthood, devalued by his inability to interact with hotel staff. In the Soderbergh commentary, Nichols comments the young man/older woman formula is a ‚Äúclassic situation‚Äù and how ‚Äúmost guys started their sex lives‚Äù; it ‚Äúhappens again in every generation‚Äù. Driving in his red Alfa Romeo across the sunset bridge, moving through trees, green lawns and night gives a feeling of freedom. We speed through the climax, running out of gas and running out of breath.
Both Mrs Robinson and Benjamin negotiate power dynamics. As an older woman, Mrs Robinson has power and allure. During one scene in rehearsal, Hoffman describes ‚Äúbreak[ing] the scene‚Äù as both him and Nichols cracked up; he ‚Äústood against the wall‚Äù and ‚Äústarted banging my head‚Äù. Benjamin‚Äôs relationship has foundations within immorality, but Mrs Robinson never acknowledges her own power, victim blaming and twisting Benjamin into a ‚Äúrapist‚Äù, becoming increasingly acidic. Dave Grusin‚Äôs score underlines their generational difference, utilising a jazzy music cue. But Benjamin looms over with the upper hand, decrying her to Hell as a ‚Äúbroken down alcoholic‚Äù, their relationship the ‚Äúsickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me‚Äù. When he tells Elaine it‚Äôs all over, it ‚Äúwas just something that happened‚Äù. The stresses and anxieties of the past become just another anecdote.
Mrs Robinson‚Äôs coercion should not go unacknowledged. As Ben takes her home at night, it‚Äôs under the guise of protection, feeling safe with the light on; she offers a drink attempting to seduce him; violates his own private space; she enters the room naked, appealing to her own desires. She asks Benjamin if he would like her to ‚Äúseduce‚Äù him, throwing back Ben‚Äôs question as though appealing to his desires. Surtees and costume designer Patricia Zipprodt are immaculate in using setting and outfit to reflect character, from Mrs Robinson‚Äôs black dress to leopard skin coat; she sits on her black sofa watching TV with bourbon, greenery overgrowth behind her; Sylbert wanted to literalise the image of Robinson as a wild beast. In the commentary with Soderbergh, Nichols points to the fact he had ‚Äúmonths and months‚Äù to prepare, allowing thought to be taken into strap marks visible on Mrs Robinson. Mrs Robinson still has her story: the cigarettes she smokes, her fractured marital relationship, her tears as Nichols moves out from her crying face, her abusive scream as Ben tries to tell his own story. Her husband‚Äôs initial brief interactions with Benjamin communicates perfect dramatic irony and comic timing, giving Benjamin relationship advice on women filled with assumptions, suggesting he ‚Äúought to sow a few wild oats‚Äù and that he has to ‚Äúfight ‚Äòem off‚Äù; Benjamin responds with emotionlessness. As Mrs Robinson recalls the conception of Elaine in the back of a Ford, Benjamin must deal with the reality of Elaine‚Äôs age and the nature of their relationship. Nichols creates suspense: as he confronts Elaine about his relationship with her mother, Mrs Robinson‚Äôs head appears in the doorframe, foreshadowing Jack Torrance‚Äôs murderous rampage in 'The Shining'. In his commentary, Suber emphasises Mrs Robinson‚Äôs and Benjamin‚Äôs separate narrative arcs: Ben‚Äôs narrative is a comedy, ending in ‚Äúintegration and fulfilment‚Äù; Mrs Robinson experiences tragedy, ending in ‚Äúalienation and frustration‚Äù. Mrs Robinson is a narrative function as the active agent and aggressor; at the pivot, Benjamin ‚Äúseizes control‚Äù of ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù.
Elaine is introduced from the beginning: in Mrs Robinson‚Äôs bedroom, a picture of Elaine sits behind them, watching in in plain sight. The 60s bought its own wave of films about love, sex and relationships; 'The Graduate' is but another lens to express values about sexuality and relationship politics, positioning marriage as a rite of passage. As Hoffman notes in his commentary with Ross, Benjamin‚Äôs dates with Elaine carry a 1950s vibe, going to a drive-in burger place; as he describes, they‚Äôd be ‚ÄúRepublican kids‚Äù. Benjamin is rebellious, driving across the curb; taking her to a stripper. On the Boulevard, Nichols captures a documentary quality, moving past young teenagers through a long lens. Elaine‚Äôs presence allows for a different environment in which to view these characters: the study halls and sports halls of the University of California, shot over 1 day without permission in the Berkeley campus. But Benjamin and Elaine have little chemistry; Benjamin has few date ideas besides coffee; he stares at her across campus through a fountain. Elaine‚Äôs relationship with Carl becomes a perfect Redford stand-in: blonde, inoffensive, walking through the zoo as Benjamin stalks her. Marriage carries uncertainty: Ben‚Äôs conversation with his parents about his intention to marry is a masterpiece in comic diffusion, stressing his ‚Äúhalf baked idea‚Äù is ‚Äúcompletely baked‚Äù, before admitting ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt like me‚Äù. In bed, as he asks her, tired and asleep, yawning and embracing; she tells him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Their screwball comedy-esque wedding has become the centrepiece, shot with a focus on close-ups as Ben screams for Elaine. The final scene parallels Elaine‚Äôs earlier departure on the bus, Ben running runs after her. They sit in silence, uncertain of their future. As Nichols tells in the Soderbergh commentary, the ending was ‚Äúcreated by my unconscious‚Äù; rather than laughing, they look terrified and upset. As Nichols concludes, his ‚Äúdefinition of shooting a movie‚Äù is to shoot ‚Äúuntil something happens than no one could have predicted‚Äù.
Benjamin‚Äôs relationship with Mrs Robinson opens a question around what sex represents. In the age of the production code, sexuality was repressed, but as the production code tore itself apart and foreign cinema pushed boundaries, 'The Graduate' allowed shock cuts to the breasts of a stripper substituting for Bancroft. As Stanley Kauffmann wrote in a contemporary review in 'New Republic', the ‚Äúmoral stance‚Äù is ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù, accepting ‚Äúa young man might have an affair with a woman and still marry her daughter‚Äù, though ‚Äú[m]oral attitudes‚Äù are ‚Äúgetting stricter and stricter‚Äù. As he concludes, beyond the ‚Äúmoral revolution‚Äù of ‚Äúcontemporary American fiction‚Äù from decades ago, cinema makes these statements ‚Äúintrinsically new and unique‚Äù.
newrepublic.com/article/120348/stanley-kauffmann-reviews-mike-nichols-graduate
Mrs Robinson realises it‚Äôs his ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù, stressing it‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to be ashamed of‚Äù. Benjamin‚Äôs inexperience plays in subtle movements: unable to take hangers off the rail, touching her breasts, undoing her zip, but without devolving into lewd sexuality. In the bedroom, Surtees uses shadows; Benjamin kisses Mrs Robinson, inhaling smoke. Nichols took advantage of Hoffman‚Äôs experiences: he asked him when he first had ‚Äúany action at all‚Äù (a junior high production of 'The Jazz Singer', performed in blackface) (2009:294) and his struggles buying rubbers from a female clerk (2009:310). In the novel, Benjamin spent three weeks on the road post-graduation, admitting to his father he slept with a few prostitutes. By removing this backstory, Nichols elevates Benjamin‚Äôs awkward inexperience around sex to a place of greater universality; more people have had bad, awkward sex or should expect bad, awkward sex than have slept with prostitutes. Nichols was caught between two uneasy places: an industry of sex comedies that, as Harris writes, featured ‚Äúas little sex as possible‚Äù (2009:313), and a film under Levine that didn‚Äôt feature sex, with Levine suggesting an arthouse poster with Hoffman and Bancroft naked (2009:361). Writing in the 'Vanity Fair' piece, Turman recalls novelist Calder Willingham‚Äôs ‚Äúvulgar‚Äù draft of the screenplay, incorporating ‚Äúgratuitous homosexual and man-woman sex.‚Äù Benjamin seeks human connection within a relationship that cannot allow it: he wants to ‚Äúliven up a little conversation‚Äù, before finding there‚Äôs nothing to talk about. As Kauffmann writes, the film‚Äôs ‚Äúsexual dynamics‚Äù allow Benjamin to ‚Äúassess and locate himself in every aspect‚Äù in identity formation, beyond the ‚Äúsexual sphere‚Äù.
Perhaps one of the most important elements is the soundtrack, using a selection of songs by Simon & Garfunkel. But 'The Graduate' isn‚Äôt a Simon & Garfunkel film, without the commercial backbone of 'A Hard Day‚Äôs Night' though still promoting an artist and album in the process. Though some films play best in silence, a good soundtrack isn‚Äôt just interested in the charts, but in consistency. Simon & Garfunkel‚Äôs split might still feel tragic, but their 6 years together produced gems; my parents grew their relationship together to Simon & Garfunkel, and did the same to their kids.
The recurring theme of 'The Sound of Silence', cutting between the blackness, the pool, water and reflections, reflecting Benjamin‚Äôs ‚Äúdeep depression‚Äù of his ‚Äúemotional suicide‚Äù of ‚Äúfuck[ing] Mrs. Robinson‚Äù (2009:360), and its return in the final scene, and Scarborough Fair during the montage at the zoo, are incredible beyond words. During the final race to the church, Simon riffs along, in the zone. As Hoffman recalls in his commentary with Ross, Nichols told Hoffman the film has ‚Äúno second act‚Äù; the ‚Äúsecond act is Simon & Garfunkel‚Äù. As Nichols tells in his commentary with Soderbergh, Paul Simon ‚Äúwas so clearly Dustin‚Äôs voice‚Äù because his voice was still ‚Äúsearching‚Äù. Nichols had listened to Simon & Garfunkel as a morning ritual (2009:358), the duo receiving $25,000 and reaching the top of the billboard.
Having trained in theatre, Nichols embraces the theatricality of cinema in his attention to performance and small details, through 3 weeks of rehearsals (2009:290) and 100 days of shooting. Speaking in 'An American Master', he recalls being stunned when he first saw 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and the power of its performances. But 'The Graduate' is equally made by visuals, with freedom to move and shoot from a long distance that would continue through New Hollywood in films like 'The Panic in Needle Park'. Surtees pays close attention to the sun and rain, reflections upon the hotel table upon Benjamin‚Äôs meeting with Mrs Robinson and in the car window, and the dimmed lights as Elaine‚Äôs father confronts Benjamin. Kauffmann enthused of Nichols‚Äô formal effects: his ‚Äúexpansion and ellipsis‚Äù, ‚Äúsubjective time‚Äù in sound editing and the ‚Äúballetic‚Äù, ‚Äúquintessential rhythms‚Äù akin to Kurosawa. As Brackman enthused, Nichols was like ‚Äúa child who has been given a great many presents at once‚Äù, discovering the ‚Äúcamera will do all sorts of remarkable stunts at his bidding.‚Äù
Speaking in in the commentary with Soderbergh, Nichols cites the long takes and filled frames from 'A Place in the Sun', and Preston Sturges‚Äô endless shots where it felt ‚Äúlike something really happening‚Äù. Speaking in 'An American Master', Nichols rejects the notion of auteur theory. Nichols argues ‚ÄúFrench guys with cigarette ashes all over them‚Äù had ‚Äúmisunderstood the whole thing‚Äù, whilst ‚Äúignor[ing] our greatest directors‚Äù. As he concludes, whilst ‚Äú[o]ne man can‚Äôt make a movie‚Äù, the film itself has to ‚Äúcome from one mind‚Äù.
When I first watched the film aged fourteen, the same year I watched 'Metropolis', 'Modern Times' and 'Seven Samurai' for the first time, I was transfixed by how radical its filmmaking style felt. But I‚Äôd already been introduced much earlier: in 'The Simpsons' episode 'Lady Bouvier‚Äôs Lover', the closing scene in the church is transposed with Grampa and Jacqueline Bouvier, complete with a parody rendition of 'The Sound of Silence'. The Graduate has lived on in the popular consciousness: 'Saving Face' modelled its final act on the church in 'The Graduate', using the same tropes to explore 21st century Asian American lesbian identity and generational love. 'The Sound of Silence' has become one of the most precious memes. But 'The Graduate'‚Äôs power has never left.",5.0

"I can't put into words how much I loved this film. It's basically like Scott Pilgrim in the respect that they follow the transitionary period of a young man's life. And although I like Scott Pilgrim much more, this film is still fantastic. I also got a huge kick out of the cinematography. The opening scene alone gives sense of claustrophobia with a tight close up and everyone bombarding Ben with questions about his life. Finally, it's insane how much depth Mrs. Robinson has in the film. She's definitely one of my personal favorite characters in film history.",5.0

"Such a joy to see this in the cinema. It's still funny, poignant and hasn't aged a day in the fifty years since its debut. Fantastic Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack notwithstanding, the reason I love this film is probably down to how much I relate to Dustin Hoffman's character, having been in his shoes not so long ago. This time though I felt a noticeable increase in sympathy for Mrs. Robinson. Perhaps that comes with age, being able to notice the deep dissatisfaction in life that many of us come to know.",5.0

not as boring as I thought it'd be to be completely honest. we watched it after learning about frames and talking a bit more about lenses (like in particular looking at that scene where Ben is running towards the camera and it looks like he's getting nowhere, they used some kind of telephoto lens there). 
it was a very fun and I think also satirical take on upper class people facing problems like boredom and not having a direction. Dustin Hoffman's character was pretty relatable for me cause I too had no idea what to do after I finished gymnasium so I took a gap year and just hung around at home for like three months till mom basically forced me to go to job interviews hahaha (I'm like the most untalented awkward person ever but I still got a decent job for six months so don't get discouraged people!!). it's a troubling time where you're at one end just relaxing and enjoying life but on the other there's the undecided/unknown where you don't know what the hell you wanna do in the future. with Dustin's character it results in a hilarious romantic chaos with him having an affair with a married woman and later with her daughter. still don't get the daughter's decision in the end.

Dustin Hoffman plays the character of Benjamin perfectly, he is scared for his future and whether or not he is going to do the right thing. All of the other cast members do a solid job. The story is relatable, and pretty funny at times. There were many scenes that had me laughing quite a bit. The soundtrack has a bunch of awesome tunes. Things started to get a bit slow around the middle portion of the movie, and most of the characters were pretty bland, but The Graduate is still a worthwhile experience. Also, fantastic ending.",4.0

"""The Graduate"" (1967) is a classic film directed by Mike Nichols, adapted from a novel written some years before.
The film follows Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman), a recently college graduate that returns home and fights the most frightening and confusing thing for people to think about and question: the Future. Besides that, we watch him being seduced by an older woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), and entering into a love spiral.
The thing is the ""relationship"" isn't, at least for me, the most important thing about the character, but a way to show what's going on in his troubled mind.
In the intro scene, we watch Ben on a moving walkway, almost like being pulled back to the past (his hometown and family house). After that, the scenes like the pool one, where he's at the bottom, just felt like isolation, melancholy and confusion (the blue tones and the muffled sound). The last scene, for me is one of most simple endings, yet with alot of meaning: the close-up of the two characters shows us their expression of happiness, yet for a brief moment, until the doubts and question of life come again. Also, the soundtrack is stunning and completes all the feelings surrounding the picture, along with the great acting.
All in all, ""The Graduate"" is a must see classic.",5.0

The film moves at a very fast pace and the performances feel so real that you forget you are watching a movie sometimes. After Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) graduates from college, he is trying to find himself as one of his parents friends (Mrs. Robinson) try to seduce him into having sex with her. She becomes very convincing, so they sneak around. While this goes on, his parents really want him to marry her daughter. Everything spirals out of control here and the film unfolds. I loved watching this movie, but there was a little too much ""sexuality,"" instead of development in the story. Still, it is a great film all around with fantastic writing, great motivations, and a superb cast. ""The Graduate"" is worth it's hype!

"Upon thinking about it for longer, The Graduate could easily get a 5/5 for me. The Graduate is a cynical, dark look at coming of age, and the desperate needs of needing someone in your life. It's sad, sentimental and downright uncomfortable at times. Mike Nichols directs this film beautifully and the Simon and Garfunkle songs are just perfect. It deserved the 1967 Academy Awards.",4.0
"Mike nichols's the graduate is the best romantic comedy (kind of comedic) ever made and a masterpiece in its own right and its a film that delivers a story that we have always wished to happen to our selves as we have become old enough for sex we hope to do it with a someone we have a crush on who is already married but it hardly ever comes true but it does for Ben Braddock in this movie i mean this movie is so good, realistic and entertaining every thing from the performances (Dustin Hoffman) to the music (mrs robinson) are absolutely brilliant well perfect if brilliant isn't good enough, this film just proves even more why dustin hoffman is probably my favourite actor or my favourite actor of all time if you dont count christian bale, this movie really is a must see that I avoided for a while because I didn't think it would be my type of thing until I saw it, so overall a whopping five out of five stars, 5/5 stars.",5.0

"√Ä primeira vista, esse filme pode parecer bobo e superficial, mas The Graduate vai muito al√©m do que seu roteiro simples e desajeitado.
A performance de Dustin Hoffman retrata perfeitamente as inseguran√ßas de um jovem de 21 anos de idade: sem saber o que quer fazer da vida depois de se formar, confuso emocionalmente e nervoso sobre sua vida sexual/amorosa. Na minha opini√£o, esse filme exemplifica muito bem a confus√£o que √© a cabe√ßa de n√≥s, jovens dessa idade.
Muito‚Ä¶",3.5
"A very interesting take on coming of age and sexuality. Not sure how to feel about either of the relationships in this movie, but this movie plays more like a thriller than a romance movie. Dustin Hoffman is a wild man in this and DEFINITELY does not pass for 20.
The filmmaking is great, especially the editing. The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack SLAPS.

"This is easily up there with Some Like It Hot and The King of Comedy as one of my favorite comedies. Dustin Hoffman was charming as heck, it was sooooo well written, and sooooo well directed. Each plot point was precise and well thought out, and the layered insanity of the story was hilarious to watch play out.

"An absolutely immaculate production. Wow! Dustin Hoffman instantly stamps himself into the annals of comedy history, his performance is so brilliantly awkward and questionable, his misdirection achingly relatable at times. The entire film is out and out an editing masterclass - some of the greatest montages on screen, some of the finest symbiosis between picture and sound (with a rightfully heralded score). It's easy to take for granted films that align their audiences with the protagonists so effortlessly, but The Graduate really pulls this off to a tee. That 4K restoration brings out the beauty of this film, so much so that it really doesn't look as if it's aged a day (the water hues!). Just a lovely way to spend 100 minutes.",4.5
"‚ÄúElaine, it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot for me.‚Äù
I haven‚Äôt watched this since high school (the first time was when I was in 6th grade because my mom wanted me to be cultured I guess?) and I forgot how beautifully shot this is. The dialogue is biting and dear God everytime I hear Sound of Silence my chest gets heavy and my breathing slows down to a glacier pace. I‚Äôm 23 now and haven‚Äôt been a graduate for two years but the feelings of hopelessness, inadequatcy, and stuffing it all down with distractions is still extremely relatable. I usually dislike movies that are solely about people having everything but they‚Äôre still miserable because they just have too many feelings and are too soft for the world but this has enough reality to ground it. 
But also why is Dustin Hoffman only six years younger than Anne Banecroft let‚Äôs discuss",5.0
"A hearty fuck you to all the TV shows and movies that ever parodied the ending of The Graduate before I finally watched it for the first time. Luckily there was still plenty to be surprised by, namely how great a comic performance Dustin Hoffman gives (the entire exchange between him and the hotel manager as he books a room is exquisitely funny), and that killer pool-inflatable-to-hotel-bed match cut.
(Watching this and all the other 1968 Best Picture nominees before reading Mark Harris‚Äô Pictures at a Revolution.)",4.5
"Isn‚Äôt it kind of amazing that when we reach about 20 years-old and get to college, graduate college, or hell even graduate High School there‚Äôs this implanted expectation upon us that we‚Äôre supposed to the fit the mold of what our elders anticipated us to be? Rather we just forge our own paths of destiny to define our journey after unparalleled success? 
It‚Äôs so crazy to think about the fact that I don‚Äôt go to school anymore and all my life I‚Äôve tried to meet the expectations of so many of my family members and never once was I presented with just a simple, ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù, but tagged along with that was a constantly unnerving question of, ‚ÄúWhat are you planning to do?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are your sights set on?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the next step?‚Äù But reality has never been that way. We never know what‚Äôs truly next.
We intend to make plans or abide by social norms to satisfy the needs of others but do we ever stop to wonder if this is what we really had in mind? Then when we do take that inevitable next step it‚Äôs down a path we never initially intended, and then it‚Äôs a domino effect from there on out. 
What Mike Nichols does is nothing short of a masterclass in direction. How he goes about achieving those goals and accomplishing them the way he did is the definition of ‚Äúfilm-making‚Äù. Dustin Hoffman delivers a wide-ranged performance that covers all bases and powers the film forward like an immovable force. 
The Graduate is everything I love about movies and everything I love about the experience of watching one. I feel as if I‚Äôll never see a bad movie in my life ever again after seeing this.

It's a film about the mistakes we make, the loss of innocence and youth, and pursuing the ones we love most. The directing, writing, and editing are fantastic and so are the songs from Simon and Garfunkel. Might change the rating to a 5 if I think about it more.",4.5
"After watching this again in a theater, my biggest issue was the shock I felt when Ben started to stalk Elaine. On the slightest whim, he transplants himself to an apartment near Berkeley, roams the campus hunting for the girl, and then follows her onto a bus.

"The Graduate made me realize that the only beneficial aspect of growing old is gaining a better understanding of The Graduate. The rest of aging compromises of a cycle of aimlessness and regret.

"Probably the most nihilistic coming of age film in the American canon, even Godard couldn't turn his nose up at this one. Anne Bancroft's performance is stained into my soul - she effortlessly conveys Mrs Robinson's constrictive manipulation through a veneer of middle class politesse, but her longing eyes still provide that underlying sense of loveless menopausal desperation which completes her character. Equal parts terrifying and sensual, while somehow still being heartbreakingly sympathetic - she has to be one of the most truly human characters I've encountered in cinema so far.
The 35mm presentation at Bradford's Media Museum was exceptional, one of the only things keeping me alive is the promise of their widescreen festival later this year. Who knew that one of the UK's finest cinemas was situated in Yorkshire's anus?

"My initial reaction to this film was confusion over finding no logic at all in the decisions made by Ben and Elaine in the second half of the film. But as I think about it a little more, I think I come closer to understand what director Mike Nichols was going for.
First of all, this was a film whose existence I've been aware since I first watched 500 days of summer back when I was 15 years old. I already knew about the iconic ending, so it was nice to watch the film and finally get some context over how things finally lead do that point.
There is a lack of direction, a feeling of confusion and uncertainty over the future that is relatable to me, certainly at this point in my life, nearing the end of my course and student life. Ben starts out as a proper young man, refusing Mrs Robinson's advances, hyper focused and stressed about his future. He is a character that is in dyer need for a purpose. There is also a heavy desire to be a contrarian and to chase the forbidden fruit, to disregard the whishes of the elders in a rather rebellious way, perhaps driven by the urgency of creating a new roadpath for himself. The ending is indeed beautiful, probably the strongest part and it captures precisely what the character is about. Youthful desperation to grasp whatever it is that we're searching for in life. Whether that may be just a burst of adrenaline or true love. From the looks of their faces in that final shot, it seems like it was the former.",0.0

"This was a fantastic movie with an even better script. I love watching films that came out in ‚Äò67 and this pivotal Mike Nichols film had been on my watchlist for a while so I‚Äôm glad I finally got to check it out. It‚Äôs tough because there were things I absolutely love about this and some things I didn‚Äôt.
Love first, that Simon & Garfunkel score/soundtrack is literally amazing and used so well. I‚Äôve loved them since like junior high and when I first heard they did all the music for this I knew I wanted to watch it. And now I understand what ‚Äú Mrs Robinson‚Äù was really all about! The use of ‚ÄúScarborough Fair‚Äù was my favorite though, just so calming and introspective and to be used during that montage with the mood of the story, it‚Äôs a perfect pairing. The sputtering guitar as Ben‚Äôs car dies was so brilliant and added to the moment for sure. 
The cinematography was gorgeous for being such a simple dialogue driven picture, it goes to show how you don‚Äôt need an epic story to still have a lot of style even in a more subtle story such as this. The use of wide shots and framing and that incredibly isolating wide shot of him on campus and then the perfect zoom-in on Elaine... Really great stuff!
Now what I didn‚Äôt like, I‚Äôm sorry but Hoffman is great as the bumbling sort of schlub dorky college graduate that‚Äôs lost in life and doesn‚Äôt know where to start. But he just feels TOO old for the role. I think he was like almost 30 when they shot this and it felt off a little bit to me. The scuba sequence was‚Ä¶ interesting. I like the concept and the breathing sound, the underwater shot. It just maybe went on a tad too long. And I just think the relationships overall just feel rushed, not a whole lot of time in the film showing them develop. They just go on a date, cry then kiss, then they ‚Äúhave to be with you forever‚Äù and try to get married? These kids are 21 or something and it seemed so rushed. Anne Bancroft is beautiful and really great in the first act but then I feel the character kinda loses her steam when she starts to resort to the false rape allegations and with her whole demeanor it just didn‚Äôt feel accurate, like maybe this mother doesn‚Äôt go to such extreme lengths over some kid affair she has. But I get it for the story purposes. 
Overall it is a really special film and I understand why it‚Äôs held in such high regards. I liked quite a lot about it and it definitely deserves its spot amongst the best of classic American cinema.",4.0

"I read the criterion essay before watching and Frank Rich, the author, points out that the reason it is such a classic is because it is a blend of old hollywood and new hollywood. There is absolutely truth to this, largely on a technical level, but I find the use of romance to be the best outcome of this mixture.
The famous 'Hello, Darkness' post-runaway scene is an explicit announcement of the theme of chasing something that will only bring harm to everyone in the end. However, I am more intrigued by how the rest of the film portrays Elaine and Ben's relationship. The cold process of courting from old hollywood remains, yet the casual attitude towards love and sex invades, highlighting the empty prospect of both. I can't decide if the film goes harder against one or the other, as the combination of the themes indicates complexity. This is a film where no option was correct because every turn was so wrong. At the end of the day, that's why people relate to it. Life is too complicated to have a triumphant ending. Even that which appears triumphant, will likely end in disappointment.",4.5

"¬°Una nueva comfort movie!
Entre a este filme sin saber absolutamente nada y vaya que quede encantado, desde la
Primera toma denota que no ver√°s cualquier cosa, el montaje con: ‚ÄúThe sound of silence‚Äù, te inserta de lleno en el mundo de Ben, su mente y su mon√≥tona vida repleta de aburrimiento, no lo vemos como bueno o malo, no lo juzgamos, simplemente lo observamos.
El gui√≥n de este largometraje te deja sin palabras, esta hecho de manera detallada y con cuidado al detalle, cuida la coherencia pero sobre todo los giros, ¬°maldita sea los giros!, de verdad son algo que no anticipas, todo el desarroll√≥ interno de Ben c√≥mo personaje, perverso, mon√≥tono repleto de una malicia inocente pero invisible para todos, es algo org√°smico.

"Nichols‚Äô grasp and creativity in using distinctly cinematic techniques‚Äîbe it zooms, scene transitions, and just editing in general‚Äîmakes it somewhat hard to believe that he was first and foremost a theatre director (and that this was only his second feature!). The satirical shots at ‚Äò60‚Äôs American suburbia (‚ÄúPlastics‚Äù! Loveless marriages! Those clothes!) are pretty specific to the time but the cringe comedy and exploration of post-graduation what-am-I-going-to-do-with-my-life anxiety are timeless. At the same time, the film seems to me less iconoclastic than its reputation or what one would expect for a classic American film of its era; Ben‚Äôs ‚Äúconcern about [his] future‚Äù turns into an aimlessness that, I think it‚Äôs safe to say, doesn‚Äôt lead him unto great places. Maybe adhering to the norm of going to graduate school woulda been better for him than, you know, starting an affair with his dad‚Äôs business partner‚Äôs wife.

"This was a first-time watch for me. It is a film that is almost a time capsule of what I imagine 1967 was like as I can't picture it sitting snuggly in any other era.
The story is simple enough, recent Graduate Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is seduced by older woman Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) after he gives her a lift home from a party thrown by his parents t celebrate his graduation. The two begin an affair that continues until Mrs Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross) returns home and catches Benjamin's eye.
The first half of the film is light, breezy and very funny, as the chaotic, bumbling Benjamin tries to keep his affair secret from everyone, the second half turns a little sinister. The courtship of Benjamin and Elaine progresses very quickly, he practically proposes marriage after their first date. The final half-hour shows Benjamin develop rather abusive behaviour towards Elaine, including stalking and imprisonment, which results in the now-famous conclusion which is rather baffling on Elaine's part.
I'm sure at the time it was played lighter than it comes across now so I will attempt to judge the film on the time that it was set.
It is beautifully shot and carries one of the finest soundtracks probably of any film as Simon and Garfunkel's folk led sensibilities perfectly capture the feel and essence of the film. Performance-wise it is excellent, both Hoffman and Bancroft excel and there is strong support from Ross, Murray Hamilton and William Daniels.
Shot with an almost psychedelic haze by Mike Nichols, there is never any doubt that this is set in the summer of love. There are plenty of scenes set in and around a swimming pool that glistens in the summer heat throughout.

"Whenever I read about a movie being selected for preservation by the US National Film Registry, it‚Äôs characterized as being, ‚Äúculturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,‚Äù - that description, always makes me think of The Graduate. The Benjamin character (Dustin Hoffman) is actually quite unlikeable, but the general malaise surrounding that post-college time period is relatable (for many, I‚Äôm sure). Director Mike Nichols uses creative camera techniques that give an artsy feel, which seems unique for the era. The soundtrack, consisting primarily of Simon and Garfunkel songs, is iconic and a perfect fit.
There‚Äôs an absurdity to the story that really just continues to ratchet up all the way to the end, but it‚Äôs never to a point of being off putting or taking the viewer out of it. Ok, maybe the church scene feels like a bit much, but the final bus scene gets us back to a much more subtle ending that leaves you wondering. One must give credit to Benjamin‚Äôs resilience - really just a shocking amount of it.
In all seriousness, this is one of my favorite movies. It really highlights the directing ability of Mike Nichols to have a 50+ year old movie that still feels so relevant.",5.0

"Another film analysis I did for my class:
As a decade filled with fear of nuclear war, paranoia of communist infiltration, and an increased prevalence of protests and movements such as civil rights and Vietnam, the sixties were a time of rising polarization and sociopolitical anxiety. The Graduate‚Äîreleased at the cusp of the decade, in December of 1967‚Äîaddressed none of these topics. As Mike Nichols, the director of the film, recounts on the Criterion edition of The Graduate, every test screening held at a college campus was met with the question: ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Vietnam?‚Äù A question that if addressed, would likely have stripped down the film‚Äôs incredible relevance today. Instead, the movie became immortalized by having its focus on the timeless facets that everyone can relate to at some point in their life: alienation, existential worry about your future, and the dark places these things can take you.
The titular graduate, Benjamin Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman) is fresh out of college and unsure of what he wants to do next. His life at home is meaningless and devoid of action, he is merely a spectator in the busy social life of his parents. In one of his parents‚Äô get togethers, a chain of events is set in motion which will culminate in an affair between Ben and one of his parents‚Äô friends: Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft). An affair which Ben initially resists, but he changes his mind after being humiliated for the amusement of his parents‚Äô guests‚Äîat his own birthday party‚Äîby being forced to model his birthday gift, a scuba suit, in their backyard pool. When Mrs Robinson‚Äôs daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross), comes home from college, Ben instantaneously falls in love with her. This creates a big conflict with Mrs Robinson that will make her do everything in her power to separate Ben and Elaine.
At the film‚Äôs release, the critics were initially mixed about The Graduate. As Frank Rich says in his essay ‚ÄúIntimations of a Revolution‚Äù for the Criterion edition, ‚Äúsome of the most influential critics, including Pauline Kael and John Simon, dismissed it.‚Äù But there were also contemporary critics who praised the movie, like Roger Ebert, who gave it four out of four stars and called it ‚Äúthe funniest American comedy of the year.‚Äù Despite the incertitude, The Graduate turned out an enormous success, becoming the top grossing movie of 1967 and raking up seven Academy Award nominations‚Äîthough being snubbed of all but one.
Aside from it being a commercial success and one of the best comedies ever made, the filmmaking prowess displayed in all aspects of The Graduate‚Äîfrom acting to directing to cinematography and beyond‚Äîhas come to inspire and influence countless forthcoming directors; one of them being Wes Anderson. On the Criterion commentary of his movie Rushmore, as well as in some interviews, Wes mentions how influential Rosemary‚Äôs Baby and The Graduate were for the film. The most conspicuous evidence of this is Wes Anderson‚Äôs use of water as a motif. He goes as far as having a scene in which a character lingers at the bottom of the pool in one of their lowest moments, exactly like the event that pushes Benjamin to accept Mrs Robinson‚Äôs offer (Wes himself points out the direct theft of that scene).
Water is only one of the many motifs and devices used in The Graduate to portray the theme of feeling lost and alienated, and the darkness that can bring. Right from the first shot, we open with an extreme closeup of Benjamin, on the white headrest of the airplane seat, with a look of ambiguity on his face, and we hear ‚Äúladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin our descent into Los Angeles.‚Äù A descent which Mike Nichols himself says reaches its lowest point‚Äîliterally and figuratively‚Äîin the aforementioned pool scene. In the following shot, Ben steps onto the airport travelator, once again on a white background, and the Simon & Garfunkel song, ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù begins playing with the lyrics ‚Äúhello darkness, my old friend.‚Äù A theme that will later become apparent, Ben starts out surrounded in white‚Äîor innocence‚Äîand slowly immerses himself in darkness. But as the shot progresses and Ben slowly creeps from the right edge of the frame to the left, we can see that Benjamin‚Äôs shadow is cast on the white wall behind him, suggesting that the seed of his darkness had been already planted. This shot of Ben on the moving walkway also suggests how he is being passively dragged through life while other people‚Äîwalking in front of the camera, off the travelator‚Äîare in control of theirs.
The first scene at the hotel, on top of being one of the funniest, makes clear the symbol of Benjamin‚Äôs plunge into darkness. As he enters the hotel room, he turns on the lights, winces as if in pain, looks around the room, and turns them back off. He then turns on the bathroom light, so as to not be in full darkness while not being drowned in light, and proceeds to close the blinds. When Mrs Robinson arrives, she immediately flips on the lights, but Ben adamantly flips them back off. When Benjamin‚Äôs nerves make Mrs Robinson question his adequacy and begin to leave. Ben stops her in her tracks and‚Äîdetermined in look but hesitant in timing‚Äîcloses the door to the bathroom, making the room completely black. In the darkness, ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù returns, starting a montage where we see him further succumb to this darkness; closing the door to the light and to his parents‚Äîliterally and figuratively‚Äîin one shot. The montage ends with Ben drifting in the pool, once again capturing his mental state in the literal. His father interrupts him, bothered by his lack of plans for the future. In the same scene‚Äîwithout cutting, in fact‚Äîthe Robinsons arrive, and with a shadowy, disapproving look from Mrs Robinson, Mr Robinson introduces the thing that will take Benjamin out of the darkness: Elaine.
The next time we see Ben and Mrs Robinson together, in bed at the hotel, he tries to get her to actually have a conversation. She refuses at first but they end up talking, and Elaine comes up in the conversation. Ben tries to find out more about her, and when she shuts him down, he jokingly says he‚Äôll take her on a date to find out. Furious, Mrs Robinson pulls him by the hair and angrily commands him to never take Elaine out on a date. This is essentially a setup for the rest of the movie: Ben trying to get Elaine and Mrs Robinson trying to stop him. It‚Äôs worth noting that throughout the long scene, the lights are flipped on and off periodically.
Pushed by his parents, Ben does end up taking Elaine out on a date‚Äîwho unsurprisingly wears a white coat that night. Scared of Mrs Robinson however, Ben is hell bent on making Elaine dislike him. He wears sunglasses at night, drives like an asshole, takes her to a strip club, and pretends she isn‚Äôt there. Only when a stripper twirls her breasts right over Elaine‚Äôs head and she begins crying, does Ben realize how far he‚Äôs taken it. He takes off his sunglasses, and looks at her without blinders for the first time. In trying to comfort her, he reveals part of what was making him act like a monkey‚Äîsomething he will do again later among real monkeys, in the zoo‚Äîthe fact he was forced into it. They go to a drive-in restaurant to talk and get to know each other; their connection is immediate. Ben asks the car next to them if they could turn down their music, they turn it up instead. In response, Ben puts the convertible‚Äôs roof back on and they roll up the windows, blocking out the entire world outside of them; not even we get to hear what they continue to talk about.
Enraged at her lover by his newly formed relationship with her daughter, Mrs Robinson threatens to tell Elaine about their affair. In a move she wasn‚Äôt expecting, Ben rushes to tell Elaine first. Despite his honesty, Elaine doesn‚Äôt want to see Benjamin anymore, but he doesn‚Äôt lose hope. In a new montage, his face is now half covered by the fishtank, where before it was fully ‚Äúsubmerged,‚Äù and although sulking, Ben is not in darkness. With his faith unsnuffed, Ben stalks Elaine and follows her back to Berkeley, where he is successful in getting through to her and reclaiming her love. After doing so, however, Mr Robinson finds where Ben is staying, confronts him about the affair, and tells him that if he keeps seeing Elaine he will take legal action. He tries to go see Elaine anyway, but her parents have dragged her off. With an external force now between him and Elaine, Ben‚Äôs hope is grimm, and in his chase for Elaine he now drives at night‚Äîbut not in complete darkness. Once he finds out Elaine is getting married, he once again drives in sunlight as he gets closer to finding her whereabouts, though he still passes through tunnels of doubt on his way there. Of course, once there, nothing can stop them. Not even the fact that he got there as the ceremony just finished taking place. Ben and Elaine fight off the angry, disapproving crowd and get into a bus. Elaine is, of course, wearing her wedding dress‚Äîall white. Ben discovered what he wanted, and he‚Äôs got it. He‚Äôs out of the dark. Seemingly a happy ending, but as Ben and Elaine happily sit down on the bus, we don‚Äôt fade to black for the credits. Instead we linger on them for far too long, ‚ÄúThe Sound of Silence‚Äù comes back, their expressions slowly become ambiguous, just like Ben‚Äôs was in the opening shot. We cut to a shot from behind the bus and watch it drive away. When we finally fade to black, there is an awkward pause before the credits fade in. Once again, our protagonist is lost, and this time his future is as uncertain to us as it is to him.",5.0

having that seed of doubt or uncertainty be an inherent part of your inner nature means that real moments of meaning, connection, love and happiness become increasingly harder to strive for and achieve, even when you do end up acting on your most passionate impulses.  there‚Äôs always gonna be those questions of ‚Äúis this it? what‚Äôs next?‚Äù when the heaviness of your present never quite disappears, therefore resulting in you never fully allowing yourself to be content with your current reality, whether situated in or out of the deeply unsettling status quo which perhaps birthed these very existential notions to begin with.  it‚Äôs a constant and inescapable struggle towards some semblance of closure and happiness with your life choices.  
mesmerising direction and camera work.  those brief and innocent glimpses of anne bancroft‚Äôs nudity, the claustrophobic feeling of the scuba diver sequence, those masterful close ups and zoom out shots.  all things that reveal so much more about this beautiful little movie.  a movie that serves both as a view into the evolution of cinema but also one that stands out entirely from its respective decade as something incredibly resonant.",5.0

"""Well, it‚Äôs comfortable just to drift here.‚Äù
The first time I watched The Graduate, I was in tenth grade and the day after I watched it, my parents gave me an ultimatum: Either volunteer at a summer camp for three weeks or get a job. Back when my life was this simple, this was the only worry for my future that I had. As my priorities shifted in the coming years, I began to worry about my future in more substantial ways that only allowed The Graduate to impact my life in more profound and relevant ways.
After my last viewing of The Graduate, I thought that I had finally shared this film with friends who liked it, or at least appreciated it. It turns out that they all blatantly lied to my face and I‚Äôm back to square one being all by myself in my love for this film -- just like Benjamin Braddock‚Äôs cycle of loneliness at the beginning and end of The Graduate.
Every single shot and every single edit is simply and utterly perfect in The Graduate. The opening scene in particular is made up of only a handful of shots (less than ten), but it feels like a rapidly edited montage straight out of the May 11th, 1980 sequence from GoodFellas because of how dynamic the direction is. The camera is centered on Ben in a close-up, but he constantly paces back and forth as new characters surround him in claustrophobic and exhausting ways. Punch-Drunk Love also undoubtedly derived some of its style from this film.
In addition to the brilliant and innovative camerawork that permeates The Graduate, the editing is just as prevalent. Montages truly give off the feeling of time passing as well as a meandering curiosity. Specific cuts also make for some of the best use of editing in film. My favorite single cut in a film is still the match cut of Ben climbing onto the pool raft then onto Mrs. Robinson. Even the hoppy and precise editing of the nude Mrs. Robinson is simultaneously witty in its guilty and uncomfortable tone, but genius in its radical pushing of the boundaries for an American movie.
The soundtrack was revolutionary for its use of pre-released popular music in a contemporary film, but the way it uses music is just as revolutionary as the music that it uses. ""The Sound of Silence"" is perhaps the first use of a song as a motif in film, and it could not have been executed more thoughtfully. I can't think of any other film that cues up the exact same song not once -- not twice -- not three times -- but FOUR times in a row in the same way Mike Nichols does with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"" during the middle of this film. The soft, finger-picking guitar drifts in and floats away aimlessly, just as Ben does through life. The Graduate signaled the arrival of New Hollywood in more than just themes, but in style, and cinema would never be the same without the surprisingly radical style incorporated into every element of The Graduate's production.
All of the characters in The Graduate are plagued by the same problem in life -- loneliness. Some characters are aware of it, and others aren't. Every adult, with the exception of Mrs. Robinson, feels perfectly content in their ""plastic,"" superficial, and meaningless lifestyle. It might be difficult to love any specific character in this film, but you can't blame any of them for any poor decision they make. The promise of deeper human connection can be a blinding one, and thinking you've found something meaningful in life when it's just as shallow as everything else is difficult to come to terms with.
Paying attention to the characters more, it's easier to see the tragic plight of Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson clearly doesn't love her husband. Her entire life is essentially one tragedy disguised as the 1960s ideal. She turns to Ben to escape her loneliness, and Ben comes to her out of desperation for human connection after one of the loneliest images of the entire film -- Ben in a scuba suit at the bottom of his pool as he stands helplessly in the corner of the frame. By the end of the film, both Ben and Elaine feel just as doomed to follow in the footsteps of Mrs. Robinson, ultimately leading to a loveless, lonely life, making the ending profound and meaningful in every way possible.
Watching The Graduate by myself for the first time in a long time, I found myself falling in love with it even more than I thought I was capable of. Obviously, on a purely cinematic level I was enthralled and riveted by everything in this film. The story is just as powerful, if not more powerful than it was the first time I experienced it. The Graduate is that special film for me where I see more and more of myself in it each time I revisit it. While I wouldn't say that I'm doing much with my life right now, I genuinely hope that someday I find the courage to ruin an entire wedding and elope with the bride on a bus going anywhere.

"Hello Mrs Robinson. 
The dialogue is great and electrifying for this bouncing back motion between Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, its very humourous too. Theres not a lot of cuts and the camera is placed so well, I was impressed already and it was only 10 mins in, the zooming in and out is used very effectively, loved that. Good soundtrack. 
Dustin Hoffman is funny, excellent and perfect tone/delivery pace as always, he never phones in a bad performance. Anne Bancroft impressed me, her portrayal of the stubborn yet gentle Mrs Robinson is iconic and a role that still gets referenced to today. Elaine Robinson played by Katharine Ross also gives a great performance.
Not sure how I feel that this whole film is about ‚Äúthe art of seduction‚Äù and power control since today this is seen as sexual harassment/attempted rape. It really is bizarre how different the world was 50 years ago, the 60s idea of consent is ridiculous and crazy, why did it take the world so long to catch on that the normalities of the 60s/70s is wrong?

"It finally happened. It only took three years, but I've finally shown this film to friends who didn't absolutely hate it. Maybe it has to do with people being more mature in college, so they are better able to appreciate everything that this film stands for, such as the generation gap, the feeling of being lost and aimless, and the desperate search for connection in a lonely world.
Mike Nichols' direction never fails to amaze me with how intentional and coordinated every singe shot of this film is. No shot feels static. Every shot incorporates either a unique and creative camera movement, or action taking place in both the foreground and the background to make the world of the film come to life. I noticed that more than half of the shots that feature Ben have some visual device or object that is intentionally placed in front of or around him to visually convey the feeling of being trapped, restricted, and confined.
The most iconic example of this visual motif is during the film's most well-known line, ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me,"" in which Ben is framed within the confines of Mrs. Robinson's leg. Glass is also the most present framing device used to separate Ben from the world as well as the audience. Behind glass, Ben is able to be viewed as normal, but he is still physically isolated from us. Even the last shot makes sure to position Ben, and Elaine for a change, behind the glass of the bus window.
The way that most of the adults in Ben's life are concealed behind shadows, or other cover-ups (with the exception of Mrs. Robinson) is effective at conveying the emotional distance Ben feels from the older generation. There are very few times in which Ben's parents or other adults are shown clearly or in full without wearing sunglasses or being hidden by harsh shadows. It's interesting how Mrs. Robinson, the only adult Ben feels like he has a connection with, is always shown clearly whenever she's in a scene. More than just being fully-visible, she dominates every frame she is in, creating a truly iconic and unforgettable character.
The use of music in The Graduate is more than simply powerful. It's revolutionary. Being the first film to incorporate a soundtrack consisting entirely of popular music, Simon and Garfunkel narrate the path of youthful aimlessness better than any instrumental score could have done. Their lyrics and harmonies are haunting and complex, sublimely conveying the exact feeling of every moment. The feeling of Ben and Elaine's temporary happiness is as weightless as Simon and Garfunkel's voices. ""The Sound of Silence"" becomes a motif in the film through its repetitive usage during pivotal moments in Ben's life -- moments in which he experiences the exact same feeling of uncertainty and worry about his future.
The comedy in The Graduate is brilliant. The humor is never obvious and is entirely situational. Not a single line is funny if taken out of context (maybe with the exception of, ""Mrs. Robinson, I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends.""). Every laugh arises from the combination of a visual and a line that works perfectly with the current situation to create comedy. The discomfort is so palpable in many moments because the situations are crafted so meticulously and carefully to not rely on obvious jokes for an emotional response or laugh.
When I say that The Graduate is my favorite film of all time because I find it to be the most relatable film I've seen, people who have seen this movie have trouble taking me seriously.

"Ultimately just one of those films where I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint exactly why I loved it so much. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs Nichols‚Äô calm, assured direction, with his use of long takes and the beautiful use of light, but it could also be Hoffman‚Äôs performance; his awkwardness and unstableness, or even how the film gradually evolves into an exploration of love and happiness, with a conclusion that made me tear up. But in reality, it‚Äôs not any one technical aspect that made me fall in with The Graduate. I guess it‚Äôs just the mood and feeling achieved. The feeling of confusion, of thoughts racing and consistently worrying about what the future holds. It‚Äôs something to which I relate, and I felt myself growing closer and closer to what took place on the screen. It left me feeling both warm and cold, feeling hopeful and afraid, but ultimately just happy.

The Graduate is a great film that I highly recommend to anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen it and wants a great comedy/coming of age story. It has a really simple story, but it is still super entertaining due to the chemistry between Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross, as well as the great humor/romance aspects. Most of the time Romance movies aren‚Äôt my thing, but this one was such a fun spin on the genre and I loved it. The first half tells the story of a woman, Mrs. Robinson, having an affair with her friend‚Äôs son, Benjamin. This gets called off about half way through the film because Ben falls for Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter, Elaine. The rest of the film is about how Ben must win Elaine back after she finds out about the affair. Doesn‚Äôt sound like anything all that great on paper, but something about it was just amazing. I never got bored, and I had a smile on my face the whole time. Benjamin was a great lead character, the way Hoffman played the character was just great. Simon and Garfunkle made an amazing soundtrack that fit the movie perfectly. Also the ending was fantastic, it was the perfect way to end the film and I loved the last scene more than anything else in the movie. Overall, The Graduate is now one of my favorite films ever (in the 60s right now), and I recommend it to everyone.

"Woah....don't you ever just watch something and just get amazed by it and just sit down and process your thoughts....that was me for this film. I always love films that are carefully crafted by directors who are really trying to get something special out,and my God this was something special. Oh and it's cool to also know that Anne Bancroft is a total MILF.....well to be honest she was a Milf before the term Milf even existed which is even more impressive. This film is directed by Mike Nichols and stars the wonderful cast of Dustin Hoffman,Anne Bancroft,Katharine Ross and everyone's favorite Murray Hamilton in this film that....really felt special. I'm sure we can all agree that the cinematography and pacing here is just ahead of it's time in this one and it's all just so perfect. You can tell Mike Nichols is a director who wants to make his film as perfect as possible and yeah he does certainly make a perfect film and I just.....have the biggest respect for him. Dustin Hoffman as Ben is just perfect casting and Dustin really did portray this character as I would expect and he did a phenomenal job at acting and making you really feel for the character,he really shines and makes a wonderful lead in here. Anne Bancroft easily has the best performance in here as Mrs. Robinson and she really makes her presence felt this film and makes every scene HER scene and it's just amazing to watch. Katharine Ross may have had a little less screentime then most other characters but you really get to like her and there is a good amount of development for her in her short amount of screentime. The writing/story was all just perfect and it was very interesting to watch....I will say this is one of the most interesting films I've seen by far,I just always wanted to know what was gonna happen next. Also this has quite the ending that I wasn't expecting and...um....I absolutely loved it. I'm not gonna say anymore about this film other then you're gonna love it and it's just a masterly crafted film that hasn't even aged a day...so yeah,highly recommend this MASTAHPIECE.",5.0

"1967 was a way different time. Hot chicks like Mrs. Robinson are throwing themselves at someone like Benjamin. What a time.
The Graduate is an American classic directed by Mike Nichols starring Dennis Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, and is the story of Benjamin Braddock and his maturity into life. More specifically his relations with the Robinson family. Ben is seeing Mrs. Robinson at hotels in the night, and having an affair. However once Elaine comes to town he realizes his love is not for Mrs. Robinson but for her daughter, Elaine.
The Graduate succeeds in telling two different stories, both remaining central to Ben's character. One tells the story of Ben and his first steps into the real world, and the other is the ever changing love in Ben's life. The first story is told in the first half of the movie, and the second story is told in the later half of the movie. The best part of the movie is how the two stories intertwine.
The Graduate is a really funny movie, with all the jokes being subtly hinted at. The delivery of this movie is top-notch and the talent of the actor extends the quality of the script (even though the script isn't bad at all). Also this movie is a very entertaining and captivating movie, with the story being very interesting and the runtime a very short movie.
This movie is crowded with applause and accolades, with it even landing a spot on AFI's Top 100 (I don't really remember what spot). So my opinion and rating won't convince anyone who hasn't seen the movie to watch it. However if you are hanging on to my every word, then I highly suggest this film, and if you are into classic American cinema then few films get better than this.",4.5
"A movie so sublimely simple (and stylish and funny) that its easy to overlook how seminal it really was. Basically the bridge between the straightforward, played for laughs comedies of the 50s and 60s and the modern prestige dramedy (there would be no Silver Linings Playbook without this, and thats just one minor example).
I love the use of color in this movie. I love how it starts off very blue and green and then becomes brown when he heads north. I love the all time great two shot cinematography and the flawless composition and camera movement. It's also probably Buck Henry's best script, which is saying a LOT. There's sl many great zingers in the first act. I got to Buck talk at Cinefamily last year at a screening of Heaven Can Wait and he was still witty as all hell. Can't remember what he said about The Graduate though but he definitely mentioned it. He also Parke his Beemer in the car port there and asked for a large coke at the bar. Definitely a hero.",4.5

"50 years! This movie came out 50 years ago, and it could have been made today. Sure, it's an average romantic comedy, but creative input and time makes this stand out from the rest. Certain scenes were shot with more depth than you think, and to understand the meaning you have to look up the making of the movie. I really like the characters because in some moments you never really know their goal or understanding. It sounds weird, but that personality trait makes the characters feel more real. Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin is the biggest praise here, I felt his struggle and understood his trouble for what he wanted to do with his future. Anne Bancroft was good as Mrs. Robinson, but sometimes I felt her character was too mean. Sometimes she would be mad at Benjamin, but I never really understood her reason why. All the actors do their jobs well. I really enjoyed the ending. It hangs on an open note, but satisfies as a closing to an enjoyable, classic comedy.",4.0
"It's exceedingly ironic that the older generation in this film is epitomized by their obsession with superficiality, when the only word I can come up with to describe Benjamin Braddock's personality is ""plastic."" Similar to the previous decade's Rebel Without a Cause, it's a film that achieves a lot, despite having a terribly underwritten lead character (both proudly performed by two talented actors) -- characters that were written and directed by men who were only marginally in touch with the youth culture of their day. Both of these characters come from privileged backgrounds, and seem to be disillusioned by this, even though they're blatantly (blissfully?) unaware of any issues beyond their own feeble attempts at happiness. If Nichols had been able to convey a character who even remotely resembled the youth culture of the late 60s, then this film would be more than just a technical success. The saving grace in the instance of The Graduate is Nichols' still witty social satire, that gleans many laughs, even if they're partly unearned. The editing and cinematography are what really stand out -- both absolutely top notch. The music is cool, but it seems to have done more to inform Wes Anderson's aesthetic than to help the film itself. The Graduate did a lot to advance the maturity of popular films in America, but it's still a popcorn version of what the French had been doing for nearly a decade.",4.0

The editing in the Benjamin with his normal day/sex with Mrs. Robinson at night montage is the best use of editing I have ever seen.

"""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.""
The Graduate (unfortunately) is one of those films, that's going to go on the ""I just don't get it"" pile...sighhhhh. All this time I've been waiting to watch it and I finally did yesterday and I gotta say, it was nothing like I expected it to be and I feel a bit disappointed. The 8/10 IMDB rating confuses me and I really don't understand why so many people love this movie so much.
Were nipples taboo in the 60's? I didn't think so...that moment when Mrs Robinson first undresses and the camera does several quick cuts between her nakedness and Ben's face made me burst out laughing. I guess I would have thought of it in a completely different way if I'd been watching this in 1967, but watching it today, made it seem very...aged. The thing that confused me most about this, was not long after this, Ben goes into a stripclub(?) with Elaine and you see an almost naked woman swinging tassels around on her nipples...very strange indeed.
For me, Ben Braddock was unlikable. He displayed very stalker like tendencies and he was a little but insane haha.
Mrs Robinson was a manipulative bitch (so now the Fifty Shades reference makes wayyyyyyy more sense haha).
Elaine was an absolute crazy fool.
Love does make people do strange things.
The pacing was off, the characters unlikable, but the soundtrack was AMAZE and my favourite thing about the film and the ending saved it from being a total flop, only because it was so bonkers!

"I don't feel the need to do a full length, ""critical analysis"" type review for this one. There're plenty of great reviews on here already and I would be adding nothing new to what is already a very well received classic.
Sometimes, it's just easier to record what I actually thought of a particular film at a certain point in time so that when I re-watch it, or if I decide to look back on it for whatever reason, I can remember exactly what impression it left on me. What mood I was in at the time of watching. Seeing if anything changes over time.
To that end, the impression I was left with at the end of Mike Nichols' 1967 adaptation of Charles Webb's novel 'The Graduate', was a positive one. I didn't expect it to be quite as funny as it was. Ben (Dustin Hoffman,) a recent graduate terrified about the future who becomes embroiled in an affair with the mother of a girl he comes to love, is so pathetic sometimes you can't help but laugh at him. My first assumption was that he was far too naive and easily manipulated, but then that got me thinking about why he was so easy for Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) to snare and control. It's because, I think, deep down he just wanted something to do, and being in a love affair gave him a purpose. He may have appeared frightened and reluctant at first, refusing Mrs Robinson's advances, yet all he was actually doing was playing a game. The very famous last scene at the end of the film as he's sat at the back of the bus as it pulls away, his face turning from one of triumph to one of .. well ... it's expressionless; that is him realising the whole ""project"" has completed, he's finished, it's back to ""reality"" and facing all the same problems he's been running away from over the past few months.
I'm sure that's not news to anybody who's seen the film, everyone eventually seems to come to the same conclusion as this, but I remember as the credits slowly faded that it was a happy ending. Gradually as I thought it over, I began to realise that it wasn't at all a happy ending for him. In fact it was probably the worst scenario for him to have ended up in. You're tricked into thinking it ends on a high just through the sheer dramatic ""love conquers all"" style ending, but boy, is it anything but!
Anyway... I'm not going to try and go all pseudo-intellectual and try and analyse what that all means and if/how it's a parable to the American Dream and blah blah blah. I'm sure that's there if you really look for it and far cleverer folk than I have no doubt already studied it in much more depth.
I loved the music, by the way. Can't say I've ever been a big fan of Simon & Garfunkel before now. I haven't stopped listening to them on Spotify since, however! It's a stunning sound track. The Sound of Silence is used perfectly throughout - also, I now fully understand the ""I've made a huge mistake"" joke in Arrested Development!
Oops. I didn't mean to go on and on and on about The Graduate. I'll wrap it up by saying that I really enjoyed it. Completely understand why so many others love it and how it came to be regarded as the classic that it so rightly deserves to be.",4.5

"It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen something this great. Often described as the quintessential coming of age film, The Graduate follows a man who just graduated from college and undergoes the typical identity crisis felt in early 20s, under the backdrop of the 60s.
It could just be because I‚Äôm in a similar point in my life, wondering what my future will be that this resonated so much with me but I feel like everyone can really empathise with Hoffman‚Äôs character, even if you disagree with some of the choices he makes later on. This has to be my favourite Dustin Hoffman performance I‚Äôve seen and can easily see how he broke out into the new Hollywood crowd - it‚Äôs true of a lot of these veterans but when it‚Äôs one of their first performances there‚Äôs a certain purity and vulnerability to their performance, and given the film‚Äôs trajectory this is a perfect place to showcase that. Further, it definitely feels intentional that the older costars are from the golden age of Hollywood, which are ultimately very different acting styles, furthering the generational gap and thus how they react to different life events. This is one of many examples of director Nichols being ahead of the times, as the perceptiveness to pick up on this shift in acting style is something I haven‚Äôt seen before.
I actually think calling this a coming of age movie is selling it short, really. In a small 106 minute runtime, themes of identity, expectation, sexuality and even depression are explored in nuanced detail and through very purposeful and often harsh cinematography, without taking a firm stance on any of these topics and leaving it to the viewer‚Äôs interpretation. This is true of the ending too, which while I don‚Äôt think is overly subtle, the small sense of ambiguity is enough to leave you pondering if the characters felt they made the right decision, which is very true of most 21 year olds.
On a side note, at the point I am in my film journey, seeing the iconography from classics like this which has been imitated so much from films after I always get so giddy to see where it actually originated from - it just feels like one of those special moments you can‚Äôt recreate again.
On that note I feel like that‚Äôs a pretty good way to sum up The Graduate, it‚Äôs simply an experience you can‚Äôt recreate. I‚Äôm so glad I watched it at this point in my life, but I look forward even more to watching it in the future as this feels like the kind of picture you‚Äôll view through a completely different lens as you get older and experience more of life, and that‚Äôs something I can say for only very few movies I‚Äôve watched.",5.0

"40/100
I had a pretty unique reaction to The Graduate the first time I watched it. If I recall correctly, I initially rated it at about 1.5 stars. I really disliked it, borderline hated it. After a few days, maybe even weeks of sitting on it, it grew in my estimation. My fondness towards the ending and the wonderful Anne Bancroft performance in particular were what ultimately made me go back and change my rating to the 3.5 stars I‚Äôve had it at for the past year and a half. But today I decided to rewatch for one specific reason, I‚Äôm currently Ben Braddock.
I graduated from University back in December. I applied for numerous jobs and for the most part, had very bad luck. However, after months of waiting and doing what felt like absolutely nothing, I finally heard back from a company and got hired. These past few months, weeks and days have all been so strange. This time between finishing school and what I hope is the start of a long career has felt like an eternity with little to no positive moments. So if I can‚Äôt relate to or sympathize or root for Benjamin Braddock when I‚Äôm in the exact place in life as he is, then I never will.
So after my first viewing I walked away thinking that the acting and directing were extremely poor, despite the praise they have had garnered over the years and the successful careers of those same individuals went on to have after the release of this film. I was wrong. The directing is actually quite brilliant, and though I still wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a fan of Mike Nichols, his direction here is not the issue. It in fact is the acting, but more importantly, the script. This film is wildly inconsistent, extremely unfunny, wants you to root for a psychopath, and treats its women characters like shit.
So Mike Nichols is a comedy director and The Graduate is a comedy. But it is funny in slightest. Its attempts at comedy come from Ben‚Äôs ‚Äòquirkiness‚Äô and social awkwardness. Neither of which are charming, but rather extremely annoying. Nothing annoys me more than a ‚Äòquirky‚Äô character. Now my real issue with this film starts and ends with the character of Ben Braddock and the performance by Dustin Hoffman. Believe me, everything else I‚Äôve mentioned annoys me as well, but if I didn‚Äôt have Hoffman‚Äôs performance and Braddock‚Äôs characterization as much as I ultimately do, I wouldn‚Äôt dislike this film as much as I do. He‚Äôs insane. He‚Äôs uncharismatic. He‚Äôs smug. And with all do respect to Dustin Hoffman, and actor I greatly adore and respect, he‚Äôs just not that handsome (Robert Redford was initially up for the part of Ben Braddock, so that tells you what the filmmakers wanted this character to be). The two scenes that most annoy me are the scene that Ben and Mrs. Robinson share in the bed in which Ben gets her to tell him about how she got pregnant. And the second scene being when he forces Elaine to tell him how she got proposed to. Those scenes are clearly meant to be charming and funny but are the complete opposite.
No explanation will ever make me make sense of why both Mrs. Robinson and Elaine Robinson fall for Ben. Let me be clear, my issue isn‚Äôt why is Mrs. Robinson having an affair, it‚Äôs why is she having an affair with him specifically. Why can‚Äôt she go for someone her age, or quite literally any other human being, of Ben‚Äôs age or older. The age doesn‚Äôt matter to me, what matters to me is WHY HIM? He‚Äôs annoying, and it clearly bothers her. He also takes control of the relationship almost from the get go, often forcing her to do things she doesn‚Äôt want to do and keeps her from doing the things she does want to do. So again, she‚Äôs not with him because she can control him. Then there‚Äôs the Elaine of it all. After finding out that Ben had been sleeping with her mother, she first reacts like any person would react, by rightfully pushing him away. He then reenters her life by stalking her at school and then following her around and creating the most absurd situations. Again, why is anyone attracted to him? Why does anyone find him charming? Both the people in the film and the people who watch this film, why do people like him?
Now I mentioned that after reflecting on the film, I was won over by the famous ending and the Anne Bancroft performance. Neither worked for me this time around. I think Anne Bancroft is fine. She‚Äôs not bad and I don‚Äôt really have anything to say about her. However, I do hate the way she‚Äôs written. She exist solely to be dunked on by Ben Braddock. He ruins her marriage, he ruins her relationship with her daughter and he ruins her entire home life as well as her social life. How do you think people are going to talk about that family after the disaster of a wedding they put on, in 1969 nonetheless. As for the ending of the film, it has no substance, at least to me. Everything has gone Ben‚Äôs way during the entire film. He‚Äôs gotten everything he wanted. The final shot, while for the most part ambiguous, leans more towards the side of hinting that things will not work out between Elaine and Ben. But why is that the case? Literally everything has gone his way up to this point.
Look, to get straight to the point, my issue is this: I hate Benjamin Braddock and I don‚Äôt understand why anyone finds him to be anything other than annoying and repulsive, and all I want for him is to be unhappy for the rest of his pathetic life but that‚Äôs exactly what a piece of shit like him deserves. And while sure, the ending may be hinting that he won‚Äôt find that happiness, it‚Äôs just not enough for me. That ending does not undue all the damage that came before it.
I will never like this movie. I will never like this Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs performance (it‚Äôs easily my least favorite of his) and I will never like Mike Nichol‚Äôs as a director (I don‚Äôt like any of his films). All three of those are controversial/unpopular opinions that I‚Äôm not necessarily proud of as I don‚Äôt mean to be a contrarian, but will stand by them until the day I die.",2.0

"Mike Nichol‚Äôs second feature film, The Graduate, was released in the late 1960s and shows the distinct differences between the youth and adult generations of the time. However, this film has virtually nothing to do with the late 1960s era or youth culture at all. There is no mention of hippie culture, student protests (despite featuring the most politically active student campus, UC Berkeley), or ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll that came to define this generation. Instead, The Graduate seeks to explore the connections, or lack thereof, between the people living during this turbulent era of war, protests, hate, violence, and, surprisingly, affluence.
A major theme of the film is present in the unofficial theme song by Simon and Garfunkel, The Sound of Silence. The song is heard three times throughout the film whenever Benjamin feels uncertain about his future and his current state of happiness. This song is one of many aspects of the film that made it relevant during the 1960s and keep it relevant today. The main characters in The Graduate all feel lonely many times during the film and can‚Äôt quite express their true feelings or emotions to one another. During the 1960s, this lack of communication was caused by the generational gap. Nowadays, there is a shocking lack of true emotional interaction due to the development of technology that has become the barrier between people. The film‚Äôs theme of people being unable to truly express their feelings is most clearly represented in the song by the line, ‚ÄúPeople talking without speaking. People hearing without listening.‚Äù People come in contact with each other physically, but never break through the invisible barrier to create an emotional connection with one another. When large generational gaps, technological distance, and loud, materialistic societies are present, the only thing truly heard is the sound of silence.
There is also a visual motif of glass separating characters, particularly Benjamin, from the other people around him. Ben is frequently framed behind or in front of glass, such as sliding glass doors, a phone booth, the glass window at the church, his fish tank, the goggles of his scuba diver suit, and the glass window of the bus that he rides away with Elaine on. These semi-invisible barriers serve to show the isolation and distance that Ben feels from his society and the older generation around him. He is physically present with the people around him, but never fully integrated with them emotionally. People can see through glass, but they can‚Äôt feel through it. Whenever glass or other physical barriers separate Ben, he is often very lonely and feels the least connected to others. When Ben reaches out to Mrs. Robinson early on the film, he is metaphorically trying to shatter the glass of his loneliness to forge a human connection, but this only ends in more isolation.
Similar to glass is the visual motif of water. Water, like glass, is transparent and also serves to divide Benjamin from the people around him, most often his parents. During his affair with Mrs. Robinson, shots of Benjamin floating in his pool are frequently shown. He is literally drifting through life as he questions his happiness and refuses to commit to a certain future. At his graduation party, Benjamin doesn‚Äôt want to interact with the house guests who are there to congratulate him and instead isolates himself from his parent‚Äôs generation in front of a glass fish tank filled with water and a scuba diver positioned in the bottom left-hand corner of the frame. Later on in the film, Ben‚Äôs parents‚Äô birthday gift to him is a scuba diving suit that they force him to wear for their friends. Despite feeling uncomfortable, he reluctantly tries it on and tests it out in his pool as his parents literally push him away underwater. Instead of returning to the surface where there are other people, he chooses to float in isolation at the bottom of his pool, pictured on the left-hand side of the frame, just like the scuba diver in his fish tank. He floats in isolation and loneliness as he likely reconsiders Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs offer to create an artificial emotional ‚Äúconnection.‚Äù
If there is a single word that defines The Graduate, it‚Äôs ‚Äúplastics.‚Äù During Ben‚Äôs graduation party, one of his parent‚Äôs friends gives him a word of advice: ‚ÄúPlastics.‚Äù On a literal level, this word obviously means that there is successful business to be had in the plastics industry, especially during the relatively successful consumer economy of the 1960s. On a deeper level, the word ‚Äúplastics‚Äù represents everything wrong with society to Ben. Plastic is homogeneous, false, artificial, and unnatural, just like most of the adults in The Graduate. Plastic is one of the many symbols that further divide and reinforce the generation gap of the characters in the film. Ben and Elaine seek true happiness and something much deeper than fake, artificial materialism represented by the term ‚Äúplastics.‚Äù The adults and parents in The Graduate seem perfectly content with their hollow, material lives, with the exception of Mrs. Robinson, and never try to form true emotional connections with other people. The scuba diver figurine in Ben‚Äôs fish tank is made out of plastic (probably) and Ben is later seen wearing a similar costume from his parents. This represents their attempts to project their materialistic beliefs onto Ben, but he finds no happiness or pleasure from this. Ben pursues Elaine in an attempt to marry her, even though the two of them clearly lack love for one another. The ending can be interpreted as symbolically representing Ben and Elaine‚Äôs attempt to escape the materialism of their former lives and families, but the outcome is questionable and uncertain.
The final shot (technically the second-to-last shot) is cinematic perfection. Like Ben and Elaine, I found myself experiencing the same emotions as their faces radiate with joy at first and slowly devolve into uncertainty, nervousness, and regret. Looking back, it's hard to believe that Elaine isn't even a major character until well into the second half of the film. It's a testament to the film's excellent pacing, writing, and character development. Like all great films, The Graduate is able to make so many diverse, great scenes and moments feel like they were in a much shorter film and leave viewers questioning what they previously thought they remembered.",5.0

"This movie can be so much weirder than I give it credit for. Early on, it does a lot of weird subjective camera angles and overstuffs the soundtrack and feels overwhelming, and there are shots and bits of lighting that look for all the world more like a psychodrama or psychological thriller of the era. I also think I want to drop a billion Oscar‚Äôs off to Mel Brooks house and tell him they‚Äôre for Anne Bancroft. She rules! And Dustin Hoffman is also absurdly good. He‚Äôs a freak. Benjamin is just so insane to behold sometimes, making insane little noises and sputtering out with remarkable consistency and being a creep and all that. And poor Elaine, who seemingly just gets caught up in the weird crossfires of it all. A million things can be said about the ending, and I think it‚Äôs because on one hand it‚Äôs clearly a harsh comedown of realization of ‚Äúhey what did we do‚Äù but I do think there‚Äôs also just a ‚Äúwell we got what we wanted, what do we do now?‚Äù feeling that is scary but does leave the door open for life to be, if not good, then at least pretty okay.

"I think it‚Äôs safe to say that we are all a little worried about our futures. But, personally, I never had my own Mrs. Robinson. And that‚Äôs probably a good thing.
This was Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs breakout role in 1967, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. He does a great job as Ben, the newly-minted college graduate trying to figure out his plan for the future when an older, married woman comes along and throws his life into chaos. He knows the affair isn‚Äôt right, but feels entirely powerless to stop it when it begins. Anne Bancroft is perfect in that role, giving off as much class as she does sex appeal, gaining his affections across the board. She portrays the exact amount jealousy she feels over Ben dating her daughter that we would expect. She wants to be seen as an object of as much desire as her daughter, and when Ben falls for her instead, Mrs. Robinson simply can‚Äôt handle his decision.
Director Mike Nichols crafted an instant classic here, capturing the mood of the late 60s with a wonderful soundtrack and open ideas about sexuality. He got a lot out of his cast and, working with Robert Surtees as director of photography, achieved some great shots. The early party scene follows Ben at an uncomfortably-close clip, really pushing the sense of claustrophobia that comes with everyone having such high expectations of you at such a stage in your life. One friend of the family wants him to get into the plastics industry, but says only a few words, assuming he will take that idea and run with it to a long and successful career. It‚Äôs constricting, and that scene plays into Ben‚Äôs mindset wonderfully. Things open up, literally and figuratively, once Ben begins to make his own choices, whether they are seen as right or wrong.
Calder Willingham and Buck Henry wrote a very good script that hits all the right notes. They didn‚Äôt try too hard and overwrite their characters, trusting the actors to fill in the blanks for them. The finale of the film sees Ben interrupt Elaine‚Äôs wedding before running out with her and boarding a bus, leaving the wedding party and families shocked as they ride away smiling. But their smiles give way to a hint of underlying doubt. Have they actually done the right thing? Do they really feel this strongly about each other? Hoffman and Katharine Ross play this scene beautifully and help a great film end on an iconic note.",3.5

This and sunset Boulevard now top 2 favourite old films ( before like 1990). But these are very old. 
But that didn‚Äôt take away from the fact that this felt relevant today. It‚Äôs darker than most romantic comedies. Also one of the best soundtracks. 
Ultimately there‚Äôs this kid who seems lonely. He‚Äôs only ever around adults and family not friends. Yet he‚Äôs nervous and inexperienced in adult life. And this pervert milf woman seduces him and ultimately spreads rape rumours which could lead to his later life maybe being destroyed and ruins any chances he had with her daughter who he actually connected with. And from this he gains life experience and maturity. Whilst it‚Äôs not laugh out loud funny. It‚Äôs enjoyable most the way through. I think some of the middle act was a bit slow paced but not bad. 
The bit where he‚Äôs in the hotel and gets the room was funny. Stuff he was saying was pretty goat behaviour

"New favorite once again! Dustin Hoffman was literally perfect for this role, he portrays the character and the feelings he feels perfectly. I love the camerawork, each aspect of it is thought out perfectly. Like how at the beginning where Ben is being greeted by the many family friends of his and how they use a handheld camera to portray the annoyance and anxiety he feels from this. Also the realization scene of where Elaine realizes that Ben had an affair with her mother is shot by making Elaine‚Äôs face very blurry and as she begins to realize the truth her face becomes more and more coherent. Usually I don‚Äôt like romances but this one is quite special. At the end, on the bus, both Elaine and Ben realize that their decision wasn‚Äôt thought through enough, which you can tell by their facial expressions going from happiness to more and more worried. I really wish I was back in California again because this movie is making me yearn to go back there. I could go on and on about this movie but I got more movies to watch so I‚Äôll end it here.

"Words can not describe how amazing this film is.
The Graduate is the quintessential coming of age flick, if you ignore the affair with Mrs. Robinson - as I do not think that is quite relatable. The feeling of not knowing what you want to do with your life. The feeling of your parents trying to force you into becoming just like them, having a life just like theirs. Wanting a different experience than others. Getting what you want and realizing you still have no idea on how to navigate the world or who you are.
Despite this film debuting in 1967, this film has managed to stay so relevant and relatable due to its themes and messages.
In my personal opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. The acting, the soundtrack, the plot, the cinematography, the symbolism.. the foreshadowing. Just amazing.",5.0

Five years after first my first viewing, The Graduate remains a film that only becomes more and more relatable for me each and every time I watch it. When I laugh, I'm laughing at the movie, but I also feel like I'm laughing at myself. Watching The Graduate is like looking in the mirror for an hour and 46 minutes, except I actually like what I'm seeing.
I finally got around to exploring many of the special features on the Criterion edition of this movie and I absolutely adored everything about it. From the excessively long and meandering original trailer to the hours upon hours of interviews and insights from the aging cast and crew members, I felt like a kid in a candy store. I loved watching the crew explain how everyone hated Dustin Hoffman as the lead before the film was released. Buck Henry and Lawrence Turman recounting their experiences making this film is like watching them relive the happiest moments of their lives. It's amazing that it took me this long to take a deep-dive into the making of my all-time favorite movie, but I only love it even more now.
Watching the screen tests for Ben and Elaine by other lesser actors was quite a revelatory experience. It makes it clear how easily this film could have been ruined in the filmmaking process. All it would have taken to ruin the entire film was one overly-serious person who had no grasp of the comedic tone of the film. The other actors who screen tested weren't bad, but they were far too melodramatic and had no grasp of the material they were filming. Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross have such electrifying and lighthearted chemistry together. It's like lightning in a bottle.
The Graduate is filled to the brim with captivating, creative, and daring filmmaking techniques. Mike Nichols wasn't afraid to demand what he wanted while making The Graduate and it paid off. He insisted on using the church in the final scene and the film wouldn't work without it. The way the movie was filmed is so confident that it demands your attention without distracting from the story. The Graduate is one of the first American films to demonstrate the revolutionary style of the French New Wave. The use of popular music, POV shots, and unconventional editing would seem to distract from the story, but it all elevates it to brilliant heights.
The first boob Dustin Hoffman ever felt was on a girl wearing blackface.

"I can see people quickly dismissing The Graduate as a quirky coming of age story with love affairs, but is a movie that holds more value today than anything else.
In a society made by consumerism and capitalism everyone is trying to make a meaning out of themselves is there any meaning within life?. Some could argue that the relationship the protagonist has with Miss Robinson wouldn't be that far off from the type of relationships young men/women have on Tinder or Grindr in case of gay/bi guys with older people and these people just aren't aware of what they are getting themseleves, because in the mindst of all the mandess in life, this is a movie about hopeless people making hopeless relationships trying to find something in the world, we know these relationships won't last and you are irrational thinking you will but you just want to get something out this parents would your parents rethink it twice their marriage the same way? It is something to think about in what makes life that maxes the graduate so complex and go beyond a quirky coming of age movie. But the question in life always remains
''What does the future hold?''
Is your love for this person going to be the same from 10 years on? Is your degree going to be worth it?. Because from generations and generations that's what we seek a connection to life that isn't going to last forever.",4.5

"I like how at the beginning of this film the camera puts you firmly in Benjamin's mindset. The party scenes become a floating anxious-comedic nightmare, conjuring up the character's turmoil. What really makes the film special, however, is how much it begins to distance you as the film goes along. By the last act Benjamin is a rom-com protagonist with this glitz and charm fully stripped away, until he's basically The Shape hiding in the bushes stalking a woman.
It's weird how most of the characters lose their complexity as we near the last act, but I think it's mainly an effect of our POV character losing his internal complexity, becoming a rote estranged being with one goal shambling like an alien from step to step. He doesn't recognize his own interiority at this point, let alone anyone else's.
Plus, of course, that damn ending is phenomanal.",4.5

"Three times I have seen this, and three times I've found myself unable to like it. Having now read Charles Webb's original novel, however, I can clearly see all of the ideas contained in the story.
On one hand, it's a somewhat universal story about the transition from childhood to adulthood, and the many conflicts that come with it; I feel that Ben's parents are representative of the inevitable responsibility of adulthood, while Mrs. Robinson represents the consequences that can come from a lack of that very responsibility.
It's also a story about the changing culture of the 1960s (that interestingly came out right in the midst of it); the children of the generation that won WWII were caught in a simultaneous flurry of privilege and expectation, and their only feasible reaction was to stand counter to what any authoritative figure instructed of them. We see that very clearly here with Ben, who disobeys his parents and the Robinsons to a point that might have a permanent effect on several people's lives, including his own (this seemingly comes to fruition in the final moment where the true light of the situation appears to dawn on Ben and Elaine).
I used to think Ben and Elaine's relationship was rushed, and while in some ways I still do, I realize now that it's rushed by design. Elaine arrives at a point in the story where Ben feels an utter sense of defeat, and he appears to see something special in her; whether it's a kindred spirit, a symbol of innocence and simplicity, or something else entirely, Ben truly feels that Elaine is the only one who understands him. As we know, Ben quickly and easily becomes misguided by that, which leads to the aforementioned conclusion, and the ultimate realization that revolution without purpose has great potential to do more harm than good.
All those ideas are there, and I suppose they're communicated well enough, but what ultimately keeps this movie at a relatively mediocre level for me is the all-around execution. I never know exactly how I'm supposed to feel or react to the events onscreen; sometimes it seems like a dry comedy, but the performances and dialogue come off as so clumsy that I don't feel comfortable laughing at it. All I can really do is take in the events and gauge my internal reactions, but the story is so oddly paced and presented that I'm never quite sure how to do that either.
What I can say this time is that, having read the book, the filmmakers and performers didn't have much to work with. The dialogue in the book is (by design) clumsy, repetitive, and without any discernible inflection, and I find that this style doesn't translate well to the screen. The technical aspects of this movie are too well done for me to think that it's some sort of terse, matter-of-fact presentation of life, but the lack of charisma is too noticeable for me to accept it as a straightforward narrative. It's a strange cinematic stalemate that I could never articulate before reading the book, but now I see where the problem lies.
I feel that I can now say with relative confidence that I'll probably never consider this to be one of my favorites. As I said before, it has some fantastically well-realized ideas that still hold plenty of weight, but the movie itself doesn't have a strong enough structure to really let those ideas shine the way they should. I suppose what I'm ultimately saying is that this isn't for me, nor do I think it ever will be. If for nothing else, I'm glad I can finally put my finger on why I don't dig it as much as many others do, but I do still have hope that someday I might come around on it. Someday...",2.5
"I've been on vacation for a week so I'm easing back into reviewing with a short review of The Graduate starring Dustin Hoffman. I had seen this film many years ago but barely remember it, probably wasn't paying attention knowing me. However, upon a second viewing I was able to fully appreciate what a gem this film is.
Dustin Hoffman's performance is outstanding; his shy, naive awkwardness brought a lot of levity to the film and makes us care for him. He plays a character named Ben who has recently graduated from college but hasn't quite figured out what to do next in his life. As a graduate myself, I really identified with the character; during the party scene at the beginning of the film, his family and friends congratulate him and constantly ask what he is going to do now, a question that he does not know the answer to yet. These are the same questions I dreaded being asked after I graduated because I wasn't quite sure what route I was going to take and to be honest I still don't!
The cinematography is the film is also very beautiful, including shots that are famous in film history. The angles are awkward and usual at times just like our main protagonist and on quite a few occasions, Ben is covered in darkness reflecting the aimless despair he is feeling. Not only does the cinematography reflect our characters feelings and mental state but the Simon & Garfunkel songs enforce it very well from The Sound of Silence to Scarborough Fair, very off-beat yet incredibly fitting songs for the narrative.
The ending of this film I feel is going to become one of my favourites of all time. After the unexpected brawl in the church, Elaine and Ben escape on a Santa Barbara bus. At first they are happy and enthralled by what has just happened as they come to realise the reality of it, the happiness slowly drains from both of their faces. Exquisite.
I really cannot wait to get in some more repeat viewings of this film because it truly is a classic.",4.5

"My life is such a waste. It's just nothing.
It's quite amazing how this 60s movie is still socially relevant up until today, and who knows maybe 20 or 50 years later.
For a classic movie, The Graduate was just nearly perfect and phenomenal. The confusion that's Benji felt after he graduated was just surreal, I mean, that was exactly what I felt right after I graduated from undergrad school 6 months ago. I was scared, I was confused, I was anxious, I just did not know where the future was gonna hold. Basically, the movie rest on that issue with a little bit of love triangle dramatization that it made The Graduate became very profoundly compelling.
There were quite an awkward moment here and there, however that was probably the reason why the movie felt so down to earth and relevant. What I fond the most was the cinematography, it was freaking eye catchy, aye? The angle was very unique, the transition was smoothly moving, so vintage yet technically well aclaimmed. I just regret that I didn't watch this movie sooner.

I had always assumed Wayne's World made a large portion of the church scene up, but I was shocked to see how much of it was lifted directly.
An interesting movie. I'm reading other peoples reviews and then contrasting it with my own opinions of it and they don't quite mesh up. I liked the movie, but I also found it very troubling and not quite the light hearted comedy so many people view it as. It is a good movie, the disconnect Ben has from the world around him as The Sound of Silence plays over the scenes really resonated with me. Right as he returns triumphantly from college there's the song, right after he gets the girl there's the song. Moments he should be savoring always end with the song.

Everyone was laughing really hard, myself most of all: this movie is so freaking funny. Using ""The Sound of Silence"" as a punchline to really sad character moments is genius. The entire first sequence at the Taft hotel is a masterpiece of pacing and comedic timing. 

I think the whole movie is perfect, but I especially adore the first hour, which is an excellent character study of a very aimless and lonely man, and an equally lonely and aimless older woman, who no longer has the liberty of time to figure things out for herself. Everyone is sad and selfish in this movie, but we empathize with these emotions that they are exhibiting.

One of my favorites.",0.0
"I have so many things to say about ‚ÄúThe Graduate‚Äù but I‚Äôll just stick with the most important.

The Graduate is about relationships, empty relationships.

Ben‚Äôs relationship with his parents is empty because they expect something out from him he doesn‚Äôt want to do, conformed to their lifestyle which is empty on its own.

His relationship with Mrs. Robinson is empty because it‚Äôs strictly physical and emotionally detached. It turns out being more like a drug than just sex. This toxicity is evident by Ben taking up smoking during the affair.

Mr and Mrs Robinson relationship is empty since they‚Äôve only stayed together because of the pregnancy.

Elaine‚Äôs relationship with Carl is empty because it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs unsure of and also because her parents had a large role in arranging the wedding for her.

All the relationships here are empty because they are all based in the happiness through the ownership of stuff and given how women were treated in the late 60‚Äôs, people.

The only relationship with real potential is Ben and Elaine‚Äôs. Ben is so empty inside that the only thing that pushes him forward is his relationship with Elaine and that‚Äôs all it took him to do everything to have her.

I think that in the final scene in the end when the smiles fade away, means that they knew they were making a mistake, which reminds us to another failed relationship, Mr and Mrs Robinson‚Äôs and why Mrs Robinson strictly didn‚Äôt want them to date, so that they don‚Äôt make the same mistake they‚Äôve made.
Mike Nichols‚Äôs understanding of the world his characters live in is splendourous, from another world. He deserved and still deserves that Oscar he won.
Also Sam O‚ÄôSteene in the editing did a wonderful job. This is one of the best editing in filming history. He had an amazing career editing films like Chinatown, Rosemary‚Äôs Baby and Cool Hand Luke.
I wanna talk about the initial scene though. Benjamin is being pulled along by a sidewalk as if life is controlling him, just pulling him along. 

The Sound of Silence is on in three parts of the movies and in all three parts gives this feeling of uncertainty that amazed me so much. The BSO is perfectly used here and I loved that.

Also Katharine Ross was beautiful.

I have to admit that the first time I watched The Graduate I wasn't really into it, but I wasn't really giving it a fair chance either. That's why I bought it in one of Barnes & Noble's Criterion sales a while back. I knew I needed to revisit it when I was ready. Tonight was the night.
I still like the first half of the film better than the second. The affair with Mrs. Robinson is a bit sad, but it's also darkly comedic as Ben is so completely out of his element and trying so hard to find some reason for being with her other than the obvious. Once Elaine comes home, he's even further out of his element though. He has no idea how to handle the situation and his attempt to turn Elaine off is hilariously dimwitted. But that's also where the film shows how well written the script is as these young kids go from hate to love to hate again in less then 24 hours, simply because Ben is an idiot. The scene that really shows how little these two know about life is the final one as they escape the church and get on the bus triumphantly. The smiles on their faces couldn't be any bigger. And then reality sets in and you can almost see the thought, ""What the fuck did we just do?"" pass across their eyes.

"So this is where the Fifty Shades Mrs. Robinson reference came from. 

First of all, this film is as old as my parents yet still very relevant today. At some point in our lives, we all were Ben Braddock - in that gray area between being young and being old, where we are either forced to make decisions for ourselves or end up taking orders from the much experienced adults around us - and that is what makes this film hella relatable. The only time Ben was able to take hold of his life was when he decided to go to Berkeley and ask Elaine to marry him. Everything about this movie just blows me away, Mike Nichols deserves all the awards just for that pool-dive-to-bed transition. It's one of those films that just ages well in my opinion.",4.0

"Could this be Hoffman's defining role? That it came so early in his career isn't necessarily to his own detriment, especially considering his own doubts about his suitability. In a way that may have seeped into his performance and been channelled by Hoffman himself. I had only seen The Graduate once before and one thing that occurred to me is that Hollywood doesn't make comedy films so confidently restrained as this. It is the awkward silences and the half sentences that make The Graduate so funny. Perhaps the subject is now taboo. A 20 year old has an affair with a woman twice his age then falls in love with her daughter. It is quite a web that is woven here. The Graduate is full of surprises and no more so than that final shot. A brave ending, but a necessasry one. One in line with idiosyncratic nature of the film.",4.0
"Film School Drop Outs - Weekly Challenge 2017
Week 26: Movement - New Hollywood (1968-1980)
The feeling of this film, only after watching it for a few minutes, reminded me quite a bit of Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude, which I believe also falls into the New Hollywood category. I'm thinking that Harold and Maude actually took cues from The Graduate since The Graduate seems to be one of the first New Hollywood films; it's incredibly sly, and absolutely brimming with editing and tonal choices that are downright inspired.
Since I don't live under a rock, I already knew the gist of the plot, its most famous lines (""Plastics......"") and the very last scene. Even so I was totally engrossed. The leads are all great but Anne Bancroft in particular had me cackling - her comedic timing and the ways her lines slink out of her is flawless.
I did not know that I'd be treated to ""Hello darkness, my old friend..."" right out of the gate. This is how a movie should be scored if the music is gonna be contemporary. I paused the movie a handful of times to look up Simon and Garfunkel on Spotify.
Side note: while I'd like to see some citations, the lists of actors considered for Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson are nuts in the best way. Can you imagine The Graduate, starring Jack Nance (aka Eraserhead) and Anouk Aim√©e? Steve McQueen and Audrey Hepburn? Jack Nicholson and Joan Crawford? Christ......",4.5
"This is one of those movies that I have returned to every now and then for some odd reason. I felt like the Fathom Event screening of this provided a good enough excuse to see it again. The truth is that the film is so good. There's so many striking images that grab me. I could watch those opening credits if they lasted for another five minutes. I could see more montages of Dustin Hoffman jumping from a pool onto Anne Bancroft. I could watch him drive around the California coastline as Simon and Garfunkel played behind him. This film's ""nothing"" moments are better than most film's ""something"" moments.
With that said, I think a portion of the film's charm is lost on me. I cannot seem to undoubtedly love this movie as much as I want. It could be that - for reasons that allude me - I think that the middle drags a little. Not enough to derail the movie, but the shift between the Robinson women definitely has drama that doesn't connect with me. Maybe I am just not one for infidelity. Maybe it's something about the idealized 60's youth culture that I don't get. After all, it's been 50 years. If anything deserves to show its age, it's a 50 year old ""youth"" movie.
Yet I keep coming back to it, hoping that I get over those bumps that I cannot quite get over. Don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining movie and Hoffman started off his film career very well. However, I think to younger viewers like myself, it is easier to see as a drama than a comedy. Yes, there's awkward humor, but the subject feels richer than that. I think it's in part because I often overlook bad jokes (though not here) in comedies for the story, and I don't know that too much of the affair stuff is funny. Maybe I just need to travel back in time and experience a generation who liked Love American Style. Who knows.
Still, I'll keep searching for the answers every now and then. Maybe I'll figure it out by the time I'm 30. It's my Aunt's favorite movie, and I hesitate asking her why that is because I want to find the answer myself. I guess in that sense I'm just like this movie: lost and unsure. Still, this is a masterpiece worthy of the big screen, and I'm glad to have seen it that way once in my life.",4.0
"A genius work of art. Fine cinema from one of the greatest periods in American film history thus far. Evocative, sensual, humorous, satirical, and best of all, relatable.
The Graduate follows the life of young Benjamin (Hoffman), who's just earned his undergraduate degree and has no idea what he wants out of life. Along the way, he begins a steamy affair with the smoldering Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), a longtime family friend. While unwinding and taking advantage of all the spare time summer has to offer, Benjamin finds himself caught up in a bigger dilemma -- one that threatens his future, happiness, and love life.
Some of the best acting you will see is right here in this film. You can't ask for a better cast: Bancroft and Hoffman (still new to the screen!) are professionals, slipping effortlessly into their respective roles. Katharine Ross is great. Not one actor gives a weak performance. The dialogue is wonderfully poignant, witty, and makes for some great laughs.
This is the zeitgeist of the counterculture era, the sexual revolution and the winds of changes that dominated the late 60s. One of my all time favorite films, and one that's not to be passed up on by any means. 4.5 stars.",4.5
"Always find a way to come back to The Graduate this week was seeing Art Garfunkel in Bad Timing. Not that the films are in any way are alike just kept singing Simon & Garfunkel songs all week.
Watched this on my small mobile phone and it's still the most brilliant social satire film ever. Most film fans have seen this and know it's significance in history. 
For  me The Graduate was the birth of quirky social comedies. It's a little off beat in its characters and story. Particularly Hoffman walking around in Scuba Diving gear. Directors such as Alexander Payne, Wes Anderson, Jason Reitman all can be thankful for this classic film. 


Love this film so much",5.0
"The Graduate seemed to hold the same tone throughout the whole movie. The melodic music and zoom shots add a sort of seriousness that counteracts the subtle humor. The editing is also gorgeous. The cuts between scenes fit perfectly with the next sequence. I really enjoyed this early ""New Wave"" Era innovative piece. :) 
Plan to watch it again soon since Netflix has it at my disposal.",5.0
"Hands down, one of my favorite films of all time.
The Graduate depicts perfectly what it's like to be lost and scared about growing up for good. Even if we know what kind of job we'd like or what career to study, we still hesitate and wonder if we're making the right decision. I adore this film, especially because I was able to relate to Benjamin on so many levels. What I enjoy and appreciate the most is that it doesn't have a completely happy ending. On the last two shot of Ben and Elaine sitting on the bus, we can see how their happiness fades into concern. Ben's face shows pure confusion and fear. He has the girl but he still doesn't know what he wants to do with himself. That's life. One moment you feel like you're on top of the world, but suddenly you realize you've actually fucked up. Kudos to Dustin Hoffman for nailing his performance as Ben. I'm obsessed with the constant lost and stupid look on his face. 
Apart from an amazing plot, The Graduate has some amazing shots. I'm in love with the shot of Ben's and Mrs. Robinson's reflection on the bar table. Beautiful. Also, the sudden flashes of Mrs. Robinson's breasts. That was a clever and creative way of showing Ben's nervousness and POV. Ugh, this film <3",5.0
"The themes of disaffected youth and social inadequacy and anxiety sort of make The Graduate the The Fight Club of its generation. While the second half feels slightly tangential, the first half remains the definitive text in comedy of manners which a recent graduate such as myself can strongly relate to (sadly sans hot cougar seduction). However, for me, the film‚Äôs key misstep is its failure to completely see out the comparable existential problems endemic in adulthood that are set up with Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs decidedly tragic character. Unfairly, her magnetic and immortal persona is notably neglected during second act and the inner release she seems to be in desperate need of never comes.",3.0

"Only at this seminal time in film history would the casting of a 30 year old Dustin Hoffman in the title role not raise an eyebrow. Still, Mike Nichols' valentine to the baby boomer generation is a classic in every sense of the word. Now if you'll excuse me I am going to watch the hundreds of other films that were made possible by this groundbreaking work.",4.5

"Not quite worthy of ""classic"" status, but there is a lot to love about The Graduate, like the fantastic Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack, the great performances from Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman and especially the editing and Mike Nichols' camerawork, which give the film an engaging kind of energy that makes the 100 minutes fly by.",4.0
"A classic that really stands the test of time. I watched this for the first time over three days time in school and loved every minute (while most other classmates hated every minute). Not only backed by a fantastic Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, The Graduate is a very funny, dramatic, simple-yet-deep movie that is quickly going to become one of my favorites.",5.0

"I've been wanting to watch this for years. I saw the Criterion at my local movie store a couple times but decided not to pick it up because of the price. 39 freakin dollars‚Ä¶..kinda wish I did though cuz I loved this movie.
I feel that this is the first movie pre-70‚Äôs that I actually love. This movie‚Äôs messages are so very relevant to the point that it makes this movie feel like it came out post 2010 and was made to look like something that came out in the 60s. Everyone has or had that feeling of not knowing what to do with your lives after graduating. And the pressure of everyone around you asking what you‚Äôre gonna do with your life just feels so suffocating. I loved how this movie handled all of that. This movie also talks about toxic relationships. I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone has been in one or knows someone that‚Äôs been in one. I wish I could say the stuff that happens in this movie is over exaggerated but it‚Äôs really not. Some people are just that crazy.
This movie is just so wonderfully directed. It‚Äôs jam packed with symbolism. I was able to catch a few things here and there. Very interested in watching this again to see what else I can catch.
As for negatives, this movie replayed the SHIT out of some of these songs to the point of annoyance. Listen, I like Simon and Garfunkel to a degree but shit man‚Ä¶relax. They played the beginning of Mrs Robinson like 4 times in the span of 5 minutes. Sound of Silence was played throughout the movie like 5 times and Scarborough Fair was played a TON. I lost track of how many times. Like, take a shot every time it‚Äôs played.
That‚Äôs my MAIN gripe with this movie and it‚Äôs a pretty decently sized one too. Every time one of those songs played I just let out a sigh. A good movie soundtrack is great. I love to throw one on for something to listen to while I‚Äôm doing something but man, I‚Äôll never do that with this one.
Aside from that, I loved this. Movies like this are why I have a strong passion for film. It‚Äôs such a beautiful art form that some people in my life don't understand and that‚Äôs so incredibly frustrating. There's so much to it and that‚Äôs why I love it.

Dustin Hoffman was great in the lead role as Benjamin Braddock - also insane to see him so young??? i forgot he wasn't always like 40+ LMAO. Anne Bancroft was a perfect Mrs. Robinson, and Katharine Ross is always a delight. also ummmmmmm the camerawork??? just about flawless really. my favorite thing about this movie was the camerawork, easily. all the movements of the camera just felt so cool to watch, and the transitions were just so smooth,,,,,,,,, god yeah it just looks so impressive. the standout that comes to mind first is the first time Benjamin sees Mrs. Robinson naked - like the way the body parts flash quickly on screen and the shot keeps focusing on different areas like its just a perfect way to showcase the actual act of his eyes darting around it was SO GOOD. but there are so many other specific instances where there was a certain technique or something that just made me go ""wow,,,,,,, that was really cool !!!"" u know. the soundtrack is pretty solid as well shoutout to Simon & Garfunkel. yes the amount of Scarborough Fair needle drops is tiring BUT April Come She Will??? perhaps one of the best little tunes ever. the symbolism with the water was well-executed as well, using that as a way to communicate the feeling of being stuck in an aimless period of transition was really smart. all in all i can see why it's so highly praised, it just didn't hit for me. by the time i got to the end and realized Wayne's World 2 spoofed the ending i was literally just like ""damn what if i rewatched that instead u know"" üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. it just did not resonate enough !!! oh well u know. it happens. perhaps i will give it another shot after i graduate college.",3.5

"The Best Picture line-up at the 40th Academy Awards represents the changing shift within Hollywood that led to the New Hollywood movement in the 1970s. Doctor Dolittle and Guess Who‚Äôs Coming to Dinner represent the old generation of Hollywood filmmaking, Bonnie & Clyde and The Graduate represent the new generation of Hollywood filmmaking, and the winner of the category (In the Heat of the Night) has elements of both eras. The Graduate is the coming-of-age story of a man expected to have it figured out. In a way, the film challenged the norms of young adulthood upon release in the 1960s. Traditionally, the path in life was school, college or university, career and settling down with a significant other. It is expected to understand how the rest of their lives will go during the application process for college or university. But Ben (Dustin Hoffman) still feels lost and confused about how the rest of his life will go. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) also feels lost and aimless in her marriage. Bancroft and Hoffman give excellent-mannered performances when they have to present a facade to the world. It has an element of melodrama. The Graduate is not only a funny film, but it is also a stunningly crafted piece from Mike Nichols. The brilliant use of Simon & Garfunkel music to capture a feeling of aimlessness, beautifully shot, the remarkable editing and the final shot that reflects the uncertainty of life. Who knows what will happen to Ben and Elaine (Katherine Ross) once they get off the bus and start their lives together? And it is meaningful because of the ambiguity. But I do know that The Graduate is a remarkable film.",5.0

"I don't remember why this was on my watchlist, but I am glad it was. A funny timeless movie straight out of the 60s.
Dustin Hoffmans deadpan delivery has just the right amount of humor to make you laugh without being silly. His demeanor perfectly captures being young and nervous about the future. All he wants is to control his own life and make his own decisions, but is frequently being forced into situations where older adults manipulate him. At first I felt great sympathy for Benjamin and resented Mrs. Robinson, then their relationship developed and my sympathy shifted a bit more to her. A woman desperately trying to being young again because she feels her life have come to a standstill when she married and got pregnant very young. Then Benjamin starts being more of a jerk and I really felt sorry for Elaine.
What really set this movie as a top-rated one for me was how it ends up not being a ""happily ever after""-romance. On the surface it looks like one, but Benjamin and Elaine are not really in love. They just both want to free themselves from their parents and make their own decisions, and the final shot in the bus when that reality hits them hard is among the best end scenes ever.
It is remarkable how it is really a movie from the 60s, but also very timeless. It is not a movie that simply have ""aged well"" or was ""ahead of its time"". My only minor complaint is that I didn't believe in the age difference of the actors. They should be around 20 years apart but the actors are only a handful of years in age difference, which isn't very convincing. I can write it off as a relic of movie productions of the time that couldn't cast woman over 40.",5.0
"*Vague Spoilers*

Oh man, so I guess we‚Äôre just eternally doomed to perpetuate this cycle of generational divide, aren‚Äôt we? Where the old smother the youth with expectations and projections and the youth will forever be aimless and adrift. At the beginning we see Benjamin being moved along the straight and narrow path of the airport walkway, imbued with as much independence as his luggage. By the end he believes himself to have a purpose in fighting for Elaine, but the filmmaking still reflects that sense of being lost that we see in the beginning. It‚Äôs a cruel trick of misplaced bravado that Ben and Elaine don‚Äôt realize until it‚Äôs too late. The older generation isn‚Äôt in a much better spot either, they‚Äôre the ones that are destined to put their children and themselves in a box and inevitably push away their children when they decide to make life choices out of spite toward them. Mrs. Robinson in particular is such a tragic figure, with Anne Bancroft bringing a lot of sadness in her many closeups. 
I get why many people think the second half is a lot weaker than the first. In some ways I do agree, watching Benjamin fumble his way through an affair is comedy gold and it‚Äôs a lot easier to enjoy than the moodier, less focused second half. Thematically however, I think the latter half of the film is perfection. I think it‚Äôs of great importance that we see Benjamin change from awkward and fresh faced graduate to an impulsive rebel fighting for nothing of terrible importance. I love that by the end his car (presumably a graduation present) is beaten up and out of gas, he‚Äôs ditched the suit and tie for a hoodie that‚Äôs covered in sweat when he gets to the church, and he‚Äôs fulfilled the parental ideal of settling down with the girl next door albeit in a rather twisted manner.
Comedically I also think the second half of the film still has plenty to offer. The very mercenary way Elaine and Benjamin discuss the possibility of marriage we see through montage, Benjamin‚Äôs final conversation with Mr. Robinson, and my personal favorite which is Benjamin fending off all the churchgoers at the wedding with a cross (which to me feels like a clever and funny way of visualizing youthful rebellion), all of these scenes are just as funny as watching Benjamin nervously buy a hotel room.
Anyway, I‚Äôm sure this is a film that will always be pertinent to me as I continue through my 20‚Äôs, and then I‚Äôm sure when I hit my 40‚Äôs Mrs. Robinson will be my new Black Panther frfr.",5.0

I saw it again later in high school and appreciated it so much more, and now seeing it after graduating college on Friday, I can recognize it as the masterpiece that it is. Such a product of its time yet completely timeless. I still think that Scarborough Fair is played way too many fucking times though.",4.5
It's astonishing how this film blends comedy and drama so smoothly. This is a very unique coming of film that fires on all cylinders. A premise like this could easily turn into a disaster but thankfully the confident filmmaking and remarkable craftsmanship makes this a classic (no idea why it took me this long to see it). Definitely one of the best Dustin Hoffman performances I've seen. Choosing between Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross is quite the dilemma!

"The Graduate es una declaraci√≥n de inconformidad ante el estilo de vida de la clase media estadounidense de los 60. Una pel√≠cula que representa una generaci√≥n que se rebela ante sus padres y cr√≠tica la presi√≥n por el encajar socialmente dentro del arquetipo. Una pel√≠cula realmente contraria a los valores tradicionales de la √©poca de su estreno (si se estudia minuciosamente el contexto) y que brilla con una puesta en escena magn√≠fica, de ensue√±o y que se siente tan veraniega. Jugando entre los escenarios con el estado mental de nuestro protagonista, Benjamin; un joven con la presi√≥n de ser alguien en la vida, un joven para el que sus padres tienen expectativas altas, pero ni √©l mismo sabe ad√≥nde ir.
Una pel√≠cula que trata de vivir incondicionalmente ante las exigencias de nuestro entorno, es la representaci√≥n viva del alma rebelde por un estilo de vida alejado a las demandas de lo que socialmente se espera de cada uno. Dustin Hoffman es impresionante y la escena final la guardar√© profundamente en mi coraz√≥n como una de las que m√°s me ha impactado. <333",5.0

"Timeless. While it‚Äôs direction gets a bit crazy, I adored the composition of this film, how it frames ben submerged in the water, or Mrs Robinson when Ben reveals their affair to Elaine, or how we become Ben, watching behind objects, peering through the gaps as he yearns for Elaine back. And obviously that ending, tears of joy just streamed down my face, make sure you like Simon and Garfunkel though, glad I do!",4.5
"If I feel myself as the producer of my life, then I am unhappy. So I would rather be a spectator of my life. I would rather change my life this way since I cannot change it in society. So at night I see films that are different from my experiences during the day. Thus there is a strict separation between experience and the cinema. That is the obstacle for our films. For we are people of the 60s, and we do not believe in the opposition between experience and fiction.
‚ÄìAlexander Kluge, 1988
THE GRADUATE opened in December 1967, the same month the first successful human heart transplant was performed. It was a few weeks after the premiere of BONNIE AND CLYDE and about three months before the launching of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Among the albums that came out the same year were the Beatles‚Äô Sgt. Pepper‚Äôs Lonely Hearts Club Band, the Rolling Stones‚Äô Their Satanic Majesties Request, and the Mothers of Invention‚Äôs Absolutely Free. Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme had both come out in ‚Äò66, and THE GRADUATE appropriated tracks from both of them on its sound track. (The ‚ÄúMrs Robinson‚Äù lyrics were added for the sound track album.)
For many fans, including myself, of Mike Nichols and Elaine May who had seen them perform live or heard their ferociously funny records, Nichols‚Äôs early career as a director seemed tame, considering both his comic gifts and the political cast of the 60s. THE GRADUARE, his second feature (his first was WHO‚ÄôS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? in ‚Äò66) was entertaining, but hardly the rallying cry of a rebellious youth explosion that some claimed it to be once it took off at the box office (it was the second highest grossing movie of the 60s, after THE SOUND OF MUSIC). Even now, when new prints of the movie struck from the original internegative are being released, the only ‚Äúrevolutionary aspect‚Äù of THE GRADUARE described in the press book is the use and impact of the Simon and Garfunkel songs -‚Äì not the songs themselves but the new marketing possibilities derived from transplanting ‚Äúfound‚Äù material into a Hollywood hit, which clearly set a lot of wheels spinning.
‚ÄúShe was always brave,‚Äù Nichols said of May during their partnership as a comedy team. ‚ÄúBut I became more and more afraid.‚Äù This certainly appears to be the case if one compares their subsequent careers as directors. (For a candid look at the complex dynamics of their relationship during the height of their fame as a team, see Edmund Wilson‚Äôs posthumously published journals, The Sixties.) On the other hand, according to Janet Coleman in her book The Compass -‚Äì a fascinating study of the mid-50s Chicago improvisational comedy workshop from which Nichols and May sprang -‚Äì they both, along with comedian Shelley Berman, lost some of their edge when they became famous:
‚ÄúOn becoming stars, each member of the trio once referred to as ‚ÄòTwo Cocksuckers and Elaine‚Äô had unwittingly pulled some plugs from the main currents of ordinary life that had charged their improvisations with humanity. They had been almost instantly isolated from the ensemble work of their peers, the extraordinary improvisational foot soldiers. Thus, their passage into celebrity did not return to the political comedy of the improvisational theater any insights into the issues of status and money, or hard looks into the workings of power in the arts and society, or revelations about the entertainment industry. Without the focus and urgency of the improvisational theater, they were atomized from their most integrated and revealing work. Substituting for commonality and spontaneity the narcissism and obsessions of show business, they grew silent in the society they once had satirized.‚Äù
As a passionate fan of the four features May directed ‚Äì- A NEW LEAF, THE HEARTBREAK KID, MIKEY AND NICKY, and ISHTAR ‚Äì‚Äì who finds plenty of ‚Äúinsights into the issues of status and money,‚Äù ‚Äúhard looks into the workings of power in the arts and society,‚Äù and even a few ‚Äúrevelations about the entertainment industry‚Äù in these dark, vibrant movies, I feel that Coleman‚Äôs basically sound observation applies differently to the careers of May and Nichols. In many ways, May, unlike Nichols, is too large and unwieldy a talent to accommodate herself to the entertainment industry in a manner that can easily translate into fame and success, and given the complex and tortuous skirmishes she had with studios on all four of her features, it is hardly surprising that she has worked in Hollywood chiefly as an anonymous script doctor. More recently, she has teamed up with Nichols again as a writer on THE BIRDCAGE and, as reported in a lengthy article in the March 3 New York Observer, on an adaptation of PRIMARY COLORS budgeted at $65 million and starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson as the Clintons -‚Äì a project that seems highly political. It will be interesting to discover to what degree May‚Äôs dangerous satirical gifts and Nichols‚Äôs commercial savvy can work in tandem.
THE GRADUATE, Nichols‚Äôs main ticket to mainstream success, replays various aspects of the Nichols-May partnership in telling ways ‚Äì- as does THE HEARTBREAK KID (1972), May‚Äôs own second feature, which can be read in many ways as a response to THE GRADUATE. Both movies chart the hero‚Äôs ditching of a dark, overpowering woman for an inaccessible WASP princess (each monomaniacally pursuing her to the university she‚Äôs attending, where he hangs out on the campus), echoing Nichols‚Äôs abandonment of the dangerous side of his routines with May. Furthermore, Charles Grodin, who plays the lead in THE HEARTBREAK KID, was originally cast by Nichols to play the lead in THE GRADUATE, and Jeannie Berlin, who plays the ditched woman in THE HEARTBREAK KID, is May‚Äôs daughter.
The two movies take notably different approaches toward ethnicity: Nichols pretends it isn‚Äôt there and May flaunts it. Though Nichols and May are both Jewish, May grew up in the Yiddish theater, and the anomaly of a Jewish New York actor playing Waspy Los Angeleno Benjamin Braddock in THE GRADUATE has to be weighed against the explicitly Jewish New York wedding at the beginning of THE HEARTBREAK KID ‚Äì- and the explicitly WASP Minneapolis wedding that closes it. In other words, May accentuates ethnic difference whereas Nichols muddles it. THE GRADUATE ends with a Christian wedding of its own, but in this case, significantly, the hero isn‚Äôt the groom; and the fact that Benjamin winds up using a cross both as a battering ram and as a tool for escape can be read allegorically as Nichols‚Äôs own determined flight from his roots in courting mainstream success. Even the uses of pop songs as anthems of their hero‚Äôs aspirations have ethnic implications: in contrast to the euphoric Jewish assimilation (and mainstreaming of folk music) of Simon and Garfunkel in THE GRADUATE, THE HEARTBREAK KID offers multiple versions of a pop single associated with the Carpenters, ‚ÄúClose to You,‚Äù and each successive version registers as more bitterly ironic.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust anyone over 30‚Ä≥ is the only 60s counterculture motto honored in THE GRADUATE, though the picture has only two under-30 characters of any importance, neither of them especially well defined apart from their southern California affluence, and the innate corruption of all the over-30 characters is more felt than analyzed. Dustin Hoffman wears a jacket and tie throughout the picture (his first movie role), and his rebellion relates exclusively to personal rather than social or political issues -‚Äì his determination to marry the daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), of his father‚Äôs law partner after having an adulterous affair with her mother, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft, whose style and authority make her a clear stand-in for May). Indeed, one of the film‚Äôs running gags is the erroneous impression of a suspicious rooming-house landlord in Berkeley that the straitlaced Benjamin is some sort of campus radical.
In fact, Benjamin has no convictions, no politics, no ambitions, no ideas, no friends, no professional interests, and, apart from sex and romance, no nonprofessional interests of any kind. He doesn‚Äôt take pot or acid, his exemption from fighting in Vietnam is assumed rather than spelled out, and apart from the conspicuous affluence of his background, his remoteness from the world around him, Berkeley included, is defined iconographically rather than ideologically: it‚Äôs a movie-star pose. Yet somehow he‚Äôs perceived as a social rebel, and Nichols‚Äôs transplant of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of counterculture, not to mention the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of his satiric routines with May, into the Hollywood mainstream clearly struck some kind of elemental paydirt. To borrow the title of a subsequent Simon and Garfunkel album, his movie provided a bridge over troubled water that millions were happy to take.
To understand this alchemy, it‚Äôs helpful to consider what the other top moneymaking pictures of the 60s were that had some relationship with ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù youth culture: SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS (1961, set mainly in the late 1920s), BYE BYE BIRDIE (1963, an adaptation of a stage musical about the impact of a rock-and-roll singer on a small town), A HARD DAY‚ÄôS NIGHT (1964, a film about and starring the Beatles), THE WILD ANGELS (1966, an exploitation feature about a motorcycle gang), BLOWUP (1966, Michelangelo Antonioni‚Äôs art film about ‚Äúswinging London‚Äù), 2001, and EASY RIDER (1969). None of these pictures with the possible exception of the last can be described as an expression or even an accurate representation of 60s counterculture apart from a few passing elements. When Antonioni dealt directly with American counterculture in ZABRISKIE POINT (1970), the film was a resounding flop with audiences and critics alike, and the same could be said of Otto Preminger‚Äôs grotesque if fascinating SKIDOO the previous year; perhaps only WOODSTOCK (1970) succeeded both in dealing directly with the counterculture and in reaching a wide mainstream audience.
No doubt the sense of ‚Äúnewness‚Äù projected by THE GRADUATE came less from the film‚Äôs subject matter than from the offscreen Simon and Garfunkel songs, from the comic dialogue (the obvious legacy of Nichols‚Äôs satiric routines with May, adroitly adapted by screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham from Charles Webb‚Äôs source novel), and, above all, from the eclectic, free-wheeling, and attention-grabbing visual style. Much of that style had clear antecedents in some of the better-known art films of the early 60s ‚Äì- work by such filmmakers as Truffaut, Godard, Antonioni, Fellini, and even Cassavetes.
The film‚Äôs first extended sequence is a party given for Benjamin by his well-to-do parents (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson), attended exclusively by the parents‚Äô friends, filmed almost entirely in claustrophobic closeups and hand-held camera movements. The style has a great deal in common with the style of party sequences in Cassavetes‚Äôs SHADOWS (1959) as well as in his subsequent Hollywood feature TOO LATE BLUES (1962), although Andrew Sarris, in his contemporary review of THE GRADUATE, noted that these ‚Äúbobbing, tracking, lurching heads in nightmarishly mobile closeups looks like an ‚Äòhommage‚Äô to Fellini‚Äôs 8¬Ω,‚Äù which indeed may be a likelier source. Either way, it looks nothing like standard Hollywood filmmaking of the early 60s. (Pointedly, in his same review of THE GRADUATE, Sarris noted that ‚ÄúA rain-drenched Anne Bancroft splattered against a starkly white wall evokes images in [Antonioni‚Äôs] LA NOTTE.‚Äù)
An even more striking example of this mainstreaming of New Wave techniques comes at the end of the protracted comic seduction of Benjamin by Mrs. Robinson (the only name he or the dialogue ever assigns her), who orders him to drive her home from the party and issues a series of commands to him when they are alone in her house -‚Äì to have a drink, to accompany her upstairs, and so on -‚Äì as she proceeds to remove her clothing. This climaxes when Benjamin, alone in Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs room, sees reflected in a framed portrait of Elaine the nude figure of Mrs. Robinson entering the room and closing the door behind her. When Benjamin spins around to face her, this single gesture is broken up into four separate dovetailing shots, each filmed from a different angle, all but the last of which is so brief that the effect is mainly subliminal. (The successive lengths of the four shots -‚Äì at least in my un-‚Äùrestored‚Äù video copy -‚Äì are 15 frames, 13 frames, one single frame, and then, as Benjamin says ‚ÄúOh, God!,‚Äù 70 frames.) Insofar as the early features of Godard and Truffaut can be said to have visual tropes, this is clearly one of them, though the use of it here is more pointedly tied to the viewer‚Äôs identification with the subjectivity of a single character than it would have been in the French originals.
This is followed by other shots of Benjamin‚Äôs frantic responses to Mrs. Robinson, punctuated by other near-subliminal shots of her nude body -‚Äì ten frames of her midriff, four frames of one of her breasts, and five frames of her navel -‚Äì which effectively suggest the sources of his panic without spelling them out. In this case, it is more difficult to point to precise New Wave counterparts and more likely that the pressures of studio censorship led to some of the subliminal abridgements of shots. (THE GRADUATE came out after the far-ranging revision of the Production Code in 1966 and prior to the launching of the rating system in 1968 -‚Äì a transitional period in more ways than one.) But the titillating effect of these brief inserts and their stylistic eclecticism point to the inroads made by New Wave films on Hollywood thinking and practices.
And the same could be said for many of the movie‚Äôs other stylistic flourishes, ranging from sound overlaps (such as the beginning of a scene‚Äôs dialogue over the end of the previous sequence) to fancy camera setups (e.g., Mrs. Robinson appearing at a hotel bar rendezvous with Benjamin as a reflection on a glass table) to extended uses of first-person camera (such as the sequence featuring Benjamin inside a deep-sea diving suit, nearly all of it seen and heard from his vantage point).
The differences between the uses of such techniques in New Wave pictures and their uses in Hollywood usually have to do with the mechanics of storytelling and the identification of the viewer. The stylistic play of BREATHLESS and SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER generally had the effect of making the viewer identify with the filmmakers, while the stylistic play of THE GRADUATE made the viewer identify with Benjamin -‚Äì even if a greater awareness of the director‚Äôs role ensued from the process.
Seeing THE GRADUATE again recently, I enjoyed pretty much the same things that I enjoyed 30 years ago: Bancroft‚Äôs robust, superlative performance (until the script turns her into a one-dimensional monster she‚Äôs the only real character in the movie); the smoothness and assurance of the sketch humor, most of it having to do with Los Angeles affluence and sexual embarrassment; the graceful, dreamlike transition between Benjamin emerging from his swimming pool at home and entering a hotel room with Mrs. Robinson for another bout of lovemaking; the foregrounding of the ebullient and wistful Simon and Garfunkel music (recently appropriated and parodied in Albert Brooks‚Äôs MOTHER, and so integral throughout THE GRADUATE that when Benjamin‚Äôs car runs out of gas at a climactic juncture, the guitar vamps slow down).
What I don‚Äôt enjoy is the cruelty, the glib mindlessness, and the insulated, pampered narcissism that makes the whole thing possible. (If Benjamin had run off with Mrs. Robinson, the movie would have been genuinely rebellious.) By studiously avoiding everything about the 60s that is worth remembering today, apart from some of its energy, Nichols can flatter the audience for its knowingness only by assuming the audience knows nothing at all. ‚ÄúThe small triumph of THE GRADUATE,‚Äù Pauline Kael wrote in 1969, ‚Äúwas to have domesticated alienation and the difficulty of communication, by making what Benjamin is alienated from a middle-class comic strip and making it absurdly evident that he has nothing to communicate ‚Äì- which is just what makes him an acceptable hero for the large movie audience. If he said anything or had any ideas, the audience would probably hate him‚Ä¶.Mike Nichols‚Äôs ‚Äògift‚Äô is that he lets the audience direct him; this is demagoguery in the arts.‚Äù As a bridge over troubled water and a clever piece of merchandise, THE GRADUATE is at best only following the same escapist principles followed today by INDEPENDENCE DAY ‚Äì- or THE ENGLISH PATIENT, for that matter.

This ended up being a rewatch for me because I had seen this in film class years ago but somehow managed to forget about this. I‚Äôm going to start off by saying that the shots ??!??!? Are fucking insanely gorgeous. Every shot pulled as a still image can stand on its own because the composition of frame is just simply beautiful. I also enjoyed this definitely a lot more than my first viewing of it (I came to this by realizing how little i could recall from my first viewing and y‚Äôall know my memory is spot on therefor i clearly just didn‚Äôt pay attention the first time). I enjoyed the characters a lot and found the music choice to be very entertaining. 
I also think that the very last scene of the movie is the best scene ever. Ben realizes what he‚Äôs actually done and again seems to be very unsatisfied with his choices. This is so relatable only because he was so dead set on having Elaine but once they both were together you can see how they really feel. Truly a great way to end the craziness of this film.

"What a great ending. After a big panicked rush, the film slows down and forces you to sit with the consequences of what just happened. This sums up the film: Benjamin just did 4 years of grad school and then is told to chill out and think about his future. His worries and uncertainty are incredibly relatable.
What is less relatable are the two central relationships. I never quite understood why Mrs Robinson or Elaine would be into him tbh.‚Ä¶",4.0

"I‚Äôve seen this movie many times and as I get older I can‚Äôt help but appreciate it more and more.

Whether it‚Äôs your parents‚Äô friend telling you that the future is ‚Äúplastics‚Äù or Mrs. Robinson manipulating you into having an affair, it‚Äôs always hard to know if you made the right the decision. Even when the decision you took (or were manipulated to take) is clearly the wrong one. The Graduate is a movie that made sense for the time it was released in.

Filme #80 assistido em 2022.
The Graduate, na minha experi√™ncia, foi um grande exemplo do fen√¥meno que a leitura sobre o filme pode impactar na sua experi√™ncia, mesmo posterior.
Quando comecei a estudar saobre hist√≥ria do Cinema e a ir montando a lista, em 2019, The Graduate estava l√°, e lembro de ter escrito o porqu√™, mas n√£o lembro qual era o motivo verdadeiro. Fiquei todo esse tempo sem ver o filme e me mantendo no escuro sobre quase tudo a seu respeito. Assim que terminei, achei um filme divertido e com um tema interessante, mas n√£o tinha achado t√£o incr√≠vel.
Apenas depois de assistir e ter minha primeira impress√£o baseada exclusivamente na emo√ß√£o (e defendo que ainda que essa seja uma das principais, √© sempre bom ir mais profundo), voltei para ler o par√°grafo sobre o filme na descri√ß√£o da lista e a ler os textos das pessoas que sigo aqui, e o que o filme significava para mim mudou completamente depois de relembrar suas inten√ß√µes.
Ao perceber a influ√™ncia da Nouvelle Vague, a d√©cada e o meio onde este filme foi lan√ßado, fica muito claro que, ap√≥s d√©cadas de glamuriza√ß√£o do ""American way of life"", come√ß√°vamos a ver uma cr√≠tica a burguesia. A real face da juventudo incerta (o take final!), seus dramas, a hiprocrisia dos pais conservadores, tudo muito claro aqui. N√£o apenas um filme divertido, mas um filme diferente do que se fazia no mainstream estadunidense da √©poca, marcando a Nova Hollywood. O uso de The Sound of Silence, e todas as mensagens passadas na imagem elevam o filme como uma obra que realmente usa o som e a imagem para dar poder √† sua hist√≥ria.

"Well, esta peli ten√≠a ganas de volver a verla pasado unos a√±os para ver si hab√≠a cambiado mi opini√≥n sobre ella y debo decir que han pasado cositas.
La primera vez que la vi fue a la tierna edad de dieciocho a√±os y me gust√≥ m√°s en su momento, no s√© por qu√© pero conect√© m√°s con la peli. Supongo que porque me gustaba m√°s la musiquita de simon and garfunkel, o porque me parec√≠a muy interesante el joven dustin huffman. Ahora bien, debo decir que me sigue pareciendo muy buena pel√≠cula y respecto a que sea un cl√°sico del cine no tengo nada que objetar: lo que es, es. 
La verdad es que la he disfrutado a pesar de que cada vez que sonaba the sound of silence sent√≠a la imperiosa necesidad de tirarme por la ventana pero todo ok. Sigo viva dando la chapa con esta peli que en su d√≠a me la compr√© en dvd porque una chavala a veces necesita basar su personalidad en una peli con un soundtrack deprimente y un prota que cuando lo ves te dan ganas de pegarle un guantazo de lo pelele que es, pero qui√©n soy yo para juzgar a un pobre chaval que se acaba de graduar en la uni y no tiene ni la m√°s remota idea de qu√© hacer con su vida y lo √∫nico que hace es dejarse llevar por los inciertos senderos de la vida.
En fin, esa escena final todav√≠a sigue resonando en m√≠ cada vez que la veo y esta vez lo ha hecho con much√≠sima m√°s fuerza que la primera vez. Me sigue fascinando la transici√≥n entre ese impulso final tan euf√≥rico de los protas a ese miedo paralizante generado por la incertidumbre de un futuro al que irremediablemente est√°n abocados subi√©ndose a ese autob√∫s.",5.0

"Seen this film a lot and I'm surprised how much I still find refreshing in it. On today's viewing I noticed a particular shot where Elaine is interrogating Benjamin over his affair, while Mrs Robinson's graven face is in the background, isolated through a doorframe. As Elaine realises the carnal connection between Benjamin and her mother, her face slowly comes into focus. So much in this film makes clear the links between film technique and aesthetics and culture and theme. This moment is followed up by the pan out from a close up of Mrs Robinson, internally boiling with rage and neglect, to isolate her in the corner of a long white hallway. Anne Bancroft breaks my heart every time.",4.5
not horny enough,3.0
"Watched it six years ago for the first time when I had very little knowledge about how films got made; I fairly enjoyed it as a rom-com‚Ä¶some cute moments and two characters happily running away into the sunset in the end. But, when I re-watched it today, the film showed me why Hollywood films are timeless.
In the 60s, a graduate has difficulty deciding what's the next stage of his life/career going to be. He meets a middle aged woman who had to get married after getting pregnant in college. Topics like these always feel relevant and relatable (in my case, the question of what to do next in life), making the films evergreen even if they have protagonist and the supporting characters belonging to an upper class society. And that final shot! 
It's a beautifully directed film. Benjamin‚Äôs loneliness and Mrs. Robinson‚Äôs personality get captured through the cinematography which I loved so much. I loved the editing too which ensured the pacing was pitch perfect. The use of music and montages were also wonderfully done. 'The Graduate' sometimes feels like it's thin on paper but there's so much meaning behind say, a character's silence, when their despondency is shown on screen. A lesser director may have messed this up, but everything under Mike Nichols's direction felt almost perfect. I wish Benjamin's decision about what he should do next in his career got explored though, along with covering few more chapters from Mrs. Benjamin's life. Still a great film overall.",4.5

I really had no idea what to expect going in given I knew very little about Mike Nichols and his filmography, but this absolutely knocked it out of the park for me.

Some of the scene transitions (particularly of Ben going from his home to the hotel with Mrs. Robinson) absolutely blew me away. Hoffman, Bancroft, and Ross were just perfect here, leaving me laughing, cringing, and contemplating seemingly all at once. The plot unraveled pretty much perfectly, and the ending of uneasiness left me thinking not only about the technical aspects of the movie, but the burdens and emotional consequences of love.

"One of the best things about this film is all that annoyance that apparently caused to fifty-something Mr.s of the time by social criticism disguised as humor, so ahead of its time. It is a film that we can understand thanks to its protagonist and for being able to see situations through his eyes where even we ourselves could've seen or lived them as well, and it is that completion of some academic process not as satisfactory as perhaps it should be, those times of not wanting to do anything or find real satisfaction in something, the fear and worries about the future for wanting something or maybe for not knowing what to want, internal and external instabilities that are sometimes trying to dealt with, pressures for what comes next in life because of course, you close a cycle, what's next? even though the present is being an internal struggle between conflicts and emotions, you move around and exist at the expense of the rest and what could be.
Between some overly admirable camera shots, a visual quality better than my eyesight, and depressing Simon and Garfunkel songs that are repeated on loop, it is also expressed what Ben is feeling and how his world full of superficiality, pressures and blackmails like ropes around his neck and nothingness seem to completely fill his life with meaninglessness, until the unexpected arrives. Even though Elaine arrives as part of those conflicts, it means for him something contrary to what he has been having during all this time being this positive and comfortable almost like a dissociation that provokes him that something in his life to the point of leading him to see something that he wants for the first time and in a euphoric way going towards it in the most hilarious way possible, and who knows if it will turn out well because as we have learned and know, things that would seem perfect and done completly, rarely are, and they are there starring in one of the best endings of a film where they're returning to the beginning surrounded by too much overwhelming uncertainty.
This movie was for me something else because i went from thinking it would be some romcom to something that express a lot about youth and adulthood, the good and the bad, more bad than good even going beyond the years and generations and providing a whole rethinking of things (or existential crisis yey) that after all should be talked about in the 60s, now in the 2020s and in the future as well.",5.0
"I get some heavy joker, taxi driver vibes from this. Just the worst bloke doing more worse things but thinking he's in the right about it, but what I really like here is that the film really tries to show how awful this person is. There's no idolisation of Rob, he's just a bad bloke and everyone knows that.
That ending too really hits well. What a gold film",4.0
"""Love is an uncontrollable feeling.""
I haven't really seen this film for so many years and it makes me strange, and to see it again now, the story between Ben and Mrs Robinson is something familiar with what is happening in my life now, but with a much more positive twist.
The film is Ben's moral change, from the transition from adolescence to adulthood, taking place through love, with him not very ready for the changes in life.

"It was a well done movie. It‚Äôs just not my kind of movie. 
Great acting, soundtrack, cinematography. The thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the pacing and the story. Otherwise it‚Äôs very good just not my type of movie. 
Also bought it on criterion.",4.5
"This is pretty fucking great, stunning visuals for something 54 years old and great direction. It‚Äôs a very disturbing story honestly seeing a lost vulnerable student be groomed and seeing how much it makes him hate himself. Cautionary tale for sure. As for complaints, I thought it was a pretty weak third act until the fantastic ending, so it kinda redeemed itself. I also personally dislike the way people used to talk in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs, it‚Äôs grating and‚Ä¶",4.0

"Esse filme √© simplesmente perfeito em todos os sentidos. Desde a atua√ß√£o fant√°stica do, at√© ent√£o desconhecido, Dustin Hoffman at√© a trilha do Simon & Garfunkel, que foi feita exclusivamente pra este filme. 
E a dire√ß√£o do Mike Nichols tem um toque especial. Um filme que fica na mem√≥ria tanto pela sua beleza, quanto pelo o entretenimento de primeira.",5.0

"una pel√≠cula que representa lo ef√≠mero, las emociones que no conviven con nosotros, que valen la pena un rato pero despu√©s volvemos a la misma decadencia de siempre, inertes a nuestro futuro y esperando encontrar una respuesta.
es una pelicula meramente cinematogr√°fica, todo plano tiene un significado y simbolismo dentro de la trama para que logremos interpretar las escenas con su respectivo trasfondo.
lo √∫nico malo que le encuentro es que me pudri√≥ a m√°s no poder es la canci√≥n the sound of silence, y que la trama le cuesta un poquito avanzar. sacando eso, me parece una pelicula fundamental.
btw xq tiene TANTOS gritos random que le sacan el equilibrio al sonido, me dejaban üßê",4.0
"This is a film filled with astounding performances, with editing and cinematography ahead of its time, and with a soundtrack that's hard not to love... But still I rated this higher than I think it deserves, because man, do I not like this screenplay. Quite the shame, because with some better character motivations this could have been perfect.",3.5

"Mike Nichols tem uma qualidade muito rara, ele consegue transmitir um sentimento de verdade, um sentimento de que um amigo passou por essa experi√™ncia e consegue transferir para a tela com muita naturalidade e veracidade.
As interpreta√ß√µes do elenco, suas rea√ß√µes s√£o uma obra de arte que beira a perfei√ß√£o.

"I cannot help but love it!
The story that it has is actually really simple, but the way it's being told in a very aesthetic way made it very pleasing. Each character is performed astonishingly. The score and soundtrack‚ÄîYES, Simon & Garfunkel‚Äîcomplemented the atmosphere. Let alone the cinematography! It was so minimal yet still colorful and nice to look at. The final shot on the bus wrapped up the film (ONE OF THE BEST ENDINGS, EVER), successfully leaving me a huge impact‚Äîa reason to falling in love deeper to it.",4.5
"Reflecting on where we are in our life‚Äôs and what to do next isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary and the Graduate captures this. A solid first half between Ben and Mrs Robinson is highly entertaining with jokes and awkward dialogue. Cinematography and transitions stand out, grasping into Ben‚Äôs state of mind, unsure how to progress through the world around him. Constantly pushed into someone else‚Äôs narrative and not his own. I can‚Äôt talk about the Graduate without speaking of the soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, musicians I haven‚Äôt listened too much apart from a song here and there yet their music reflects each part of this film so well I‚Äôm gonna dig into their discography now.",5.0
