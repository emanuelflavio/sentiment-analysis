"The message of Mitchell Leisen’s “Remember the Night” is simple: love conquers all adversity through its depth of kindness. 
The structure of the film, though, is remarkably intricate for a movie that seems to at first sell itself as a home for the holidays romance. 
Perhaps - because it carries all the personal complications of the talented cast and crew involved in it. 
“Night” was the last screenplay penned by Preston Sturges before he took up the director’s chair for himself — driven to do so after being irate at the liberal cuts that Leisen had made to his script. Sturges likely took the hacking personally, having based the plot somewhat off a brief but intense elopement he had with an heiress whom he met and fell in love with on the road to Palm Springs.  
As for the film’s stars, Barbara Stanwyck as a hot-handed thief quite literally steals the movie from Fred MacMurray, whom Leisen reworked into a morally upright supporting lead to Stanwyck’s emotional center. 
It was a crime that no jury could convict. 
Stanwyck, true to form, turns in a performance of magnitude and pathos - despite working in the sometimes frothy realm of romance. 
Just as Sturges had written one of his own life interludes into the script, Stanwyck brought her own background to the front of the lens. Portraying a woman so shattered by a loveless upbringing that she ran away from her family for a self-destructive pattern of theft, Stanwyck… could no doubt relate. 
While the straight arrow Stanwyck never turned kleptomaniac, she was raised in Brooklyn as an orphan, after her mother died following a streetcar accident and her father left to Panama never to return. 
“Night’s” greatest scene, then, and possibly one of the greatest in Stanwyck’s entire filmography, depicts a Midwest Christmas morning. Surrounded by family, surrounded by love — Stanwyck allows the comfort of the welcoming and kind surroundings to engulf her. 
Only to realize … this, also, is not the type of home for her. And it never will be.",4.0
the ending is rushed and kinda strange but i can forgive it because i’m just always so amazed by barbara stanwyck doing literally anything...combing her hair and pensively biting the comb? show stopping. maneuvering around a cow so fred macmurray can milk it? incredible. staring off into the distance and then bursting into tears? amazing. i love her and her broad shoulders and crazy hats.,3.5
"*MINOR SPOILERS*
I watched this on the big screen for the first time last night. It’s still the greatest movie I’ve seen: a witty, knockabout Preston Sturges comedy (his last script before becoming a director) that slips gently into an extraordinarily powerful articulation of romantic love: romantic love as both the saviour of and ultimate threat to family, career and existence itself.
Fred MacMurray is an assistant D.A. brought in to win a case against shoplifter Barbara Stanwyck. After forcing her case to be postponed till after the festive season (leaving her in the clink over Christmas), he has an attack of conscience and gets her bailed out, and soon they’re travelling to their home state of Indiana together, as their frosty relationship begins to thaw.
Combining Sturges’ comic smarts and sly sentimentalism with the lushness of director Mitchell Leisen’s visual vision, it’s a heady concoction in which the imagery – a Gothic, lamplit house; shooting through streamers at a New Year barn-dance; silhouettes against Niagara Falls – perfectly complements the action, in which each of the supporting players (Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson, Sterling Holloway) has one truly great scene with which to comprehensively nail their character, and in which Stanwyck exhibits the most refined strain of that incandescent, beguiling sensitivity that for a short time made her the most important actor on the American screen.
Incredibly, MacMurray matches her every step of the way, the pair generating an intense chemistry of which most screen couples can barely dream – no wonder they were re-teamed for Double Indemnity, many film fans’ contender for the title of Best Noir Ever Made (I’m more of an Out of the Past man, myself).
Every time I watch it, I find something new to make me laugh or cry. Here it was MacMurray’s petulant cry of “Those jurors are gabbing again” (laugh), as he takes an unusual approach to the climactic court case. And then there are all the elements that reward time and again: former lawyer Willard Robertson as a ridiculously OTT defense attorney; Stanwyck and MacMurray’s meeting in the apartment, her very genuine sardonism put to great use; the running gag about her defence of ‘hypnosis’; her heartstopping “You bet”, when he tells her he’s a lucky man to have the family he does, huh; the musical interlude in the parlour; Patterson’s line about her engagement; the moment when it dawns on you that Sturges is preaching on the malleability of human behaviour, one of my pet themes; and the night-time chat between Bondi and Stanwyck – a raw, captivating, unusually mature and effortlessly judged piece of cinema. And then there is the denouement, a Niagara Falls/courtroom one-two that sees Sturges take every duplicitous restriction of the Hays Code and work it in his favour, as only he could.
There’s a black valet who’s a bit thick, a running joke about Sterling Holloway yodelling and an oft-maligned hair bow for Stanwyck, and you’re welcome to sneer, smirk or raise alarm at them all you want, but - for me - everything that happened in cinema up to Remember the Night was just a rehearsal, and nothing that’s happened since has been half as good.",5.0
"Perfect constructed Sturges script. I know he suposedly disliked Leisen direction for being far too soft, but it has a very good balance of the Wilder-like irony of the basic situation and the redemptive romance and the film let both sides feed each other. And there's Stanwyck at her near best. And as lovely as most of this is, it has a very bitter logic that the entire wallk through the past sets up with movie magic only doing enough to allow the lovers to escape themselves (and on this McMurray usual stifness is very well deployed).",4.5

Second viewing, last seen 1993. Remembered it as lightly enjoyable, and one could readily imagine a version of this story that's more overtly comic. Indeed, the basic scenario—representative of law and order travels with criminal; one of them awkwardly visits an estranged relative; they grow close enough that Mr. Law (who'd been looking out solely for his own professional and financial interests) ultimately seeks to let the crook get away—was recapitulated decades later, minus the romance, via Midnight Run. Instead, Remember the Night turns startlingly dark for a moment, with Lee's attempted maternal rapprochement cruelly rejected, before shifting into a lovely, heartwarming portrait of restorative kindness...which then itself takes an ugly turn as Jack's mother ever-so-sweetly asks the wounded bird she's been tending to please fly somewhere far from her respectable and hardworking son. Sturges and Stanwyck would perfect this sort of thrilling tonal whiplash the following year in The Lady Eve—and that's the (even) greater film, in my opinion—but Leisen contributes purely visual aspects that Sturges, for all his genius, was never remotely able to match. Certainly there's nothing comparable to the shot of Lee sobbing on her mother's front porch, during which Leisen has Mom peek out the window, deep in the background, and then just switch off an interior light and vanish, rather than emerging to patch things up as one might expect. A truly disturbing moment that subtly enriches an otherwise one-dimensional character without ever calling attention to itself. Apparently, Leisen also cut a lot of the snappy patter that Sturges had written for Jack, fearing that it was beyond MacMurray's capability...which now seems patently absurd, since MacMurray and Stanwyck arguably set the standard for high-speed badinage just four years later, but probably better served this particular picture (just as The Lady Eve wouldn't work with a scabrous wit in Fonda's role).
Yet there's still plenty of vintage Sturges here—most notably in the opening reel, which hands the minor character of Lee's attorney an epic opening or closing argument (it's not clear to me which) that revels in escalating lunacy and remains blithely unconcerned about taxing the viewer's patience. Plotting's uncommonly strong, often creating and then subverting expectations; an entire sequence exists solely to divert Jack and Lee through Canada on their way home, but while Leisen gets a gorgeous Niagara Falls clinch out of it, Lee winds up passing on Jack's suggestion that she thwart the U.S. justice system simply by remaining outside of the country's borders. And having complained a few months ago about Kramer vs. Kramer's ludicrous custody trial, I was very gratified indeed to see a movie made four decades earlier employ that sort of witness badgering to an actual purpose, with the attorney deliberately trying to make the jury despise him so that they'll acquit the woman he's ostensibly trying to convict. (If you can watch Lee suddenly grasp what's happening and not need to brush tears away, you're less of a sap than yours truly.) I could perhaps wish for a slightly stronger finale, meaning literally just the last few seconds—what we get's a tad prosaic—but here I've been gushing for two full paragraphs without even mentioning Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway, who collectively manage to make ""common"" decency seem genuinely inspiring rather than saccharine or like a rebuke of those self-obsessed city folk. ""I'm pretty lucky, huh?"" Jack asks Lee, vis-à-vis the warm bosom of his family, and Lee's quiet ""You bet"" pierces because we've just seen her endure the opposite. Only a great movie would then have one of those same people gently stick the knife in, leading to an unhappy happy ending.
(If you somehow require further prodding, note that the Coens outright swiped Stanwyck's line ""That gag's so old it's got whiskers,"" giving it to Bruce Campbell in The Hudsucker Proxy. Also I watched this on 30 December, which is ideal; entire film takes place between Christmas and New Year's, basically.)",4.5
"70th Review for The Collab Weekly Movie Watch
In this Christmas film starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, a thief is caught and placed on trial, and the assistant district attorney, fearing that the jury will let her go free because of the goodwill of the season, has the trial postponed until after the holidays. However, his good nature gets the best of him when he decides to bail her out of jail since he feels awful that the girl will spend the holidays locked up. However, his actions ""backfire"" when the thief is placed in his care. This relationship develops into something more, and the two discover the value of love, friendship, and festivity.
Written by Preston Sturges (his final screenplay was for someone else), it is full of amusing moments, a writing that blends the cheesy, the saccharine, and the screwball in a coherent and enjoyable way in a film that will make you laugh at the numerous witticisms and drop a tear or two at the occasional revelation. Fred and Barbara, in particular, give strong performances; they have natural chemistry and do a great job bringing their characters to life.
All in all, even though some of the comedic segments didn't work for me and it can get a little melodramatic at times, this is still a great movie that you should watch during the holidays or any other time.

"The tension between Leisen's and Sturges's styles that was evident in Easy Living is here resolved, with the former easing off his tendency to favor background design over foreground acting and the latter hinting at the real depths of pathos lurking beneath his antic comedies. Yet it was Leisen who understood that the true focus of the film should be Stanwyck, not MacMurry and reoriented the screenplay accordingly. If Sturges bitched and moaned about the director's fussy alterations to his other script, he owed Leisen a debt for showing just how good Stanwyck could work in a comedy, which of course paid off handsomely for Sturges down the line. There are some sublime shots here: the way candlelight hovers in Jack's family home, or the matte background of Niagara Falls that glows so radiantly that the water backlights the putative lovers. But the real pleasures are in the natural chemistry that develops between Stanwyck and MacMurray, slowing down screwball into just an honest-to-goodness meet-cute that plays not off of manic gestures but subtle interactions. When Lee realizes early on that Jack's stoicism is a product not of his resolute kindness, her soft ""Gee, you're sweet,"" said as much to herself as him, lays out the next 2/3 of the movie in one fell swoop.",4.5
"It’s Babs' birthday today. She would have been 114. In some ways, it feels like she is. I just watched her resort to milking a cow after getting lost in the middle of nowhere on a long drive. And not for one second did she lose that sly twinkle in her eye.
As petty jewel thief Lee, she finds herself in hot water for sniping bracelets and flogging them for quick cash. Spend any time at all with Lee (Barbara), and it’s no wonder that her real trick would be to unknowingly steal the hearts of anyone who stuck around long enough to hear her story. And I don’t know about you, but that’s just about the best legacy that anyone could ever hope to ask for.
That sparkle she wears can blind the dullest of men, but what helps REMEMBER THE NIGHT shine so bright is that you can sense a gradual shift in that spark, from the inside out. It’s most evident in the moments where she’s hit with the realisation that no-one has ever been this selflessly kind-hearted and good to her before. And expected nothing in return. That kind of revelation has the power to change you, but only if you let it. Only, if you think you’re worthy of the time of day they stoop to give you. And she wears that struggle and everything else all in her two glistening eyes.
Slowly that twinkle starts to reveal itself as something more, something less dazzling than a personal cry for help. When she gives in and lets it all out, the result can be seen in the slight, dampened sheen of her pearly whites. At once, we see reflected back the strength of human tenderness and selfless deeds on someone who has only known a life spent running from unhappiness.
For all of her adept swindling, Lee has all but let any chance of love slip through her fingers. Resorting instead to buying it. Or rather, steal. It’s the poignant tremble of ‘what in good name have I done to deserve this?’ as fixed with ‘so this is what it’s like to have a family to call your own, friends and folk who actually love and care for you, warts and all?’ All right there in the solitary glance to the side. Falling to the knees beside the warm bed they’ve let you stay in for the night. The clutching of the pearls when no one is around to see.
And in a world where the littlest gestures often reveal the grandest impact, sometimes all it takes is a small exercise in human decency from the one person you’d least expect it. To change everything for the better. And it’s only in learning to love another, can she hope to love herself. On the road to accepting more than the lowly love she thinks she deserves.
Here’s to you, Babs. I’ll remember you, that’s for sure.",4.0

"Leisen's lyricism is at such odd ends with the percussive tendencies Sturges showed in his early work that it's no wonder Sturges hated this film. For all the Christmas time warmth and the pastoral landscape there is something eerie and foreboding about those two rural houses, visited one after the other; no amount of singing at the piano can dispel the lingering unease of Stanwyck's visit to her abandoned home, her mother standing just beyond the closed screen door.",4.5
"""that gag's so old it's got whiskers!""
a Stanwyck Christmas! primordial romantic comedy may have gutted Preston Sturges' first screenplay, but that unique wit bulldozes a way through all the same. the frothy plot (think THE PROPOSAL with a criminal twist) is good fun, Stanwyck & MacMurray do their thing, and the supporting cast is strong when not racist in a way typical of the time.
the court scene in the beginning is brilliant, those dark midwest studio skies are colder than the most frigid of Bela Tarr films, and the genial tone maintains a frankness that fits Stanwyck's unaffected screen presence (the bit where MacMurray's mom stuffs Stanwyck into an ancient corset is gold).
the only thing that hasn't aged well is the irrepressibly moral finale, a happy ending tainted by goodness.",3.0

"Basically, a really nice romantic aside turned into an endearing holiday film. I’m not sure if Barbara Stanwyck has ever been cuter, considering she later became typecast as the femme fatale/menacing mastermind. Her character here is a far cry from that, embattled with a stealing problem that pulls her into a district attorney’s life. Quite the humbling arc. While watching Remember The Night I was again impressed with Fred MacMurray and I am somewhat convinced he could be the most underrated actor of his era. He was in big films of course, but he is never really spoken about as a guy with range, one that could be straight, cutthroat, and funny. Together, the duo is charming and delightful. The film doesn’t invest me as well as I thought it would for a holiday film, and that one dude (ya know, the one who sounds like he could do a mean rendition of ""Indian Love Song"") gives me the Willies.",3.0

BARBARA AND FRED IN 1940’S FIRST GREAT LOVE AFFAIR…!
It's not just the first great love affair of 1940, it's the greatest cinematic love story of all, sorry Ethan and Julie in the really overrated sunrise saga from Linklater, this crosses dimensions/what if's, to burn the greatest flame of passion in cinema.,,, (I'm really overselling this right)
OK three films, which spanned 16 years, across three of the best directors of melodrama (minus Stahl), Wilder, Leisen and Sirk.
F**K Dr Strange, this is the true multiverse of madness.
Remember the Night - MacMurray the good clean lawyer, Stanwyck the thief, they fall in love and live happily ever after...
Double Indemnity - MacMurray the crooked insurance saleman Stanwyck the woman who wants her husband dead, they fall in lust and ends badly.
There’s Always Tomorrow - the best Sirk ever! MacMurray is the bitter husband, Stanwyck is his first love who returns to his life. This is a pure emotional train-wreck of a film.
Three different relationships, three different scenarios, three very different outcomes,. the one thing they all have in common, the best cinematic love affair and screen kiss after Garbo.
Here in their first tryst, a lawyer ends up taking the woman he was opposing in court (due to a miscommunication and it's Christmas) to Indianan, spending Christmas with his family. They fall in love and then face reality when they have to go back to court for trial.
I love this film, it is so out of time, so naive, so innocence and so pure. Watching this now 80 years after it was made, with its unrealistic notions of romance and emotional purity, may seems so out of step or alien, however possibly i hark to these film because we still need reminders of hope and goodness in this bitter world.
Here we have Stanwyck and like always, she steals another performance and film, due to her grounding of the role. Yes, it is lightweight fluff, but she pounds down on every line like it is Richard III to make this performance stick. Stanwyck was the method, 30 years beforehand and this is possibly why she is the greatest actress of the first half of the Twentieth Century. She could make anything work, that is how much she believed in her character and role and projected that to a camera.
One final thought on this is about director Mitchell Leisen, one of the most popular directors of the 1930s & 1940s. He seems to be completely forgotten today, he has had no real rediscovery, rep seasons nor that many collectors blu ray releases out there for people to rediscover him. Leisen, from memory was like the 2nd or 3rd most popular director at Paramount after DeMille, and pre Wilder, having such hits like Death Takes a Holiday, Hold Back the Dawn, Easy Living and Arise My Love, which most are seemingly so under the radar. This is a great shame but he basically was replaced by his two writer apprentices Wilder and Sturges (who both hated him with what he did with their scripts).",4.0

"It was my birthday, so I watched my favourite film. Actually, it was my birthday earlier in the week, but I fell over my HDMI cable the night before and snapped it, so we were a bit delayed.
It’s still my favourite, still a miracle of a film. It’s a movie so full of music – five of the loveliest diegetic songs you’ll ever hear, ‘Easy Living’ perhaps nodding to Leisen and Sturges’ only other collaboration – and full of the most exquisite lighting: the orbs around the candles, the shadows at Niagara, the hideous Gothic nightmare of Stanwyck’s mother’s house, as one of the great screen villains comes to the fore, Leisen finding every crease in her face. There are so many great jokes that I keep alighting on new ones every time I watch it: this time it was MacMurray's deadpan, ""If you know any other Fat Mikes, you can send them too"", the fantastic battle-of-the-sexes material in his apartment, and, near the close, Stanwyck's fantastically sarcastic, ""Some district attorney you turned out to be.""
Then there’s that kiss that quickens the heart like no other kiss in cinema. There’s Stanwyck’s tears over the nightie: a scene I’d always overlooked until last night, shot and played as it is with such subtlety. There’s a single sentimental scene of extraordinary power for each of the three supporting family members. And there's the way the two main characters soften and freeze between New York and Indiana, the way that Stanwyck can be acerbic or giving, MacMurray sanctimonious or kind.
Above everything else, though, it’s Stanwyck’s sincerity that hits so hard, and that makes the film as special as it is. In those key moments, she can make “Gee”, “You bet” and “I’m afraid so” sound and feel like epiphanies, and with it she can break your heart.",5.0

I hate seeing sweet Indiana boy Freddy Mac call his servant a dumbbell and later sing songs about the “old plantation,” but I love to watch him fool around with cattle. Also love: Sterling Holloway, who was born to play the part of a little yodeling boy (when he wasn’t busy playing a telegram delivery boy), and when Stanny’s eyes go all watery in closeup, I dare you to fight the spirit.

"Everybody's favourite Stanwyck (to Letterboxders, anyway), and one I hadn't seen until today. Putting aside the fact that bits of it remind me of 'The 39 Steps', others of 'Susan Slept Here' and others of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and 'Mr Deeds Goes To Town', I have to add my praise to that of the general majority.
Barbara Stanwyck is Lee, a jewel thief (must be something in the air, as yesterday I was watching a film with Myrna Loy in a similar profession), and here she is teamed for the first time of three with Fred MacMurray, here playing a prosecuting attorney, John, who succeeds in getting her trial postponed for decision til after Christmas, and ends up taking custody of her over the festive season instead.
MacMurray isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's very good here, and Stanwyck is in good form as the career criminal who opens proceedings in the court by watching her defence lawyer with barely-disguised amusement.
She's no victim here, and in fact she is perhaps better than she was in femme fatale mode in 'Double Indemnity'. Her gift for fun eventually paid off as Preston Sturges, screenwriter here, went on to write and direct 'The Lady Eve' for her, which gave her a chance to broaden her range.
Willard Robertson's speech as the flowery defence chap is hilarious, and even more so when you note in real life he gave up a career in law for the stage. Sterling Holloway, always fabulous, and with the weirdly musical voice, is fun as a cousin of MacMurray's. 'Snowflake' Toones plays John's slightly slow servant but he isn't quite as daft as he first appears. And Beulah Bondi ages up yet again to play MacMurray's mother.
This is a romance, a festive one, and a courtroom drama, and succeeds at all of them. What a happy discovery!",4.0

"COLLAB FILM CLUB
I feel a bit like Scrooge or the Grinch as I write this review since it's a Christmas favorite for so many. I enjoyed it but with reservations. There’s much to like: Mitchell Leisen’s romantic/sentimental direction. The less madcap than usual but still witty and edgy Preston Sturges script. Plus a terrific cast - Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and some great character actors in secondary roles.
However I always cringe at the elevation of old-fashioned Midwestern small-town goodness as the universal American ideal. It always feels like an earlier version of “family values” contrasted the dangers of modernity and big city living. We see this in the Hallmark holiday movies where a sophisticated NY woman goes to Iowa and realizes what she’s been missing. And this theme is strong in Remember the Night although the film’s positive features somewhat balance it out.
Nonetheless, I do like the emphasis on the power of kindness to open up the hearts of those who’ve had to live in survival mode. Stanwyck is Lee Leander (love the name!), a chronic shoplifter of high end items who’s arrested at Christmastime. Considering she reports having no money and skipping from one free meal and hotel to another, she looks quite glamorous with fashionable early 40s outfits and stylish hairdo.
MacMurray is DA John Sargent who winds up escorting her to his Indiana family and hometown while she’s out on bail. (Note: Apparently Sturges made Sargent more of a moralistic hard-ass in his script but Leisen insisted he be more pleasant and relatable).  Lee is deeply touched by the goodness of McMurray’s mom (Beulah Bondi) and maiden aunt (Elizabeth Patterson), and of course they fall in love. There’s also a hired hand played by Sterling Holloway, an actor whose schtick annoys me. But that’s another story.
The second collaboration of Leisen and Sturges - they did Easy Living - shows their different approaches. I wound up liking the first half with its quirky but lovable characters (Sturges) more than the sentimental second half (Leisen). Stanwyck does a great job of showing Lee’s softening and transformation. But there’s a strong gendered messaging in her transformation: We watch Lee being taught to bake, and to wear a lacy corset for a rural dress-up New Year’s ball. John’s mom (Beulah Bondi) kindly but clearly pressures Lee to not do anything that would derail her hard-working son’s career.
I hate to add even more critiques but there's some racist elements as well. John has a black servant whose pattern of speech and behavior has the usual Hollywood stereotypes, and there’s some casually racist anti-Chinese jokes in the banter between John and Lee (“In China, they eat dogs” and references to “Chinese coolies” in the trunk of the car). These are minor but I still wish they weren’t there.
Nonetheless, there are some lovely and amusing moments throughout. And genuine pathos, such as when Lee visits her hostile and contemptuous mother. The paring of the quick-with-a-sharp-comeback Stanwyck with the understated MacMurray works so well they wound up doing three more films together. But I much prefer them in Wilder’s Double Indemnity and Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow. Anyway, hope I wasn’t too harsh because this is truly a well-made film. I guess I just prefer my “feel good” movies to be less linked with those old-time heartland values.
Oh, and Merry Christmas to all my LB friends!",3.5
"Fred MacMurray is the OG “I can fix her” guy
Probably a 4.5 on a rewatch cause it had all the feels but my cat was eating Christmas presents under the tree during the last 10 minutes so I had to keep pausing and it was distracting as fuck",4.0
"My all-time favourite film: a work of simple grace and beguiling beauty about the relationship between a shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) and the DA who lands her in jail over Christmas (Fred MacMurray), before feeling the first stirrings of conscience.
The marriage of Stanwyck's consummate, unique artistry and screenwriter Preston Sturges' fusion of the hard-boiled and heartfelt begins to work its magic instantly, and by the time they pitch up in Indiana to spend the holidays with MacMurray's family, I'm a mess. MacMurray too is astonishingly good, giving far and away the greatest, deepest performance of a long and erratic career.
Probably the 12 most moving moments in cinema history are crammed into this one film – among them, a meltdown at a New York nightclub, Elizabeth Patterson's love letters and Stanwyck's immortal ""you bet"" – while former costume designer and set dresser Leisen's very specific style (including props in the foreground to colour the whole frame) leads to some astonishing imagery: including a New Year's kiss shot through streamers and a Niagara Falls scene filmed almost entirely in silhouette. Its atmosphere is like nothing else I've ever experienced.
The movie's hilarious too, from MacMurray's ironic admission of state-sanctioned hedonism (""Oh yes, my life is just one long round of whoopee""), through Sturges' memorable ruminations on honesty, to a climactic courtroom scene that's both emotionally redolent and gloriously petulant, as MacMurray goes from intimidating the defendant to insulting the jury. Even the supporting characters are given pure gold: deftly sketched personas spouting stellar lines, including a ludicrously loquacious lawyer (Willard Robertson), dullwitted bondsman Fat Mike (Tom Kennedy) and overstretched orphan Willie (Sterling Holloway) – working for his supper at MacMurray's ma's house.
But the film's much more than a smart, moving, even heady rom-com: it's a plea for love, tolerance and social justice, a film about second chances, the malleability of human nature and the conditions that breed criminals, all masquerading as a holiday romance.
I've seen it perhaps a dozen times now – this was my second time on the big screen this year – and there's nowhere I'd rather be than at Beulah Bondi's house, as her son Jack (MacMurray) and the thief he's prosecuting (Stanwyck) swap songs, stories and presents, while falling desperately and irredeemably in love.",5.0
"One of these days one of you boys is going to start one of these scenes differently and one of us girls is going to drop dead from surprise.
AW. That was sweet. Barbara Stanwyck really should have been booked for murder...ing my emotions. A wholesome Christmas movie featuring thief Stanwyck and DA MacMurray, what an unlikely combo.
Also, I'm glad this Christmas film was light on food, because I lost my taste and smell today and tested positive for COVID for the first time (and here I thought the punchiest present this week was its sledgehammer to the elbow pain for days, boy I thought wrong). I think I'll spiral into sad films if I can't taste Christmas next week uggghghghUGhGH. (I know, first world problems, could have been a lot worse but let me have this moment.)",4.0
"In a previous write-up of a wonderful film called Ninotchka, Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch worked together and got along as writer and director respectively, turning in a flick for the ages — Lubitsch became a mentor figure to Wilder. However, it wasn’t always that Wilder was proud of how other directors handled his work such as Howard Hawks on Ball of Fire (jeez, at this point, if one had a dollar for everytime I mentioned this film or Barbara Stanwyck in a review, you might have enough to get yourself a Peloton) and Mitchell Leisen on Midnight. But even then despite editing scenes and dialogue crafted & cherished by Wilder, both of those directors gave audiences a film for the ages. Speaking of Leisen, there was another writer whose work he altered to his dismay — that of Preston Sturges who made real gems like Sullivan’s Travels and The Palm Beach Story. The product of such is known as Remember the Night. But did Leisen’s changes hold up to screen greatness like how he edited and sowed Wilder’s script for Midnight? Yes, they did and even better. This 1940 film is a Christmas classic steeped in sweetness that stemmed from roughness.
In New York City, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is arrested after stealing a bracelet from a jewelry store. Assistant district attorney John “Jack” Sergeant is assigned to the prosecution team in a trial that occurs right before Christmas Day. In order to prevent an acquittal due to a holiday spirited jury willing to proclaim Lee not guilty, Jack postpones the trial to after Christmas on a technicality. Little does he know that he himself becomes filled with the holiday spirit as he immediately feels guilty post realizing that Lee will have to spend the 25th of December in a jail cell. So he bails her out. But oddly enough due to a misunderstanding, Lee appears in Jack’s apartment, having nowhere to spend Christmas. Jack decides to take her to her mother’s house on his way to see his own family where love, humility, and joy reside — something Lee must experience herself. Will she?
There’s just a really great quality about old writers and directors — Frank Capra was the sentimental, conservative, and common sense American and Billy Wilder found ways to make fun of politics in his films, while also proclaiming views against communism or fascism like in the aforementioned Ninotchka. Importantly, these filmmakers knew how to balance their art with the message. Preston Sturges had an unwavering brand of messages out there and one theme that stood out was responsibility. In Sullivan’s Travels, he made the whole case for movies’ responsibility to the audience: for the average citizen to escape the burdens of life ranging from politics, familial troubles, hard days at work, etc. — to not lecture or preach. In Christmas in July, it was the responsibility for people to stay humble amidst all the hard work and pay. 
In Remember the Night, responsibility plays a factor in both characters Lee and Jack. Lee is a thief, responsible for her actions and her court sentence. But one must also take into account why she is the way she is — a rough home life with a mother who spoke ill of her and never cared for her as a child growing up in Indiana. Her fellow Hoosier, Jack, is a man who himself had a rough home life and put himself through work to become the lawyer he is. Most importantly, it is the responsibility of one’s parents to shape their kids into the adults they are today. 
Jack’s mother to Lee: We were very poor after my husband died. In fact, we had nothing. Jack had to do chores before school and chores after school, and -- when he was in high school, he drove a delivery truck afternoons to earn a little money. And after chores, he studied evenings to try to get into college. He worked his way through college and he worked his way through law school. Oh, I’m not trying to say there’s anything unusual in that. Thousands of boys are doing the same thing this minute. But I am trying to tell you how hard he worked to get where he is today. How very, very hard.
Sturges’ words here are very much the missives of wisdom, but it’s amazing that such ideas as this aren’t found in films of the current age. Or maybe they are and I just haven’t touched upon them yet. This kind of message isn’t one to lecture or preach to the audience, but to inspire people in their normal lives. Babs Stanwyck’s Lee took it upon herself to do what was right and MacMurray’s Jack felt it his due diligence to welcome Lee into his loving home and away from the horrors and memories of her childhood. From the way his life was shaped in a hard working, caring, loving, and humble family home, Jack’s actions based on humility have paved the way for romance to blossom between the law giver and the law breaker for a Christmas miracle that never at one point loses its humility. Even at the very end.
Remember the Night is an excellent film and another addition to the annual Christmas movies to be seen time and time again, helped by Leisen’s use of blocking and cinematography. It is a wonder as to what this film would’ve been like if Sturges was director in addition to writer — more lengthy monologues for MacMurray rather than utilize his quiet nature, for instance? Sturges probably wouldn’t have known how to play or tailor the script to the co-leads’ strengths the way Leisen knew. That is not until The Lady Eve. Not to mention… another favorite starring Babs. Look, I stan Stanwyck. This might be my most favorite collaboration of her and MacMurray over Wilder’s Double Indemnity. And right here again she knows how to light up the screen. Stanwyck + Christmas movies = joy.
Also, Jack’s cousin Willie played by Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh??
👉 Second Review",4.5
"While watching REMEMBER THE NIGHT, I couldn’t help the occasional momentary flashes that the two leads would headline DOUBLE INDEMNITY just four years later!  That isn’t a flaw with this movie.  It speaks more to the versatility of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.
   
Just as “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens defined Christmas for Victorian readers, REMEMBER THE NIGHT captures the American ideal of Christmas that was popular in the 1940’s possibly right through to the 1970’s.  It lovingly creates the image of what it is supposed to be like when the extended family comes together during the Holidays.  That’s not to say that people were expected to sing around the piano and attend a barn dance.  However, it presented a sense of belonging and not being alone during a festive time ... which may mean that REMEMBER THE NIGHT might not be the best Christmas movie to watch during the Pandemic!
   
Director Michael Leison (probably best known for DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY) keeps things moving with a very light touch.  The comedy sequences are gentle rather than laugh out loud funny (okay, maybe with the exception of the cross-eyed portrait on the wall) and the relationships are more touching than passionate.  Yet, it is appropriate for a show that wants to merge “smart” with “nostalgia.”  Add to that a screenplay by Preston Sturges, and it would be difficult to “miss.”
   
Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are fine separately, but they are excellent when together.  In its effort to push sentimentality, REMEMBER THE NIGHT treads dangerously close to the maudlin, and there are a couple of plot turns that may likely raise an eyebrow.  Still, Stanwyck always “sells” it ... and MacMurray is wise enough to follow her lead.
   
REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a delightful film for the end-of-the-year Holidays, and is a reminder that good deeds and basic human decency should never go out of style.",4.5

"Insta-heart melter. Remember the Night is going into the Christmas rotation for every year forever.
Remember the Night is noticeably softer than the other Mitchell Leisen - Preston Sturges partnership I've seen Easy Living (another phenomenal film). Apparently Sturges didn't like how much Leisen lightened the film, but Sturges' wit shines through expertly. I have to go against Sturges on this because Remember the Night is a masterwork. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are perfect, flawless, gorgeous, charming, funny, and everything in-between - except when MacMurray eats a sandwich with leather gloves on.",4.5
"I thought this was just a Christmas romance and now I'm in tears about love and morality?? Preston Sturges did not have to go this hard for us!!
Listen. This is the cutest thing I've ever watched. It's essentially the inverse of ""Double Indemnity"", or at least its distant cousin. I loved Barbara Stanwyck in ""The Lady Eve"", another Sturges movie, and she was absolutely amazing in this as well. However, I basically have no coherent thoughts about ""Remember the Night"" except for how sweet, romantic, and sad (?? bittersweet??) it is.",4.5
"Preston Sturges described the plot of this film, which he wrote and which Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray starred in, this way: “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” I suggest the following addendum: “Then their love for each other redeemed them both.” A pattern of sentiment, subversion of sentiment, and triumphant return of sentiment repeats throughout the film. Assistant district attorney MacMurray plays a courtroom trick that keeps accused thief Stanwyck in jail. He feels bad about it, so he asks bail bondsman Tom Kennedy to get her out for the holidays. Kennedy misreads his intentions and leaves her at his apartment. Stanwyck quickly realizes MacMurray was trying to do her a good turn, not take advantage of her. As a result, she begins to fall for him. 
That same pattern continues, with variation. Learning that Stanwyck grew up not far from his mother Bealah Bondi’s house, which he’s getting ready to drive to, MacMurray offers her a lift. But Stanwyck’s mom, Georgia Caine, turns out to be a loveless, puritanical harridan. So MacMurray helps Stanwyck save face — and have a merry Christmas — by inviting her to Bondi’s house. Etc. When they return to New York, MacMurray tries to “throw” his case against Stanwyck, jeopardizing his career in the process. But Stanwyck has learned how important MacMurray’s career is to him and Bondi, both of whom have been good to her, as well as the sacrifices they made for him to have it. So she makes her own sacrifice for his sake: she changes her plea to guilty so that, if they still love each other after she’s served her term, they’ll be able to look each other in the eye. 
It’s a rich and incredibly moving film. That’s due equally to Sturges’ screenplay, which suggests meaningful parallels in MacMurray’s and Stanwyck’s respective backstories, and director Mitchell Leisen’s subtle handling of the thematics and emphasis on characterization. Both Stanwyck and MacMurray grew up poor; both even stole their mothers’ savings. But Stanwyck’s mistake was met with emotional cruelty, while MacMurray’s was met with love. Would their roles be reversed now if their situations had been different then? Love, or the lack of it, has made them who they are. Yet the film never feels sappy because Sturges’ tendency to subvert the sentimentality of the story before reinforcing it and Leisen’s reluctance to hit us over the head with it keeps us on our toes. There’s ambiguity even at the end. Will these two lovers ever reunite, and if so, how long will it take?
Stanwyck and MacMurray have great chemistry in their first film together. One scene stood out to me in particular. As they share a cab to the courthouse, Stanwyck grows concerned about what MacMurray is planning. As he tries to kiss her, she turns away slightly. He kisses her cheek and neck instead. Suddenly, she’s smiling and leaning into his kiss. It’s a wonderful display of Stanwyck’s acting talent as well as their chemistry. (It also illustrates the repeating pattern I describe above. In fact, those few seconds could represent the whole film.) Two of their three subsequent films together are at least as good: Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity and Douglas Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow. That Leisen rarely gets mentioned alongside Wilder and Sirk as a master of the medium is a shame. Off the top of my head, I can think of at least four other films he directed, in addition to this one, that are masterpieces. 
This gives It’s A Wonderful Life a serious run for its money as the best Christmas-themed movie of the 1940s.",5.0
"Such a beautifully constructed script from Preston Sturges, rich in detail and subtle in shading. Guided by the deft touch of Mitchell Leisen, under the glow of Paramount at its peak, Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Beulah Bondi breathe humanity into their characterisations, as do the score of actors in smaller parts, each grabbing their moment and making it count. It's kind of sublime.
On Christmas Eve, Sterling Holloway croons At the End of a Perfect Day, accompanied by Barbara on the piano, her eyes glistening with emotion. On Christmas morning, at the beginning of a hopefully getting-on-for-perfect day, I was caught up in this classic, to the same effect.
Merry Christmas.",5.0
"There’ll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?
Christmas is a time of memories. Each December, when I lift the ornaments from their cocoons of tissue paper, I bring back holidays past. There’s the plywood stocking bought to commemorate my first solstice, there a snowman hand made out of clay (“age 6” scrawled on the back); there's a red-capped mouse my mother painted one year, and there an elf missing its right hand to the Yuletide wars.
On the tree I hang tokens of past blessings, and I draw on them for present contentment. But what if the box of ornaments was empty? Or its contents shattered, or invidious, or accusing?
Remember the Night seeks to define the limits of justice and mercy. To what extent are we responsible for our actions? What is the proper amount of penance, particularly for those crimes we seem to have been born to rather than chosen?
As a first-time viewer, I was struck by just how long the beginning of the film dwells in the courtroom. By the end of the first fifteen minutes, we’ve spent more time with defense attorney O’Leary (Willard Robertson) than our ostensible leads. His speech to the jury more than justifies earlier comments about his prolixity – and then goes on.
And still goes on.
And goes on some more.
I was a little puzzled by the pacing, but further reflection clarified the time expended: this is a movie about the stories we tell in order to explain our behavior – about our excuses, arraignments, doubts, and justifications. O’Leary attempts to get petty thief Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) acquitted by depriving her of responsibility for her actions. He concocts a long-drawn, fabulous story in which his client, an innocent victim of mesmerism, entangles herself in crime with all the volition of a puppet entangled in its strings.
Lee stole a bracelet; O’Leary’s defense attempts to rob her of her autonomy.
The movie cannot allow this defense to succeed. To acquit her on the basis of mesmerism, the film suggests, would be equivalent to looking to her past to deny her culpability in the present – as though all of us, “hypnotized” by our upbringings, could no longer be treated as agents, but as products.
It’s a rather conservative message – but the movie also doesn’t want us to identify with the unforgiving rectitude of Lee’s mother. One of the most humane things John Sargent does in the film is rescue his new companion from a heart-breaking scene of failed reconciliation.
“Well, it’s been interesting meeting you, Mrs. –” he says, moving toward the door.
“The name does not concern you,” she replies.
“It certainly does not,” he says.
Fred MacMurray’s delivery here is absolutely withering.

My Christmas tree topper is missing part of a wing, and its halo is chipped – but one hopes that, without shame, even the imperfect can join the ranks of the angels.

"My favourite movie, on the big screen again
The small details, the wild counter-intiition of its courtroom climax, and Stanwyck’s story playing out on her face. The way Sturges and Leisen use comedy to segue into, or offer relief from, deep emotion (the cross-eyed grandfather after the homecoming heartbreak; Sterling Holloway’s ballad after he’s been put in his place). The use of snatches of everyday language to represent epiphanies. Bondi as conscience and heavy. Some kind of miracle.",5.0
"This is a superb comic drama from the pen of the marvelous Preston Sturges, directed by the almost as marvelous Mitchell Leisen. Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent as a young woman whose life of petty crime has its roots in some unhappy childhood experiences, who comes to see that life has better things to offer. Fred MacMurray is nearly as good as the prosecuting attorney who, cynical as he is, takes pity on her and introduces her to the kind of life she had never known. Beulah Bondi, as MacMurray's mother, is gentle and expert in her portrayal of a woman filled with love and pity. The supporting cast, particularly Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway as family members, is keen in its depiction of small town characters, providing richly authentic feelings to even the most comic of types. The legal stuff at the beginning is largely laughable in its variance from actual courtroom procedure, but Sturges has filled the rest of the script with a true sense of life and feeling. Splendid viewing on every count.",4.5
"The one previous time I saw Remember the Night, I was disappointed that Mitchell Leisen, the year after Midnight, and Preston Sturges, the year before The Lady Eve, could come up with this sentimental twaddle. I also disliked what I saw as clumsy shifts from comedy to seriousness, and that ending left a bad taste in my mouth. Well, this time, I fell for it, cornball Americana and all. Sometimes, a fella just wants to believe in the inherent goodness of people, even if, you know, well. Just as Cary Grant holds The Bishop’s Wife together, Babs does the same here, with a multilayered performance, providing more to her role than is in the script. The range of emotions in the final trial scene is moving. She and Fred mesh together well in the first of their four films together. Mitch and Pres, I apologize for my previous response. My shift must be a Christmas miracle.

"Wow! What a charmer this little romantic comedy is. The script was penned by Preston Sturges and this features a pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray prior to their most iconic: Double Indemnity. I discovered this film in the TCM Christmas in the Movies book and I didn't know I was about to see such a potent romance and Christmas film. Barbara and Fred are as good as they ever were here and this movie really gets to the bottom of what Christmas means to people from differing levels of loving childhoods. The charm, wit, and love this movie oozes out seems to have been invented from a master of the genre (it was) and it's one of the most effortless early Hollywood romances I've ever witnessed. This'll be put in my annual Christmas rotation for sure. The shot of Barbara and Fred finally kissing at the dance behind all of the party streamers>

"Is this who I am now? A mutual logs a classic film from the 30s, 40s or 50s and if it looks interesting, I just jump onto it?
I was in high spirits on Saturday (my football team Manchester United actually made me proud and won a trophy) so I thought I'd watch what looked like a heartfelt ""romcom"" from a decade of cinema I was never initially that interested in or convinced by but continue to grow to love more and more...Turns out the film is not quite what I thought it was but that sure did not prevent me from really enjoying it!
I'm not quite sure what to make of this film to be perfectly honest. Despite it being labelled as a romantic comedy, there was very few jokes that landed, let alone got a chuckle out of me. What helped the film is these jokes weren't the whole point of scenes, and instead more complimentary to the character interactions taking place.
There were moments that just felt, I don't know, odd? Like the whole thing about them getting lost and ending up in a guy's farm and trying to milk the cow in the morning...That was weird and I can't tell you if it was bad or whatever, it just felt really odd and like it belonged in a different film. Oh I almost forgot, the stuff with the black erm, servant...Was pretty cringe inducing. Besides a lot of these weird drawbacks though, I thought the rest of the film turned out much better than I could have hoped.
The romance between Jack and Lee, as well as the chemistry between Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, had to really land for this film to work I feel. I've seen MacMurray in two other films but I mostly remembered him for his role in The Apartment. That role is what sort of confused me in terms of what his character here was. It wasn't until Jack offered to buy Lee dinner that I realized he was a morally upright character. I had, like her, assumed he had an ulterior motive for being kind to her.
The presentation of Lee's character was interesting too because for a long time, I kept waiting for the film to try to explain away her own crimes and mistakes. Maybe I'm cynical in expecting this, but it couldn't have been helped because the film itself didn't try to use sentimentality to mask flaws in its characters.
There was a cloud of inevitability that hovered over the romance between Jack and Lee, but I never really believed it wouldn't pass by the ending. I kept thinking somehow, some way, by the ending the two of them would be together and the world would bend to them being a couple, treating them as though they really were the main protagonists.
Sure Lee's homecoming was not what I expected and she got a little dose of reality and some overly tough love when she got home. Sure it would feel a little bit like a cop out if everything just worked out well for them. I mean just because you are remorseful doesn't mean the law should just forgive you but come on, these two are so endearing and they have both become better people! Lee has slowly lowered her protective demeanor and personality and started to reveal more vulnerability, probably something she hasn't done since she was a child. Jack is in love and is starting to learn to sometimes see the humanity in the people he prosecutes, even though he was never a jerk or completely ruthless and uncaring.
I was won over by the their budding romance that I didn't think too much just how much this new found love was bringing integrity to one character, while blinding and taking it away from the other. It was not until the final scene, which is just fantastic, that I realized how much of a copout a normal ending would be. It would undo so much growth for one character and slowly begin the downfall of another's integrity.
Remember the Night shows just how crucial a loving and supporting family can be to who we become. Honesty, integrity, kindness and love are all virtues that made people good. Being dogmatic about any particular one while ignoring the rest will blind you. Jack thinks loving Lee is enough reason to sacrifice some of these virtues, as though this wouldn't have further reaching consequences.
Lee on the other hand, is seeing these virtues earnestly for the first time in a very long time. Her own insecurities and flaws are for once unable to prevent her from doing what she feels is the right thing. She also sees the value on waiting to know a person better before deciding they are perfect in every way.
Through the ending, the film manages to feel both hopeful yet realistic. It takes a story I wasn't quite able to really pin down in terms of what it was going for, and really ties it together in impressive fashion.
MacMurray and Stanwyck were definitely very good, but I was also impressed by Beulah Bondi's performance as Jack's mother. I've seen her in a few films (though I didn't immediately clock this) and much like in Make Way for Tomorrow (what a film, what a performance!), she possesses an aura that's hard to describe. It's like she exudes integrity, tenderness, honesty and whenever she speaks, I'm fully attentive. If anything I wish we got more scenes of her and Lee because their heart to heart was just great to see.
In the end, I was won over by Remember the Night. I don't entirely know why but I at least know that what the film does well, it does very well.",4.0
"There could be some instances among cinephiles wherein penning a second missive of a film you’ve seen before and about which you’ve previously and lovingly jotted down your thoughts might feel manufactured as opposed to wholehearted enthusiasm. However, fortunately, the assurance must be stated — my second write-ups of films don’t at all come from a place anathema to eagerness, and certainly wouldn’t think most others and my friends on this platform don’t share the sentiment. However, being a member of this medium, even watching a movie can spur ludicrous thoughts about what words one shall write down post viewing. Possibly much of the time for people, yet none for some others, absorbing a film’s magic is meant to obtain a stage of joy. People ideally watch a movie for the sake of enjoyment, relaxation, and escapism. Even to learn a lesson or have one’s values be supported or challenged, and see life through a different perspective wherein emotion is all but difficult to explain verbally as opposed to visually. But among the vast number of reviewers and “reviewers” here, watching a flick for the sake of composing the next Letterboxd entry can never be the goal of watching a film. And so therefore, the viewer may not come to witness the kind of emotion that’s exuded by a great film such as Mitchell Leisen’s Remember the Night. If there were all but one adjective to describe this little Christmas tale wholly, the word “adorable” materializes. It’s undeniable that my first write-up in 2021 for this Preston Sturges written charmer still stands its ground. 
Once again, after being arrested for shoplifting, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is taken to court where district attorney Jack Sargeant (Fred MacMurray) is assigned to prosecute her. However, due to his wits and Christmas being just days away, Jack successfully postponed the trial until January, leaving Ms. Leander in jail all alone. But due to his good heart, this clever lawyer decides to bail Lee out and take her on a little road trip to see her mother. Not only her mother, but Jack’s sweet family up in the Midwest. Through periods of loneliness, a ruckus trial, and a true gift of a man’s goodwill and chivalry, Lee discovers not only a new willingness to reform her dastardly ways but a special kind of love that she had never received and a forgiveness that was never bestowed on her soul. In the spirit of Christmas, Ms. Leander only begins to learn what love is — how it feels and what’s expected to emanate from one’s heart. And by love, what a dose of sacrifice and unselfishness does to the soul — it burns, but it burns ever so deeply that the willingness to suffer only grows stronger. 
Post watching this Leisen charmer on Christmas Eve of 2021, my dumb thumbs tapped away…
“… responsibility plays a factor in both characters Lee and Jack. Lee is a thief, responsible for her actions and her court sentence. But one must also take into account why she is the way she is — a rough home life with a mother who spoke ill of her and never cared for her as a child growing up in Indiana. Her fellow Hoosier, Jack, is a man who himself had a rough home life and put himself through work to become the lawyer he is. Most importantly, it is the responsibility of one’s parents to shape their kids into the adults they are today.”
The thought still stands. But stemming from the virtue of responsibility is love. Whether one wants or doesn’t want to act, responsibility is not a human’s innate ability to feel righteous about oneself, but to act for another — a person or cause — simply because it is right and moral. Good ol’ MacMurray’s Jack Sargeant never wanted to bring the enticing criminal into his apartment, pay her dinner, and neither did he expect to allow her into his warm and loving Indiana home. The radiant and cute Barbara Stanwyck’s Lee Leander had never expected for the man who was to put her in jail to do all of those good deeds either. But one feeling in both individuals’ cases was for certain — neither wanted to be alone. Lee had no one but her mother who disowned her. Jack lived by himself and only wanted to see his sweet family once again.  
The steadfast lawyer not only recognized the horror of loneliness, an unloving parent, and the absence of love and joy in Lee’s life.. but he fixed it for her. Rather than allow the jewelry thief to spend another Christmas by herself, Jack stays with her. Instead of having Babs’ Ms. Leander sit and listen to her malevolent & uncaring mother crush her spirit further, Jack takes her to meet his sweet mother, aunt, and cousin. From this comes the remedy to install the missing love and joy into Lee’s soul, but the final dose of that medicine came in the form of Jack devoting himself. Without this recognition of such an intense willingness to give oneself unto another, Lee herself wouldn’t have found the courage to care for Jack and his well-deserved reputation as a district attorney. Consequently, the D.A., who had always received and reciprocated affection and happiness his whole life wasn’t the person to declare the final “I love you” to this pretty dame. But like how the seasoned lawyer made the final court trick and postponed his fellow Hoosier’s trial, the rookie in the realm of such ebullient human emotion, Lee, was the person to make the final sacrifice and postpone that solidification of love for the right time and place. 
Through intimate, reflective, and sweet framing of the characters in not just scenes related to the plot, but small portions that drive the journey and evolution of Jack and Lee’s relationship, the Leisen and Sturges collaboration only makes for a stellar wintery classic never to be ignored. Simple dinner scenes, a slow dancing sequence, a family scene by the piano, and the dichotomy between the morose entry of Lee’s mother and the warmly lit introduction of Jack’s mother, aunt, and cousin, can hit the viewer with an indelible charm that can’t be overlooked. Once again, Remember the Night is just adorable, and another flick that should be seen every Christmas alongside It’s a Wonderful Life, The Bishop’s Wife, and The Shop Around the Corner to name a few. Yeesh, will you people quit watching Elf?

Stanwyck at the traditional Christmas morning, a foreign concept to her, conveys a million and one emotions just by sitting cozily off to the side for most of the scene. Edith Head's designs for Stanwyck are gorgeous.",5.0
"A must-see film that for some reason always gets overlooked as a Christmas classic and doesn't have the same status as the holiday standards It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street, and it really should have. I for one couldn't wait till Christmas to watch this gem again. It's so sweet and charming that it makes me all warm and gooey inside. Stanwyck has never looked lovelier and I love how the camera captures her face, especially when she's not even speaking and her face and eyes are doing all the talking. Some of my favourite scenes: the milking of the cow; the unwrapping of Christmas presents; the singing around the piano; the bedroom scene where Beulah Bondi (love her) talks to Stanwyck about her son and how nothing should spoil what he worked so hard for. And then of course there's the scene where Stanwyck visits her mother and gets a cold reception. It's heartbreaking and memorable. Only flaw: the overly long courtroom scene at the beginning of the film which makes for a slow start. ",5.0
"Preston Sturges' comedy is surprisingly the weak link here. Not bad, but compared to the humor in the other two Leisen films I've seen- the humor in this film tends to feel like it belongs in 1940 and doesn't really land well with my modern sensibilities. Some of the jokes were still funny, it's just some of them also fell flat. Rufus' inclusion as a character was also not necessary and pretty racist.
The romance and character drama parts of the script were great though. I really loved both of the leads and the dynamic between them. Stanwyck especially got most of the focus from the camera, and I'll tell you hwhat I lived for it every time we got a closeup on Stanwyck's face. Her forlorn looks of longing and her small moments of hopeful acceptance take front-and-center stage, and it makes her the defining element of the film.
MacMurray was also great leaning more into the sly and witty city slicker on the outside and the gentle and empathetic romantic on the inside. His performance doesn't have the emotional high/lows of Stanwyck's, but he is a well-written character with a genuine charm.
My favorite section of the movie was when they were at the Sargent farm. Almost all of my favorite scenes from the film take place within that section; I just wish we could've stayed there for longer. The piano scene after Christmas dinner was just magical. I loved the whole family dynamic there as well and the contrast of being in a big country home full of love and family as opposed to the dwindling humanity of the New York courthouses, luxury hotels, mansions, and banks that I'm used to from Leisen's other films.
And shout-out to Edith Head on the costumes in this one, because Stanwyck dons some legendary outfits in this movie.
Mitchell Leisen Ranked",4.0
"Out of Classical Hollywood's many talented directors and visionaries who could clear-as-day make films with an iconoclastic style and are best remembered for their hard-working skills behind-the-camera, Mitchell Leisen isn't a name you'll find mentioned often, and that's because Leisen was very much a writer's director, in that the quality of his work depended solely on the material he was hastily given to make something out of, especially in the pre-war days. The thing about Mitchell Leisen is that he didn't make Leisen films, he made Paramount films and spent 29 years being a loyal journeyman, but that's not to say Leisen didn't craft his unique personal directorial niches, creating leisurely-paced films and emphasizing eye appeal and visual elegance helpfully informed by his time designing sets and costumes for, say, Cecil B. DeMille or Ernst Lubitsch. Remember the Night is Leisen's most famous film not because of the man himself, but because he made so many changes to the original script that the credited screenwriter, Preston Sturges, got so fed up and decided to make films of his own, a few of which have made a few laps ahead of Leisen's in terms of popularity, and as a heartfelt Christmas-adjacent drama with healthy doses of comedy, it works like a charm.
Lee Leander is on trial for a third offense of shoplifting and awaits further questioning after the holidays, all while a sympathetic attorney, John Sargent, agrees to give a roof over her head with a little help from chummy bail bondsman Fat Mike (no, not the guy from NOFX). Lee's major story revolves around that of redemption and reformation, slowly warming her cynical attitude towards living and ownership as she agrees to join John in a trip to Indiana towards both their elder's homes, structured around many detours on and off the road that shift her identity and rekindle the small-town values within her (though not without hesitance towards a quick bit of arson to escape from a pickle), escaping the frivolousness of New York and finding communion and longing within the friendliness and love of a family like John's that helps Lee understand the morality and capability of greater things within a dame burdened with a tendency to scatter off with jewelry that's not hers. By finding herself within sentimentality, Lee is able to mature from her past sins and learn what she may desire to help keep these life lessons rooted within her.
As much as love reforms Lee, love also corrupts John as he's the man assigned to book this petty thief to the slammer after the holidays, agreeing to have her accompany him on a non-romantic basis that wanes, falters, and gradually eases towards each other that brings John into a conflict of interest towards whether falling in love or maintaining his attorney reputation is more important. The chemistry between our two leading actors, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, is absolutely palpable, Lee bouncing off a tough demeanor hiding her vulnerability with John's relaxed, good-as-gold integrity as he ends up effortlessly shedding the distance between them, evoking the Christmas spirit as they express kindness to each other, charm in gathering around John's family piano for a sing-a-along, intimacy underneath the New Year's flairs, the two are destined for each other and it takes a considerable amount of the runtime for that self-imposed barrier between professionalism, i.e. to treat this pairing as a temporary truce between attorney and thief, to collapse into enormous fondness. John comes to know Lee better as a person rather than just another case, and how that internal conflict comes to head is inevitably as bittersweet and realistic as one can get out of such an improbable pair.
Preston Sturges' witty dialogue and ability to juggle from one mood to another (to the point that this understated melodrama briefly turns into a screwball comedy once the pair get lost in Pennsylvania, complete with invasive cows, gun-totin' farmowners, cruel justices of the peace, it's like I'm actually there) helps Remember the Night be as clever as it is, but Leisen's subtle abilities to tug at the heart-strings, injecting compassion and soft-spoken conversations in-between the brashness of the lead couple's opposite personalities, it's an element that's hard to properly define or give meaningful words to, but the swinging emotional tides make a light romantic yarn quite cozy and sweet enough to get wrapped into a stellar final scene, the film is quite adept at mending spirits and breaking hearts, with enough of a reminder that Christmas allows us to raise our sights and see the best in other people as we tumble inevitably towards a new year of uncertainty and doubt, impossibly hopeful in its downbeat moments that's able to balance out its moments of hokiness in trying to prove those above thoughts true. A lot of heart and a delicate sentiment make a simple, small, otherwise unambitious film mean more than what you'd expect.

Stany's greatest screen partner wasn't Fred MacMurray or Henry Fonda; it was Bossy the Cow.,5.0
"Remember the Night. What a gripping film. It doesn’t kick so hard until the arrival at Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson’s house 45 minutes in, but it’s so good at setting up a powerful force field of home/family issues that the sleight-of-hand of Stanwyck’s reform seems almost plausible, happening as it does in the background. There’s a direct, solemn/sad emotionality in the film that doesn’t seem like Sturges. The script is brilliant though, full of slight smart digressions that establish and deepen the characters, so that no one seems a mere repository of the film’s (considerable) wit. Just wonderful.",0.0
"A Catch of a Thief
There are two moments in particular here that showcase the unparalleled greatness of Barbara Stanwyck. They both take place in the courtroom and neither involve her speaking. One is at the beginning of the film, the other at the end. The camera just lingers on her face as she processes some information and moves fluidly from one emotion to another, most of it playing out only in her eyes. It's more riveting than the soliloquies of Shakespeare or sports drama speeches. I sought this out in part because of Preston Sturges but in those moments I didn't care if there was any more witty repartee left. You simply cannot take your eyes off Barbara Stanwyck. She's a marvel.",4.5

"The greatest movie I’ve ever seen. A small mention this time for the lights in Stanwyck’s eyes during the “I’m afraid so” scene, which might be my favourite passage in the film. Or, indeed, in films full stop.",5.0
"The last film penned by Preston Sturges before he started directing. A complete reversal of Double Indemnity; instead of Barbara Stanwyck leading Fred MacMurray astray, it’s him steering her back towards all things good and wholesome. We all know going the other direction is more fun, but when it’s pulled off this slyly I can certainly stomach a little well-measured moralizing. 
At its heart it’s really a romance that just happens to use Christmas as a backdrop. Or maybe it’s more of a film about empathy that just happens to use romance as a vehicle for expressing that idea. Maybe that’s how Sturges and director Mitchell Leison manage to get down to the true spirit of the holiday without beating the viewer over the head with good tidings and merriment. 
To him, she’s just a crook. To her, he’s just a square. They come together for the holiday and learn to see each other as complete, complex human beings formed by circumstance and equally capable of good intentions and bad decisions. 
It sounds corny when put into words, and maybe it is, but the idea is smuggled into the movie in such a furtive way that one doesn’t much care. You’re so caught up watching the two leads fall in love—lost in the longing in Stanwyck’s eyes; charmed by the hapless wonderment on MacMurray’s face—you don’t notice that you’re also absorbing a Sunday School lesson about books and covers, and giving without thought of receiving.",4.0

Remember the Night criminally crackles with its scattered, fiery romantic light and comedic charm. underneath its cow-mooing, popover-baking, and jewellery-stealing merriment resides a nicely drawn Christmas celebration where families are not solely about blood relations but welcoming, accepting people. it's special. an it-plays-Easy-Living-in-one-scene special. however, other than its habit to harp on morality, it casually treats its black character, Rufus, poorly and breezily includes a woman-beater joke as if it can't be any more dated: “a woman, a dog, a hickory tree, the better you hit 'em, the better they be."" eyes roll. nonetheless, it is unforgettable for its astonishingly mesmeric finale. where these lovers' faces are mere inches apart, words of confessional affection blend with the shadows upon them as the music rises, a love unselfishly sweeping these moral grounds. Barbara Stanwyck is a shoplifter here, and she can sure steal my heart.",3.5
"Customs Official: And what is your reason for going through Canada?
John: I'm a fugitive from justice.
Lee: You sound like a fugitive from a nut house.
Customs Official: Go ahead, sir, go ahead.
Call it naïveté. Call it fantasy. But maybe it’s true many of us men just may sound like fugitives from nut houses when we’re in love. It’s possible my brain has already exhausted itself in two reviews: here and here. But frankly, Leisen and Sturges’ Christmas classic never grows whiskers and puts itself at a standstill where dreamy pastures take root and a whimsicality in romance achieves a spacious breathing room. The lawgiver meets the lawbreaker. Opposites attract by the goodwill of the former infusing a newfound form of life and love into the latter’s thieving heart. Listen to an episode Ben, Chris, and I did for this wintry fave of mine this season as you cozy up by the fireplace with some hot cocoa or maybe some good Cabernet as you also hear me fawn over Barbara Stanwyck once again.
Witness the gleaming brilliance of black and white photography and sense the sort of mystical element as brought forth by its beauty and introspection of the soul of individuals, as romance swirls and twirls in the airiness of Noël. Also, speaking of introspection, if you’ve already seen Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron, check out our new episode all about it right now! On Podbean, Spotify, Google, and Apple Podcasts.
This year’s Christmas Kino spree has begun on a path that seems right. 
May the rest of this Advent season continue with a spirit truly merry and bright.

"An act of charity on the part of hard-working assistant District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray)—arranging for bail for Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck), the shoplifter he's trying to put behind bars, so she could spend the holiday season out and about rather than behind bars—gradually transforms into an act of empathy when Sargent ends up taking Lee, who has nowhere else to stay, back home with him to Indiana for the holidays, in the process getting to know her better, starting to understand her troubled family background (in stark contrast to Sargent's own loving family), and eventually falling in love with her.
People are rarely as black-and-white as some—especially someone in Sargent's legal position—would perhaps like to think. In the end, though, love is, as ever, the great leveler: the irrational force that makes people do all sorts of crazy and dangerous things. Sometimes those crazy and dangerous things are genuinely noble as well.

"My favorite Christmas movie subgenre is the Barbara Stanwyck Doesn't Know What To Do With Cows subgenre.
That said, Remember the Night is no Christmas in Connecticut (1945). Barbara Stanwyck plays a petty thief who's invited home for the holidays--except it's not her home; it's the family home of her prosecuting attorney, played by Fred MacMurray. The story should be predictable from here, but Preston Sturges's screenplay and Mitchell Leisen's direction fit everything together so smoothly that every plot point feels completely natural and genuine.
MacMurray and Stanwyck are a great pair, but it's Stanwyck's show all the way. First of all, she's gorgeous; her whole style for this film is sleek and flattering. Secondly, her performance is just moving. She has a couple of moments when she's alone with her thoughts after being shown an unexpected kindness, and her defenses melt so completely and so subtly that it's hard not to tear up with her at the overwhelming tenderness of it all. Knowing that Stanwyck bounced around foster homes for most of her early life adds another layer of sympathy to her performance. I'm sure the subjects of home and family were just as bittersweet for her in real life as they are for Lee Leander, and I think that element of personal history occasionally shines through in the sensitivity she shows on screen.
I love the simple complexity of this film, too. On the surface, it's a straightforward redemption tale that might take some suspension of disbelief, but we're also consistently given insight into the different upbringings and lifestyles that produced the two main characters. Leisen generates his sympathy from the ground up--one person is not just independently good or bad. There are nurturing elements (or a lack thereof) that contribute to their personalities and behaviors, and fortunately, personalities and behaviors aren't set in stone. A brassy thief can soften just as easily as a stiff prosecutor can loosen up (and--thank goodness--just in time for Christmas).
Come to think of it, Remember the Night and another of my Christmas favorites, The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), have basically the same message: things don't always work out exactly the way you want, but that's okay. Both films are reassuring in their acknowledgement of difficulty, and they're reminders that problems can be solved, even if you have to get arrested three times first. I've found that a lot of Christmas films from the war years have a strangely uplifting quality even if they're not completely happy, and I think it's because they're tinged with the implicit recognition that good things aren't limited to peaceful times any more than they are to a perfect relationship or a clear-cut solution. Watching other people make the best of the worst on screen is an act of artistic compassion very much in keeping with the goodwill of the holiday season. I think that's what most frequently gives me the Warm Fuzzies in Christmas movies, anyway.
Considering how much I love Barbara Stanwyck, I can't believe I waited so long to watch Remember the Night, but it lives up to the hype in my books. It's funny, easygoing, and sentimental, with a dedicated cast, a sincere love story, and just enough realism to run the full gamut of emotions. It's touched with poignancy and a little heartbreak, but it never oversteps the bounds of holiday spirit open-heartedness. It'll make a worthwhile contribution to any watchlist, Christmas or otherwise.",4.5

"52 Years In 52 Weeks: 2023
I couldn't stay away from this intriguing looking selection for the Collab Film Club Christmas/New Year's theme. I'm a little late, but it's still kinda holiday time?
I had no idea Stanyck and MacMurray teamed up before Double Indemnity. You can see the chemistry building here. It's not as strong as electricity between the two in the Wilder noir, but you can see the potential.
The time period is very clear from the WPA sign. With Beulah Bondi as the Mom you can't help but compare the film to It's A Wonderful Life, which the film certainly has overlap with in the holiday department. Inconsequentially, WPA signs in movies make me think of Frank Capra anyway.
The more direct Christmas movie comparison is Stanwyck's Christmas In Connecticut, which some of you may know is a huge favorite of my family's. That scene when they wake up with the cow poking its head in the car is so C in C. Followed by the citizen's arrest. No shot Christmas In Connecticut's writers had not seen the 1940 film. Woah there Macushla!
Remember the Night doesn't compare in quality to the other Christmas films I've mentioned from this time period, but I still enjoyed watching it. Stanwyck always steals the show, and the noir style of the film is pleasing on the eye.

"Shouldn't this be called ""Remember That Night?""This Preston Sturges written script has a lot of quotable dialog....so much so that I started to wonder why this wasn't a better known established classic the way It Happened One Night or The Lady Eve are, and I think it's partly cause of the generic title (title like this is very easy to forget) and partly because of how much better known stars Fred MacMurray and Barbra Stanwick 's other movie together is. This movie could not be more different than Double Indemnity if it actively tried to be but this one came four years before that did (and according to the TCM intro of it more or less flopped upon release... apparently it was a January release which even back then was apparently regarded as a studio dumping ground)
This is a largely Christmas set unlikely road trip movie between a shoplifter played by Stanwick and the assistant district attorney trying to put her in jail played by MacMurray who feeling guilty over pulling a maneuver in court that would see this first time serial offender sitting in a jail cell over the Christmas break (it looked very much like the jury was getting ready to acquit her because of the Christmas spirit so MacMurray not wanting to lose pushes for more time for discovery or something so the case gets held over) MacMurray then bribes the bail bondsman to let her go for the holidays in his custody because of guilt cause he's a decent guy, and when it turns out she lives in the same small town his mother and aunt and cousin all live in, they go on the road together.
The movie is primarily an opposites attract rom-com with the cynical but guarded Stanwick trying to loosen up the straitlaced to a fault MacMurray (upon getting released into his custody she immediately complains that he's cheating her out of a decent holiday meal at the jailhouse....""I got no family, where am I gonna go?"") (""Well surely you must have family somewhere"") She does indeed have a mother tho when they go visiting her, it is maybe the most brutal mother daughter reunion you could imagine, the mother is terrible to Stanwick and so MacMurray extends the temporarily emotionally wrought Stanwick the offer to crash with his family thru the holidays which apparently extends to New Year's.
Even tho the dialogue here is crackling for the first half and the tone is sharp at times very sharp...the movie sorta shifts gears to be more of a sweet romance in the second half and even tho I had much preferred the sharper more sarcastic attitude filled first half, I will admit that the extent of the warm hearted nature of the second half is disarming enough that I even started to give in to the idea that the lawyer could fall for the woman he has to try and convict. In fact the irony of the movie's romantic angle working so well is that when at the very end it has to shift back to the two of them in the courtroom, it feels off somehow as if the movie itself doesn't even want to be here but they gotta wrap this story up. (The ending felt kinda odd to me, like the note it ends on is oddly dramatic for something that had been comedic and sweet for most of its runtime)
All that said I still really enjoyed it and think that the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable (we're lucky that a different studio saw fit to try to pair them up again several years after this had been forgotten by most people) it's that chemistry that keeps this alive and purring when it shifts from sarcastic comedy to a more conventional romance even tho you know that the plot of him trying to put her in jail has to kick back in at some point.",3.5

Extremely sweet and charming. Barbara Stanwyck ❤️",3.5
"I'm writing this on my phone like Andrew. Props to him, I hate this so it's gonna be shorter. I'm so slow and hit the wrong buttons like my grandma. Anyways.
Still can't get rid of Sturges as he wrote this Mitchell Leisen directed holiday romance starring, and I'm ready to pronounce my stance on this, the greatest actress of all time Barbara Stanwyck. I've praised her too many times for all the miniscule things so no bother going into that. Remember the Night is a sweet and melancholic film about acceptance, love and family. It's got a bit of a jarring structure going from a court film to a road movie then full on romance and finally going back to the courtroom. I can see why modern audiences can be put off by old Hollywood because the movies, at least many of these lesser known productions, are often far less dynamic and more episodic in nature. (The other usual complaint, acting, isn't a problem you run into with Stanwyck on-screen however).
Leisen and Sturges paint good character portraits though. The multifacetedness is presented through simplicity and ironic humour; every person has good and bad in them. We can't choose our family nor where we grow up geographically. Some are luckier than others but everyone needs love and compassion in their lives. It's a simple, small film with a lovely silhouette shot here and there. Didn't invest me the whole time but showed a lot of heart, good old melodrama and actually sad moments, ending on a bittersweet moment.",3.0
"Remember the Night (1940) when Fred MacMurray & Barbara Stanwyck first met? This was before Double Indemnity (1944) and their the feelings was more innocent then the sensual danger of their later acquaintance, as the Christmas flirt between state prosecutor and the thief starts on a road trip home for the holidays. And it becomes such a inspiring encounter that really takes over the heart once the end comes around. Lovely stuff.... with a tear lurking.",3.5
"Even for the era, anything to do with Rufus is so distasteful. It’s not even a doting white paternalism or a winking lampoon, it’s simply mean. At least the ever commanding Stanwyck is innocent of that, though.",3.5
"If you're ever looking for a melancholic Christmas story that still celebrates all the joys of life, this movie might be exactly what you're looking for. Working from a script that was written by Preston Sturges, what Mitchell Leisen brings forth in Remember the Night is a wholly pleasant and hits all the right bits with Sturges's often fast-paced and dense plotting down to the more soft and melancholic romantic bits. When it switches from the overt slapstick comedy to the melancholic romance, it also unveils something much darker and more complex.
Barbara Stanwyck remains about as legendary on the screen as she's ever been. Being the first pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray, you can only imagine the best is yet to come - especially knowing what the two of them would be going on to make much later, because the chemistry that the two of them exude on the screen is just extraordinary. Holiday classic, if there's anything else to be said.",4.0
"Yeah, yeah, Frank Capra, but here's the thing: despite his talents as a writer and director, Crapa films often make non-Americans gag with their onslaught of sentimentality. If you want a better blend of recognisable reality but also heightened sweetness with a dry wit, then Preston Sturges is your man. It's A Wonderful Life (1946) gets a run every Christmastime, but despite its iconic status, if we can be honest for just a moment, that movie is as cloying as it is uplifting. Remember the Night should get a run as an under-seen alternative to It's A Wonderful Life. (Perhaps it would have were its title not so similar to 1958's A Night to Remember, although nothing sinks in this film.) It's a more intimate tale where Barbara Stanwick's shoplifter Lee is busted but thanks to DA Jack (Fred MacMurray) not wanting the trial to interrupt the holiday period he comes up with a technicality to have it postponed into the new year. However he feels guilty about making this woman spend Christmas in gaol, so bribes his friend to get her bailed and then they take a drive to visit family in Indiana.
The opening courtroom scene is strange and clearly intended to be funny but isn't, however as the two hit the road the film finds its rhythm, the banter sharpens, they get into some amusing adventures, some painful history is revealed and soon enough the film had won my affections. (Almost) every character is beautifully drawn with only a handful of authorial brush strokes, Jack's family seems far more believable than most clans you see in movies, and the relationship between our two leads feels earned whereas so many other insta-love stories in contemporary films do not. As with Sturges' Sullivan's Travels (1941) the journey reveals multiple facets of the human condition, but all are handled with a deft touch and uncovered via crisp badinage.
Lee's lonely existence reminds us all that Christmastime is not always some Norman Rockwell painting or Frank Capra movie. Many people are alone or estranged from their families, and the relentless media focus on togetherness can be hard for many at this time of the year. So this film about the comfort of strangers in many ways resonates far more than generic emotional stocking stuffer, where everyone loves each other and you know that despite whatever contrived conflict all will be well be the end. I remember when I moved to Canada I was adopted by some acquaintences for Christmas dinner, we had a nice meal and then watched Natural Born Killers (1994). It's strange and a bit sad that I can't remember their names or where they lived, but isn't that how so much of life goes? Most of us don't live in a Norman Rockwell painting, so despite social conditioning to conform, many of us respond to less conventional tales of the holiday season. I doth declare the Die Hard (1988) meme has now run its course and so we can inaugurate a new slate of alternative Christmas movies. My new holy trinity will be In Bruges (2008), The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) and Remember the Night. Happy holidays, all.",3.5

"Once you get past the ripples of racism in the first 20 minutes and overlook the ludicrous notion of a moral, compassionate district attorney, this flies high.

"""It's been very interesting to meet you Mrs uh...""
""The name doesn't concern you.""
""It most certainly does not.""
A lighthearted movie in the beginning that seems to be heading towards the level of an all-timer screwball comedy, especially considering a screenplay by none other than Preston Sturges, until it makes a sharp left turn into a crushingly sad and poignant tale that's not quite melodrama but also not like anything else really. The tonal shifts are emphasized by Mitchell Leisen's direction, keeping things subtle with shot selection and not overwhelming the viewer with any kind of sentimentality, despite some unfortunate stereotype humor in the early goings. Stanwyck is the glue to the whole thing, going from wisecracking thief to wounded child at the drop of a hat; the relief in her eyes as she gets to celebrate a holiday with a real family is incredibly moving. Also incredibly moving is both of the stars trying to out-grand gesture each other at the end, making big and bold sacrifices to do the least amount of harm to the other one. But the Sturges touch is still ever-present, with big laughs still poking through for the duration, like when they cross the border into Canada by essentially telling the god-to-honest truth and the genteel Canadian border guards just letting them pass through.",4.5
"“Well I’m not exactly ugly” - Barbara Stanwyck, beautiful lady, fantastic actress, supporter of HUAC, lover of Ayn Rand, and the warm soul of this bittersweet Christmas romance concerned with the limits of charity.",4.0
"This is a tough one to rate, because I’m a sucker for romantic films and I’m a sucker for Barbara Stanwyck, but the first 40+ minutes of this film are really not very good. The lengthy courtroom scene in the beginning is silly, we see a lot of shambling from an African-American servant, and the premise of the film which unfolds – that a prosecutor (Fred MacMurray) would bail a defendant (Stanwyck) out and then drive across the country with her to Indiana – is ridiculous. The scene in the cow pasture they end up in one night before being hauled in before a small town judge is too. This is definitely a film where you’ll need to be patient.
The point at which MacMurray escorts Stanwyck to her estranged mother’s home and she turns to him and says “Gee, you’re sweet” in such a wonderfully authentic tone is where the film gets good. Stanwyck is a thief who is literally from the wrong side of the tracks, and the following scene which explains her difficult upbringing is quite good. Soon afterwards MacMurray takes her to his own home, where his loving family embrace her and act with incredible decency and kindness. His mother (Beulah Bondi) and aunt (Elizabeth Patterson) are such a sweet old pair, and a joy to watch. One of the points of the film is that the family we’re born into and the love we receive is so important in life, and I liked this message. Meanwhile, as you undoubtedly guess, Stanwyck and MacMurray begin falling for one another.
The romantic scenes are engaging, helped considerably by how attractive and talented Stanwyck and MacMurray are. Stanwyck lights up the screen from the minute she casts a sharp glance at MacMurray in the courtroom, and never lets up. I don’t for a second believe her as the product of a broken home and a grifter with a rap sheet – she simply doesn’t convey the necessary edge for that here – but the film isn’t really going for that. There is an underlying sweetness all around, and the scenes between Stanwyck and Bondi, which might have otherwise been full of suspicion on one side and defiance on the other, have none of that. Instead we see things like Bondi lacing Stanwyck into her old corset (“When I was young, we thought 19 [inch waste] was big”), and having rational heart to heart talks about the feelings that she sees developing. These scenes are just as good as those between Stanwyck and MacMurray.

"Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in their first screen partnership. A script penned by Preston Sturges. What more could you want? Well, how about a courtroom drama, a road movie, a slapstick comedy, and a thoughtful Christmas movie all rolled into one? Collectively, it’s a stack of filmic ingredients that proved too tantalising to pass by, and I have to say, I found the oddities of the film’s fanciful scenario every bit as appealing as its sound and well-earned sentiments. There is a plentiful supply of rosy, festive good cheer to be found here, but crucially, it isn’t plastered on too thick, and the film is otherwise very much grounded in the believability of its characters. The conceit that engineers our central romance—between a petty thief and the district attorney hired to prosecute her—is precisely that, but Sturges uses both the conscious absurdity of this setup and the inherent bias of the film’s Christmas-time setting to great effect. Our attorney, Jack Sargent, makes this bias known from the outset, when he gets Lee Leander’s shoplifting case postponed on a technicality in order to bypass the projected leniency of a holiday spirit-buoyed jury, knowing full well that their judgement is compromised by the fact they are making their verdict at this typically good-natured time of the year. Of course, Jack’s attempt to circumvent the very good spirit that threatens to undo this clear-cut case comes back to bite him when he gets swept up by the same spirit of Christmas himself. The jury were ready to acquit Lee for the sake of “peace and goodwill toward all”, and by the end of the film, Jack is more than willing to do the same.
It’s an obvious trajectory, but Sturges’ screenplay doesn’t succumb to the most obvious traps or outcomes. In fact, what follows is a curious mix of full-on farce, like a wonderful sequence where a stranded Jack and Lee get accosted by an overly-curious cow, and some disarmingly affecting and more melancholic asides that reflect on Lee’s troubled family life. Much of the narrative is built around Lee’s acceptance into Jack’s family home, after she is shunned by her estranged mother and has nowhere else to go. This welcome shown to Lee is genuinely touching, as it presents such a warm and palpable contrast to her own, much colder upbringing in a home that never offered her the same treatment. Stanwyck conveys the overwhelming emotions of being accepted in such a compassionate way so well, the camera often just lingering on her face as she quietly wells-up and observes the warmth displayed around her. It says everything about what her character has been through, and what she ultimately yearns for.
It’s this journey of acceptance that anchors the entire film, giving it the staying power it needs beyond just that typical Christmas movie desire to shamelessly pluck at our heartstrings. But the important distinction here is that nothing feels forced or overly manipulative in the way it so easily could have been. It helps when you’ve got someone as discerning as Preston Sturges providing the strings, and a director in Mitchell Leisen who clearly knew how best to pull them, all with an evident awareness for the lessons the former wanted to impart. It also helps that Stanwyck and MacMurray’s relationship is made to feel so believable. Romantic chemistry is a term that gets thrown about a lot, but it is so crucial if we are to fully invest in a screen relationship—and I doubt few who watch Stanwyck and MacMurray perform together could ever doubt that they had such chemistry in spades. When the pair gaze into each other’s eyes here amidst a raucous New Year’s Eve party, or when Lee stands before a mirror and despondently replies “I’m afraid so” when asked about her feelings towards Jack—we very much believe that their feelings for each other are true.
What caps this off even further is an ending that is both bittersweet and very well judged. Although we think we can see the film swinging towards an unrealistically happy resolution, about to throw in one last conceit to scupper the case and give the audience the “happy ever after” outcome they no doubt wanted, that’s not exactly what we get. Instead we get an ending in which Lee reckons with and accepts her past wrongdoings as a chance to repent and better herself, with a resolute Jack standing firmly by her side. To me, that’s a perfectly honest and realistic Christmas message to get behind if ever there was one.",4.0

"A rather sweet Christmas tale in which the spirit of the season reforms a shoplifter through the convoluted circumstance that allows her to spend the holidays with the lawyer in charge of prosecuting her. Not much more to it than that; there's good humor, beautiful imagery, and Barbara Stanwyck shows believable chemistry with Fred MacMurray. It's no wonder they would reunite a few years later in Double Indemnity. I appreciate their willingness to commit to a somber ending, avoiding the cheese that typically clings to this genre, though the writing on the wall was obvious once you recall this was made during the Hays Code years where crime never pays.
There's the typical naïvety of the era on display, chalking bad habits up to bad parenting and good morals to a Christian upbringing, but it was the ‘40s and it is what it is. Anything vying to have the audience sympathize with a crook is at least a little progressive, even if the approach is a tad simplistic. One trope I'm glad they avoided was having the girl fall back into her criminal behavior at an inopportune time to create drama. Once they reached the prosecutor's family farm, I was worried she was going to try to steal something, or someone would accuse her of doing so, and I'm glad they never even came close to that pitfall.

Get it while you can - and have a fantastic Christmas.",5.0
"Right and wrong are not universal concepts (in China they eat dogs, says Stanwyck) and in the same way being good or bad can give rise to different reflections and justifications.
Specifically, Stanwyck has never received love and therefore does not know how to give it. Her being a thief -even towards her mother- derives from this.
MacMurray's mother, unaware of Stanwyck's past with her mother, tells of how as a child Murray had stolen money from the house and then regretted it when he met love. Same Stanwych story, but she lacked the love to redeem herself.
A tender morality that decrees how love changes people positively.
The first time Stanwyck knows love she is overwhelmed. Not the love towards MacMurray, that comes as a result, but that of a warm family that makes you sad to get to the end of the day, and that pushes her to express her happiness by playing ""A perfect day"".
The Christmas atmosphere is so real in this palpable family intimacy made of recycled gifts and improvised MacMurray piano ballads. The presents opening is so intense without being pathetic, no one is really surprised by their presents, nor they pretend to be. It's just a routine gesture to share some affection.
(Stanwyck is surprised, but not so much for the gift as for the interest they show in her).
It's also amazing how the relationship between Murray and Stanwyck is born as an opposition to the will of the other.

Shortly before Christmas, assistant district attorney Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) takes up the prosecution of shoplifter Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck). Since jurys tend to be lenient before Christmas, Jack has the trial postponed, but asks a bondsman to bail Lee out. Thinking Jack has alternate motives, the bondsman then delivers Lee to his home ...
Remember the Night is a romantic comedy directed by Mitchell Leisen, and written by Preston Sturges.
This was the first on-screen pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray who would star in three more films together, the most famous being Double Indemnity (my review). And you can see why, because they have great chemistry together.
The movie is an endearing genre mix with elements of Christmas movie, romantic comedy, road movie and drama, very well written by Sturges and beautifully brought to life by its excellent cast, with a perfect ending.
While I do wish it had focused more on the comedic elements - it's greatest strength - Remember the Night is a very charming and delightful movie with two great leads, which can be funny, sentimental and even touching at times.",4.0

A prosecutor falling in love with a shoplifter over Christmas when he is supposed to try to send her to jail after the holidays is the kind of nonsensical claptrap that I can't stand. It's idiotic. Having Barbara Stanwyck in the role of the shoplifter changes things slightly though... it makes me wonder why it takes so long for the prosecutor to fall in love with her.
What's funny though is that the only other film I have seen thus far starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together is Double Indemnity, so seeing them here as decent human beings feels like an alternate reality.",4.0
"Certainly more sentimental than I've come to expect from a screenplay penned by Preston Sturges. This sentimentality generally avoids becoming cloying thankfully. The story is fairly predictable though not without it's surprising moments, most notably at the end. Sturges' patented wit is present throughout the film, but here he displays a sweetness he doesn't normally show. While I prefer his more cynical scripts, this movie is enjoyable for it's simple authenticity.
I would have scored it higher if not for the harmful black stereotype in the first portion of the film.",3.5
"Suppose you were starving to death and you didn't have any food and you didn't have any place to get anything. And there were some loaves of bread out in front of a market. Now remember, you're starving to death and the man's back was turned. Would you swipe one?
If I was starving, you bet I would
That's because you're honest. You see, I'd have a six-course dinner at a fancy restaurant across the street and then say I forgot my purse. Get the difference?

Remember the Night has made its way into regular rotation around the holidays thanks in no small part to the perfect balance of romance, humor, heartbreak and, at least on my end, Barbara Stanwyck.
I love every expression that Stanwyck makes which says so much without her speaking. Whether it's amazed amusement at her defense attorney Francis X. O'Leary (Willard Robertson, who I just found out today was actually a lawyer in real life) spinning a wild tale of how she stole a bracelet because she was hypnotized by it, or looking at the love between a mother and child that she never had or slowly realizing what's happening in court, you can see pages worth of words written on her face.
Of course Stanwyck's thief Lee Leander wouldn't work if she didn't have straight shooter DA Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) to play against. Jack has such an innate decency that he comes across as almost dumb but once we meet his family it's clear he was just sheltered because he had love and doesn't fully understand those who grew up without it.
Beulah Bondi gets Christmas movie mom MVP status playing Mrs. Sargent here and Ma Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life and her tightrope of being a kind and accepting woman but also giving a gentle warning and rebuke to Lee about how she and Jack can't be together because of how hard he worked to get where he is adds some amazing layers to what could have been a one note character. Same with Lee's mother (Georgia Caine) who is a believable harsh woman, as if she didn't get enough love and didn't know how to pass it along.
The whole supporting cast is great, from small town judges to goofy farmhands and I love how bittersweet it is all the way through, from the meet cute in court on opposite sides of the law to the misunderstanding of why Jack got Lee out of jail for Christmas until the trial resumes to the dinner in the city where the seeds of understanding are planted to the road trip where the two bond even more to the Christmas spent learning what's really important in life.
There's just as much joy as sadness in this great holiday film about family, belonging, love, acceptance and most importantly, how irresistible Barbara Stanwyck is.

I would usually brush past this film as I do many others just like it, but something stuck with me.

"It's true; one of my favorite discoveries this year and fast becoming my favorite holiday film besides A Christmas Story.
Remember the Night is the inferior of the bunch well made Christmas films in the 40s and should be treated at least in the same way like It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street.
Sadly, it's neglected, but, a hidden gem perfect at least for me. Its outstanding Preston Sturges screenplay works in every corner. The long courtroom scene is actually funny; when the leads found out they're both Hoosiers made my heart melt; Sterling Holloway sings ""A Perfect Day"" beautifully; Beulah Bondi's pep talk with Barbara Stanwyck; and the one perfect shot Niagara Falls scene. And dear God, that ending.
Watch out for Barbara Stanwyck. I love how Mitchell Leisen takes close-up shots of her face that matches enough with Sturges' lines making it seem impossible for me not be moved by it.
On the other hand, the cinematic relationship of Stanwyck's affairs with MacMurray would be a pretty interesting boxset DVD collection consisting of three titles: 
- Remember the Night (1940) directed by Mitchell Leisen and screenplay by Preston Sturges

- Double Indemnity (1944) written and directed by Billy Wilder with Raymond Chandler credited as screenwriter based on James M. Cain's novel.
- There's Always Tomorrow (1956) directed by Douglas Sirk and screenplay by Bernard Schoenfeld based on a novel written by Ursula Parrott.

"Smarter in the heartwarming plus affirmation category than It's A Wonderful Life; where Team Capra sees Bedford Falls and Pottersville as mutually-exclusive end-stages of communities shaped by the guiding genius of one singular person, Remember The Night proposes that they're coterminous possibilities, both already existing within the framework that society has built up for people to live in; which of those communities a person starts out from is a major factor in 'inequality of outcome,' alongside other factors that are in fact within the individual's control.
Also, feels! Leisen at his most meltingly romantic, the Hollywood narrative engine running at peak efficiency.

"I certainly enjoyed this film much more on this rewatch than the first time and I can´t say why. Preston Sturges, who wrote the screenplay, summarized the film the best by saying, “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” “Remember the Night” is not on the same level as the other two Stanwyck/ MacMurray collaborations I´ve seen, “Double Indemnity” and “There´s Always Tomorrow”, but it´s a mature and deeply affecting romance that lives from the sizzling chemistry of its leading duo. Barbara Stanwyck plays a thief, which is fitting because she steals the movie and my heart. Her confident screen presence, the sincere pathos of her performance, and the mesmerizing twinkle in her eyes make me swoon. Furthermore, the film features humor, warmth, and great visual direction. In particular, the scene with the Niagara Falls in the background is really pretty. “Remember the Night” is a graceful, melancholic Christmas classic that still warms your heart 8 decades after its release.
Fun Fact 1: One day when Preston Sturges visited the set, he told Barbara Stanwyck that he would write a screwball comedy for her. This film would become “The Lady Eve”.
Fun Fact 2: The film was completed eight days ahead of schedule and $50,000 under budget, which Leisen attributed to Stanwyck's professionalism, saying ""She never blew one line through the whole picture. She set that kind of pace and everybody worked harder, trying to outdo her.""",4.0
"I'm gobsmacked to come here and discover this is a universally-beloved classic. Well, I won't be bullied out of my original judgment. My apologies, but here is my dissident's report.
This movie has the illogic of a screwball comedy but none of the rapidity and wit. Leisen heavily altered the Preston Sturges script, removing much of the fast-paced screwball patter because he presumed that Fred MacMurray was only capable of quiet strength. The result is zany situations given a leaden presentation. (Sturges was so aghast at the treatment of his work that he was driven to start directing his own scripts.)
Take the early scene where a lawyer cooks up an implausible hypnosis defense. You can imagine this dialogue being rattled off by a smooth-talking slick-haired shark. Leisen instead assigns it to an old doddard. As the attorney drones on, we see the judge bored out of his mind and checking his watch, and we feel the same. And yet, when the jury reacts, we see them improbably won over! I don't think this scene makes sense at all given the acting and direction... the jurors seem impossibly dull-witted. The whole movie is like this. It's populated by a bunch of dullards, too slow for the silly situations to read as clever. Nearly every scene had people annoying me with their dunderheadedness in some way. Lee starts a fire in an office, and a woman throws water on a couple of men in there by mistake, but it's so languid and slow that it looks like she did it on purpose, not in panic. The men ignore Jack and Lee as they saunter out of the office, catching onto the fact that it was a distraction past the point of plausibility. Then we get a scene of supposedly-smart Jack wondering how the fire started.
And let's not get started on Jack imitating his house staff with some truly aggressive racism.
Nothing is quite as fatal as the fundamental premise though. A prosecuting attorney consorting with the defendant is so self-injurious and beyond the pale that it needs much more of a reasonable impetus than what we get here. Without much of a prod at all, Jack and Lee are immediately on a road trip. Maybe this is fine for a zany comedy, but this isn't shot like a zany comedy. They try to milk a cow and it's barely even playful because all the Sturges snappiness has been sloughed off.
I know that everyone's applause must be directed at the movie's second half when it goes full-on melodramatic. I doubt anyone would celebrate the movie if it ended after the first half hour. But I think the sentimentalism only has a chance of working if you ignore the set-up, and I can't. The reality of the movie is already broken. It's established a world of idiots.
Great shots of Niagara Falls though. Pretty funny that the Canadian border guards are given English accents.

"◘ Fred Toones' disastrously thankless character here is, even by the basement-low standards of 1940 Hollywood, treated in a remarkably mean-spirited and dehumanizing fashion. The usual boilerplate ""Ah, but Fred Astaire meant the blackface as a tribute"" or ""Sam the piano man is respected by everyone onscreen"" defenses don't even begin to apply here; this is just unadulterated minstrelsy.
◘ Stanwyck seems incapable of being anything less than a magnetic genius of a performer. I'm gradually warming to MacMurray-as-lead, but to say she acts circles around him is to drastically understate the matter.
◘ Seems like a whole lotta hoopla over the theft of a few rocks. I tell ya, the more I hear about this justice system you Americans have the more I don't care for it.",3.5
"”A fine district attorney you are.”
“You know I love you, don’t you?”
”Don’t say that…”
”Why shouldn’t I say that? Because some chiselling jeweller claims you swiped one of his bracelets?”
”I did swipe it.”
”The jury will tell you whether you took it or not.”
Though they don't know it at first, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) and John Sargeant (Fred MacMurray) were born and raised as near-neighbours – but have lived entirely different lives. She’s an habitual thief and he’s an attorney, which is why their paths have intersected. She’s stolen a bracelet from a jewellery store and he’s been assigned the task of prosecuting her case.
It’s a pretty nifty idea for a meet-cute but Remember the Night’s abiding strength is the simplicity of the story it tells.
Due to a technicality of John’s devising, Lee’s sentencing is postponed till after Christmas, which means she gets to spend the holidays in jail. Feeling sorry for her, John arranges to have her bailed. She’s duly delivered to his apartment, which wasn’t his intention. Still, it means they can have a bit of a chat and he learns that she originates from his neck of the woods and offers to take her home to visit her mother for the festive season. After all, he's already he's headed that way to stay with his mother, aunt and cousin. The journey by car is more circuitous than expected, which is a good plot contrivance because it allows the two main characters to become better acquainted. And so we learn how their relative upbringings led them to their present circumstances.
Stanwyck and MacMurray play beautifully off one another (it’s no surprise they would reunite thrice more). And though billed as a romantic-comedy, Remember the Night is not especially laugh-filled, although there are funny moments. Rather, it’s a very warm picture, one with a handful of characters that see the best in humanity, even petty felons like Lee. And this being the era of the Hays Code, the film has to end a certain way, which will probably leave modern-day viewers with very mixed feelings.
And though director Mitchell Leisen does a professional job – of servicing the script and facilitating the performances – I couldn’t help but wonder how it might have turned out if the writer had helmed it himself (which he’d go on to do, starting with his next screenplay).",0.0

"Barbara Stanwyck has quickly become one of my favorite actresses. There's something about her I find comforting. I don't know what it is or how else to describe it. There are other actors and actresses I feel this way about too, but most of them are in movies I grew up on. They are people I grew up watching. Cary Grant, James Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, etc. So I've always assumed that was why I felt that way about them. But Barbara Stanwyck I really only discovered a few years ago. I haven't even seen that many of her films. But that comforting feeling is there just the same. Maybe it's because she always seems so warm and genuine?
(Sorry, this is just what I was thinking about as I was watching the movie.) Anyway...
This film has flaws but it really is very sweet. Fred and Barbara were so good together. And the scene with Beulah Bondi and Barbara Stanwyck was both heartbreaking and touching.

"Sturges described this a ""love reformed her, and corrupted him"" which might be a little bit of an exaggeration, but since he wrote the screenplay, let's go with that. Stanwyck is Lee Leander, a petty thief caught stealing a bracelet, and MacMurray is John Sargent, a lawyer for the DA's office. When he tricks the defense attorney by insisting that his plea of hypnosis will require a stay, it leaves Lee stuck in jail over Christmas. Feeling a bit guilty, John arranges a bail bondsman to get her out, but the bondsman, assuming John wants her brought to him for a ""favor,"" dumps her off at his apartment.
Once John clears things up with Lee, he takes her to dinner, and finds out she, like John, is from Indiana, where he's headed for Christmas with his mother and aunt. I don't need to go any further, because of course they fall in love. John tells his mother why Lee is there with him, and she can't believe that Lee could be a thief, and she is treated like one of the family, but mom (Beulah Bondi) tells Lee how hard John worked to become a lawyer, and is worried that their relationship could cost him his job as a prosecutor. Lee agrees, but John loves her too much to allow her to be sent to jail, so he plans to find a way to get her off.
How it all works out is quite a pleasure, and a surprise for me, because I imagined some sort of tomfoolery would put them in each others arms to live happily ever after, but Sturges' script, and Mitchell Leisen's direction plays the ending like a violin. It's a charmer in every sense of the word.
I took off a half star because of the irritating ""yassur, Mr. Sargent"" nonsense forced on Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones, John's manservant. Also because he isn't listed in the credits by his name, but only as Snowflake. I hate it when that crap tarnishes an otherwise excellent film.

"I was all ready to give this 4.5 stars and Canonise it, but then the third act happened, and it kind of lost me. I won't deny that interesting stuff was done, especially in light of its being, you know, a Hollywood romance and all, and it's entirely possible I'll come to my senses and throw in that extra half-star eventually. But for a long time all the courtroom business seemed like it had just been a pretext to get these two people together for a not-quite-screwball caper, which meant that when Sturges brought it back into the story at the end I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit as though I'd been yanked this way and that by a script that couldn't quite make up its mind. Otherwise, this is immaculate stuff: I love how the visit to the mother gives the film a sharp kick of leaden seriousness manoeuvred into so smoothly there's never the remotest suggestion the filmmakers don't know exactly what they're doing despite the distinct variation in tone. And the segment at the family home is bliss, warmly sentimental without being cloying, cut as it is with Sturges's familiar sharp insight into the foibles of small-town folk, as well as a legitimately great Sterling Holloway performance.

"A fitting watch, given that we spent the day cutting a line across the Hoosier State en route to our Christmas destination in an attempt to outpace the Four Snowmen of the Blizzpocalypse set to wallop the Midwest.
Nothing chilling about this film though, save for its regressive depiction of race. No, this thing is full of warmth and holiday romance. A Stanwyk pairs lovely with a MacMurray, be it this wholesome, lighthearted, road-trip romp or the more acidic, black-hearted Double Indemnity. I suppose most people fall for this film at the same point Lee does Jack—while playing the piano for his mother, auntie, and cousin. “He really plays very well considering the size of his hands.” I bet he does. 
That scene comes on the heels of an unsettling one in which Lee’s mother, still vicious and bitter after all these years, declares she wants nothing to do with her. We get a glimpse of Lee’s upbringing and how it’s shaped the choices she’s made. Feed your mind lies, and it will believe them. If you’re told by those closest to you that you’re worthless and no good, you may very well act upon it. Contrast that with the kindness and affection Jack’s family heaps upon her; it’s only then that Lee’s icy exterior thaws, allowing her to view herself as worthy of love along with the faint outlines of new possibility.
Written by Sturges, there’s surprisingly little of the subversive, small-town satire which marks his other films. This depiction of the Midwest is tender and generous, a heartland full of genuine heart.

He's solid, he's not going to screw up, and he makes his stars look damn good. Barbara Stanwyck is pretty great here as a girl from a broken home who steals things - but is it nature or nurture? The story is predictable - if they aren't falling in love, then why am I even bothering to watch it? But damn if they don't sell it. She falls for his whole family of course, including the guy who later gives the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh, and his mom and ""aunt"", whom I've decided are a couple and you can't change my mind. On top of all that it's a Christmas movie, complete with Auld Lang Syne, and even Beulah Bondi, the same mom from It's a Wonderful Life, a movie I've watched countless times. Coming to this one and seeing it for the first time, that feels very unfair. I see a new holiday movie entering the rotation.",4.5
"I have actually watched this more than ""Double Indemnity"", and I believe it is because I don't want to loathe Babs, and with this film, I love her with all my heart. This is the kind of Stanwyck performance that just hits me right in the guts. A mother's rejection, seeing McMurray's family's love and warmth for each other, receiving gifts from that family, actually treated with kindness and affection, a mother's plea to let her son not ruin his career over her because of how hard he worked to get there, the realization that McMurray would throw his career away for her and refusing to let that happen on the stand, and making McMurray wait on a marriage proposal until after she serves her time in order to ""be square""...you feel all those emotions because Babs knew how to convey them. I still cannot just pretend that McMurray's treatment of his butler isn't wholly unpleasant and it hangs over the film. I think why I cannot embrace Preston Sturges like others is how he wrote characters like Rufus. The worst of these is when Fat Mike bursts into Sargent's apartment and presses the door on Rufus' neck...it's reprehensible. Watch any number of Sturges' films and it was always that ugly side that rubs me the wrong way.
Thankfully Rufus got a week to himself where he didn't have to deal with such ungrateful asses. Anyway, seeing Beulah Bondi pop up in another Christmas film is always a delight. And some of my favorite scenes are of her and Babs and with her sister at home during the holidays as Sterling Holloway moans and groans of the chores they stick him with.
Another Turner Classics must. I hate to say but this wasn't discovered by me during Robert Osborne's era, but Ben Mankiewicz was by then the lead host. A little later but I have to watch it every year on TCM...just unavoidable.",4.0
"Yule Logging 2023 #24
I must admit that Remember the Night is something of a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, it's a charming romantic comedy with a lot more Christmas spirit than some other movies I've seen this month. On the other hand, there are a few jarring elements that happen early.
For example, where Miracle on 34th Street climaxes with an overwrought courtroom scene, Remember the Night has one within 10 minutes. You see, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is on trial for stealing an expensive bracelet and trying to pawn it, her third strike. Her public defender has a reputation for theatrics, and this is no exception, putting forth a hypnosis defense in a way one would expect from a junior high school mock trial. Sensing an impending acquittal, because Christmas time, Assistant DA John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) gets a continuance until after the first of the year.
Feeling pity on the woman, Sargent bails her out, only to have the bondsman drop her on his doorstep, answered by the resident African American stereotype. (At this point, being surprised by such racism in old movies is like expecting Kirk Cameron to say something rational in Saving Christmas.) Finding out that both of them are Hoosiers, he hits upon the idea of taking her on his preplanned road trip so that both of them could see family.
That's essentially the superficial reading of the movie, when it's really more of a redemption arc for Lee. This arc becomes noticable in a hurry when we meet her mother, a foul woman who perhaps always looked like she was about to shit a cactus, one who seemed to plant a self-fulfilling prophecy into her daughter's head. Not a loving place, especially contrasted with Sargent's doting mother (Beulah Bondi).
This sounds like quite a trip for a love story, though it's hardly surprising given the talent behind the camera. This would be the last script written by Preston Sturges before he started to assume the director's chair himself, largely out of dissatisfaction at what he perceived as tinkering by director Mitchell Leisen, a man known for a fair amount of romanticism, and for driving writers to direct their own movies. Whomever was ultimately responsible, they remembered to give the characters enough dimension to make the audience care.
It should be noted that half of what makes this work are the two stars. For those whose frame of reference for Stanwyck and MacMurray is Double Indemnity (which was, ironically, directed by another man whom Leisen drove to directing, Hold Back the Dawn co-writer Billy Wilder) may be surprised that they can shoulder lighter material. Seriously, watch these two try to milk a cow after taking a wrong turn and try to reconcile that with anything that had Raymond Chandler's name on it.

P.S. Pardon me if I seem to be rambling, but where my reviews are concerned, it's been an unusually long holiday season, and it's wearing me down. Fortunately, there will be a few upcoming days where I'll be venturing outside of that, so there is relief in sight. For now, just forgive the aimlessness.",3.5
"If you ignore the racism and the fact that Jack should unequivocally be disbarred, it’s a quaint Christmas love story. Like a forerunner of an unhinged Hallmark movie.",4.0
"It’s really damn close to a ten. It’s basically top to bottom perfect. Stanwyck and MacMurray’s chemistry is as great as it could be. It’s one of the sweetest little Christmas movies I’ve ever seen. The supporting cast is just as good as the leads. It’s tight, it’s thoughtful, it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There are so many ideas and set pieces to where the relationship between the two leads feels completely earned and flows totally naturally. It’s basically a perfect movie. So what’s with the racist portrayal of Rufus? He’s not even in the movie that much, he could have easily been cut out. Ugh. This close to perfection.

"""People aren't responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls.""
In my opinion, this is equally as great of a classic romcom as IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT or BRINGING UP BABY or BALL OF FIRE. It might even be Barbara Stanwyck's single most charming performance.
Lee (Barbara Stanwyck) is a petty thief who is arrested for shoplifting a bracelet. She is sent to trial where the district attorney, Jack (Fred MacMurray), bails her out for the Christmas holiday and, after taking sympathy on her, offers to take her on a road trip to be with her family.
They go on a long trip that leads to various shenanigans, but also reveals that Lee comes from a cold and unloving mother (Georgia Kane). This one scene is really the lynchpin of the entire film, as it gives us a vision of Hell. And it makes the entire rest of the film feel much more uplifting in contrast.
Eventually the two spend the holidays with Jack's family, but all the while they are falling in love, yet both know she will likely be imprisoned once they go back and she will stand trial. We also see how both Lee and Jack had similar childhoods, growing up in towns not too far apart, and really the only difference between them was their upbringing, which set them on very different paths in life.
It's a heartfelt premise that has real maturity to it, and even though Jack does his best to rescue Lee, first by encouraging her to jump bail and then by trying to lose the case, I like that the film ends with Lee choosing to plead guilty, and even still, insisting on serving her sentence rather than allow Jack to rush into a marriage with her. It's a surprisingly mature ending, and I like that it treats crime and the justice system seriously.
REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a sweet little Christmas movie, and while it shows a charming romance between two likable leads, it also tackles other themes as well and shows that romance does not allow you to magically escape from all of life's problems as so many Hollywood films often do.",4.5
"There's a moment in the car, in a field with cows and a threshing machine, middle of the night while New York state attorney, McMurray, is eating his sandwich, where Stanwyck remembers she is set to go back to jail and so desperately hopes her mother will be happy to see her. Up to this point, she's been able to forget about jail for a while and has somewhat bonded with the attorney set to put her in jail January 3rd. She's not seen her mom in a while but they didn't exactly part on good terms and Stanwyck's kleptomania might derive from trauma of her childhood. All of this exposition, though, took me away from Stanwyck, in just a change in tone, voice, and her eyes, telling a story of such absolute disappoinment and anxious longing...fear of her mother's response to seeing her is of equal weight to a prison term. Stanwyck rivals this exceptional work later when she sees her disapproving mother and at the courthouse in her refusal to let McMurray purposely lose a case she felt was a slam dunk against her.
Nothing pains me more than when a weeping, heartaching Stanwyck tells McMurray she'd have been better off falling out of this tree, talking about a childhood near bad injury.
Beulah Bondi is my favorite Mother of the Christmas movies.
Oh, and I'm sure I'll incorporate fiddlesticks into my vocabulary on a regular basis.",4.5
"I must have had my curmudgeon pants on last night, because most of my friends liked the night’s second film written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen much more than I did.  This was Sturges’s last screenplay that was shot by another director as he began work on his first film as writer/director, The Great McGinty (which screens in the Sturges season next week), in the same year.
I was right there for the first half of the film which was funny, very cleverly paced and superbly acted.  Cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff begins with a brilliant close-up of a wrist with a diamond bracelet on and we realise from the background dialogue that this woman is trying on the bracelet in a jewellers that is busy because it is close to Christmas.  When she asks the sales assistant to get another bracelet from a lower shelf, she does a runner while he is distracted.  It turns out that she is recidivist thief, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) and she gets busted when she tries to pawn the bracelet before news of the theft can be circulated.
She goes to trial very quickly and, in some very funny courtroom scenes, her lawyer, Francis X. O’Leary (Willard Robertson), gets carried away and suggests to the jury that Lee was hypnotised by the sparkling jewels, walked out with them unknowingly, and hocked them to get bus fare to return them.  This plays into the hands of the Assistant DA who is prosecuting her, John “Jack” Sargeant (Fred MacMurray), who does not object to this fanciful story because it enables him to get an adjournment until the New Year - juries are not keen, apparently, to convict women in Christmas week.
Sturges and Leisen cleverly get around the dead hand of the Hays Code, twice (the second time comes in the Niagara Falls scene late in the film).  When Jack hears Lee complaining to her lawyer that this means she will have to spend Christmas in jail, he feels sorry for her and organises with bail bondsman, Fat Mike (Tom Kennedy), to post her bail.  Fat Mike clearly thinks that Jack intends to have sex with Lee and delivers her to Jack’s apartment. Lee clearly thinks the same thing but, once that is cleared up, agrees to have dinner with Jack before he sets off to spend Christmas with his family.  When Jack discovers that Lee grew up in Indiana, only a few miles from where he did, he offers to drop her off at her family’s place on his way by, even though she has not seen them in years.
Roadworks and fog on the drive see them getting lost and spending the night in Jack’s car in a field.  When the landowner, who has clearly pulled this scam before, drags them before a local JP who is in on the scam, Lee schools Jack on how to disguise who he is and sets fire to a wastepaper bin so they can escape.  Predictably, Lee’s mother (Georgia Caine) is a bitter and vindictive woman who wants nothing to do with Lee, whom she has written off years ago as an inveterate criminal.
What had, until that point, been a polished comedy with some social justice underpinnings, takes a sharp turn into cloying sentimentality.  Jack comforts a sobbing Lee and takes her home to spend Christmas with his family, his mother (Beulah Bondi), his aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), and his young adult cousin Willy (Sterling Holloway) who seems to have a mild intellectual disability (unless this is a joke about Hoosiers that I did not get).  His family immediately thinks that Lee and Jack are romantically involved but even when Jack tells his mother the full story, she still makes Lee welcome.  
The last part of the film, beginning with Jack’s mother’s late night chat with Lee on New Years Eve after she sees them kissing at midnight, is the classic “woman putting her needs/desires aside for the man she loves” trope.  I thought for a moment that Sturges/Leisen might be going to break the mould in a scene where Lee tells Jack that stealing is the only job she knows.  He says that, once he marries her, she will have a full time job - cooking for and keeping house for him.  The look Lee gives him suggests that a stint in the women’s prison might be a more alluring career prospect, but the moment passes and, apart from a possible night together at Niagara Falls, the plot settles down to its three-handkie conclusion.
Stanwyck and McMurray stop this from being saccharine dross, but they have to work hard to do it.  Sturges was unhappy that Leisen altered his screenplay to move the focus from Jack to Lee and made the Jack character more subdued and less dashing than the character Sturges had written.  That seems like very astute changes as they played to the actors’ strengths.  Stanwyck is wonderful here and totally capable of carrying the movie.  Stanwyck and McMurray would go on to make three more films together, including Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in a really tough year.
Unsurprisingly, this film does not knock Sean Baker’s Tangerine (2015) out of its spot as my go-to Christmas Eve movie.",3.5
"There’s a sequence a third of the way into the movie when district attorney Fred MacMurray has brought a shoplifter whom he ’s prosecuting – played by Barbara Stanwyck – home for Christmas to a small town in Indiana (don’t ask — it’s a Preston Sturges script from 1939). She came from a broken home and has never experienced any true love. And now she gets the opportunity to witness a real family enacting the Christmas spirit for the first time. MacMurray sits down at the piano to plod through a stodgy rendition of “The Old Folks at Home,” while his mother, his aunt, and their hired hand listen attentively — adoringly, even — even though he can barely stay in key. Then Stanwyck, getting into the Christmas spirit herself, sits down at the piano, and she and the hired hand — a towheaded dimwit — improvise a surprisingly moving rendition of “A Perfect Day,” and as Leisen cuts to a close-up of Stanwyck and the whole family joins together in song – “Do you think what the end of a perfect day/Can mean to a tired heart,/When the sun goes down with a flaming ray,/And the dear friends have to part?” – we realize that she’s fallen in love – not with MacMurray so much as with the fuzzy notion that an ideal world of pure love might actually exist somewhere out here in the real world, the perfect theme for a Christmas film. It’s a small moment, but it hints at a depth of character and ideas that a smart screenwriter can achieve without a word of dialogue.
Later, there’s another great sequence. MacMurray’s old mother — played perfectly by Beulah Bondi, one of my favorite old Hollywood character actors (up there with Eugene Pallette, (seriously, she’s that good)) — who’s the salt of the earth, who’s never had a nasty thought in her life, the kind of person who accepts Stanwyck into her home with unquestioning love, invites herself into Stanwyck’s bedroom to have a woman-to-woman talk. Earlier that evening, she’d seen her son kiss Stanwyck at a barn dance. And now, unexpectedly, instead of telling her how happy she is to welcome her to the family, she explains instead that given how hard MacMurray has worked to climb out of poverty to get where he is, they shouldn’t do anything to spoil his success for him. And Stanwyck, catching the hint, decides to perform the noble role and agrees that she won’t do anything to continue leading him on. A bitter and cruel scene, in which this old lady overflowing with humanity has essentially told Stanwyck that she’s a gross slut unworthy of her son, a scene that’s made all the more powerful because Bondi plays it with such tenderness and generosity, suggesting to us that the family ideal that Stanwyck evoked in song earlier has always been merely a façade, a mask for a world that’s just as calculated and striving as the one she’s been trying to escape.
For the rest of the movie, Stanwyck follows Bondi’s advice and pushes MacMurray aside – including an amazing scene at Niagara Falls with some of the most beautiful rear-projection I have ever seen – and Mitchell Leisen lights her so that her iridescent, watery eyes throw back the anguish of the world.
I watched this alone in my mother’s apartment in Washington DC on Christmas Eve, the night that we Scandinavians actually celebrate Jesus’ birth. My mother had gone to church after dinner to sing in the choir for the evening service, and though she hinted that I could join them if I wanted, I decided to stay home. I haven’t been to a service in more than twenty years and I didn’t want to jinx anything by ruining my streak. Mom would never say anything out loud, of course (she’s Norwegian-American, after all) but I could tell she would’ve liked it if I had come. But then she has her faith and I have mine.
The movies — especially old Hollywood movies, with their emotional register that strikes so many people today as sentimental —serve the same purpose for me as the church once did when I was young: it’s a window onto the world and thus a window onto the self, a reprieve from the world and the self but also an uncomfortable reminder of the insoluble imperfections of both.
Sturges and Leisen stage the final scene in a holding cell after a trial in which Stanwyck has admitted her guilt so that she’ll be sent to prison to save MacMurray from her inherent sinfulness. Appropriately for a Christmas movie, the story is about the idea of redemption. And yet, its happy ending is leeched through with darkness and uncertainty. Recall the title of the film. We can forgive, yes, but to what end? Will this forgiveness lead to any reformation or just another cycle of judgment and shame? A wonderfully jaded – but, admittedly, dimly hopeful – Christian parable.
I saw this movie for the first and only time about twenty years ago on VHS when I was going through my rebellious post-college Makavejev and Warhol phase. I don’t think I was old enough or wise enough to really get it back then.

"Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, both best known for their sordid romance in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, prove that their chemistry isn’t just limited to sleazy film noir. In this Christmas romance, the duo quickly embark on the most charming of festive adventures.
After one of the more peculiar meet-cutes we’ve seen, the connection between the stars is almost instant. They flirt so naturally; their feelings are born out of honesty, and strength of character - a rare thing to see in romantic comedies of any era. Stanwyck is especially skilful at conveying all the passion bubbling away beneath the surface. Her subtlety is aided by the beautiful, intimate black and white imagery. This is one of the most gorgeous looking rom-coms I can think of. Director Mitchell Leisen really knows how to make his leading actresses light up the screen. He shoots Stanwyck to perfection nearly every time, as she once again proves she can do no wrong. Preston Sturges’ screenplay is rife with layered flirtations, and fills the story with quirky side characters, before giving way to a more melancholy final third. By the time the inevitable rolls around, it’s infinitely more moving than the early, lighthearted antics might indicate. This has instantly become one of my favourite Christmas classics.",4.5
"Not quite sure what I was expecting from this film, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to be as moving and cathartic as it is. Stanwyck is, as always, excellent at conveying her character's vulnerability beneath her steely façade and her chemistry with MacMurray—a collaboration that would go on to give us several more cinematic gifts—is blazing. Early on, it might feel like Remember the Night is marching towards an inevitable finale. Yet, not only does the film eschew a predictable outcome, but it is so engaging throughout that one almost forgets its plot will need a resolution at all.

Which winds up including a trip back to Indiana to their respective homes with lessons about family and how different that word can be from one person to the next.

Fred MacMurray is an assistant DA who just really wants to get home to his mom and aunt (Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson). He pulls a trick so the case gets bound over till after New Year's and in a plot contrivance that is nonsensical, but necessary, ends up putting up the bail for Stanwyck and driving her home to Indiana.

This is a really lovely film, and it's fascinating to see Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together in a story where they can fall for each other honestly and sweetly without the additional cynicism that Double Indemnity throws in (great as it is) - they're brilliant together here, and brilliant individually too.
The two of them are thrown together in a legally questionable but extremely entertaining fashion - he's the lawyer trying to send her to jail, she's the repeat offender with a heart of gold - and before you know it, he's taking her home to meet his family, who inexplicably live with Winnie The Pooh (or maybe just the guy who did his voice, but whatever) and they're just as swept away by her as I was, and presumably most viewers would be. Who cares if she's a thief? She's Barbara bloody Stanwyck. The way their relationship evolves is full of fun and surprises, and it's all warm and fuzzy in a very Christmassy way.

I just can’t warm up to him? I think that did affect my rating to a degree. But the final half of the film was definitely better! The themes of acceptance and redemption are so perfect for the Christmas season and leave you with such a cozy feeling. But there is also the bittersweet message of learning from one’s actions and facing the consequences. I’ll definitely rewatch this next year and hopefully I will be kinder to it the second time around!",3.5
"Fred MacMurray brings some real “Gee shucks, that’s swell!” energy to the role of prosecutor, while Barbara Stanwyck is her usual slinky, sophisticated self - this time a jewel thief - in this improbable romance between lawyer and crook. 
I gotta tell you, the inclusion of a racist caricature (the stuttering fool) as the lawyer’s servant really knocked this down a few pegs for me. Yes, 1940, but there are plenty of films of the time that portrayed black people in roles of domestic servitude without making them the butt of a joke (or several jokes, none of which were funny). I also found it jarring the way our leading man goes from an uptight man of virtue to one willing to break the law and take a huge chance on destroying his career over a woman he just met, almost overnight. I get that’s the whole point of the movie, the way this unlikely couple falls in love, but the change that comes over him feels so abrupt, and with a few tweaks - even just one more scene of our pair talking where it appears to dawn on him that he’s falling for her - it could have been more believable. 
Outside of these things, I did actually enjoy the film. And let’s be honest, I *probably* wasn’t going to *love* a romantic comedy any way.

"The climax of this film makes us realize how human we are underneath all that talk and bluster. Despite the obvious moral conundrums, love triumphs over everything. We can't but want them together.
Remember the Night is a charming romance. It takes a lukewarm first act to get things into motion. But right from the start of the road trip, the chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck's Lee Leander and Fred MacMurray's Jack Sargent works wonders. The gags are simple but propel the story as well as the characters forward.
What is Christmas but a celebration of the good things we are thankful for. After seeing a cold family reception from Lee's mother, Jack's family feels royal. I would be surprised if any woman doesn't fall in love with Jack after this treat. Written by Preston Sturges, the film has all the trademark Sturges traits. There is a charming romance, funny gags, stereotypical side characters, and a clueless person in power. But what sets Sturges apart from the rest of his contemporaries is the lovable characters who are more flesh and blood rather than creatures on paper.
The cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff really shines in two scenes. The first is the famous Niagara Falls sequence. Any one who has seen Niagara from both sides of the border mentions that the Canadian side has the best view and it's great that the filmmakers managed to write the screenplay to let them have the best time of their life with the best view of the best falls. The second scene is the New Year celebrations. The shot that especially registers is the wide shot that pans to reveal a couple hiding on the stairs.
Barbara Stanwyck was the quintessential survivor of the biggest transformation in cinema. Over her prolific career, she was part of silent films, musicals, screwball comedies, early rom-coms, noirs, and westerns. Stanwyck has a deep voice that at times is in conflict with her younger-than-age appearance. But what really sets her apart is her demeanor. She can appear innocent in one film and domineering in the next. This shapeshifting boon is the reason she was able to navigate the transition from silent to sound which many greats could never manage to do.

"1st point: Fred MacMurray could act and he does a fine job in this Christmas-time movie.
2nd point (having watched The Palm Beach Story the day before): what a contrast Fred & Barbara Stanwyck make from Colbert and McCrea (who give lifeless performances and have no chemistry in their pairing).
Actually, the acting just by Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson herein outclasses the entire Palm Beach production. (And Stanwyck is far better in this than in Christmas in Connecticut.)
MacMurray's character does engage in questionable ethics at one point herein (and should have recused himself from a particular legal case) so I cannot see how this can merit a 5 or even 4.5 star rating, but it is a well made production, with accomplished acting, respectable camera-work and above average dialogue.

"Utterly charming and cleverly written, Remember the Night features Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in the first of their four film pairings. The script was written by Preston Sturges, and he became so incensed at changes director Mitchell Liesen made to his carefully penned story that Sturges began directing his own films. Interestingly, this is the same reaction that Billy Wilder had after working with Liesen as writer on Hold Back the Dawn. Whatever Sturges's concerns, Remember the Night is wonderfully structured, has some terrific lines, and is beautifully shot.",4.0

"“Remember the Night” is a fairly odd mix of courtroom drama, road movie, and romantic comedy with a far-fetched premise and a plot that made me scratch my head a few times. That being said, the witty and heartfelt Preston Sturges script definitely has its moments and the dazzling Barbara Stanwyck swept me off my feet. Her range is incredible, as she seamlessly switches between comedic, romantic, and dramatic modes. She teams up with her future “Double Indemnity” screen partner Fred MacMurray, but this time they play decent people (if you ignore the shoplifting). The two have cute chemistry, though I like MacMurray more when his characters have a slimy edge. I think the last act stumbles a bit towards its finale but overall, “Remember the Night” is a sweet and endearing Christmas movie that combines lighthearted comedy and sentimental melodrama.",3.0
"That’s more like it! I guess Leisen just needed to helm a holiday romantic drama instead of a screwball comedy for his gifts to really shine, reworking and streamlining Preston Sturges script into a spry <95 min there-and-back-again structure that smartly foregrounds the romance over the comedy. The right amount of wit still remains, but with a real sense of weight to proceedings that even Sturges rarely made approached. The film satirizes and celebrates small-town middle-America in ways both funny and perceptive, especially in how it contrasts the effects familial love (and lack thereof) have on the development and eventual character people have—yet it doesn’t use the lack of love Stanwyck’s character received as a child as an excuse for her criminal behaviour, but takes her on an arc of moral progress through the treatment MacMurray’s family shows her without becoming moralizing (in a heavy-handed way, at least). It helps that MacMurray and especially Stanwyck are just absurdly great, and in an entirely different register than their iconic pairing in Double Indemnity—Stanwyck’s turn here should be included alongside the great acting-with-their-eyes-that-says-more-than-the-dialogue performances. Really wish there wasn’t that…let’s say, insensitive racial caricature in the first act; it’s a big yikes that distorts and almost perfect film.",4.5

"“Remember the Night” is one of those unheralded movies that’s not talked about as much as it should be. 
The first pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray and they had chemistry right from the start. 
This movie manages to find the right mix of sentimentalism, charm and realism which makes it easier for the audience to believe the situation that the characters are in and how is plausible that the two different characters will fall for each other. 
Moved to pity by the Christmas season, an Assistant DA (Fred McMurray) bails out a shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) and offers her a ride to her mom’s home in Indiana. On the road, they get to know each other, their families and fall in love. 
Even the ending is perfect as the movie doesn’t go for the expected happy ending. 
Highly recommended!",4.0
"The story is a little crazy, but that didn’t prevent me from liking it! I loved the roadtrip scenes of Stanwyck and McMurray, from searching for directions to ending up milking a cow. And that’s all before Christmas is celebrated! There was something really sweet about watching a Christmas morning in 1939. It was so simple, yet still so beautiful. It humbled me, and reminded me that Christmas is so much more than receiving gifts. 
Barbara Stanwyck was so great in this. I’ve had a hard time liking her in the past because she always seems to play these villainous/dislikable characters, but I can’t complain here! Fred McMurray is a cheese, but I still like the guy. I’m glad to discover another great black and white Christmas movie!",4.0
"☀️ Christmas in July 🎄 - 'Tis NOT the Season - Movie #23
An attorney brings home a shoplifter to his family for the holidays.
I've meant to save this movie for my November/December watchlist, but my curiosity got the best of me. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray make quite the team together, it's no wonder that they were duo for three more movies. All the moments spent together at the sergeant's house were warm and lovely. And of course, the scene at Niagara Falls brought all the feels next to that ambiguous ending. Dammit morse code showed no mercy in 1940. I can't believe that I've never seen this movie before but now it's placed on to the Holiday Favorites list. A nice discovery for Christmas in July, although I'd imagine this would hit so much harder around the colder months. Minus the casual racism on Rufus, the black character, lovely movie. Equal parts sad and melancholy yet charming.
And what a surprise Sterling Holloway was in this (Winnie the Pooh) and he has quite the singing voice too!
How Christmassy is it: There was some Christmas scenes at the house, Christmas decor, brief snowfall, family gatherings, and a New Year's Party at the barn thrown for good measure.

"A film that earns its warmth precisely because of the bracing blasts of cold. Case in point: Jack’s salt-of-the-earth family is heart-meltingly gracious to Lee (who they correctly recognize as his love interest before he does), acutely aware of her lack of a loving family. Which makes Jack’s mother’s gentle, last-minute pleading for Lee not to taint her son all the more devastating. The same goes for Lee’s ill-fated visit to her estranged mother, a rejection as painful as any ostensible comedy would dare. At every turn I was disarmed by the sensitivity of Preston Sturges’ script; each complication is treated with the gravity of drama rather than comedy, and potential stock characters are gifted with uncommon depth. Stanwyck especially digs into her character’s pain without losing any of her delicious wit.
Not that this isn’t funny. Sturges devotes one of the very first scenes to a defense lawyer’s lengthy, increasingly ludicrous performance for the jury, and I adored moments like Sterling Holloway’s Jack McBrayer-style cowpoke revealing a beautiful singing voice. Everyone gets their share of snappy lines, though Remember the Night isn’t in quite the same register as Sturges’ take-no-prisoners comedies. That’s likely due to director Mitchell Leisen, who brings a more restrained tone as well as a lovely visual elegance. In hindsight, it’s all in preparation for the gut-punch of an ending, where each character gets their own gesture that's as hopeful as it is bittersweet. Not bad for sharing space with a goofy cow-milking scene.",4.5

"Hardly feels like a Christmas movie, and the ending is mildly infuriating, but Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are absolutely hypnotizing. The defense attorney's (Willard Robertson) performance in the courtroom was a real hoot, and reminded me of the ridiculous discourse around Brendan Fraser's performance in Killers of the Flower Moon - an attorney's job is to perform, and Robertson and Fraser both understood that.",3.5
"Gosh, the way the tears twinkle in Barbara Stanwyck's eyes, like angel hair on a Christmas tree, absolute magic. Wonderful script by Preston Sturges - everything is so cleverly interwoven, and all the stuff about hand-holding, you can sweep me off the floor.",4.5
"Remember the Night is warm, witty comedy. Though, it is a lot sadder than I remember it being. It drifts between a screwball set-up and into a pure romantic drama, but it is earthed by darkness and sadness. The unrelenting gothic scene of Barbara Stanwyck visiting her mother lingers like gloom on everything after.
However, I do not think that it is any surprise that Preston Sturges is credited as the screenwriter because the film has a lot of his first-class dialogue. It runs towards sentimental in the second half, but the tremendous performances from the peerless Barbara Stanwyck, and Fred MacMurray keep it fresh and watchable.
A Christmas film par excellence, that deserves to be switched into the Christmas film rotation. A little sadder, a little more saccharine, a little more romantic and a little funnier than most films of the season.
Remember the Night is a film for anyone that thinks MacMurray is only good in Billy Wilder films playing against type. Playing to type here, as the good-natured, intelligent lawyer, MacMurray is superb. But as with any film she is in, Stanwyck steals it, and with ease. Bottled lightning. She is one of the great actresses. It may not have the verve of her early pre-code performances in Night Nurse or Baby Face; nor is she quite as good as she was in, say, The Lady Eve or Double Indemnity, but this is a great turn, that is surprisingly emotionally resonant, for a film that starts so funny. Again the scene between Stanwyck and her mother is one of the best Stanwyck scenes I have seen. And that is high praise indeed.
Remember the Night is a really great film. A top studio product, from Mitchell Leisen.",4.5

"'You don't have to be a horse to judge a horse show.'
Another sublime Preston Sturges script delivered in typically elegant fashion by Mitchell Leisen, delicately balancing cynicism with warmth and humour without ever getting bogged down by sentimentality,Remember the Night is a genuine Hollywood Christmas classic, though sadly it now seems forgotten compared to the likes of Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were a superb screen pairing, probably best remembered for their scandalous affair in Double Indemnity, though here Stanwyck is in total opposition to her famous femma fatale persona, putting in a heart-breaking performance as a shoplifter with such disarming tenderness that you can't help falling for her too.
Leisen is fast becoming the greatest screen romanticist after Borzage in my estimations, a director able to stage his scenes with the utmost beauty and sensitivity that the production design itself seems to carry more importance than the story—it may well have been funnier with Sturges behind the camera directing his own script, but his more contentious style would likely have dampened the romantic milieu that is so wonderfully maintained here, the attention to detail in regards to lighting and props is always taken into thoughtful consideration.
There is an unfortunately stereotypical portrayal of Fred Toones' black servant character, who MacMurray treats with what seems like contempt and irritability, making his character more difficult to like, though aside from this there are very few, if any other missteps in this utterly charming romantic comedy—the road trip sequence is a memorable standout, the two leads beginning to fall in love as they get lost and wake up in the middle of a field of cows, which they naturally decide to milk and get dragged to court by the farmer. There are scenes of such warmth and comfort—Lee meeting John's family, who are in total contrast to her cold and uncaring mother, turning her own daughter away in the film's darkest moment.

"Part Christmas movie, part courtroom drama, part road tripper, part romance, and it does it all well! It's a shame Preston Sturges couldn't write every Barbara Stanwyck role: his sharp wit rolls off her tongue with such ease. That chilly Indiana countryside is a studio construction, sure, but it could've only been filmed by someone with an intimate knowledge of what a gray Midwestern winter feels like (director Mitchell Leisen was born in the UP). I know I say this every time, but this ranks up there with the best Stanwyck performances.

Four years before they sizzled in one of the greatest noirs of all time, Stanwyck and Macmurray burnt up the screen in one of the most romantic films i have ever seen.

I don't know how she does it, but there are times when Stanwyck is looking at MacMurray and her eyes are legit twinkling. Maybe it's because sometimes there are tears in her eyes so it creates a shimmering effect, or maybe it's because she's just one of the damn best.

"The part where Barbara Stanwyk is just gazing, open mouthed at Fred MacMurray’s extremely American protestant family celebrate xmas by holding hands, and singing songs, and talking about all their fun midwestern traditions, I honestly thought she was going to run out of the house screaming or be further driven into her scammy criminal mindset and enact some sort of sad revenge on these people for being too normal and happy, but I realized quickly that this was just my own inner Grinch, and that of course, in reality she’d be charmed by these very kind women who raised a good-hearted and extremely racist District Attorney.
It reminded me of years ago when I had allowed my inner Grinch out while playing keyboards in a goth band. It was around the holidays and we were rehearsing in a garage. Even though it was very cold at the time, I felt comfortable there. I was in a safe space, surrounded by other people like me. People who’d devoted their lives, or at least their free time, to the darkness. People who lived outside the constraints of normal, sunny society. People who wore dark eyeliner, and knew where the orchestral setting on the keyboard was, and had seen The Crow. I was so comfortable that I off-handedly mentioned that I don’t like Thanksgiving or xmas. Something, at the time, that I really didn’t think was a big deal. I was very naive. My bandmates' faces dropped. I felt immediately ostracized. An outcast even among the outcasts. In trying to convince me that I was wrong, the singer said to me, “It’s not that you don’t like the holidays, you just have a bad relationship with your family.” I was an adult playing keyboards in a goth band in a garage in New Jersey, I obviously didn’t have a great relationship with my family. It wasn’t until weeks later that I remembered that goths love xmas because of their hero Jack Skellington and that I had basically committed blasphemy against him.
If only my bandmates had welcomed me into their familial homes for the holidays like I was Barbara Stanwyk. I could've finally felt the xmas spirit in my heart.
Some really good jokes in this. The defense attorney’s opening statement - which feels like a typical Preston Sturgess thing where he lets a bit with a single joke go on for 10 straight minutes - is v funny. I also guffawed sadly at the pretty bleak and I’m assuming Hays Code enforced ending that makes the whole movie feel, I think, even more subversive than intended.",4.0
I wonder how many women tried stealing something after watching this movie? After all you will end up with Fred MacMurray!,5.0
"This is a surprisingly tender film given its initial premise, and it might be Barbara Stanwyck's best performance. A soft-hearted DA feels bad about a career jewel thief spending Christmas in jail so he pays the woman's bond, and they end up embarking on a poignant roadtrip together to visit their families for the holidays and predictably fall in love. I really had no idea where this film was going for most of it and was not expecting the ending at all.
Stanwyck begins the film as her typical comedic bad-girl persona, though we hardly hear a line from her for at least the first fifteen minutes of the film. We open on her wrist donning an expensive bracelet. The wrist leaves the frame. Next we see her at a distance, rushing down the avenue to pawn the bracelet. She enters a pawn shop but the camera remains outside on the street, just peeking through the doorway where we see her exchange muted words with the pawnbroker. He knows something is up, and closes the door on us. Next thing we know we're in the courtroom where she stands trial. For the next ten minutes we get a monologue from her defense lawyer addressing the jury. We've yet to hear Stanywck really say anything, but as the camera continuously cuts to her during the monologue, we get her facial reactions - surprised yet impressed by her lawyer's ridiculous yarn - which are brilliant and hilarious - silent acting at its finest.
Then we mostly get Stanwyck being Stanwyck - full of moxie and wit and seemingly self-assured. We even get a great scene with Stanwyck acting alongside an adorable cow that deserves some sort of animal Oscar, if only to acknowledge the poor debasement the animal was subjected to for the scene. The film changes gears around the midway point when we meet her estranged mother - a miserable figure who has denounced her daughter and won't accept the young woman back into her life. Stanwyck and MacMurray then go visit his family - the polar opposite - and it's here that Stanwyck is smothered with kindness and produces one of her finest performances.
The subtle discomfort that Stanwyck displays when around MacMurray's family, the fact that she has never been around such kind people and it almost makes her feel worse about herself, is expressed entirely through Stanwyck's eyes, fleeting glances at the warm, accommodating people she's surrounded by. When Stanwyck is left alone, she finds herself overwhelmed with emotion, coming to tears as she grapples with what she's being offered, and whether or not she even deserves this.
The ending is phenomenal. While upholding the standards of the Hays Code, the film manages to both punish Stanyck's character as a thief, while still allowing her to ""redeem"" herself and continue to garner our sympathies. It ends in a jail cell - with a kiss and an embrace - one of overwhelming passion. I wasn't expecting it to end there, but then the credits rolled and I realized I was pleasantly satisfied.
Some of the cinematography in this film is out of sight - particularly the interior shots of the homes in Indiana - the lighting and shadows have noir vibes. And the penultimate scene at Niagara Falls - whether or not that was a set - the Falls frozen in winter, Stanwyck and MacMurray silhouetted against it, is a brilliant image.
My only complaint with this film is that MacMurray makes for a poor Boy Next Door. He's best playing toxic skeezeballs. I had trouble taking him seriously as a mama's boy from Indiana, and he doesn't quite have the right charm that this role required. But it didn't really detract from my enjoyment at all, and I wonder if I hadn't already seen him in Double Indemnity and The Apartment that I would have felt the same.
Another note: This is a Preston Sturgess script. I've been watching a number of Sturgess films lately and I've noticed one thing that stands out in his stories - the presence of Black actors. Now, the depictions in these stories is rarely flattering by any means, but when you start to realize that all the screwball comedies penned by Sturgess have Black actors - who are primarily absent in almost all other screwball films of the era - you start to wonder what Sturgess's intent was through their inclusion. As I said, the depictions are rarely flattering - the characters are always the help and always subservient. MacMurray even describes his servant/butler (?) as ""Not very smart but he's a great cook."" I did enjoy the porter in The Palm Beach Story continuously calling yachts ""yachets"" because seriously, why is it spelled y-a-c-h-t? In Sullivan's Travels Sturgess has a very clear purpose in his inclusion of Black actors - they make up a church congregation with whom Sullivan and some prisoners of a chain gang get to watch cartoons, and its here that Sullivan realizes that the ""common man"" doesn't need drama - they need comic relief. Part of me wants to think Sturgess just wanted to remind white audiences that they're not alone in this country, but another part of me maybe just thinks Sturgess sees Black people as ""the help"" and sources of comedy. Either way, his films gave roles to Black actors, which is not something other screwball comedies of the era did. I'm sure there's some more informed writing on this elsewhere.",4.0

"An enjoyable trip down memory lane circa 1940.  Director Mitchell Leisen brings to the silver screen a story by Preston Sturges with a holiday time frame.  The magic period between Christmas and New Years.  
     We open with a petty crime committed by Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) involving stolen jewelry.  Hard up for cash allegedly and pulling her stunt during a busy Christmas shopping season which one might think would provide a good cover, she is busted by a pawn shop owner which lands her in a court of law just prior to the Holiday.
   It is here where she first meets assistant district attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) who cleverly has her trial by jury postponed until after New Years.  A relief to all except John who suffers the guilts after having successfully lined Lee up for a holiday behind bars.  Reaching into his deep pockets, he solicits a bail bondsman to spring Lee and spring her he does.  Landing in John’s apartment and the middle of his life.
     With some coldly distant exchanges between them, they both discover they are from Indiana and he offers to drive Lee home to spend Christmas with her family as he intends the same for himself.
     Here is where “Remember The Night” swings for the fences but misses the charm of nostalgia offered us by other similarly themed films of that era.  The degree of fun or pathos brought to the viewer will depend on how far one can stretch your own credibility.  Director Leisen is no Frank Capra.
     The acting is actually better than the story should allow and Stanwyck and MacMurray hint at the chemistry they would later display in “Double Indemnity” and always stalwart Beulah Bondi arrives on the scene later in the film as John’s kindly mother once again lifting the proceedings.  
     Paramount Pictures released “Remember The Night” in January of 1940 which seems like an unusual time to market a holiday themed film as many people just want to put the Yuletide behind them by then.  Favorable reviews and the capable cast brought some coin into the box office.  What it did not do is place “Remember The Night” in the perennial Christmas themed movie marathon that usually begins mid July. 😉🎄",3.0

"Christmas Selections 2021

Remember the Night is a romantic dramedy following a sympathetic attorney and the comely shoplifter he has taken home for the Christmas holiday as love blooms between them.
I really have no idea how I didn’t know this was a Christmas film until now but it’s immediately became a new favourite of mine and one that I’ll definitely revisit. Remember the Night is a perfectly paced and very well written piece of early 1940s cinema that sets its story up perfectly within the first 10 minutes or so and manages to remain consistently entertaining and engaging throughout the rest of the film. Although a lot of classic Hollywood films can feel a little laughable at times with how fast the romance stories move along but thanks to Preston Sturges’ excellent screenplay and the superb performances from both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, it feels so believable and easy to become invested in.
It’s great to see the romance slowly build throughout the film without ever feeling rushed, boasting some terrific chemistry from Stanwyck and MacMurray that’s always enjoyable to watch. What’s also interesting is the morale questions raised about Stanwyck’s character who is a criminal, one of the main plot points of the film yet she’s also written, directed and played as a very likeable character who goes on quite an interesting journey throughout the film, something that makes the ending effective and thought provoking. The cinematography is amazing, presenting so many wonderfully set up shots that draw you into its captivating story through the beautiful filmmaking on display. The soundtrack also works, never outstaying its welcome and always fitting the film’s tone brilliantly. 
Overall, Remember the Night is filled with excellent performances, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic direction and brilliant writing. The romance between Stanwyck and MacMurray is set up brilliantly and the story remains thoroughly interesting and entertaining from its superb opening scene to its bold and effective ending. Definitely a new favourite Christmas film of mine.

Much like love this is a bittersweet story with two knockout performances in a near perfect film that is sadly marred by a pretty racist character in the beginning that takes a little away from it as a whole but seeing the brilliant pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray several years before their team up in my favorite noir but playing such a different pair reminds me of how damn good they are and helps to balance out the ugly aspects that date it as a product of its time.
This is a few different films in one as it bounces between a courtroom dramedy (with one of the best and funniest defense lawyer performances in history) and road trip with a classic rom com set up as Stanwyck plays Lee Leander, a thief who was just pinched for stealing and trying to pawn a bracelet and MacMurray is John ""Jack"" Sargent, the prosecutor tasked with putting her away. Knowing that at Christmas the jurors go soft Jack gets an extension of the trial but feels guilty when he hears Lee complaining about being locked up for the holiday.
Even though the setup is pretty by the book the chain of events leading to romance isn't. After Jack gets a bondsman to have Lee freed the bondsman assumes something sleazy is going on and drops Lee at Jack's place.
That Jack is a decent guy who only felt bad about locking Lee up is a surprise to Lee and when the two find out they're both from Indiana Jack offers Lee a ride to reconnect with her estranged mother on his way to visit his family and slowly starts to realize that Lee isn't bad, just unloved from an early age.
The chemistry between the two is palpable and the road trip aspect works really well with the two of them getting into a slight jam after accidentally trespassing and Jack ends up being a small time criminal himself in a nice nod to showing that not everyone who breaks the law is necessarily guilty, bad or deserving of a harsh sentence.
The meeting with Lee's mom does so much more to humanize Lee than any dozens of lines could and the warmth and acceptance Lee has been lacking in her life and finds at Jack's family farm is the beating heart of the film.
Stanwyck is one of, if not my favorite actress from the 40's and she brings such a depth and loneliness to her character that finally has someone who cares about her and that she cares about in return.
Jack's slow realization that the worst thing about someone doesn't define them feels earned and his everyman small town decency is charming and wonderful.
It's also just really funny. Preston Sturges wrote the screenplay and although he and Stanwyck would work together on The Lady Eve one year later this has a slightly better mix of comedy and melancholy for me with an ambiguous ending that doesn't tie everything up with a bow.

"Surprisingly poignant and sincere by the end considering the tone of the first third is a bit breezy. It won me over, as most Stanwyck films do. We all have our weaknesses.

"Mitchell Leisen directs this romantic comedy drama in which an assistant District Attorney takes a shoplifter home with him for the Christmas holiday. Starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.
This is the first of four collaborations that Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck did together. Although there is absolutely no denying that their most famous pairing is Billy Wilder’s Oscar-nominated classic film-noir Double Indemnity, their first film together is a very enjoyable outing.
Moved to disappointment by the festive season, New York District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) lets attractive thief Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) out on bail and suggests that she has a journey home to Indiana. Along the way, they have a confrontation with a Pennsylvania sheriff, encounter each others’ parents, and sooner or later fall in love.
John's mother, however, doesn’t like this, and seriously tells Lee to stay away, in case she damages John's job. Not aiming to cause distress, Lee resolutions to leave the man she really likes.
Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck both give very good performances in their respective roles as John and Lee. John is the District Attorney who postpones the trial to Lee can spend Christmas with her family, while Lee is the woman who is caught shoplifting for the third time, but won’t be going behind bars.
They both suit their roles very well, providing moments of charm and humour in the process and make the most of the time they have on the screen.
Elsewhere, there are decent supporting performances to be had from Sterling Holloway, Elizabeth Patterson and Beulah Bondi in their respective roles as Willie, Emma and Mrs. Sargent, the members of Jack’s family who give Lee a very nice and warm reception when she stays at Jack’s house.
The direction from Leisen is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a pleasant atmosphere happening as well.
The script is written to an excellent standard by Preston Sturges as he makes the movie really easy to follow and creates funny moments too. But even when the movie isn’t funny, you can still understand what is happening, because the narrative is definitely there from beginning to end.
The camera stands out best in terms of the technical aspects in glorious black-and-white, because it makes very good use of the locations and also captures the humorous occasions well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status.
This film would be the last that Preston Sturges would write for another director – he would go on to do this own movie career following this with The Great McGinty, a movie which won him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
Overall, Remember the Night is a really enjoyable movie to watch, thanks to the very good and central performances and chemistry from Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, along with Mitchell Leisen’s direction and Preston Sturges’ well-written, funny script. One festive treat from start to finish.",5.0
"Prémisse parfaite de comédie romantique: elle, accusée à raison de vol à l'étalage, ce n'est pas sa première offense ; lui, procureur, carrière impeccablement honnête, spécialiste pour mettre les femmes en prison ; le tribunal est reporté de quelques jours, dans l'entre-temps ils tombent en amour, évidemment.
La première moitié du film est aussi bonne que les meilleures comédies romantiques de l'époque, très drôle, dialogues savoureux, et qui peut résister aux regards que lance Barbara Stanwick à Fred MacMurray (lui me laisse plus indifférent, mais il fait la job), ou à ses ""gee you're sweet"" murmuré à mesure qu'elle se rend compte qu'elle tombe amoureuse? C'est écrit par Sturges, et on voit qu'il a dû s'inspirer de ce film quand il a écrit Lady Eve pour Stanwyck, dans un rôle semblable de criminelle qui tombe amoureuse d'un homme d'une autre classe sociale (d'ailleurs, ça m'étonne toujours à quel point les films de cette époque dealaient assez franchement avec les différences de classe pour en faire un réel enjeu, ce qui a pratiquement disparu avec le temps). On reconnaît aussi certaines structures de scènes que Sturges aime bien, les personnages secondaires qui commentent l'action principale, comme des spectateurs.
Bref, on a Stanwyck, extraordinaire, toujours à devoir s'affirmer contre le jugement des autres, mais peu à peu elle se fait rattraper par la morale, elle se plie à certaines conventions pour séduire son mec (plutôt que de l'entortiller dans ses mensonges comme dans Lady Eve) et même si elle demeure très émouvante dans le drame qu'elle vit (qui n'est pas sans rappeler à certains égards celui de Stella Dallas), même s'il y a quelque chose d'assez audacieux dans la transition de la comédie vers le mélodrame, on a un peu l'impression que c'est le film plus que la société qui finit par se dresser dans le chemin de Stanwyck. Je sais pas trop pourquoi, c'est un peu ambigu (il y a une manière de voir la fin de manière plus positive), mais il y a quelque chose qui ne passe pas tout à fait, qui n'arrive pas à être aussi nuancé que peut l'être Stella Dallas.
Je mets un gros cœur pour Stanwyck pareil, parce qu'il y a quelques moments incroyablement émouvants qui passent entièrement par son jeu, qui nous surprend en passant du registre du screwball au mélodrame avec une fluidité toute émouvante. Il aurait suffit de pas grand-chose pour que ce soit vraiment excellent.",3.5
"Remember the Night is warm, witty comedy; that drifts between a screwball set-up and into a pure romantic drama. I do not think that it is any surprise that Preston Sturges is credited as the screenwriter, because the film has a lot of his first-class dialogue, though it may lack his directorial nous. It runs towards sentimental in the second half, but the tremendous performances from the peerless Barbara Stanwyck, and Fred MacMurray keep it fresh and watchable. A Christmas film par excellence, that deserves to be switched into the Christmas film rotation.
A film for anyone that thinks MacMurray is only good in Billy Wilder films playing against type. Playing to type here, as the good-natured, intelligent lawyer, MacMurray is superb. But as with any film she is in, Stanwyck steals it, with ease. One of the great actresses, it may not have the verve of her early pre-code performances in Night Nurse or Baby Face; nor is she quite as good as she was in, say, The Lady Eve or Double Indemnity, but this is a great turn, that is surprisingly emotionally resonant, for a film that starts so funny. The scene between Stanwyck and her mother is one of the best Stanwyck scenes I have seen. And that is high praise indeed.
Remember the Night may have a little too much sentiment, but otherwise it is a really great film. A top studio product, that Preston Sturges fans need to see.",4.0
"'She never blew one line through the whole picture. She set that kind of pace and everybody worked harder, trying to outdo her..' (Director Mitchell Leisen talking about Barbara Stanwyck's professionalism during the making of Remember The Night)
The first screen pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray was also the last script Preston Sturges wrote before deciding that the only person capable of directing his stories successfully was... Preston Sturges himself!
It's a beautifully made sentimental romantic comedy drama with a stellar performance from Barbara which builds masterfully and creates a very special mood.

"“How long since you’ve been home?""
“Never.”
“Why?”
“I ran away.”
“How’d you like to go home for Christmas?” 🎄
Remember the Night is a great film to see with the ingredients of classic 1940s goodness and the added bonus of Christmas vibes: Beautiful cinematography - in this case by TED TETZLAFF (Notorious, I Married a Witch), romance, slow dances and multiple music needle drops including ""Easy Living"", “(Back Home Again in) Indiana”, ""A Perfect Day"" and of course a new year’s party featuring Auld Lang Syne. Above all, it is blessed by the talented performances of FRED MACMURRAY, BARBARA STANWYCK (in one of her best roles I've seen thus far) and BEUAH BONDI (Make Way for Tomorrow, It’s A Wonderful Life, Mr Smith Goes to Washington), who epitomizes the compassionate mother-in-law.
The script by PRESTON STURGES is extremely well written, asserting itself well in scenes of levity and gravity alike. Never in a million years did I expect to see two people trespass a farmer’s property all on ‘ignorance of fact,’ pass the night without doing ‘a little passionate necking’ and proceed the next morning to TRY to milk a cow who decided to visit them. What a funny scene!
“Oh you spilled the breakfast!”
Then when John is caught in a delicious moment of irony: a lawyer taken to trial at gunpoint, it is the criminal (Lee) who busts them out with a fire in the bin escape exit strategy.

With the shifts toward drama, MITCHELL LEISEN’s fine direction and the detail-oriented editing by future Billy Wilder collaborator, DOANE HARRISON, dually help emphasize this character study of Lee as an outcast from her own family as well as from society. Empathy and compassion are a crucial part of how Lee and John eventually see eye to eye and fall in love, and by introducing the roadmap to the viewer early in steady trickles, Leisen ensures that when the moments of decision do eventually happen, they feel realized to us and right to each character.

Taking Lee’s homecoming as one essential example, I am sure the moment of her going back home and facing her mother was relatable for people who’ve always had a shakier relationship with their parents. It certainly did make me an ally of Lee’s and I appreciated how authentic Lee’s POV works here in the approach to the house and during that sticky conversation. John’s cognizance of how she feels in the remark he makes to Mrs. Leander as they make their farewells speeds the arc of their relationship further along to when she arrives as a guest at the Sargent residence and we see Beulah Bondi’s Mrs. Sargent take Lee in like her own daughter. What a homely part of this film where Lee joins in the Christmas festivities, and how can one not appreciate the New Year’s kiss scene, the pivotal moment in front of the Niagara Falls or the final act in court. This latter moment was a little quick for me, but significantly, it never felt didactic. Rather, it was heartfelt and is a testament to both actors’ skill and investment in their roles.

“Don’t you think I’m the best judge of what’s good for me and what I want most in this world?!”

"Thought this would be a madcap odd couple situation given the premise and the writer, but instead the two just click immediately, and all of what follows is very gentle and sweet. Stanwyck’s especially great here balancing her character’s hard-bitten voice of experience with vulnerability and moments of flightiness, playing well off McMurray’s stiff do gooderism.

"Merry Christmas to me.
First time seeing this film and it made for a great new addition to my list of holiday classics.
The film interestingly puts a stake in the ground in terms of its message and doesn't stray from it. I kept expecting a curveball within the story's sine wave but it didn't happen and not to the detrement of the overall satisfying conclusion.
On a purely asesthetic note, there's an amazing nightclub scene where MacMurray dances with Stanwyck and at one point the camera transitions its focus from the leads to the singer approaching the microphone. The camera gently moves over the dancers' shoulders to reveal Martha Mears who croons Easy Living. (Mears, notably the voice behind Marjorie Reynolds' 'White Christmas' in the film Holiday Inn.) It was such a lovely transition and the film gave time and space to appreciate the song while it painted the mood for the ongoing events.
I'll also 'remember' the sets for this film. The home farm and barn were so warm and inviting.
Great holiday pic.",4.5
"“He thinks he’s taking me to the Ritz.”
How could a film so tender and heartwarming be yet so stone cold at the same time? There’s always an element of glamour in living on the edge, just as long as it isn’t the real world. But Remember the Night plays into the hands of simple moral good, clear message, no risks taken; it has all the workings of a didactic piece. But it’s the other elements that make this film so lovely. Barbara Stanwyck is unaffected, alluring, from beginning to end. From her witticisms to her emotional displays of longing, regret, happiness, love, and her pragmatic, heartbreaking endearments, it’s no wonder that her prosecutor’s initial base altruism blossoms into passionate love, and I’ve fallen for Babs too. Fred MacMurray: “Don’t you think I’m the best judge of what’s good for me and what I want most in this world?” Of course, Babs is the star here, but when it’s time for MacMurray to experience some heartfelt pining, he does shine, playing the part with emotional affliction. Loved the romantic talk, and stuff, in Canada, the visual ecstasy of Niagara Falls and the noir-dark lighting were lovely to look at. With the Stanwyck power and the heart power at play here, the didactic elements are only a slight bother.
“I’m not exactly ugly.”
Waterloo Bridge, released the same year, has a similar didactic premise, but its Code-laden ending is much more annoying there, because it is unsatisfying, yet it doesn't need to be. The film went through reform school and the censors were its teachers. I still love both films for all their other elements. It gets a little fun when you can anticipate the coming-on of Auld Lang Syne in a film.

"One of the lovelier Christmas movies of the period.  Barbara Stanwyck plays a shoplifter who is being prosecuted by compassionate, but fair Fred MacMurray (usually boring to me, but very well-cast).  Not wishing her to spend the holiday in jail, he brings her to her sadly still harsh mother’s home, before thinking better of it and heading to his own instead.  The contrasted scenes of Stany seeing how a warm, inviting family enjoys the holiday are just lovely.  They even pull together some last minute gifts for her to open too 🥹
Stanwyck is vulnerable, sympathetic and beautiful in this film.  While I’m no big fan of Fred, he’s very likable and believable as a justice-conscious lawyer with an apparently idyllic upbringing.  On an unrelated note, I need that gingham apron/housedress Stany wears while baking the popovers 🤩",4.0

"Comedies, old or new, have a difficult time making me laugh. Maybe it's because I'm a cold bird with nothing to laugh about. But that disconnect grows wider when the comedy is older. The screwball stuff is fairly hit-or-miss for me, as is the racy pre-code material. I think My Man Godfrey and Love Me Tonight are hilarious, while It Happened One Night and even Trouble in Paradise (as great as it is) leave me cold. I'm more a His Girl Friday guy than a Bringing Up Baby bird, if that makes any sense.
The praise for Preston Sturges seems to imply he won't be for me, but I thought Sullivan's Travels was fantastic. I'm also understanding of films that aren't necessarily ""funny"" to me that I still understand the humor in. Remember the Night is more ""understanding the humor"" than properly getting the humor as I would with Sullivan's Travels. Its jokes don't land as hard for me, especially when the quips are equally smarmy and lingering rather than always varietal or quickly-paced.
BUT... contrary to what people might say about Sturges, in my admittedly very brief experience, he balances wildly varying moods quite beautifully in his work. Allegedly he was not a fan of Mitchell Leisen's direction here, but Leisen's an unsung legend in his own right. From The Eagle and the Hawk to Midnight, he had a precedent of fantastic work. Many argue this is his finest.
We also have to be grateful for a quite stellar leading duo, one that we would continue to see together off-and-on for the next decade and a half. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are a terrific pair, and this is the first time audiences would see them on-screen together. There's a reason why their range would extend beyond Leisen's brand of drama/comedy and toward the even more serious works of Wilder and Sirk.
And uhh... Rowland. The Moonlighter is the odd one out in that it's apparently not very good.
Despite that fantastic cast and crew, Remember the Night was quite overlooked for a long while. Even now, it doesn't feel like its popularity matches its praise. Its inclusion on the holiday circuit has perhaps done it some favors. Hopefully it sneaks up on some with its comfortably chaotic balance of comedy, absurdity, and romance and its sharp details buried within its script glowing for brief, brilliant flickers of time.
Such is the power of a sneakier heart like Sturges'.",4.0
"I remember watching this film for the first time in 2006 and how special it felt just in that first viewing.
It's hard to pick my favorite Christmas film, but I always come back to REMEMBER THE NIGHT.

Elizabeth Patterson may be my favorite character in the film. She's adorable and funny, but that scene when she picks up her old love letters and gets lost in her thoughts. Wow.
I like Willie's (Sterling Holloway) phrases. ""Gosh oh hemlock.""
When Barbara Stanwyck's character almost breaks down while the group sings ""The End of the Perfect Day.""
Fred MacMurray's character says something along the lines of ""Not even married, you say that like it's the least someone can be.""

The plot is implausible and yet Sturges' script is so effing smart it works brilliantly.",4.5
"Welp, that's an automatic entry into the xmas movie canon. How is it that I've never heard anyone say anything about this ever?! It's so, so good, and functions as both a top-notch holiday film and an incidental call for restorative justice.
Preston Sturgess wrote the script, but this is nothing like what I've come to expect in my brief acquaintance with his work. Although there are some laughs to be had, it's mostly a light romantic dramedy about two star-crossed people finding each other and then trying to navigate the overwhelming obstacles that stand between their being together.
Fred McMurray is a New York ADA whose legal trickery causes shoplifter Barbara Stanwyck to end up in the stir awaiting trial over Christmas. A pang of guilt leads to his posting bond, and a miscommunication leads to her being left in his care. Once they realize they're both from Indiana, he offers to give her a ride home for the holidays. And what do you imagine happens on their ride out west!
While there's certainly a bit of meet-cute rompery over the course of their trip, the tone gets a little more serious when we meet Stanwyck's sour mother and realize why she ran away from home, and then when we meet McMurray's much warmer family and realize that there but by the grace of love goes he. Fred's mother accepts Babs with open arms even after learning who she is, and Babs ultimately realizes that she has to take responsibility for her actions if she wants her burgeoning love to pan out.
I'm pretty much a Stanwyck neophyte but I can already tell that she is the absolute real deal. She's able to say so much with just her face, just her eyes. There are several brief scenes in this where her unspoken thoughts are broadcast like a beacon by her facial expressions alone. And I'm quickly becoming a Beulah Bondi superfan. She's like the most real small town Midwestern mother/grandmother I've ever seen onscreen, in every role I've seen her in.
What can I say. Add this to your holiday rotation ASAP and stock up on the Kleenex.",4.5
"Mitchell Leisen's Christmastime romance Remember the Night finds Barbara Stanwyck at her most adorable. The script was written by Preston Sturges, and although Sturges was very unhappy with the liberties taken by Leisen, the changes resulted in a more tender, emotionally grounded film. Stanwyck is Lee, a shoplifter who goes home for the holidays with assistant District Attorney Jack (Fred MacMurray). Despite the film containing some screwball elements, the unlikely romance that develops between the two feels organic in a way that is rare for Old Hollywood. The magnificent lead performances, especially the vulnerability shown by Stanwyck, make us believe that this mismatched pair would really fall in love. Remember the Night's bittersweet ending has remained with me in the day since I watched the film, so perhaps it is even better than I had initially believed.",4.5

"I had to review at least one good Christmas movie tonight. After rewatching that North Pole stinker, ""Santa Claus the movie"", I needed to wash the taste of failure out of my mouth. 1940's ""Remember the Night"", with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck was just the thing needed. She plays a shoplifter and he plays the D.A. who prosecutes her on Christmas Eve. Rather than have her spend the holiday in jail until the trial starts, the ol' softie takes her with him while he visits his family. As you can imagine the two fall quickly in love. Of the two Christmas movies Barbara Stanwyck made, I much prefer this one, even though there are some cringe worthy moments when the era's blatant racism is displayed in some early scenes with MacMurray's man servant. Yikes! What were they thinking? The chemistry between the two leads is real, and the ending, when MacMurray attempts to lose the case on purpose, so his newfound love can avoid any prison time, doesn't seem at all farfetched. Stealing scenes left and right is squeaky-voiced Sterling Holloway. A wonderful character actor from back in the day, and the voice of Winnie the Pooh for many, many years. He alone makes the movie worth your while. I believe it's still available on demand at TCM. Watch it before your Christmas tree turns into next years compost.",4.0

Her performance here is really something else, communicating so much with barely a word. Her future Double Indemnity co-star Fred MacMurray is unbelievably loveable. His final scenes where he is willing to throw it all away hit very hard. A wonderful romantic melancholic affair.",4.5
"A special kind of movie magic: when an already wonderful film suddenly reaches an even more spectacular level. To me, this happens here in the Niagara Falls scene. Two people transforming the world-famous sight, glowing softly in the background, into their own private universe, their bedroom. Like something a romantic extremist like Borzage could have filmed, but at the same time shot through with a decidedly un-Borzagian modern, ironic sensibility: the scene also can be described as two Hollywood stars taking a stroll through a sound stage. They even pass by a lighting fixtures.
A few minute earlier we have Stanwyck in front of a mirror in a room with flower wallpapers - the fantasy world she was able to build around her for a while comes crushing down while a strand of hair keeps falling over her face. No one projects herself into the space surrounding her like she does, but also: no one knows as much about the relationship between space and feeling as Leisen does.
Most of the best shots in the film are of Stanwyck alone, and yet MacMurray never feels out of place when he enters her frame. Unlike in his films with Lombard, he is not saddled with a proactive role he cannot fully inhabit; instead, his only job here is reacting to Stanwyck, or rather: lending our own reactions to Stanwyck a body. And this he does beautifully.",5.0

It was a sweet, heartwarming and funny film with a great story and an ending that I loved. Between the story and the chemistry between the leads it reminded me of Roman Holiday which is about as great a compliment as I can give a film like this really.

"Such a charming Christmas movie. The beautiful Barbara Stanwyck's outstanding portrayal of a woman shaped by a troubled past, intertwined with co-star Fred MacMurray's portrayal of a compassionate prosecuting attorney, creates a movie filled with warmth and style. Director Leisen and writer Sturges skillfully blend their leads' personas to avoid excessive sentimentality while showcasing a transformative journey. The initial legal aspects might seem a little quirky and distant from reality, but the film compensates with a genuine portrayal of emotion. The conclusion seems slightly off and bittersweet.

About the only thing that's consistent between the two is Barbara herself, whose acting and choices in fashion are still the most superb aspect of the production. In fact, performance-wise, Stanwyck probably impressed me even more in this one. I feel like she's one of those great actresses who can communicate so much with just her eyes and her demeanor that she makes every scene she appears in absolutely mesmerizing and owns every single line of dialogue.
She plays an impressively multi-layered femme fatale in Lee, who starts out playing the smug panther over the beleaguered Fred MacMurray but as the film goes on, we get to see the more emotional and vulnerable sides of Lee's personality and she becomes a complicated, but never non-compelling, tragic figure. Who again, rocks every single look in this movie.
It's just too bad everything else around Barbara doesn't really work here. Fred MacMurray does an alright job as Jack Sargeant and the two have nice chemistry in a lot of their scenes, but his characterization is rather inconsistent and the way he falls in love with Lee doesn't really feel organic and sown-out well enough. (The romance in Christmas in Connecticut happened fast too, but at least that had the excuse of playing out over two nights, whereas this is implied to take place over at least a couple weeks).
The biggest thing that made Remember the Night really off-putting for me was the over-exaggerated comical characters in its first half, from the incredibly bombastic prosecutor to Sargeant's dim-witted assistant, which uhh... it's very unfortunate that this film couldn't resist taking a spoonful of some good ol' fashioned 1940's racism. Boy, is that whole section uncomfortable.
The fact that it starts out as such a screwball ends up feeling weird, especially since it ends as a soft and more sentimentally grounded story that I was finally getting into. I guess if it had been more centered on Lee and Jack and this intimate story it seems to want to tell than on everything else, I could have appreciated it a lot better.

"Unlike Christmas in Connecticut, this one does imply that living in the country is inherently more wholesome and virtuous than the city, but it also doesn’t really romanticize farm life so I’ll give it a pass, especially when the underlying story is so sweet. This is such a skillful blend of comedy and drama - I always think of it as a straight drama but the courtroom scenes at the beginning are hilarious, among others. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are both absolutely perfect at seamlessly blending the genres and investing the comedic bits with pathos. 
This time through i spent a lot of time mentally casting a modern-day remake, and I’m quite confident Lady Gaga would absolutely murder the Barbara Stanwyck role. I have less of a sense about who the modern equivalent of Fred MacMurray would be but I’m open to suggestions! The mom has to be played by Patricia Clarkson, I don’t make the rules.",4.5

"Remember the Night (not to be confused with A Night to Remember or It Happened One Night) pairs Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together four years before Double Indemnity, the best noir ever made and having seen both movies a couple of times it really shows what great actors they are with Stanwyck being equally good as an ice cold femme fatal and a sweet jewel thief.
In Remember the Night Stanwyck plays petty thief Lee Leander who gets caught trying to pawn a bracelet she recently stole. MacMurray is the prosecutor Jack Sargent and when the two meet in court just before Christmas MacMurray knows the holiday cheer will make the jurors go easy on Lee despite her record of previous convictions.
Despite a valiant effort by Lee's defense attorney who spins a crazy story of how Lee was hypnotized by the jewels (with Lee barely holding her composure at the ridiculousness of the performance and Jack's assistant saying that the defense lawyer should be on the stage. Jack dryly replies ""He was"") Jack gets the judge to have the case resume after the holiday when he'll be more likely to win.
However Jack feels bad about leaving someone locked up for the holidays and pays for Lee's bond which is misinterpreted by the bondsman as something lascivious so he brings Lee to Jack's apartment.
When Jack sets things straight and tells Lee he doesn't want anything from her she allows a crack to show in her tough facade.
When Jack finds out that Lee has nowhere to go for Christmas and that they're both from Indiana he offers to give her a ride to her estranged mothers house and pick her up on the way back.
Lee's mother is a cold, mean woman and of course Jack being a good dude doesn't leave her there but instead offers to let Lee spend the holiday at his family farm with his mom, his aunt and Winnie the Pooh.
Anyone who's seen any movie can guess where this goes but as in most films like Remember the Night it's not the destination, it's the journey.
The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray is fantastic and the dialogue has a lot of funny lines and one liners spread throughout.
There are a few dated things about this movie most notably Jack's servant who is only in the beginning of the movie but is a very broad dumb black stereotype of the time and is very cringey to watch.
Some of the dialogue is also a bit of its time but it comes of as charming instead of annoying for me and the best part of this movie is how it gently falls on the nurture side of the nature vs nurture debate.
When Jack's mom finds out Lee is a criminal instead of being upset she posits that maybe Lee didn't have the same upbringing that Jack did and imparts some wisdom on him.
Mom: Do you remember when you took my egg money I was going to buy a new dress with? And how hard you worked to pay it back when you later understood?
Jack: You made me understand.
Mom: No, dear. It was love that made you understand.

'Remember the Night' was such a charming wee Christmas film. It grew on me more and more as the story progressed. I even got teary at the end.

Once we finally get past the fact single John Sargent (MacMurray) lives in a small apartment but still employs a Black butler and isn’t particularly nice to him, this settles into one of the most pleasant surprises. Loaded with heart, legit laughs and a big dose of Christmas spirit.

"Really thought I'd finally be bumping this one up to five stars this year, viewing it on a lovely new Blu-ray for the first time after a couple of lower-definition viewings. I've got to admit that it does start a little slowly though - I do quite like the theatrical defense lawyer but his big speech takes up a lot of time when I want to be getting to the fireworks factory, by which I mean the fireworks that blast out of the screen as soon as Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray actually start spending time together. There's also some very of-it's-time stuff in the early scenes, especially when it comes to Fred Toones' character.
Once the lead couple set off on their road trip though, this is basically perfect - funny, sad, wonderfully bittersweet. Aunt Emma might have been my favourite supporting character this time around, but they're all wonderful. It's not a perfect film but I do absolutely love it.",4.5
"Almost perfect. Maybe just take away the unfortunate manservant character and I’d have no notes. For as much has been made over changes to Sturges’ script, perhaps Mitchell Liesen saved the film, or at least the Hays Code did. One of the alleged changes that was made was to the ending. I believe Sturges had Fred getting Barbara off. Part of what makes this movie so good is its bittersweet ending which requires everyone to have faith and hold their breath until the following year. Does Fred wait for her? I honestly don’t know. Maybe she doesn’t let him. Might be a more romantically tragic tale if they’re kept apart, right? Nah. Screw that. Slap on the wrist sentence. Out by June. Married on July 4th with Sterling Holloway dressed as Uncle Sam. The man loves a hat. (Original Review Below)


I never hear anyone discuss this film without mentioning this was the moment screenwriter Preston Sturges became determined to never write another film that he didn't also direct. He was so dissatisfied with the way Mitchell Liesen directed the film and changed the structure of his screenplay, that he was disgusted with the final product. This can only make me wonder just how much better Sturges' original screenplay could have been because despite him being so unsatisfied with the experience, this film is absolutely wonderful. Sturges' sly wit is very much on display, even if it's a tad more sentimental than some of his later efforts. But what's wrong with sentimentality? It's freakin' Christmas! And if it ever gets too sweet for you, just imagine that Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck don't end up together and a few years later she dyes her hair and enlists him to murder her husband!

Stanwyck plays a shoplifter on trial just before Christmas, with MacMurray the smarmy D.A. who gets the judge to postpone the trial until after the holidays when he realizes the jury is going to acquit her just so they can get a jump on their holiday shopping. Naturally Fred feels guilty about the whole thing, so he bails her out and takes her to spend Christmas with him and his family. From that moment on, with each passing hour... the two hate each other more and more. Just kidding. Obviously they fall in love. But if you think you know exactly where this is heading, Sturges definitely has some surprises in store. This is a film that has one of those endings that brings this from being a good movie to a great one. Stanwyck, is simply superb. She nails every difficult moment in the final act, and there are a lot of them. But she's such a pro. I don't think there's any other actress in the history of cinema who I'm more enamored with. That's why I saved her ""Christmas in Connecticut"" for my final Christmas film of the night. Now, let me just navigate through the TCM app and press play. Uh... where is it? It was here last night. Did it actually expire on Christmas Eve??? Oh, Ben. How could you? The Mankiewicz boy has ruined another Christmas, folks. Now I'll never find out if she could flip that pancake!",4.5
"☃️December 2021 Christmas Watchlist☃️
“Christmas In Connecticut” wasn’t Barbara Stanwyck’s only Christmas movie, you know! A few years earlier she teamed up with Fred MacMurray (pre “Double Indemnity”) for this light romantic romp through the holidays. The plot is borderline ridiculous; a sympathetic D.A. bails Stanwyck’s crook out of jail so that she won’t spend Christmas in jail. Then he extends his generosity even further to driving her to his childhood home in Indiana.
If you can get over that high concept, and admittedly, it isn’t hard to, it’s a fun film. MacMurray’s a bit stiff to be convincing as a romantic lead, he fared better being the jaded suspicious lover in “Indemnity.” But Stanwyck is fantastic, both hard edged and sensual when the script requires. It’s a screenplay with some surprisingly dark moments, but they’re appropriate to the story and even the season. The early courtroom scenes are fun, as is the comedic road trip through Pennsylvania.
Stanwyck meeting her mother for the first time in many years is an effective, heartbreaking scene. The further scenes in the household where MacMurray’s family openly accepts Stanwyck are heartwarming, and really get me in the holiday mood. The ending is predictable, and I was disappointed in how some things in the screenplay weren’t planned as much as I would have liked. But for classic Hollywood, this is a good holiday offering. Three stars.

Preston's writing is as good as in The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, or The Miracle at Morgan's Creek. It's almost completely pitch perfect, apart from the ignorant racial stereotyping. But even those scenes, as uncomfortable as they are, seem more humanistic to me than when so many other directors in the era kept Black actors silent and in the shadows.

"District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) is prosecuting Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) for shoplifting. When the case is suspended for the holiday break Leander is released on bail. Sargent feels sorry for Leander being alone for the holidays so he eventually brings her to his childhood home to spend the period between Christmas and New Years with his family where she gets to experience a true family Christmas and just maybe fall in love. On paper this movie has a ridiculously improbable premise that would be more befitting a Hallmark Channel original production. But the story and screenplay by Preston Sturges is so excellent that it transcends the sitcom setup to be one of the most warm hearted, romantic, and inspirational holiday themed movies you'll ever see. How this one has flown under my radar all these years is a mystery. I'm always on the lookout for quality holiday entertainment outside of the standard classics that are always mentioned. Why this film is never included in the conversation amongst the likes of It's A Wonderful Life, A Holiday Affair, The Shop Around the Corner etc. is puzzling. It's every bit as good as those films and deserves to be included when speaking about the finest holiday set films from Hollywood's classic era. What is most impressive with this one is how multi dimensional the characters are allowed to be. On the surface this could have been just a screwball comedy but instead it is a rather heartfelt, bittersweet, tale that is deeply imbued with the Christmas spirit. My only quibble with this one is what amounts to a rather downbeat ending. I think the ending fits the story and is probably the only logical place for it to land but it's still likely going to be unsatisfying to those who've grown accustomed to every Christmas themed movie being wrapped up in a nice, neatly packaged ending where everything turns out perfect. That this isn't that type of movie is both part of its appeal but is also what has likely kept it from being more of a perennial favorite. That being said, this is a classic in waiting that deserves a wider yuletide audience and is highly recommended for those looking for alternative holiday time fare.",4.5
"Remember the Night does follow a standard romcom formula of having two people stuck together, and by the end of it, they're in love. In this case, it's prosecutor John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), who ends up taking home shoplifter Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) rather than let her spend Christmas and New Year's in jail. The cross-country drive ends with them falling for one another in a way that feels a bit predictable, but is at least enjoyable to watch with MacMurray and Stanwyck.
Most of this feels fairly generic, and MacMurray's mindset in a few points was hard to follow, but at least the end is a bit stronger than many of these, first with Sargent trying to throw the case so Leander is acquitted, and then Leander changing her plea to guilty both to prevent Sargent from jeopardizing his career, and because she feels she has to have paid for her wrongdoings before she has any chance with Sargent. It's an emotional sort of conclusion, and it's not the overly happy ending that feels so common. It even eschews the quick wedding after that because Leander wants to enter the marriage clean, and with Sargent having had the time to be sure. It's a strong ending, one that pulls the rest of the movie up with it by ending on such a powerful final note.",3.0

"Very charming picture, and Barbara Stanwyck is an absolute vision. A vision dude. The politics are actually kind of complex, which is intriguing to watch, but ultimately it sides with the system we all hate so much. ""oh he was a kid who had to work while he was in high school and we were poor but then he grows up to become DA! What a sweet fellow!"" You grow up like that and becomes DA, you missed something pal. And it doesn't help that Fred McMurray looks like a complete dumbass in general and is not a very good actor, at least not here. Stanwyck acts circles around him because she is god tier. Fred is not. 
It's wonderful in a Christmas way of course, everything is so sparkly in only the way the silver screen can truly look. It is a Christmas film, and it's disguised as a heartwarming one, but my heart can't be warmed by a film where Fred ""Whiteass"" McMurray plays a DA. As truly wonderful as Stanwyck is.

"What an absolute delight that I had never heard of until my good friend Will recommended that I check it out.
It was so cool to see Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together before Double Indemnity would come along a few years later. These are very different films and very different roles, and they both simply excel. The way Stanwyck is able to showcase the pain of never feeling loved and how finally having someone care about her impacts her is just wonderful to watch. And MacMurray is right there with her. They have great chemistry together, and I could watch them team up in a dozen more movies.
The premise might be a bit silly, but honestly I really liked it. A DA who feels sorry for a criminal around the holidays gets her bailed out and agrees to take her home for Christmas and bring her back in time for her trial, since they come from small towns nearby each other. It's part courtroom drama, part rom-com road trip, and it all works together really well. Parts of it are very predictable, but the journey is so charming that it doesn't matter. We learn more about both characters throughout their trip, and how their upbringing informed who they each became. It allows each one to see the other on a deeper level than lawyer and criminal, and the bond that develops as a result feels natural and believable.
I loved that the ending might head in an expected direction, but doesn't arrive at the exact destination you're assuming it will.

"Fred MacMurray is an assistant D.A. charged with sending a beautiful young shoplifter (played by Barbara Stanwyck) to prison. But it's Christmastime and he knows he won't get a jury to convict a woman before Christmas, so he has the trial postponed until after the holidays.
But Fred feels bad about having poor Barbara stuck in jail for the holidays, so he asks a bail bondsman to do him a favor and get her released. The bail bondsman thinks he wants Barbara released so he can have sexytimes with her (they don't come right out and say this, what with the Hays Code being in place at the time this was made, but it's not-so-subtly insinuated) so he has Barbara brought to Fred's apartment. One thing leads to another and Fred brings Barbara along to visit his mother (Beulah Bondi, who would go on to play James Stewart's mother in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") back in good old Indiana. Feelings develop between Barbara and Fred, naturally, which complicates matters.
Let's get the obvious out of the way first: when it comes to movies starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, ""Remember the Night"" pales in comparison to ""Double Indemnity"". Of course, to be fair, ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest movies ever made and ""Remember the Night"" is a slight, likable-enough romantic comedy/drama. I watched this for Yuletide ambiance and, in that regard, ""Remember the Night"" was a bit disappointing. It doesn't have that magical Christmas vibe. It could take place at virtually any time of the year. There's a gift exchange scene but, frankly, it could easily have been a birthday party if not for the Christmas tree in the corner. There's a New Years Eve hoedown but, well, hoedowns don't exactly scream festive cheer.
Also, there's not a lot to this. It's got a couple jokes but is more of a drama, and the drama doesn't have a lot of heft to it either. If not for the presence of Stanwyck and MacMurray (who obviously have great chemistry together) this would be a fairly forgettable affair all around.
SPOILER*****************SPOILER*******************SPOILER
Also, the fact that MacMurray's mother basically guilts Stanwyck into sacrificing herself to prison time so as not to disrupt MacMurray's career sits weirdly with me. Beulah Bondi is great here, such a manipulative character but given such a warm regard by the film that you can see why Stanwyck would be completely convinced by her largely self-serving platitudes. Would it really be so terrible if MacMurray just whiffed on this one particular case, let her get off, and then romanced her afterward? Would the justice system crumble? Would his job actually be compromised? I doubt it. But Stanwyck must learn a moral lesson and go to jail so that the morality of American Cinema can be preserved. It's not just that this ending was probably preferred by the Hays Office, it's that you can practically feel them rewriting the ending before your very eyes. All due respect to screenwriter Preston Sturges, but this is not one of his best efforts.
END SPOILER
""Remember the Night"" is a trifle, but Stanwyck and MacMurray make it worth a look. But if it's Christmas atmosphere you're looking for, I'd steer you to the Yuletide romance of Robert Mitchum's ""Holiday Affair"" or Stanwyck's ""Christmas in Connecticut"" instead.",3.0

"A wonderful movie. Preston Sturges' script is snappy, funny, sweet, romantic, and heartfelt, and the chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray (who'd later make a much darker and deadlier pairing in Double Indemnity) is full of charm.
One deftly handled bit is when they're dancing together early on, and Stanwyck alludes to her rough childhood - the understatement in the writing and her performance make for an emotionally moving moment. And then her visit to her mother is heart wrenching.
In another scene, MacMurray does a great job at playing someone who can sort of play piano - getting through the song, but haltingly. A lovely, truthful bit of business.
Throughout the film, Stanwyck conveys so many complex emotions with just facial expressions and reactions. An impressive performance, even by her usual high standards.
Beulah Bondi (who I know as the elderly female lead in the tearjerker masterpiece Make Way for Tomorrow) and Elizabeth Patterson are darling as MacMurray's loving mother and aunt back home.",4.5

There is a moment early in the film where Lee shakes her hand in disgust at a policeman tasked with escorting her back to jail. What we see is not a star’s posture of toughness but an actress’ embodiment of it. The dismissive, riled-up, Out of my way, pig authenticity of this gesture cements Stanwyck as Lee; this isn’t the first time the character has been manhandled by a cop and it probably won’t be the last.""

The mirrored circumstances were more pronounced, closing the distance between Stanwyck and MacMurray, and in turn, Lesein eschews benevolence for empathy, although it’s a bit of subterfuge, because that’d topple the whole courtroom power dynamic established early on. More a melodrama built atop class betrayal (and careerism) than disparity, isn’t it? Indiana legitimately feels like another world: suddenly there’s more “en plain air” (via a backlot) compositions, more personal clutter paired with interior continuity (the camera bouncing across rooms and up and down stairs in the second home), and a closer proximity to death; references to deceased family members abound. The warmth of the second home relies on the acknowledgement of the march of time, with its pictures, heirlooms and stowed-away wedding dresses; the prevailing chilliness of the first home is a different reaction to the same source. And then that ending, which proves how affectionate self-actualizing pragmatism can be.",4.5
Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are so insanely good together. So good that they made me think the key to finding love is taking your crush to milk a cow and meet your family on your second date,4.0
Sweet Fred and sweet Barbara make the most of Christmas break up state and steal some hearts along the way. Innocent Holiday fun for the soft at heart; no wonderful life though.,3.0

"Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck shine in this pre-Double Indemnity delight written by the great Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen. This latter pairing also teamed up three years earlier for Easy Living, another great comedy worth checking out.
Every performance in this, particularly those of Beulah Bondi and Barbara Stanwyck, is so sincere and genuine.

"Fred MacMurray is a boy scout attorney who has an attack of conscience after sticking firecracker Barbara Stanwyck in the clink for the holidays by postponing her shoplifting case. He cashes in a favor with a bail bondsman to get her released, but he doesn't expect her to be delivered to his door. The dance that ensues between these two characters is really excellent. Without outright saying it for Hays' Code reasons, Stanwyck implies her suspicion that this is a shady maneuver to get with young women. But after realizing he's on the level, she accepts his ""season of giving"" offer for a nice dinner even though he's going to prosecute her in a few days. Then they find out they're both Hoosiers, and so these two cuties find themselves on a roadtrip to Indiana to visit their families.
Barring the fact that they have a full blown trial with a jury for a fucking misdemeanor, Remember the Night has a superb setup. The small machinations that keep this duo together are sharply executed. It's admirable plotting all around, and it's constantly endearing to watch Stanwyck's character experience wholesomeness, affection, and good will for the first time in her life. Her performance is excellent, as always.
More Hays Code bullshit handicaps the ending because ""crimes cannot go unpunished,"" but this is otherwise a high quality Christmas spirit movie with a lot of warmth and a modest dose of screwball hijinks.",4.0

"This movie needs a post-credit scene, I AM IN PAIN.  
Aside from the extremely racist use of ""Rufus,"" who thankfully was not in the film much, I really loved this. I have mixed feelings about the way it ended, but the whole thing was the perfect blend of funny and tender. Barbara Stanwyck is truly unmatched when it comes to leading ladies throughout all of film history. 
Also, the cow in this movie gives the horse from The Lady Eve a run for its money, which is the highest compliment I could ever give a farm animal.",4.0
The way this movie literally has every single thing I love from angst and being disowned by your own mother to being accepted by a family of a man you had just met and basically being claimed as one of them because they simply fell in love you with your charm and you get to spend a perfect christmas with them. Also let's not forget that Edith Head as always gave amazing costumes and Stany looked absolutely stunning in them.. and of course Stany's and MacMurray chemistry was from another planet they seriously had such lovely chemstry.,4.0
Reaches levels of coziness previously unheard of.,4.5
"Ya desde la apertura (es de esas pelis que en un minuto me tienen rendido) demuestra una gracia enorme para transitar entre tonalidades dramáticas en cuestión de un pestañeo, pero es que ese juego de prestidigitación entre el melodrama criminal y la comedia picaresca esconde una creencia sincera en que la frontera que separa a ambas puede atravesarse sin problemas. Aquí no se trata de ironizar con los Santa Claus de la Quinta Avenida y las melodías navideñas desde la visión desencantada de la mujer ""descarriada"", sino de la creencia sincera en que ambos mundos (por extensión, ambos protagonistas) pueden abrazarse. Hay que desprenderse de muchas capas de cinismo para contagiarse de esa creencia, pero esta es una de esas películas que nos hace querer ser más ingenuos, y yo creo que cada vez las necesito más en mi vida.",5.0
"Moving Christmassy romance with a shocking and mature ending cleverly playing within the confines of the Code system. Stanwyck is magnetic, cold and impassive to begin with before slowly opening up, her eyes shining as the warmth of MacMurray and his family shows her a new way forward. The scene with her mother is haunting and brutal in a way I don't expect in a film like this, more noir than romance. Contrasts perfectly with the lovely, homely scene on Christmas morning, idealistic but in a way that feels real. Brought a tear to my eye, I'm a sucker for this kind of sentimentality, broken people finding connection. But probably most memorable for that ending which uses the Code (the criminal can never be allowed to go free) as a knife to shatter these lovers. No matter how you read it, there's a tragedy in that ending. Legal justice is a flawed system that doesn't care about redemption and penance, only punishment.",4.5
"I never hear anyone discuss this film without mentioning this was the moment screenwriter Preston Sturges became determined to never write another film that he didn't also direct. He was so dissatisfied with the way Mitchell Liesen directed the film and changed the structure of his screenplay, that he was disgusted with the final product. This can only make me wonder just how much better Sturges' original screenplay could have been because despite him being so unsatisfied with the experience, this film is absolutely wonderful. Sturges' sly wit is very much on display, even if it's a tad more sentimental than some of his later efforts. But what's wrong with sentimentality? It's freakin' Christmas! And if it ever gets too sweet for you, just imagine that Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck don't end up together and a few years later she dyes her hair and enlists him to murder her husband!
Stanwyck plays a shoplifter on trial just before Christmas, with MacMurray the smarmy D.A. who gets the judge to postpone the trial until after the holidays when he realizes the jury is going to acquit her just so they can get a jump on their holiday shopping. Naturally Fred feels guilty about the whole thing, so he bails her out and takes her to spend Christmas with him and his family. From that moment on, with each passing hour... the two hate each other more and more. Just kidding. Obviously they fall in love. But if you think you know exactly where this is heading, Sturges definitely has some surprises in store. This is a film that has one of those endings that brings this from being a good movie to a great one. Stanwyck, is simply superb. She nails every difficult moment in the final act, and there are a lot of them. But she's such a pro. I don't think there's any other actress in the history of cinema who I'm more enamored with. That's why I saved her ""Christmas in Connecticut"" for my final Christmas film of the night. Now, let me just navigate through the TCM app and press play. Uh... where is it? It was here last night. Did it actually expire on Christmas Eve??? Oh, Ben. How could you? The Mankiewicz boy has ruined another Christmas, folks. Now I'll never find out if she could flip that pancake!",4.5

"An odd danged movie. Barbara Stanwyck as a repeat offender. Fred MacMurray as a prosecutor who specializes in putting women in prison. But he's a square guy, so he bails her out so she doesn't have to spend the Christmas holiday in jail. Things get weirder and more preposterous, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of old timey charm to MacMurray's visit to his childhood home town and family.
Unfortunately, there's also some of that old timey racism which is very cringey.
Overall, I enjoyed it. Though the ending is...very strange.",3.5
"Another great script by Sturges. Was a bit worried it'd be too much of a courtroom drama for my tastes, but luckily it didn't linger more than necessary. The film has a lot of warmth and humanity. Helped along by Stanwyck as always. A rather straightforward, but touching, romance flick not to be missed.",4.0
"The 1940s: 35/100
A Christmas classic, Remember the Night from director Mitchell Leisen and writer Preston Sturges is very sweet. It is odd, to be sure, as it brings together assistant District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) and the woman he is supposed to be prosecuting, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck). A dumb play by her defense attorney to claim she was hypnotized by the beauty of the jewelry she stole and tried to pawn sees Sargent push for a continuance. That way, he can bring in an expert to dispel this silly notion, win over the jury, and get the conviction. He does have a heart though, seeing the poor Lee lash out at her attorney because the continuance will see her jailed for Christmas and the New Year. Putting up the money for her bail, Sargent thinks that will be the end of things and he will have a free conscience. However, Lee thinks he wants sex in return and goes to his apartment where the two do not have sex, but do begin to strike up an unexpected friendship.
It is rather implausible with the film trying to concoct some way to get these together and headed to Christmas with John’s family in Indiana. Some unexpected commonalities are found between them, as both grew up in Indiana and were poor, but aside from this, they are certainly an “odd couple”. He is prim, proper, and educated, while she is facing a shoplifting charge and had led a hard-knock life. The oddity and clear imbalance of their relationship - after all, once they return to New York City, John will prosecute her again - gives Remember the Night a very strange vibe. The prolonged setup as well as their drive to Indiana makes up much of the film, leaving relatively little time for the eventual Christmas celebrations. In context, it does not have the right spark. MacMurray and Stanwyck bring some charm to the road trip portion, but otherwise, the film gets bogged into some unnecessary conflict as they get arrested in Pennsylvania and have to escape. It is, as with much of the film, a strange section that never quite gels with everything else. Once it returns to the courtroom, it does not get much better and does end up leaving the film on somewhat of a low-note. Fortunately, the chemistry of its two lovers does end up saving it in the final scene, but it is a film that does something very well but does not focus enough energy on it and instead follows this needless plot thread to an unneeded conclusion.
In trying to fit within a 90-minute runtime, this extended bit before they get to Indiana may be necessary, but ends up stealing the focus from the joy of the film’s Christmas section. What joy to be found there, too! It captures so much of the feeling of going home or seeing family. The fun popping of popcorn, sitting around and singing Christmas songs, and baking sweets to snack on together, all are portrayed and felt with full force. This may be small-town Indiana, but it is quite hopping at Christmas with local celebrations, dances at the fire station, and parties for New Year’s filling their schedule and the film with touchstone moments. It is a whirlwind of a week, one that is sure to live in the characters’ minds for years afterward, bringing John and Lee closer together than they ever expected and full of warmth. Watching his mother (Beulah Bondi) and Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson) try to prod Lee in the right direction to win his heart, responding with warmth when hearing of her crimes, and always including her, is easy to be moved by. It is a section devoid of conflict or animosity, a time of togetherness and joy. Even as they say goodbye and Mrs. Sargent watches the two drive off back to New York, one can feel the pang of wanting to be together. One can put themselves in her shoes or in John’s, parting from a loved one after a great time together that must now end. It hurts and one feels nostalgic for being together right away. To evoke this quality speaks highly of Remember the Night’s overall impact, capturing not just the look but also the feel of Christmas.
As always, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are a delight together. They show the chemistry here that made them a natural pair with Stanwyck’s worldly charisma blending nicely with MacMurray’s aw shucks demeanor. Though the film built around the characters is undoubtedly bizarre, it does feed off of their cuteness together into a charming and inviting Christmas film. Leisen and Sturges perfectly capture the joy of coming together, of the hectic time together, and the longing for just a minute more when it comes time to leave. Adding in a kleptomaniac may add some odd hilarity, but nothing can distract from or dilute the genuine Christmas magic that Remember the Night exudes.",3.5
"do i genuinely have a problem with the ending (pushing for the first 90s minutes that she's not a bad person, she just isn't treated with compassion and love, then just sending her to prison anyway) or is it just because it's barbara stanwyck (too beautiful to face consequences, i'd let her rob me blind)?",4.0
"Very cute and fun -- a testament to Stanwyck and MacMurray's great chemistry and versatility.
Loved the fact that it was set in Indiana (of all places!) which gave it a quaint, homely feel. Could use a little less of the preaching of morals (no fault of the film, given the era in which it was made), but overall a very enjoyable and fun little holiday vehicle.",3.5
Very sweet. Barbara Stanwyck is one of the best things to happen to the screen.,4.0
"Mitchell Leisen seems to get short shrift as a director, his films dismissed as camp with what sometimes seems like thinly-veiled homophobia (""Billy Wilder dismissed him as a mere ""window dresser""). But when romance was involved, Leisen has a pretty solid handful of films ranging from the melodramatic to the screwball, despite what Preston Sturges or Wilder may have felt about the treatment of their scripts, and Remember the Night is certainly one of his best.",4.0
"A thief (Stanwyck) and a prosecutor (MacMurray) meet cute in an NYC courtroom then [insert convoluted classic hollywood plot] fall in love on a Christmastime road trip to homeland Pennsylvania. The first half of this feels like the prototype for Demme's SOMETHING WILD, and not just the geography and zany road trip antics but the central idea: the stiff, square man and the wacky, dangerous woman hurtling towards the inevitable or, as screenwriter Preston Sturges put it: “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” But where Demme’s film is elevated by its swerve into the treacherous horror of Ray Liotta, Liesen’s romance stays the course, slowly running out of gas and coasting to the finish line on fumes of schmaltz and sentimental Americana. Never again would Sturges let such crimes occur: seven months after this film's release, THE GREAT MCGINTY hit theaters.",3.0
"Barbara Stanwyck plays a career shoplifter who gets nabbed during the holiday season by a pawnshop owner after she tries to unload a diamond bracelet she stole from another store. She's grown up into a life of petty crime coming from a heartless mother (Georgia Caine) who appears when she returns to her Indiana home with the prosecutor of her case played by Fred MacMurray. Why they go on the road together is a bit of a stretch but a well-handled one by ace writer Preston Sturges and ace director Mitchell Leisen. The whole Indiana thing plays an important part in the film with two bands playing the beautiful and sentimental tune My Indiana Home at strategic times in the film. Stanwyck softens herself up as well as the audience as her character emerges. The trip back to New York is actually a better one than the nearly too sentimental one to Indiana, as they stop off at Niagara Falls before the inevitable courtroom scene back in New York.",3.5
I have had a hit or miss relationship with Preston Sturges and it has usually been miss. I am so glad I have not given up or I would have missed this gem. His story and the cast's acting were top-notch. There is lots of heart and I loved the ending!,4.0
"Second Christmas in a row that I've watched this one. it's surprisingly tough alongside the comedy and sentiment and Stanwyck delivers an excellent performance that impressed screenwriter Preston Sturges enough he wrote the Lady Eve for her. Sturges' autobiography suggests he had a hard time making the ending of this one work and it does shift in tone quite a bit from act to act but there is some lovely sexy, witty work from Stanwyck along the way.",4.0

"""I suppose you do this with all the lady prisoners?""
I'm pretty skeptical of the way the law seems to work in this movie; the court trial––especially at the beginning of the movie––seems pretty dubious to me. That being said, this is actually a pretty lovely little Christmas-themed romantic drama with solid performances from Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray (they always have great chemistry together). It's got some nice cozy vibes, good Christmassy atmosphere during the Christmas scenes, and its heart in a pretty good place. I personally really liked the ending and how it wasn't super neat and tidy. This movie is not probably one you really need to go out of the way for, but it's a good one to catch at least once during a holiday season.",3.0
"Now THAT is my kind of Christmas movie. Great cast, family sentimentality, the kindness of strangers, some romance and some mild peril.

"This. This is a Christmas film.
With a partnership that sparked and fizzed again later in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, the two leads have amazing chemistry. Fred MacMurray is John Sargent, a chivalrous prosecuting lawyer alongside Barbara Stanwyck as Lee Leander, petty thief who you'll find it impossible not to fall in love with. After MacMurray asks for a continuation of the trial which would result in Stanwyck spending the Christmas break in jail, he feels guilty and bails her out. With no plan other than to visit family in Ohio, they have to improvise.
Alongside some perfectly pitched acting from the two leads, the script is wonderful, penned by the same writer who infused another film which is close to my heart, The Invisible Man, with both humour and pathos. Remember the Night is constantly funny and the dialogue quick-witted, yet endearing when it needs to be. It's clever enough not to fall into the trap of over-sentimentality and isn't sickly sweet like many seasonal favourites. Stanwyck is something of a tragic figure and while the film is romantic and heartwarming at times, it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice neat bow at the end.
Criminally overlooked, this will definitely be entering my holiday season rotation alongside perennials like Die Hard and Home Alone. Do yourself a favour and give this a try as an alternative to the usual suspects. You may be pleasantly surprised.

"JB’s review: 8/10
“Barbara and Fred did a good job. Unexpected ending.”
Sturges offers delectably cutting dialogue and Leison sets the pace; Remember the Night moves invisibly from screwball to sentimental. The story moves briskly so that Leison has the time to settle on sincere characterization in lush settings.
And neither aspect compromises the other. The film successfully defends for ninety minutes a larger argument that people’s bad decisions may be due to troubled circumstances rather than a troubled heart. Stanwick and McMurray’s grounded chemistry surely helps us buy it, milking the holiday season for all its romance. Great viewing for November.",3.5

"A subtle movie about the holiday spirit, but it stars one of my all time favorite actresses, Barbara Stanwyck. She is just a natural in this. I feel like holiday movies were made for her.

It's a light-hearted romantic comedy that doesn't try to throw in any third act twists. While we see Stanwyck and MacMurray's romance blossom, I thought for sure she was going to be framed for a crime she didn't commit. Instead the movie lets us enjoy the moments, and lets the inevitable climactic court showdown lurk over the happiness of their company. Props to the movie for committing to the ending.

I rewatched Strangers on a Train just afterwards and it almost made me completely forget I watched this. I don't exactly love Fred MacMurray as a romantic lead, I think he works better with a sleazy edge like in The Apartment or Double Indemnity. This is a decent movie with sweet moments, but it also has a scene where the whole rural Indiana town celebrates New Year's Eve with a Victorian-costume barn shindig of sorts, make of that what you will. It's part road trip comedy, part Christmas small-town-home-for-the-holidays romance, part courtroom drama, and it ends on a rushed bittersweet note that makes it feel like it was all just a strange dream.",3.0

"Jail is a grim place to spend Christmas, even less so a stage to set a love story. But when Lee (Barbara Stanwyck) is threatened with spending the holidays behind bars, the dashing prosecutor Jack (Fred MacMurray) has a change of heart and posts bail for Lee.
It’s an awkward setup with a lot of cold legalese, but the pairing of Macmurray and Stanwyck warms Remember the Night into a cozy, romantic romp through the Christmas season. With Lee having nowhere else to go, Jack eventually invites her to spend Christmas with him and his family. It's typical romantic fare, but the magnetic chemistry of Macmurray and Stanwyck is irrefutable. Although they will reunite in the much darker, noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), there is a refreshing charm in watching Macmurray and Stanwyck in what initially feels like a no-frills, by-the-numbers romance.
That is, until the film’s surprising conclusion. When Lee realizes that Jack is willing to compromise his career to save Lee from jail, she pleads guilty in a climactic act of sacrifice. Jack immediately proposes marriage, but instead of the sound of wedding bells, he’s greeted with a disappointing, and yet, level-headed – wait. “If you still wanted me afterwards,” Lee whispers, “I’d be all square and you’d have plenty of time to think things over. Lots of things.”
Remember the Night relies heavily on the raw talent of its leads, but the film’s third act transcends the cliches of its early story beats. The gut-wrenching but marvelous conclusion salvages what could’ve easily been nothing more than a predictable Christmas romance, but the true fate of Lee and Jack is left up to the imagination of the audience. I personally don’t believe in the longevity of the proverbial “Hollywood romance”, but for Lee and Jack, I’d like to make an exception.",3.0
"Oh my God, Barbara Stanwyck was just the greatest wasn't she? Not to deny how beautifully constructed this is for the most part (could have done without the racist caricature, oh well), but she does an astonishing job of humanizing the character of a lower-class woman who finds the right path by falling in love. This doesn't even feel like a comedy at times: the scene where they visit Lee's old home is incredibly powerful, particularly because of subtle touches such as the haunting image of the mother peeping from inside the house for a few seconds before moving away as the couple speak at the forefront after being thrown out. The way Stanwyck breaks down after receiving a gesture of compassion a few minutes later is devastating.",4.5
"Acts of kindness towards characters who feel they are undeserving of such sympathy—and perhaps of any good in their life whatsoever—is, I would say, the thing that most wrecks me in cinema. And this film is the purest, most sustained, distillation of that. The greatest xmas movie.",5.0

"As soon as you finish the film, you’re always left with the question: 
But, why?
And the only answer you have is:
They just can’t.
And that is the most painfully bittersweet fate these characters can possibly have.
It has the sweetness of their relationship, actually one of the most compatible people you can have in two characters, they have fun together, they understand each other, they grow and empathize with each other. Credits to Mitchell Leisen’s amazing directing and Preston Sturges’ genius.
However, the bitterness is also there. Two people who will always have that side that is polar opposite. They know they can harm each other, at least she knows it, she can’t corrupt him like that, she loves him so. 
The film still feeds us with hope. If you still feel the same way we’ll pick up from where we stopped. But they still didn’t get married before she went to prison, they could but didn’t, because maybe they will never have their fairytale ending. They can’t.
I usually love sad love stories but Remember the Night just feels like too much. It is probably the only film that makes me look up for the US legislation from 1940 to see how much they’ll have to wait. But somehow it doesn’t matter, you know how it will end, and it sadly looks more like There is Always Tomorrow (1956). 
But this is still my go to Christmas Film. The film accepts it’s fate but doesn’t ler go of the hope that’s always there. The hope it build with us throughout it’s 1 and a half hour of runtime. Lee and John’s relationship development is the closest things get to real life. Their nuances are unique and can always apply to real-life situations. The sad truth behind the happy moments, but luckily their strength comes from these highlights, and there is always tomorrow.",5.0
"Bend the limits of the law for romance's sake, it's Gargus and Adept's Queer Cinema Challenge 2020! This week, we close off the spate of ""actor who probably wasn't queer but you'd never know from all the rumor mongering!"" themes with a film starring Barbara Stanwyck!
Remember the Night makes for a pleasant film built around the virtues of homespun love and small town simplicity that feels like it's teetering on the edge of having something to say. Its story, about Stanwyck's petty thief Leander being taken in over the holiday by Fred MacMurray's district attorney Sargent after he postpones her trial till after Christmas in hopes of convicting her with a less charitable jury, sees the pair travel across hill and valley to spend some getaway time with Sargent's family. These early going scenes are quiet good, if a touch strangely paced or toned in places - an early sequence with Leander's lawyer spinning a ridiculous story claiming she was hypnotized into stealing is amusing yet goes on for a long while, and most of the humor from Fred Toones' servant character is just plain stonefacing with how much he's asked to degrade himself. When the film's got Stanwyck and MacMurray alone and talking their differences out and slowly falling in love, though, it makes an enjoyable, lively march. There's some good business with the pair dancing together while Leander starts to see Sargent's more sensitive side, some fun runaround with a confusing map and a sudden interrupting cow, a nice joking country trial scene where they both surprise each other by putting their respective skills to use and respectively rising and stooping to save the other's hide, and a darkly shot, melancholic scene wherein they arrive at Leander's home and show Sargent and the audience alike just how broken and loveless it is. Story's spinning, gears are turning, actors are acting, all's right.
Once we arrive at Sargent's childhood home and dig into the holidays with his family? Remember the Night feels like it's found a cozy place to bunk for the night, settled in all safe and clean, and resolved to enjoy the atmosphere for a whole half-hour. Mark you, this stretch of the film is not empty or aimless: Stanwyck and MacMurray still put in the legwork of her adjusting to homelife full of warmth and care and people who don't belittle you for your mistakes, him trying to disguise his growing feelings for her as the hour of their court date draws closer, and both exchanging longing looks across domestic scenes to keep the spark alive. In total effect, unfortunately, Mitchell Leisen's direction puts a great deal of emphasis on that very coziness, the gentle quirks of Sargent's extended family, the loveliness of exchanging all precious gifts and singing beautiful songs and two dottering old ladies watching a young couple obviously fall for each other in the midst of a dance. It represents the film slowing down without taking time to really examine or highlight anything about our main characters, celebrating the virtues of their environment rather than what it does to them. While I am inclined to think cinematic appreciation for a time and place makes excellent film when done well, the execution here just feels too much like a studio-bound realization of such rather than an authentic slice of Americana at the movie's core. All exceedingly pleasant, and all doing terribly little to make me do much more than quirk my lips in a small smile here and there.
With Preston Sturges as screenwriter, and this being his final film for another director before he started overseeing his own scripts, one might feel inclined to think of this as a failure to find the depths in Sturges' work on Leisen's part. Personally, however, I find Sturges' screenplay lacking in what it does with the whole homestead sequence as well. When the film recaptures my interest in the final fifteen minutes, it does so with a few scenes of note - Sargent offering Leander escape as they take a detour through Canada, the pair confessing their love and agonizing over what to do next as they embrace before Niagara Falls (their reduction to shadows here and the earlier slip into darkness at Leander's home are, incidentally, both credits to Leisen's direction), and the the big mutual sacrifice where Sargent deliberately tries to sabotage his case against Leander until she willingly confesses and begs for jailtime for his sake. The idea is meant as one of equal exchange, each giving up something precious in the name of love. Consider, then, just how equitable the relationship here actually is: as prosecutor and eventually willing benefactor in one, Sargent holds most of the power in their dynamic, with Leander having little choice other than a barren holding cell over Christmas if she refuses to stay or follow. Their journey shows they can skillfully hold their own and back each other up when the going gets rough, yet emotionally Leander is coming from a broken, unloving home, while Sargent has an extensive support network as a powerful, beloved figure at work and in his old house. And isn't it ever so coincidental that the passages depicting the two falling into irrevocable love take place in surroundings bound to remind Leander of what she doesn't have, and what she could have if she treated her would-be jailer as a potential husband?
I don't think there's any sinister intent in Sturges' screenplay. There's a mismatched power dynamic at play, yes, but it's one written in the tradition of a man who has everything finding himself willing to give it all away if it means the happiness of the woman he loves, with said woman proving her devotion in an equal act of sacrifice. Even if the sacrifices aren't equal (he'll probably just lose some reputation and still have everything else to his name, she'd go to jail with as much nothing as ever were it not for a last-second marriage), they're written with the intent of balance, and play reasonably well. I say fault lies in Sturges' screenplay because there's rich, verdant fields of potential to mine at Sargent's home, far more interesting territory to mine than just showing how the innocent country life can make two people fall in love, and yet what we see onscreen is content to play at that and just that. We don't bring the loneliness or fear of love someone with Leander's backstory might have after her childhood to the forefront, don't cast any suspicion across her brow towards Sargent's intent in bringing her here, don't put challenge to the value of wholesome family values for the sake of reinforcing them with greater strength when we find genuine loving intent instead of anything sinister. That half-hour stretch could play with far more focus on what the scenes immediately preceding implied about our main characters, and instead take it all at face value for a pleasant, charming, somewhat empty romance backed by the good ol' folks back home.
I could be spoilt by seeing Stanwyck and MacMurray play at a more tempestuous, wicked love in Double Indemnity. Ironically, despite their characters falling for one another in a heat of murderous passion and falling apart as mistrust and selfish intent poisons their lives, the relationship there is more equally balanced and mutually beneficial than the one in Remember the Night. Being equally deep in the shit will do that to ya. Still, we get right to it, this film offers some strong material on one side, a workable capper on the end, and an inner core comprised of gooiness rather than some more satisfactory crunchy or solid bits. Somehow I've figured the best way to express my feelings about Remember the Night is to compare it against a Cadbury Creme Egg, probably because I had one the other night, and the experience of biting into something solid and finding an appreciable but nevertheless soft mass yielding no resistance at the center seems an even analogy. Remind me to avoid food metaphors when talking film in the future, they always get stupid weird.

"Little to add to my initial thoughts on seeing it in February. It remains one of the funniest and one of the most romantic films I've seen recently, and has what I think might be one of my favourite endings in just about any movie - such an extraordinary, unusual, complex range of emotions found in one narrative tie-up, sold to the heavens by Stanwyck in particular, whose silent performance on the witness stand in the film's penultimate scene is amongst the best work I've seen her do. Just beautiful - and festive to boot. To have seen this twice on 35mm in a single year is a real blessing.",0.0
"While the star-crossed romance between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray sizzles, REMEMBER THE NIGHT wavers between engaging melodrama and folksy, heavy-handed post-code cornpone moralism.

My first attempt was this Christmas flick, with Barbara (yes, we're on first name basis) looking her very, very best, as a shoplifter catching a lucky, in more ways than one, break and ending up spending the holiday season with Fred MacMurray's family in Indiana.
A heart warming film, that is now probably one of a very small selection of films I will go to to get my Christmas fix. A bit dated in parts, but easily forgiven in the grand scheme of things.",3.5
"Barbara Stanwyck just has this magnetic type of screen presence where she mischievously plays with morality, indulging the audience in scenarios and sequences that push past the bounds of morality before a deeper, truer heart can shine through. Although I have only seen her in a handful of roles, she just oozes the charisma of one the all time starlets and keeps pushing me to seek out more of her work. Which, having seen Double Indemnity already, it was a bit of a hoot watching her and Fred Macmurray prod and probe the boundaries of morality and the law in the romance genre a few years before making one of the greatest film noir pictures ever. Although the Hays Code meant each film would bend towards a more moral ending for each, I still really loved how this film did not fully give a prototypical happy ending, but still managed to deliver quite a cathartic character resolution for each. Just an incredibly funny and delightful picture!",4.0

"womp womp womp…
yeah, maybe for the first like the quarter or third of the film, you could more easily fall prey and say it’s a bit charming and whatnot, but once more and more iffy things start coming up, you can really start to notice how things unwise things really are in this tale. 
for starters, the whole premise—although pretty unlikely—is somewhat interesting. but, ofc, it quickly ends up being a stupid waste of time overall, since nothing progressive happens with it (if that makes sense; trying to avoid straight up spoilers here). and then throughout the rest of the film, we are constantly running into more and more mediocre aspects and problematic elements. these include, but are not limited to lack of genuine chemistry between the leads, unchecked racism towards the same one person multiple times (this all really put a huge stain on the film imo), unfunny “romcom” moments and multitude of offensive “jokes,” an unnecessary and off-putting cow breast milking scene, overly patriarchal and sexist/misogynist, an uncomfy corset scene with talk of specific waist measurements, and a rushed ending. not to mention the whole ‘city boy takes a city girl back to his old farm town to try to make things better’ thing was laughable and unbelievable at times. like, stanwyck’s character esp def did not feel right, smiley in some prissy corset and dress outfit and dancing at some hoedown and whatnot.
sigh… the film really just is quite a problematic and meandering mess of a production. i don’t get the hype and respect for it. there’s not really anything to like about it. plus, it’s all made even worse when you find out both of the leads were republicans.
…anyways, all in all, remember the night is really quite underwhelming and unsavory—far from typical romcom descriptors like endearing, heart-warming, good-humored, and witty. 
also, what night are we supposed to be remembering here? bc this takes place over a couple days and nights.",1.0
"A mix of romance, courtroom hijinks, road movie, family drama all cooked to perfection like one of Aunt Emma cookies.
John, a hotshot prosecutor with a 100% conviction rate against female defendants, manages to get a trial suspended until after Christmas leaving a pretty repeat offending thief, Lee, to languish in jail over the festive period. Feeling guilty John bonds her out but the bondsman gets the wrong idea and delivers Lee to the John’s house afterwards. John feels guilty again putting her out on the street so he offers to drive Lee way out to her hometown for Christmas, which fortuitously is close to his. Along the way various amusing and magical things happen which lead them closer to one another but does the fact that he is a highly regarded public lawyer and she a career criminal with an active case mean they can never really be together?
It’s undeniably sentimental but it isn’t afraid to take a realistic look at less fortunate family backgrounds as well as the complexity created by the somewhat ridiculous premise of a prosecutor going on a Christmas trip to see family with the defendant of a case he is working on in tow. 
Sterling Holloway unfortunately appears in this but he’s borderline watchable and has one beautiful moment where he sings a song at a piano which almost excuses his appearance.
Nice cinematography with some beautiful moody shadows when we meet Lee’s family and later at Niagara Falls. 
Check it out!",4.5

"This is the polar opposite of Double Indemnity - less soul crushing and suspenseful, it’s more heartwarming and screwball. Written by Preston Sturges it’s filled with his quirky satiric view on small town life populated with syrupy spinsters, saccharine moms, folksy country bumpkins, a backroad justice of the peace partial to locals, cows eating hats, barn dances, and sentimental songs by the fire on Christmas Eve. Yet there is an underlying cynicism in the abrupt tonal shifts into drama and dark humor pointed at the judicial system, “Midwest nice”, and the bleakness some people can have for Christmas. It also doesn’t cop out on Stanwyck’s punishment at the end, making her arc from likable but unscrupulous petty thief to redeemed lovesick convict all the more bittersweet and heartbreaking. In the end it is a little like Double Indemnity with MacMurray falling so hard for Stanwyck he is willing to turn to criminality and undermine his career as assistant DA. With her softly cooing, “Aw, geez, you’re sweet” I would commit crimes for Barbara Stanwyck too. What chemistry these two had.",4.0

"Really quite the Christmas treat! Other reviewers seem to be giving Leisen flack for toning down Sturgess' screwball patter, but personally I think it's lovely to see a rom com this heavy on the rom. Besides, it's still solidly funny and the change allows for some real pathos. The brutality of their stop at Lee's childhood home wouldn't hit nearly as hard in a zanier flick, and Leisen's dramatic priorities make the turns back to comedy a welcome reprieve. (Shay and I both lost it after that gorgeous silhouetted kiss cut to ""People aren't responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls!"") Plus the looney legal drama and late night cigarette scandal and the ENDING! Honestly, I like this whole thing more and more with each passing word.

Happy 13th of December y'all. Hope everyone is enjoying their month so far, I know I am. Today I felt like watching a bit if a Christmas classic with this old number. Always excited to watch an older Christmas movie cause the just bring an atmosphere like no other movie.
As far as the story goes, it's a relatively average romance plot. Nothing too special but it works well here, even if i felt the setup was a bit silly and too long, but whatever. I liked the two leads here quite a bit, but unfortunately I wasn't super invested in their relationship. It's a bit unfortunate as that is definitely the most important thing about the movie, so I never quite enjoyed it as much as many others. But heyo can't win them all, it's still a nice little romance movie

"A multilayered romcom that starts as a courtroom drama meet cute, moves into a road trip getting to know you, settles into a home for the holidays falling for each other, and wraps up back in the courtroom for a touch of real drama that leaves the audience with a bit of a cliffhanger for the star crossed lovers. Fred MacMurray isn’t quite overmatched by his costar — he’s capable of selling the accomplished prosecutor who has a big heart, especially for his country family — but most anyone is going to get a run for their money up against Barbara Stanwyck. When we meet her as Lee she’s committing the shoplifting that starts off the whole chain of events that lands her in John’s (MacMurray) arms and no one sells a hardened but proper lady like she can. Preston Sturges’ final film as only a screenwriter (he insisted on also directing everything after this) serves up a bloviating defense lawyer (Willard Robertson using his background as a real lawyer to scenery chewing effect), two exceedingly kind countryside sisters (Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson who carry the entire heart of this film), and an hilarious country bumpkin (Sterling “Winnie the Pooh” Holloway serving pure heartfelt ridiculousness) among many other memorable supporting and bit parts. At issue is the usual diminishing and debasing portrayal of African Americans (Fred Toones is only credited as his nickname Snowflake for his heavily caricatured role as servant Rufus), but at least it’s a cultural artifact and not the driving center of the narrative. What Stanwyck and MacMurray may lack in chemistry they make up for in polish, professionalism, and a very tender touch.",4.0
"Christmas in July anyone?
This is quite a nice film. There were a lot of great duos in classic Hollywood, and Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are among the best. Their chemistry translates perfectly to that of their characters. 
A few minutes in, we see a comedic courtroom scene which sets a lighthearted tone for the rest of the film. The storyline is enjoyable and heartwarming (as you’d expect from a good romantic comedy). There’s something wonderful about the connection between Jack and Lee. As we learn about the two characters and spend time with them, we watch them form an unexpected yet surprisingly natural romance. Of course, it’s really heartwarming watching Lee spend Christmas with Jack’s family and how they embrace her, unlike her own mother.
Barbara Stanwyck is becoming one of my favourite actresses, she delivers an absolutely electric performance in this movie. Fred MacMurray and Beulah Bondi also shine incredibly bright. I like this film a lot, it has everything you’d want out of a classic romantic comedy. Great acting, wonderful storyline, a lot of likeable characters, and a number of really funny moments.

"The first onscreen matchup of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray has become a rare Christmas classic, although it would be enjoyable any time of the year. The clever script by Preston Sturges is full of his signature banter and situational comedy and is played to perfection. The plot may seem silly but in the context of the film it all flows naturally.
In the opening scene, we see shoplifter Lee Leander (Stanwyck) lift a gorgeous jeweled bracelet, and only a few minutes later be apprehended when she tries to pass it off in downtown New York pawn shop. She's behind on her rent and struggling to keep her head above water through petty crime.
In court, the district prosecutor is young hot-shot lawyer, Jack Sargent (MacMurray), raised on a farm in Indiana, who has gained a reputation as a winner in court, who's especially good at convicting women, for whom jurors frequently have a lot of sympathy. It's the week before Christmas and the defense attorney knows the jury will not be eager to linger for a long trial, so he plays all the sympathy cards in his deck... even claiming Leander was ""hypnotized."" Of course that's nonsense but Jack knows his only chance of conviction is to delay the trial till after ""the season of giving."" That's exactly what happens when he says he'll have to call in an expert on hypnotism who is out of town for Christmas, and so wins a continuation.
So in the meantime, with the trial delayed, Sargent, who's a decent fellow, arranges bail for the beautiful dame and prepares to head back to Wabash country to see his dear old Mom (Beulah Bondi) who still maintains the working farm where Jack was raised. But through unforeseen circumstances, he finds himself stuck with Leander and when he finds out she has an estranged mother too, back in Indiana, he offers her a ride back to her hometown.
The trip by automobile is a cool adventure as they run into road construction, take a wrong detour and end up in the middle of a cow pasture the next morning. When they try to get milk into a thermos from one of the milk cows, the farmer shows up and drags the travelers off to the local magistrate for trespassing and other light misdemeanors. Of course they don't give their real names and manage to skip on the arrest after Lee starts a fire in a waste basket to create a diversion. This part is all played for laughs and comedy is a strong suit for both the lead actors. By now we're won over to the wild plot, no matter where it leads.
When they reach the house where Lee's mother still lives (with a new husband) we find out just how angry and embittered the old woman is. It's clear she has no intention of reconciling with her runaway daughter. So Jack has no choice but to take Lee with him on to his own home for the holidays.
Jack's Mom (Bondi), his Aunt Emmy (Elizabeth Patterson), and weirdly eccentric cousin Willie (Sterling Holloway, in a scene stealing performance) welcome Leander into their home and make her a natural part of the seasonal festivities. (They think she must be ""Jack's girl."") This part of the film which involves making the strange woman feel welcome, baking popovers and sharing meals, exchanging presents, and even dressing up in vintage clothing for a cornball, New Year's Eve barn dance, is the heart of the movie, and we can eat it up like popcorn. Along the way of course we realize the young couple is truly falling in love.
Jack's honest enough to share the circumstances of Lee's situation with his mom, and although she's sympathetic, she sees the danger to her son's hard-fought reputation... so she goes to Lee to plead the case for caution. This is the crisis and the nut of the film, and the resolution may move you or leave you scratching your head. There are no easy answers... that's for sure.
The Sturges magic is already evident in this early work, made before he took to directing his own scripts... (this one was helmed for Paramount by Mitchell Leisen).
I had never seen ""Remember the Night"" and it moves instantly to a list of all-time seasonal favorites. Stanwyck and MacMurray have an undeniable chemistry and they get to play ""good people."" Four years later they would reunite in the darkest heart of film noir for the classic ""Double Indemnity.""
Enjoy this one as a pleasurable romp: with courtroom screwball comedy; a picturesque road trip; an idyllic Christmas interlude; and a well acted romance... complete with a trip to icy Niagara Falls. One viewing, and you will forever ""Remember the Night.",4.5
"This year’s pick for Christmas viewing is a slightly more obscure classic, the first out of four films that paired up actors Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Courtesy of @indicator , this lovely set did manage to arrive earlier than I expected, just in time for me to plan my Christmas watch. Overall, I thought this was a lovely film, all up to the final scene which manages to pack quite a punch. Anchored in two very charming, very off beat performances, Stanwyck in particular is quite sizzling here, this has one of those screwball premises that quickly turns its plot into a rom com vehicle. Essentially, love blossoms between a shoplifter (Stanwyck) and a prosecutor (MacMurray) just when he postpones the trial after Christmas and a quick ride to her family’s place turns into them spending their whole holiday together. So it’s quite predictable in that respect, but where other situational comedies find a way to escape their dreading outcome, here director Mitchell Leisen, working off the back of a script by Preston Sturges, let’s his two protagonists fall in love but their fate together isn’t shifted by a miraculous turn of events, as they have to face the consequences of what’s on ahead. Safe to say this was quite refreshing in that regard. The Christmas and New Years setting does add to the value of seeing this over the holidays and it’s a firm recommendation from me to all couples resting their shoulders on the sofa next to the tree.",4.5

"The unexpected appearance of Preston Sturges' name in the credits was a pleasant surprise and a good omen. This is actually the final script he wrote for another director, after this point he began his prestigious phase as a writer and director, and in this film his skill for crafting characters and dialogue is quite apparent. There is a touch of his style of screwball, while also being reminiscent of Howard Hawks, but Remember the Night unfolds in a mostly sentimental and tender manner. Stanwyck and MacMurray have great chemistry, she's always had a knack for playing these smart-talking, yet elegant and emotionally fragile characters The scenes in the countryside at MacMurray's family farm are quite charming, the best scene in my opinion is when the characters are gathered in the house and the young cousin played by Sterling Holloway sings a beautifully and gently disarming rendition of ""The End of a Perfect Day.""",3.5
"Fred MacMurray plays Jack and Assistant District Attorney of New York. Right before Christmas he is assigned to prosecute Lee (Barbara Stanwyck), a young woman for shoplifting. Afraid the jury will be nice right before Christmas he gets the case delayed until after New Years. Feeling guilty he gets her out of jail and agrees to bring her to Indiana too spend time with her family. When they reject her, he brings her to his family instead. It is interesting to watch how the justice system has changed over the years. There are a lot of references to how difficult it is to prosecute a woman and what a woman should be doing in the home. The whole thing is so implausible and silly, but counter that with some real sincere moments and great casting of Stanwyck and MacMurray. They have undoubtable chemistry. Plus the ending doesn't cop out.",3.5
"This is one of the only good Christmas movies where a city girl goes to a rural setting & falls in love with a man there, and it works because the focus is almost entirely on the chemistry between our two leads and overcoming the improbability of them getting together. Oh, and the focus is also on how spellbinding it is when Barbara Stanwyck’s eyes sparkle like precious gemstones whenever she’s having any emotion ever, as any movie should be.",4.5
"So much of this movie is just watching the expressions on Barbara Stanwyck’s face, so much so that a scene towards the end between her and MacMurray leaves him in shadow for the entire exchange, while centering her face. 
I find it interesting that, although the pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray made (in my estimation) three great movies, she always represents some sort of threat to him and his way of life. Never in quite the same way - Phyllis Dietrichson represents a much more direct threat than Norma Vale or Lee Leander - but enough of a threat to prevent them from being together at the end, even in a romantic comedy.",5.0

"""But we're there now, darling.""
Barbara Stanwyck has all the pitches. She's fantastic here, bolding every scene and guiding all the tonal shifts. It's a beautiful thing there are two Stanwyck holiday films with cow shenanigans.
The bookends hold together a bit more tightly and have a nice mix of humor and romance. This is a quality holiday movie in that it has a completely ridiculous setup to the story but you don't care because the stars are charming as hell. There's a nice pace to the plot and the cinematography is surprisingly moody and elegant.
It's shameful on the representation front with Rufus. Truly unnecessary and dumb.",3.5

"Good lord, I must've forgot what it feels like to be completely smitten with someone after a few glances. Terribly tough not to cry along with Stanwyck.",4.0
"More scattered than other Sturges scripts, but the tonal shifts don’t really matter when you nail them all. Straddles the tightrope of sentiment, but we earn the coziness because Leisen leaves in cold they’re trying to escape from. Take for instance this exchange:
Mrs. Sargent: Do you remember when you took my egg money I was going to buy a new dress with? And how hard you worked to pay it back when you later understood?
John Sargent: You made me understand.
Mrs. Sargent: No, dear. It was love that made you understand.
It’s beautiful, made me blush in the theater. But later we see how that same maternal love and goodwill can lead to cruel best intentions. No one is a villain, just human frailty bouncing off each other. 
Some brilliant shots in this, Lee’s
Mother through the window, hovering there like a bad memory, the lovers in silhouette on front of Niagara Falls. MacMurray very charming, but of course this is Stanwyck’s movie because this is Stanwyck’s world. I love how we can essentially read her mind in some scenes. It’s not that she overreacts to get the point across, she holds our hand and leads us down the same thought process until we reach the conclusion with her. The movie is bookended with two looks of recognition from her. They’re a fraction different from the other, but the whole film rests on that fraction.",4.5
"Easily one of the five greatest Christmas movies ever made. Stanwyck is unstoppable. Amongst the craziness of the plot, there is a period of about eight days where everything stops. Magic ensues as the holidays begin. I felt like I was a part of this little household, and the joys and peace of Christmas filled me from head to toe. A better time and day my friends.",4.5

After the pretty dire festive Slasher Dismembering Christmas (2015-also reviewed) I was in the mood to view a more classic holiday offering. Happily catching me by surprise,my dad revealed he had recently gotten this film on DVD,leading to us learning about the night.
View on the film:
So angry with the cuts the film maker made to his script (originally titled Great Love) in pre and post-production that he would no longer allow any other director to ever use his scripts again, the screenplay by Preston Sturges is jam packed with his unique hilarious, rapid-fire Screwball Comedy dialogue, shining in the opening hypnotic bracelet shoplifting,and spinning along until the final courtroom embrace.
Editing out heroic speeches given to John Sargent, (named after the third wife of Sturges,Louise Sargent)from the original screenplay, the changes (un- credited co-writer) /director Mitchell Leisen made brings a element of silky Melodrama to this winter tale,as the quiet, self-assured Sargent falls head over heels for the troubled romantic Leander whilst driving home for Christmas.
Bringing his disincentive, delicate touch to the merriment, director Mitchell Leisen & cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff place mistletoe under the meet-cute with graceful panning shots keeping pace with the one-liners,which entwine Leander and Sargent into deep-focus romantic close-ups.
The first of four times they would team up, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray make a winning pair,thanks to the playful zest Stanwyck serves Leander’s zingers in court, bouncing on restrained, wry comedic asides that hop over into simmering Melodrama,as they try to remember the night.",4.0
"I was saving this for the actual Christmas day, but I decided to leave It’s a Wonderful Life for tomorrow/today cause it’s midnight 🥳.
I always felt that Christmas Eve was much more melancholic than Christmas day, specially in this shitty year. Something about dining together with the people I love but not being with everyone I wanted made this moment so strange that I could only wrap it with this. Not questioning the sadness within It’s a Wonderful Life, but it certainly ends in a lighter tone than this. There’s a hauntingly yet magical bittersweetness to Remember the Night, that fit the over tone of my 2020, while it obviously had a predetermined course it would eventually take, I was avoiding to face it, not much differently from what Lee and Jack were doing the entire time. 
This is probably the last time I’ll be watching it this year and I don’t know if it will still be my favorite by this time next year, but I hope I don’t forget how special it is for me and how much I’m genuinely grateful to have made it such a big part of my life.",5.0
"A modern fairy tale, an odyssey, a beautiful semi--screwball comedy laced with heart aching drama, and a love story set at the holiday season. It's filled with characters all too human and multi-layered set to a story written by Preston Sturges. I heard he was not happy with what the director/studio did with what he wrote. Maybe it needed the interference and not too much zaniness. It's plot is perfect for the Christmas holiday story backdrop. It's just as warm and delicious as Fred MacMurray's Aunt Emma's popovers.
A favorite Christmas movie to add to the memory.",4.5
"All the emotional Christmas movies are hitting me even harder this year. Remember the Night is no exception. 

I forgot just how heartbreaking and emotional this can be at times. Barbara Stanwyck’s eyes tell such a story. If your heart doesn’t melt at all of the family scenes, you’re made of stronger stuff than me. This has quickly become a holiday favorite.",4.5

"Leisen foi taxado por Sturges e Wilder como um vitrinista, um mero figurinista. Afinal, ele havia feito esse trabalho com Cecil B. DeMille, mas o vitrinista é aquele que organiza aquilo que vai aparecer ao público, retirando-se esse insulto de seu teor “comercial”, o que temos é um grande organizador da cena.
Wilder e Sturges tem estilos energéticos, e seus roteiros atuam de maneira muito distinta na mão de Leisen, fato. Afinal, o “vitrinista” dá um peso, uma lentidão aos movimentos e quase que diminui ao máximo os pontos de comédia, não é toa que muitas das piadas são ditas quase no fade out das cenas.
Todavia, é encantador o que se passa aqui, no início deste filme, roteirizado por Sturges, eu acreditava que seria um screwball comedy, pelas situações inusitadas próximos de um road movie que aconteciam, mas aos poucos foi se tornando uma obra melodramática sobre essa paixão transformadora.
John, por pena, leva Lee para passar o natal com sua mãe, é aí que de certo os dois se apaixonariam, mas Lee parece completamente amoral para John, que é carregado por um certo moralismo humanista. A descoberta da difícil vida dela o levou mais longe, ao passo que ela começou a se encantar por esse sistema ético.
O final é moralista, afinal a felicidade do amor não vence, mas vence a sua transformação. É preciso citar também o uso absurdo de velas, espelhos e tudo que produz uma magistral mis-en-scene, além das sombras e da cachoeira no fundo, é todo um aparato romântico e misterioso (portanto, erótico) tão intenso. Leisen de fato é um arquiteto de cenas, “vitrinista”, como queiram.",4.0

"What a heartbreaking film, so lusciously shot, so achingly acted, so tenderly handled. Sturges the writer was ready for this film by 1940, but Sturges the director could not have hoped to bring out the depths of the script that Leisen brings out. While Sturges the comedian and light dramatist director delivers great films like CHRISTMAS IN JULY and THE LADY EVE almost concurrently with this, it's not until HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO that Sturges can effortlessly direct drama with the same level of subtlety and richness that Leisen brings to the material here––and Sturges's choice of cinematographers ultimately limit him for his entire career from achieving (intentionally or not) the visual lushness of Leisen's films. Ultimately Sturges will deliver the quasi-cubist menagerie close-ups of HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, but the delicate shot of Stanwyck crying on the front porch of her childhood home while MacMurray comforts her and her mother looks coldly out of the front door window in the background, or the shot of her frozen in the mirror as the reflection of MacMurray's mother climbing the stairs moves to exit the room, would certainly not have existed, and they are as stunning as anything cinema can deliver.",5.0

"I have always loved this movie but I think my favorite thing about it, especially as I get older, is that Barbara Stanwyck’s character is a bad girl who doesn’t necessarily get reformed. Maybe she does, but that’s not the point of the movie. She gets to fall in love and be treated like a real human just as she is, and at her trial, she’s the one who wants to do the moral thing, not her supposedly upstanding new bf Fred MacMurray. Babs’s performance is a masterclass on portraying a complicated lady. A lesser actress would spend the whole movie looking dour and introspective, or would style her more like a femme fatale, but Stanwyck really spaces out those moments of darkness, which makes it all the more effective when her defenses finally come down.",5.0

"My first Christmas movie of the season is all about the journey. The destination itself is clear as glass from the outset but Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray make it all heartwarmingly worthwhile. The pair have an undeniable chemistry that would follow them through three more films including Double Indemnity. Sure, you know they'll end up together but the 93 minutes you spend in their company is certainly something to cherish.
THIS is what I want when I finally watch an old crimbo flick. None of that Holiday Inn blackface bullshit. Remember the Night is genuinely funny, charming and worth a watch with some mulled wine and some tinsel around the telly.",4.0
"Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and a Preston Sturgess screenplay? Heaven.",4.5
"Wonderful - this strikes me as a pretty much flawless film. The setup is perfectly handled. On the face of it, believably arranging it in the writing so that our protagonists, John and Lee, set off on the road together (as they must) is really tricky, but every line in the scene in John's apartment is scripted and played to perfection, so the unlikely premise flies.
From there, it is just incredibly sweet and funny, and when it needs to be it is quite deeply moving. Stanwyck and MacMurray have famously fabulous chemistry. Whether sharing witty repartee, emotionally wrought dramatic scenes, or just straightforward conversation, they effortlessly click. Stanwyck's face is a wonder. So many looks that just melt you. There are times she looks at MacMurray and it's almost like you can literally see the love radiating from her features. And she has brilliant comic timing too - I loved her performance in the Justice of the Peace's office, for example. Her reactions to MacMurray's unspooling of his invented identity are priceless.
Also, it's another great Christmas film - something that usually goes down well with me. The scenes in the Sargent family home, particularly the moment Stanwyck realises that his family have somehow made her presents (""hour of ecstasy!"" - one of the biggest laughs, snuck into one of the most moving scenes), are so good. Pure, and heartwarming.
There's nothing really that doesn't work. The cow scene is inspired. The early courtroom scene is really funny; kind of an outlier tonally, but a flying start to the movie. And then, there's the ending…
Now, I may have a slight track record of imposing happy endings onto films that end ambivalently, or sometimes - according to some people! - thoroughly sadly. But from what I can see, though clearly there is a significant element of glorious heartache in play here, this ending is one to feel really good about.
More than anything, I'm relieved it ended so sensibly - with Lee showing a desire to a) pay for her crimes and b) protect John to a sensible extent by not allowing him to throw a case, or rush into marrying her - but crucially with her stating that once she has gotten ""all square"", and once John has had time to cool down and think it over, then they could potentially get married. Not a cut and dry ending (and all the better for that), but one that is realistically happy. I was worried when John's Mother gave the big protective speech in Lee's bedroom that it was going down the road of Lee simply refusing to be with John, ever, to 'protect him'. That would have been overly simplistic and would not really have made realistic sense or served these intelligent characters well - of course there is every chance they can be together, they just need a bit of time to straighten themselves out, and then they can see. Sturges finds a way to get us there, and given how much I had invested in the film by that point, given how much Stanwyck and MacMurray and indeed Sturges's charms had me rooting for these two, I am enormously grateful for that. Love reforms her, and in her redemption she saves a good man into the bargain….and though they may ache for now, there remains a possible way forward. It's sad, it's happy, it's kind of everything at once. Not quiet bittersweet, but something else. However you might label its particular combination of emotions, it's perfect. Very clever, emotionally astute, and timelessly so. A microcosm of the entire movie. I loved it.",0.0
"A great film and an odd one. Turns from screwball to outright sentimental drama, and on to something even darker and more surprisingly complex. It's got the most interesting ending to a classic hollywood film I've seen in quite some time.",0.0
"THOUGHTS
I thought this was only okay. I was hoping for sharper, wittier dialogue, especially with Barbara Stanwyck involved and Preston Sturges as the scriptwriter. Given the premise — a prosecuting attorney stuck over Christmas with the woman he’s prosecuting — I think this could have been a good screwball comedy. But it’s much more of an earnest and sentimental romance. For me, there was nothing very special about Remember the Night, though I will say the end was surprisingly un-Hollywood-like.

Preston Sturges hung around the set and became friends with Barbara Stanwyck. He promised to write a film just for her. That film turned out to be screwball classic The Lady Eve.

"The first film from the 1940s in my chronowatch! And weirdly enough, possibly the earliest depiction of popcorn in a movie that I've seen? Can't think of anything before this
Watching these Sturges written films might be doing wonders to prepare me to his actual directorial work, and this is the very last film that he worked on exclusively as a writer before his director debut. I like it but maybe not as much as I wished I did. Maybe it's the fact that I hate christmas and christmas movies but whenever a film becomes a christmas film I kinda tune off and feel completely nothing out of it
I mean, it did have some heartwarming moments, and I do like how this goes from a possible noir set-up to a holiday/christmas romance film back to the Hays Code fatalist ending, it's a beautiful and fresh narrative path. I just don't care much for the whole saccarine christmas spirit vibe.

"apparently most people say that the ending of remember the night is a sad one, but i don’t completely agree. it ends with lee leander confessing to her crime and being locked away from civilisation for a while. i believe (by reading reviews) the majority of the audience are emotionally invented in the relationship between jack/john sargent and lee leander which is understandable due to how it’s grows and develops into such a great emotional connection between the two. being invested in their relationship makes it understandable why you’d consider it a sad ending because you’d want them to be happy and be able to live a peaceful life together. the ending gave so much character growth to lee because after being accused of stealing three times before and stealing longer than she could remember she was constantly running away, she finally has some security and knows exactly what she needs to do to make things that are in her power right. this growth would have only been possible by her exposure to the sargent family; jack was loving and welcomed her into his home as did the rest of his family, they treated her as one of their own and she took part in their traditions which was something she never experienced in her own home. they all brought her love in both ways that she felt love and she had love to give out to them, she got treated as she should have as a kid, which inevitably shows the audience the true meaning of christmas. lee leander stole to get that thrill that she couldn’t find anywhere else and she needed it because her family had always cheated her out of anything good. with confessing lee gets to know her true self and she finally has something to live for. the last glimpse we see is her being surrounded with love when she’s being locked away for a long time, and it helps her so incredibly much. she doesn’t need to hide (herself) anymore. 
though remember the night was written for carole lombard, i personally believe that the character of lee leander is very reflective of stanwyck herself. in one way, lee is quite a reserved person much like missy who never went out to parties like she was supposed to and when she did she kept to herself and brought a book to bury herself in, but when surrounded with people they’re comfortable with their true self comes out and nothing else matters.",5.0

"“People aren’t responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls, this is New York!”
A small, tight rom-com/drama with great performances from the leads and supporting cast. This is unsurprisingly a terrific script from one of my favorite writer/directors Preston Sturges—the entire construction of this movie is sort of perfect. The first act struggles to find its footing somewhat, but once they get to Indiana this takes off into a lovely, engaging, funny, and quietly devastating movie. 
Barbara is maybe at her most luminous, you can’t take your eyes off her from that first shot on 5th avenue till the end. The ending is a gut shot but perfect.
Complete side note, but what on earth are flannel cakes and fried mush as breakfast options?!?",4.5
"It's pure ache, a slow burn pang, a sentimental world Sturges would rarely return to after, and you have to wonder how much Leisen tweaked it to that end. The Lady Eve does have some of Night's afterglow however.
Romantic Canon, by which I can only describe in the Borzagean means if not the same MO. Going to the movies in 1940 and having to choose between this and Shop Around The Corner is such a scary thought now. Paramount production values, Ted Tetzlaff and Edith Head are perfect companions to Leisen's fleshing of luxuries and muted punctuation, visually, during intense dramatic pulses (the scene leaving Barb's mom's house, Niagara Falls, many more). Christmas in part but Christmas throughout, perhaps more Christmas than most, if that makes sense. It is made with love, a more Leisen than Sturges thing (Sturges is far from incapable of that but still true), which I'm very susceptible to.
As much as I adore Easy Living, the other great Leisen/Sturges collab, and I admittedly still like more, RTN is probably better, if not by much and very differently. Which leads me to repeat my conviction that when Women's Pictures and Weepies stopped being a primary product of Hollywood, and box office performers, the movies themselves suffered greatly. There are some clues as to a return but this is still wishful thinking.
At any rate, I can't wait to see it again next Christmas or sooner.",5.0

"Nice, old-fashioned charmer with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck playing nicely off other, as they would in three more films over their careers. But this is the first one, and it's a sentimental tale set at Christmas, where Stanwyck, as Lee Leander (love that name!) is arrested for stealing a bauble from a jewelry store. Turns out she's a small-time thief and as she goes before the court, MacMurray is Jack Sargent, the prosecuting attorney. He's serious about his career and he manipulates the blowhard defense lawyer into going on and on, loving the sound of his own voice. Jack's trick is that if they had given the case to the jury that day, the jury most likely would have been very lenient on Lee, not wanting to send a woman to jail on Christmas. So he stalls, and the rest of the trial is put off till after the new year.
Jack feels bad about Lee being stuck in jail though, actually being an old softy, so he arranges with a bail bondsman friend to get Lee out for Christmas. Jack thinks that's the end of it, but he sees Barbara has no place to go, having no money. They find out they're both from Indiana, so he agrees to drive her out of New York to see her mother in her old small town, not far from his birthplace.
They bond over the trip, and when Lee's mother turns out to be a cruel old bat who won't forgive her for past misdeeds, Jack gallantly invites her to spend Christmas with him and his family. Once there, Lee is greeted with open arms like a member of the family. Jack's mother, Mrs. Sargent, is played by that great supporting actress Beulah Bondi, who had a long career in film and television. Jack's Aunt Emma is played by Elizabeth Patterson, who was in almost a dozen episodes of I Love Lucy, mostly as the elderly neighbor Mrs. Trumbull. And rounding out the household is farmhand Willie, acted by Sterling Holloway, who is probably most known as the familiar voice of Winnie the Pooh.
Of course, as they spend Christmas through New Year together in such a homey setting, Jack and Lee begin to fall for each other. Mrs. Trumbell had felt sorry for Lee all along, but when she sees them kiss at the New Year's Eve barn dance, she begins to worry about how it will affect her son's career. She knows that Jack will probably do anything to see that Lee gets off, and she's right. So she secretly has a talk with Lee, turning the screws on her emotions about Jack having come up from nothing and working himself to the bone to make a name for himself. Well, it works and Lee tries to distance herself from Jack but he's having none of it.
From here on, it's a back and forth as to whether Jack will throw the case to get Lee free, or if she'll confess to stealing. What happens is really well-acted and although some may want to score the film higher marks for leaving us hanging a bit, I wanted to know how it turned out. So we're left haning a bit but it's better to think that things will turn out well for both of them as they both admit their love for one another.
Very well done holiday movie with two stars just hitting their stride, with only great things to come for both of them. Recommended.",4.0
"The America of the 1940s was a country in transition, the great technological leap forwards of the early part of the century had turned the country into the world’s premiere industrial power while the depression and the political turmoil it prompted put it on a path from innocence to empire. Behind laid farms and ahead laid the suburbs of the 1950s; and social arrangements were no more stable, with urbanization and the war thrusting women into the workforce — and the factory — with the resulting countermove of repression soon to come.
Amidst this social and political turmoil, the great shapers of the national soul — its filmmakers — knew exactly how to represent this pandemonium back to the public: put Barbara Stanwyck and a man on screen and have the early stirrings of their love be disturbed by a cow.
This would happen again five years later in Christmas in Connecticut.",0.0
"More melodrama than I was expecting, but I’m not complaining… Classic movies do it right with the eternal soft focus, great writing, and the Barbara Stanwyck magic. Fred and Barbara silhouetted against Niagara Falls? That’s cinema, baby.",3.5
"Remember the Night is quite different from the other Christmas films made around this era. The film itself is a solid rom com but also shows it age with the unfortunate racism that is scattered across a lot of films from this era. However, the film itself is quite solid and has wonderful acting from Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray who both have great chemistry together on screen. Barbara Stanwyck alone is quite great and elevates the film to have a more modern feel with her style of acting. Another highlight of the film is Preston Sturges witty writing style and comedic satire.",4.0
"Barbara Stanwyck is a delight here and it’s nice to see her in a more sweet and vulnerable role considering the harsher, femme fatale types she’s known for playing. Her and MacMurray make a great pair as always.
The film has plenty of heartwarming moments but never really gets out of first gear for me. Could do a lot worse though if you’re looking for a cosy Christmas movie!",3.0
"I’m fairly sure I’ve seen this on TV before, it’s a good one featuring a great performance by Stanwyck.  She could play anything but I think she really was the best at these kind of emotional roles (Stella Dallas also comes to mind).  Her character largely relies on Stanwyck’s ready ability to play this sort of gal with a hard past and bring a stunning amount of pathos to the role.  Get your hanky this is one of those sad and bittersweet Christmas stories.  It’s maybe a little heavy on 1940 era morality (we can’t allow anyone to get away with a crime!) but ends up being a far less straightforward tale because of it.

"Original Review Here
Criterion recommended I watch this again and who am I to argue? This is just delightful.
I love that the script so perfectly helps us understand both characters on a deeper level about 30 minutes in when they both visit their childhood homes in Indiana together. In just two scenes, your appreciation for both of them grows leaps and bounds due to really effective writing and great performances.
Also, was there anyone better in her time than Stanwyck when it came to communicating without talking? My God. Sometimes you could only see half her face in profile, but her reactions and expressions said more than the page could ever communicate.
I love this movie three thousand.",4.0

"Remember the Night is:
1) A sexy/funny romcom/roadtrip movie (a lawyer and a thief somehow wind up paired together over Christmas).
2) A ""simple acts of kindness and decency can change the world"" movie.
3) An ""our heroine undertakes an enormous personal sacrifice to save a loved one movie (a la Stella Dallas)
And any one of these three movies would be excellent on its own, but what moves Remember the Night into the pantheon is that it somehow manages to be ALL THREE OF THESE AT THE SAME TIME.
I don't think Hollywood movies can get better than this.",5.0

"This was good, but the ending was completely absurd. I’ll tell you what they should have done:
- Keep the scene where the judge tells his confidante about his suspicion towards Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.
- Let Stanwyck realize that MacMurray is throwing the case in her favor, but let her have fun with it. A comedic realization, not a dramatic one. 
- Bring back Stanwyck’s lawyer for another silly monologue
- Jury goes to decide the case. Court reconvenes after ten minutes. She is acquitted.
- Stanwyck & MacMurray walk out, arm in arm. The judge is furious about it, but can’t do anything. They are happy and in love. The end.",3.5

"Much like DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Fred MacMurray is so obsessed with Barbara Stanwyck that he is driven to unethical and illegal acts ... only it's a charming Christmas movie.",4.0
"Cannot hold an Advent candle to that other Stanwyck Christmas vehicle, but I might just incorporate this into my usual Christmas canon going forward. Remember the Night contains some of the most tender and bucolic Yuletide scenes in any movie. It’s essentially a “big city girl goes back to [her/her love interest’s] small town for the holidays” plot, just like a Hallmark movie really, but with an intelligent script that makes room for darkness and never really does the expected thing. Yet somehow this is a romantic comedy, with carols around the piano on Christmas Eve, comical local color, a Hoosier barn dance on New Year’s Eve, and blisteringly charming performance by my fave and yours, Barbara Stanwyck. I love Christmas in Connecticut more as a whole, but she is perhaps even more charming on all levels here, and the chemistry is better with Fred MacMurray than with Dennis Morgan.
I do think there is a bit too much time spent in the courtroom, though, and for a Christmas movie about somebody’s broken heart being mended, I longed for Beulah Bondi to be more unabashedly accepting of Stanwyck than she is. I want to imagine Stanwyck and MacMurrary returning with joy one day to that small Indiana town, but unfortunately I imagine there being a bit of that “I’ll never forget what your mother said to me before we got married, the old battle axe” dynamic  as eternally part of their conversations on every road trip home.",4.0

"A really adorable movie. Its a testament to Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck's chemistry and acting ability that despite the fact Ive only seen them play nefarious roles I totally bought into them as sympathetic and lovable leads.
However, I got really distracted by the extremely racist portrayal of MacMurray's servant character in the film, Rufus. Its every stereotype of African American ""servant"" characters of this period of Hollywood rolled into one. I got interested in the actor who played him, and to my surprise, he IS actually credited in the film.
His name was Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones, and unfortunately he was no stranger to this kind of role. He appeared in upwards of 300 films until he died in 1962, only about 70 of which he received on-screen credit in. He played a porter fifty times, along with other domestic roles such as elevator men, valets, cooks, and bellhops. He played a shoe shiner six times, and apparently WAS the actual shoe shiner at the Republic Studio lot.
I found an article about him from his hometown, from 1942. The following is a quote: ""He's satisfied. He holds no grudge with the life Hollywood has handed him, is more than satisfied with the money and the compensations his roles have rewarded him."" One wonders what he really thought about the kind of roles he was forced to play.
I dont know what my point is, really. Just that this kind of racist typecasting was the norm for this period, and for every beautiful and glitzy romance there is probably a good amount of pain behind a bit player who only has a few minutes of screen time.
I hope he got payed well.",3.5

"God I love Barbara Stanwyck. And damn does she look insanely good without those bangs... I loved this story very much, the plot, the gradual romance blossoming, the emotional moments... I recognise that Double Indemnity, in which Barbara and Fred also played together, is the better movie, but personally I actually like their interaction better here. The only obvious problem is the stereotypical, uhm, let's say, not very intelligent portrayal of Rufus, but since a buttload of movies from the past have the same issue, I won't linger on that too much.
Sidenote, I've noticed in these old movies the endings are sometimes a little abrupt. I would have loved just a tiny little bit more movie to see the actual consequences of everything that preceded and find out if John actually stuck by Lee, but maybe that would have made the movie slightly worse, I'm not sure.",4.0
"Fred MacMurray plays a small town country boy turned suave Manhattan Assistant District Attorney. Barbara Stanwyck plays the shoplifter he’s trying to put in prison. Arrangements made in and out of the courtroom find the two taking a road trip to their native Indiana and to each other’s hearts. 
Anyone who has seen Double Indemnity knows MacMurray and Stanwyck have incredible chemistry, and the screenplay by Preston Sturges provides laughs and heart in equal measure. The courtroom scenes feel like they could have inspired Intolerable Cruelty and the road trip scenes even conjure the unlikely romanticism of Out of Sight. Had Sturges directed this, it probably would have been zanier, but in Mitchell Leisen’s capable hands, Remember the Night is a light, fun, and emotional Christmastime affair.

"Feels like the model for Something Wild so yeah, loved it. I think the only other person who’s done it better than Stanwyck in this movie is probably Stanwyck in a half-dozen other movies",4.5
"No disrespect, only meaning to right the disregard  with which most people come to Leisen as “the director who made Wilder and Sturges step behind the camera:” Sturges could get what Leisen does out of the automat scene in Easy Living, but he could never get what Leisen does out of the scene between Stanwyck and Bondi after the New Years Eve party in  Remember the Night. It is one of Stanwyck’s finest moments, brought out by a director who knows how to slow down and let her run the table, from ire to bitterness to despair, to spite, to resignation, and Stanwyck needs hardly a word to convey all of it, while Leisen splits her in two halfway through the scene, old sweet mother America on the stairs haunting her reflection, meaning well while putting the boot down.",5.0
"Another unusual, sophisticated film made by Mitchell Leisen who, much like Frank Borzage, carried sensibilities that laid ahead in time. It's a weeper, the noir of the romance genre, where lawyer Fred MacMurray takes a liking to Barbara Stanwyck, the woman he is prosecuting for shoplifting. Already there we have a story that a Frank Lloyd or even big shots like William Wyler or King Vidor wouldn't touch. There is an open complexity to the film, a lack of token moralism - a more conventional version of this film, from this era, would paint the story as a pious tragedy; a man of good stature fallen due to his carnal flaw, a woman already fallen, lost. Presupposed in such moralism is that everyone should confirm to one kind of religious and conservative order. Instead Remember the Night never judges the characters for falling in love. They are free, at least within the film, to think and feel what they want. It's not for Hollywood to tell them what is right and wrong.
The film grows more and more sublime, as MacMurray gets the trial extended over Christmas and New Year and fixes Stanwyck's bail. Together they travel out into the country over Christmas - even platonically, their escapade is illegal, but the film never even makes it an elephant in the room. Stanwyck's tender performance is like chocolate that slowly melts in your mouth against the archaic country Christmas atmosphere; heat meets cold in a film that never betrays its down-to-earth emotional ambiguity. One wonders for a while where the film is going. Then, eventually, you never want it to end.

The way this shifts from a cute little comedy into something incredibly tender and vulnerable is so beautiful,5.0
"La película comienza como una comedia guiada por la viveza y velocidad propia de lo que seguramente aporto Preston Sturges, pero a partir de una escena ominosa, el encuentro con la madre de Stanwyck, donde no hay comedia ni cariño, la película se carga de otra manera y comienza su periplo hacía el drama moral.
Los personajes se van enamorando, la película construye esto de la forma que mejor sabía hacer el cine clásico, filmando pequeños gestos en situaciones compartidas, las manos y las miradas, un pañuelo, el como va variando el gesto de apoyarse sobre el hombro del otro; para un momento en que los protagonistas amanecen juntos y protagizan una pequeña escena cómica ya están enamorades, aunque capaz ninguno de los dos cayo en la cuenta. Teniendo en cuenta el destino carcelario de Stanwyck la película ya comienza a cargar por debajo sus imágenes.
Cuando llegamos a las secuencias más tiernas y edificantes de la película, la navidad con la familia de él, hay dos cargas -una del pasado y otra del futuro- que lo construyen todavía más este momento como una isla luminosa aíslada. El pasado de Stanwyck es oscuro, todo lo contrario al amor que esta recibiendo en esa casa, se ve en las lagrimas que asoman seguido sus ojos, pero también ella sabe desde el principio que esto es un compas porque al volver de estas holidays la espera el regreso a lo que ha heredado de esa infancia, su vida de crimen, de pobre y la cárcel.
Pero de todas maneras la semana con la familia de él se vive como una reconversión, es dónde empieza el juego muy complejo moral de la película, la familia acoge a la Stanwyck, la hace una de ellos, la trata desde un principio como una igual, la ""eleva"" y le permite vivir desde otro lugar moral la vida, pero ese lugar conlleva también por un lado habitar otra clase social y por otro tomar la tradición (utiliza el vestido de la tía), el debe ser femenino (el corsé para achicar la cintura) y, claro, la familia. Desde nuestro punto de vista actual todos elementos de alguna manera cuestionados, pero que sentimos (como lo siente la Stanwyck) como lugares acogedores, que la reciben, que dan significado donde antes había cinismo frente al mundo; digamos eso que a veces el cine clásico hace tan bien de hacernos ver de otra manera esta sobre-determinación de ""american way of life"" y dónde están los que podrían ser sus lugares más cálidos, pertenecer a algo. A lo largo de toda esa semana de holidays, junto a la Stanwyck, nosotros también pensamos que hay una esperanza, una salvación a pesar de toda la carga que veníamos trayendo, ya estamos esperando el final feliz, la entrada definitiva de Stanwyck a ese mundo acogedor de la familia y el cariño.
Pero el último día pasado con la familia ocurre esta escena increíble: lo que no se ha dicho en ningún momento de manera explicita encuentra su lugar entre susurros en la oscuridad de la noche en una habitación a medio iluminar. Estas bases de la vida moral solo se pueden sostener en columnas rectas, duras, y que no pueden más que herir terriblemente al personaje de Stanwyck (solo ver su rostro durante esta escena). La madre cariñosa, la que se nos ha mostrado como el personaje más bueno de la película -y no por esto lo deja de ser- le pide por favor que deje ir a su hijo, que ella, con su vida turbia no debería estar con él; no hay perdón, cada uno pertenece a su mundo moral y social, separados, y por más buena voluntad y desprejuicio que se ponga entre susurros se busca mantener un orden.
Algo se rompe en ese momento en la Stanwyck y determina lo que hará su personaje en el resto de la película, por más que ella hiciera la conversión, hiciera el cambio moral, tomara la tradición y la familia como suyas, no hay posibilidad, no hay redención y esto queda marcado en su cuerpo de tal manera que lo que nos reconfortaba se vuelve pesado, duro, inamovible y ni siquiera nos permite el happy ending hollywoodense.

"”You treated me like a sister.” Well, he kind of did. There’s simply not that much chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Freddie MacMurray. Sweet but slightly disappointing movie. Stanwyck gives a radiant and emotional performance as usual and MacMurray just feels like an uneven pairing. They are like from two different movies. That almost works though as the story is about meeting of opposite realities of the main characters.

So I didn’t buy it. But Fred MacMurray bought it, hook line and sinker. I just didn’t fully buy the little Christmas miracle that this movie tries to sell us. But with Barbara and Fred’s screen presence I almost bought it by the end. Other than that it’s an ok enough movie.

As impressive as the amount of genres and settings the film hops through, is the way in which it stealthily includes serious moments in comedy scenes and lands comedy lines in the more serious scenes.

"If the whole thing was as good as the glorious middle section, it would've been one of the greats. Unfortunately, these opening bits in the courtroom with the defense attorney drag interminably. It really picks up when Stanwyck and MacMurray get on the road and begin bonding. Everything at John's house where Lee is cozying up with his family and falling in love is tremendous. I especially liked the scene where Mrs. Sargent puts her hands on Lee's shoulders and re-assures her. Stanwyck is so good here, perfectly emoting the impact physical closeness has on her, which her own family clearly failed on. The conclusion is far too swift, and has an air of inevitably that left me unsatisfied. I guess I was expecting something to happen in the courtroom that would work dramatically while also providing the big happy ending this movie deserved. Oh well.

Rewatch 12/17/22: Upgraded To Four Stars:
Atleast I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong. What a gem this is. The direction is so steady and confident in the material it never becomes maudlin. I'm glad Mitchell Liesen directed this and not Sturges, because this could've gone horribly wrong in a heartbeat. I had recently commented in my review of The Lady Eve that that film was Stanwyck's best performance, but I'm going to call it a tie. Who wouldn't fall madly in love with her here? She spends half the film with tears in her eyes, and every one feels completely warranted. When she turns around and non-chalantly says ""Gee, you're sweet."" I can hardly think of a more realistic and perfect bit of writing and line delivery. This should actually be slightly out of place at this point in the film as it divulges Lee's infatuation with John a little early, but it's so perfect it doesn't matter. I also love the subtly great camerawork such as their first dance early on that moves into a close-up of the singer, or the pan in the barn leading to the couple kissing for New Years. Even after two viewings, the four stars is still tentative, and I expect this to climb higher.",4.0

The writing is also weak in other aspects. The movie is absolutely directionless until halfway through it decides to actually be about something. I am honestly shocked that the same person who wrote this went on to make The Lady Eve a year later.
Barbara Stanwyck gave an excellent performance, but that's also like saying the sky is blue. She looked especially stunning as well, and her character shoplifts and commits arson so of course she's goals. Iconic. Meanwhile Fred Macmurrey's character is complete cardboard. In the last scene Macmurray actually injects some life into the character with a very passionate performance, but too little too late for me.

Barbara Stanwyck is awesome but not enough to carry this mediocre movie. The concept was intriguing but the execution was lacking. Because it took place over one week, I’m not actually sure which night we’re supposed to remember, so the title doesn’t really work. 
I did find it funny to see how the roads pre-Ike’s Federal Highway project were a part of the story and a clear joke. But the road trip part of the movie was too short, would’ve built up the romance better if they’d made that the key to the movie, not the family hang out in Indiana. 
And seriously, 1940, with the awful/racist Black housekeeper stereotype character and the not one but two Chinese jokes?? I know it was 80 years ago but still…

"This is a borderline all-time classic but for two things:
1. The unfortunate exploitation of great performer Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones (listed only on the credits as ""Snowflake"") so the audience could get cheap, racist laughs in and...
2. Willard Robertson's lengthy summation to the jury that takes almost ten minutes. The basic joke is that he overplays his hand and brings up hypnotism that MacMurray is then able to use as a continuance since it wasn't brought up in trial. This could have been accomplished in a few lines. Robertson plays up the summation as broadly as possible and it creates a gaping dead space right at the start of the movie!
Both the racist caricature and over-cooked trial scene happen in, and, in fact, take up the first 15 minutes.
That would kill most movies and I know people who told me they gave up. I can't imagine many films exist that would be able to survive that but everything that follows is pure gold. Stanwyck and MacMurray, in their first screen pairing, have wonderful chemistry and the small town community that MacMurray takes her too is charming and giving. It really is a masterpiece - after that first 15 minutes.
So docked a star for a disastrous start. Otherwise, great movie.",4.0
Barbara Stanwyck binge! They really had no chemistry in this. My first introduction into Mitchell Leisen’s filmography.,2.5
"Very strange that Criterion put this up in the month of May with their Mitchell Leisen collection, and not with their Christmas collection last year, but whatevs. Famously known for being the last script that Preston Sturges wrote while not being a director (of which is the fault of Mitchell Leisen, who took various liberties with the script, of which his changes I actually agree, and feel makes a stronger film then that of which Sturges wrote.) Leisen famously “watered down” a lot of the dialogue involving Fred MacMurray, and had the film focus more of its attention on Barbara Stanwyck’s character, and I feel these are much better/needed changes, since everything in film should always be about showing, not telling (not sure if Preston Sturges was early in his career or something, and didn’t understand this), but the lack of dialogue for MacMurray works alot better, and makes him come off more charming especially during the films second act, which makes for a great sentimental/somber Christmas film. The films script smartly balances a fine line of MacMurray taking Stanwyck’s character to see his folks, of which they get into various adventures along the way (the cow scene reminded me a lot of the horse scene in ’The Lady Eve’, when the horse keeps butting in all the time), all the while never feeling like MacMurrays character is trying to “get lucky”, but instead is feeling guilty. As Struges himself once described the film, “Love reformed her, and corrupted him”. 5/5

"It’s no illusion that Barbara Stanwyck has played more than her fair share of fallen women. It’s also not as if there’s not a reason for this, as she lends herself as a performer to so many of the facets of what being troubled could mean. What she brings to her petty thief in Remember the Night is perhaps a heavy dose of forlorn denial and reflection, as Lee Leander is walking a tightrope to prison and has to come to terms with what stealing pretty baubles has gotten her through the years. Forming a pillar for her fallen woman to rest upon is Fred MacMurray as John Sargent, the opposing counsel with the DA’s office, smooth and suave and too good at his job as he lets Lee’s attorney talk her right into a tight spot. Past the conceit of these two characters, the film takes swinging turns at being sweeping and cathartic to almost trite. As chemistry and rapport builds between Lee and John in an ill-advised, well-intentioned trip to Indiana, we even begin to root for them, as star-crossed as that fate may seem out the gate. It’s at that inevitable end, though, that the line through the story begins to fray a little as Fred MacMurray takes the love that John begins to feel and imbues it with hangdog saccharine as he pouts and fights and puts his job on the line to keep Lee to himself and out of jail. Prior to this, he’s the aforementioned pillar, stable as Lee isn’t, showing her what it means to have a loving family and a warm home for Christmas. The hardened grace with which he removes her from her hostile mother’s home is admirable, and the way he has to learn how to weasel out of tough situations like she does makes for plenty of cute moments. However, so much of that is lost in this character revelation, as he becomes a soft mess the moment he realizes he loves her. It retroactively makes many aspects in the film far less forgivable, like John’s butler who’s as loud a stereotype as they come, or Sterling Holloway playing the hired help for John Sargent’s mother and is equally simple and just as unnecessary. Remember the Night has some layered and deep moments, but so much of it is repeated or bolstered with fluff that much of the poignancy is lost already once it comes time for resolution.",3.0

"After watching Double Indemnity, I wanted to see if Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck worked together in any other films. It turns out this one was their first time working together. Seeing them together again felt really odd. It was like some weird alternate universe and it was funny because I still had their characters from DI on my mind (I watched it just yesterday). But anyway, this film was really cute and heartwarming. Things progressed at a perfect pace, with the exception of the ending because I thought it was a bit rushed. The camaraderie between the characters John and Lee was really nice to see. I love that John always looked out for Lee even though their circumstances were far from normal. 
These two have undeniable chemistry together and I swear it just bursts through the screen. It’s no wonder they were teamed up again for DI. I‘m a sucker for mismatched-couple kinda plots. A District Attorney falling for a criminal? Yeah, I didn’t need to know any more and my finger was on the play button. I’ve watched many older films and I haven’t been captivated by the couples like I have with Fred and Barbara. Individually and together, I love them. The way they say their lines, the emotions in their eyes alone, and how it’s like I’m watching them in person and not on a screen. I wonder if this natural way of acting was new to the scene back then. Love these two a lot and I definitely recommend this cute Christmas movie.

Not to take anything away from Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra but it’s kind of too bad the rights on this didn’t lapse decades ago so it could have been shown perennially and become the widely seen holiday classic it deserves to be.,4.5
"My first Christmas movie of the season. And even though I was told that it's not as noir as the Double Indemnity stars might suggest, I was surprised at how un-dark the story is. MacMurray plays a district attorney who - through a series of perhaps unwise, but also understandable decisions - finds himself having dinner with the defendant (Stanwyck) in a case he's successfully requested be postponed until after the holidays. Dinner leads to the revelation that both characters come from the same rural area, which leads to MacMurray offering to drive Stanwyck home to see her estranged mother for Christmas.
Hilarity doesn't ensue, but heart-warming does. MacMurray's character is a tough, smart lawyer, but also a kind man. He has a line I wish I could remember where he explains to his own mother why he's done what he's done. Basically, Stanwyck may be a thief, but she's also a human being and she's hurting and MacMurray wanted to help her. I found that profoundly touching. As I did the rest of the movie.",4.5

"Aufgrund einer strategischen Urteilsaufschiebung zu Gericht, bringt der gegnerische Rechtsanwalt (Fred MacMurray) die Diebin Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) über die Weihnachtsfeiertage ins Kittchen. Aus schlechtem Gewissen löst er jedoch ihre Kaution.
Was die beiden über kurz oder lang, bzw. die Feiertage über, zusammenschweißt.
Die Grundidee schon mal naiv genug, erzeugt die herzige Geste gleichermaßen Selbstlosigkeit und Mitgefühl. In selber Manier setzt sich die Geschichte des wunderlichen Pärchens fort. Denn über kl. Umwege und einem schrägen Road Trip - der in der Pampa endet - bleibt nichts anderes übrig, als die Gaunerin zur Familie mitzunehmen.
„Sie nehmen mich mit nach Hause?“
„Ja, warum nicht.“
Schon bricht sie in Tränen aus.
Das mag textlich nicht besonders ergreifend wirken, könnte in der Umsetzung aber nicht bewegender ablaufen; da der Dame durch ihr bisheriges Leben jegliche Zuwendung abhanden kam. Wenn dann noch die familiäre Häuslichkeit/Liebe über sie hereinbricht, kocht das nicht nur Lee Leander weich, sondern auch den Zuseher.
„Sind sind alle viel zu gut.“
Die Reise über Weihnachten/Silvester hin zum erneuten Gerichtstermin (03. Januar) findet zwar wenig Zeit sich in seiner Sentimentalität zu laben (Atmosphäre), hierfür werden zu schnell die Schauplätze gewechselt, begeistert aber mit gewitzten Dialogen, unglaublich herzigen Momenten und einer ebenso rührenden Gesangseinlage; in einem romantischen Spiel gaunerhafter Moral - was zuweilen ziemlich witzig ausfällt.
Ein Film so bezaubernd wie Stanwycks Schauspiel! Ich kann nur hoffen, dass dieses unvergessliche Zusammentreffen irgendwann auch eine HD-VÖ erfährt.

"#6 of IT’S CHRIIIIIIISTMAAAAAAAS!: The 2016 Christravaganza
Lee (Barbara Stanwyck) is in court having been caught with stolen jewellery and John (Fred MacMurray) is the prosecutor who, on the verge of Christmas, knowing that juries are sympathetic so close to the holidays, allows the defence attorney to put himself in a position where John can get the case postponed until the New Year when he knows he will have a better chance of a successful prosecution.
But his conscience quickly gets the better of him and he arranges for her to get bail so she won't have to spend Christmas in jail. However the bail bondsman dumps her on him and soon she's tagging along on a trip to see his family, stopping off at her family home to find out that she's still just as unwelcome there as she was when she left there years ago.
Needless to say the two of them fall in love and John is quite prepared to put his career on the line in order to make sure that she doesn't get convicted. And do you know what? I would too, for Barbara Stanwyck.
For me one of the few delights in what has, let's face it, been a pretty crappy year all around, has been the revelation that Barbara Stanwyck is utterly fantastic and I mean bewitching. It's not just that she's so beautiful, she really can act. And this is a wonderful, quiet performance, it's not showy or flashy, she does just enough to show exactly why MacMurray's character is falling hook line and sinker for her, and no more.
Because this is not the screwball comedy you might imagine it to be, she's not some kind of Manic Pixie Dream Girl leading the man astray, having her play the master manipulator would have been obvious, but that isn't the way the film goes, this is pure romance and in a good way. Yes of course there's sentimentality, but you not clonked over the head with it and in fact more than one the character recognise that throwing everything away for what seems like love, isn't necessarily the right thing to do.
But then again, would throwing everything away for Barbara Stanwyck be such a bad decision?

Stanwyck, a crook with a heart of gold, also can’t help but charm him as they wind up on a cross-country road trip to visit his family.

"Before Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck teamed up in Remember the Night, a Christmas-period romantic comedy/drama about an Assistant DA and a thief who he is trying to send to prison. Their sizzling chemistry is the secret sauce which made Double Indemnity such a memorable noir and this is at its best when it's just the two of them.
The film lags in the middle on the road-trip and when we get back to Jack's familial home, but recovers once it again becomes a two-hander. Other than the very funny opening courtroom scene the comedy is largely ineffective, and unfortunately the depiction of Jack's butler is quite racist and mean-spirited which left a sour taste in my mouth, but MacMurray and Stanwyck's undeniable chemistry meant the romantic elements really worked for me.",3.5

"I will remember Remember the Night. The ending seemed abrupt and unsatisfactory. But on second thought, it could not have been more perfect. The film refuses to reassure its audience. It leaves everything open, because the truth of the story is that these two people, who have fallen so swiftly and completely in love, still face many uncertainties.
Barbara Stanwyck's character is correct in being hopeful but guarded. She sees the situation clearly because she faces definite incarceration. Indeed, she made sure of that by pleading guilty at the last minute. Fred MacMurray's character does not share her sober view of the situation. His judgement is skewed. He has become disoriented by the sheer thrust of new love. The truth is he can't really know how he'll feel in several months or years, whenever Barbara Stanwyck's character gets out of prison. Neither can she.
When you're in love, when everything is perfume sweet and New Year's Eve, you can't possibly imagine anything changing. The good feelings will never diminish. No one will get sick or grow old. You exist in a kind of suspended animation.
Remember the Night sees through all of this. It asks us to dwell in uncertainty. Or if not dwell, then to at least contemplate uncertainty. To consider it as a necessary condition of our existence. And it's beautiful.",5.0

"Not the charming Christmas screwball rom-com I expected it to be, for better and for worse. It’s a much more interesting picture structurally and tonally, with some wild deviations into domestic drama and court proceedings, but can also be a bit sluggish at times and never feels like it fully commits any which way. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are of course firecracker in Double Indemnity, with her as the femme fatale to end all femme fatales and him as the poor schlub in her crosshairs. But here the chemistry never quite sparks, and so the romance element of this largely fell flat for me.
That said, Stanwyck is truly just a force like no one who’s been seen before or since. She chews up every piece of this thing, from the rat-a-tat dialogue moments to the sincere, introspective character beats that hit like a ton of bricks. That whole sequence with her visiting her mother is a complete powerhouse, really tore through me. Especially when you consider Stanwyck’s own backstory as someone who was tragically orphaned, this whole concept of her as someone who has been cast aside without a home and looking for family is absolutely shattering.
There’s also some great stuff throughout in bits and pieces, like the whole court sequence with the defender basically giving a one-man show audition that had me in stitches. CinemaEsquire’s review on here theorized that scene had an influence on Intolerable Cruelty and now I can’t unsee that.
Was also a delight to see Sterling Holloway in a live-action performance, and he was a total sweetheart. Very fun catching him in this a few months after seeing his Twilight Zone episode and being irreparably scarred by what he was doing there.

Leisen does some good work here. Some well-composed images for sure. Though I also understand why this would cause Sturges to want to direct himself. In his own stuff he ups the pace, can see him seeing this as much slower.

This might sound like a gooey Hallmark movie, but what follows is a similar yet heartfelt story through family and redemption, and it works because the characters were (mostly) caring, had heart, and it's so nice and warm. It has enough conflict and emotion to make it a good crowd-pleasing movie rather than a pandering, forgettable Christmas flick.

Them in Double Indemnity are probably the best of their careers, but their performances here are delivered with such tenderness and yearning. So many little moments where Barbara, as Lee, struggles to keep herself in check, as someone who feels like she never deserves anything remotely good in her life.
It starts off somewhat lightly, since a thief and lawyer getting together amidst a trial is pretty much grounds for a screwball comedy, but becomes a more earnest Christmas love story a little past the halfway mark. I still found the romance aspect to be done well, but only could've gone so far if the moral center of it wasn't hindered by what was presumably the Hays Code. The film treats her stealing to be almost as bad as murder and that's really the only thing keeping Lee and John apart, both legally and emotionally speaking. I could see it happening differently in a movie produced literally anytime after 1968, but for a 1940's comedy/melodrama, it's as fine as it could be.",0.0
"A charming yet occasionally clumsy romantic comedy that is most remarkable not for its caught-red-handed redhead or hilariously long courtroom scenes or that the film has a lovely Christmas morning sequence. What's most impressive, in fact, is that this story is structured around Christmas, meaning there is plenty of room reserved for the days leading up to and after its centerpiece holiday.
There is space left for consideration of the joy of coming home for the holidays to a place full of love, and the trauma and guilt and grief that lingers in a place one does not want to return to ever, much less on Dec. 25. It also leaves time to linger in that post-holiday malaise — the bullying blues that overtake the joy of contented celebration when one must return to daily life, and sometimes try to make sense of what has developed over the break and whether forging a new existence is possible.
Most importantly, I would overlook any and all past misdeeds and immediately abscond with her to Canada if Barbara Stanwyck said ""You’re a Hoosier?!?"" to me with the enthusiasm and delight she displays for Fred MacMurray in the scene on the dance floor.",3.5

"Remember the night is a lovely film with a bit of everything. It has crime, drama, romance and humour with a christmas setting and a hopeful message. I love Fred Macmurray and Barbara Stanwyck from Double indemnity so was interested in seeing them pair up again, they once again gave brilliant performances and they have really great chemistry together.

"This was decent rom-com which captured the christmas spirit but the story was carried by the chemistry between the leads, who were so well acted and very enjoyable. Most other character, however, were pretty dull and the film did consist of some boring moments. It is also quite grim for a christmas rom-com even if it did capture the Christmas charm well. This film has it’s good bits and it’s bad bits and left me thinking it was decent.",3.0

"Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray light up the screen as their characters embark on an unexpected road trip, navigating the twists of fate and discovering the magic that unfolds over the holidays. Stanwyck's radiant presence and MacMurray's charming demeanor create a delightful pairing.
Watching this one with my Mom was a joy, considering her love for classic Hollywood and, apparently, her admiration for Barbara Stanwyck. It turned out to be a great family choice; the romance between the main characters is sweet and enjoyable. Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is a compelling character that tugs at your heartstrings, and I unexpectedly found myself tearing up in the end, which I didn't expect to do.
I'd recommend this if you appreciate a slow and wholesome romance, though it might not be my top suggestion for my friends unless they're fans of this era. Overall, I enjoyed it, and it made for a nice Christmas film. Whether I'd rewatch it next year remains uncertain.",3.5

Rare occasion where it seems the rules of the production code actually force this to have a pretty downbeat ending.

Not a perfect movie but a perfect CHRISTMAS movie. Manages to capture so perfectly the feeling of when someone shares their life with you and they have things you never had access to or even could imagine. Sold flawlessly by ms stanwyck of course. Made me cry! Catch me shoplifting this Christmas bc you never know what might happen!,4.5
"Delightful. The first of four collaborations between Stanwyck and MacMurray, and the last screenplay Preston Sturges wrote for another director before embarking on his own filmmaking career. Sturges was apparently unhappy with Mitchell Leisen's direction, as well as the changes he made to his original script. I can understand his frustration, and while it's interesting to consider how it would've turned out with him behind the camera instead, I think Leisen did more than a fine job with Sturges' script. Leisen and his cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff provide some beautifully shot sequences—the New Year's Eve barn dance scene is particularly moving. Stanwyck and MacMurray are both outstanding of course, but the whole cast is excellent. I especially liked Elizabeth Patterson as Aunt Emma. The film is a comedy for sure, but like most Sturges stories it includes elements from a variety of genres, yet never feels disjointed or messy. It's hilarious, dramatic, tender, and bittersweet. 
 Again, Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent. Her presence never fails to captivate me. Leander is a surprisingly complex character, and Stanwyck couldn't have given a better or more authentic performance. Beyond the elements that might make modern audiences uncomfortable, I think Leisen could have trimmed a few minutes off to make it a solid 88-90 minutes. That said, it's consistently engaging and never feels like it's dragging. It's also a great Christmas movie, as it explores the deeper meaning and sentiments of the holiday, as opposed to the pomp and grandeur displayed in most holiday-themed productions (especially of the time).

"I suppose you do this with all the lady prisoners?
Barbara Stanwyck is amazing in this 1940 classic directed by Mitchell Leisen. With a unique premise and minimal sap, Remember the Night is a Christmas movie you can believe in.",4.5
"Barbara Stanwyck continues to be a wonderful performer as I see her more. For a star in an era in which it may be easy to see the performances as a bit more one note, she has the grace and nuance of an actor who would be extremely successful in any era.
The story here is quite interesting, the idea of putting an accused criminal alongside the prosecutor in charge of putting her behind bars and allowing them to find love despite the opposite sides of the law they stand on. 
This has a pretty sharp script, and it was crazy seeing Sterling Holloway (yes, the same Sterling Holloway you would recognize as the voice of Winnie the Pooh) in a supporting comedic role. 
A good time to be had over the holidays with this if you’re looking for something off the path of the certified classics.",3.5
"The best Christmas movies are doused in melancholy. The real world waits on the other side of those twinkling lights and major key melodies. As romantic as it is moralistic, Remember the Night is a curio of the time it was made. Even with a treacly Hayes Code ending, Preston Sturges’ script makes for a witty ride. If you want to be a little bummed out this holiday season, this is your movie.",0.0

"My fourth Stanwyck film in the last two days (although I've seen a good number of her films), and I am just astounded by her work. The range of this actor is crazy. She is beautifully adept at comedy but also has the ability to be cold and calculating (see Double Indemnity and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers) or utterly warm and heart-breaking (this film as a case in point).
There is such authenticity to her work. She doesn't possess a showy bundle of mannerisms and so there is a verisimilitude to what she does. She makes everything feel and seem totally lived in and as such her performances have not dated at all. There is a modernity to what she is doing and her work could be transplanted to films of today and you wouldn't recognise a difference. It was far removed from the sometimes very presentational style of acting.
I pondered her never winning an academy award, as she was one of the foremost actors of her generations (plural - she kicked about for some time) and also the power of her work. It was confounding. But I did a bit of research and she was a freelance actor and never signed any long term contracts with major studios (as was the order of the day) and so never had the backing of a studio driven campaign for Oscar glory. This still holds true today. The politics of the Oscar race very much is a campaign.
That hardly matters when the body of work that remains is so engaging and moving. Looking forward to watching more. Great artist and as Natasha Lyonne described Stanwyck, she had Moxie to burn. So much fun!",4.5

"Barbara Stanwyck plays a beautiful thief to Fred MacMurray playing a straight-laced district attorney. The characters' lives cross paths and they find themselves falling in love with their adversary. Turns out that the DA has a compassionate heart of gold despite his professional zeal for maintaining a 100% conviction record. The thief has a sense of right and wrong with a desire for reform and acceptance, in spite of a cruel, loveless upbringing and life of hard knocks. Most importantly, the DA and thief seem to understand each other deeper than they do themselves, filling the gaps in each other's isolated lives.
The movie has some funny scenes - I actually laughed out loud a few times.
Overall, the movie is sold by Stanwyck. She is actually believable in this ridiculous story - and she grips the audience's heart strings as we root for her character. It is a surprisingly powerful emotional portrayal by Stanwyck. There are scenes when her acting is AMAZING using only her eyes and expressions. Other actors may never achieve such perfection in their entire careers even with the finest dialogue. Interestingly, Stanwyck had a personal background that apparently allowed her to relate to this character.
MacMurray is very good in this film. He is at his best in courtroom scenes, some of which are absolutely hilarious. However, he just can't sell the goody-two-shoes and socially aloof side of the character. To his credit, I doubt anyone could achieve that - it was written as overly absurd.
Without revealing too much, I will say I was disappointed with the ending. It was far too abrupt and didn't deliver what I wanted. Perhaps that is the mark of a good story, but I was definitely left wanting more.
Modern viewers will take offense at the film's portrayal and treatment of the black butler. Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones was apparently typecasted in such roles as a bafoonish, child-like comedic interlude. The humor is standard with such characters still being used today (the stupid friend in any sitcom), though now without the overt rascism. I wish all such characters would be dropped. I'd say Barbie (2023) takes such buffoonery in characters too an extreme, now mocking based on sex instead of race.
This is the first film featuring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together. They pair very well together, but their best Performance was four years later in Double Indemnity.",3.5

"The late night scene between Barbara Stanwyck and Beulah Bondi had my fucking jaw on the floor - had to watch it twice. SO much unsaid. Just brilliant. I've never seen Stanwyck quite as vulnerable and it was really thrilling. The movie around it is a bit clunky, but that scene made the whole thing worth it.",3.5
"This was a good choice to end the year, as it takes place from just before Christmas to just after New Year's Day. Unethical lawyering aside, Stanwyck and MacMurray are great together in their first collaboration. Leisen and Sturges balance the tones well, from the early comedic scenes to an absolutely heartbreaking scene with Stanwyck's mother. There were moments I appreciated where the film went a different direction than I had expected. It's weird actually seeing Sterling Holloway perform rather than just hearing him as a voice actor. I've gotten used to seeing John Fiedler (Piglet), but I guess I'm not there yet with Pooh. Anyway, this is a really good holiday film that feels like it should be more of a classic.",3.5
"I was completely taken aback by and knocked on my heels by this. Not only was it just an utterly lovely confection but I genuinely couldn't believe that in just under 20 years of hosting Christmas movie related group drinking game parties, this had totally passed me by.
Somehow Chuck Norris' INVASION USA made the #GCMMDG line-up three times but this not even once? Frickin shameful.
It's a Christmas movie starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in their first film pairing before they'd make one of my all time favourite films, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, together (and follow that with two more movies; THE MOONLIGHTER and THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW). It's written by the mighty titan that was Preston Sturges (the last time he'd script for another director as he'd start his own directorial career soon after submitting this script). And it's a big, high concept, road trip romance that Steve Martin claims left a fingerprint on PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES.
I should've been all over this long before now. I'm going to make up for that by making it one of my annual Christmas mainstays here on out. It's a tender, warm and lovely film that builds real human comedy and romance out of contrivance.",5.0
"Stanwyck is luminous, badass and heartbreaking in this, a performance for the ages. The extras from the Indicator release mount a convincing case that Mitchell Leisen was done dirty by Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder's sour grapes (plus homophobia), and indeed it is a well directed piece of work all right. Its flaws are not down to cast and crew as much as sins of its time - an offensive black servant character at the begining, an ending that could never be emotionally satisfying under the Hays code.",4.0

"Watched on FAWESOME & suffered through an abusive amount of commercials that definitely had an affect on my enjoyment.
Stanwyck is her typical luminous self as a kleptomaniac and MacMurray surprises as her romantic interest and prosecutor. You never really think of Fred being The Dude, but he was competing against an unbelievably impressive Leading Man inventory at the time - I get it.
The film sort of gets off to a rocky start with a rather long courtroom scene, where Stanwyck's defense council tries to sell the jury that she was hypnotized into stealing an item of jewelry. It wasn't particularly funny or clever...and the machinations of delaying the trial and events leading up to the her staying at Fred's apt are ridiculous...but once her and Fred get on the road to Indiana, it's outstanding.
I enjoyed the end, which didn't land on the atypical sappy note of the time...a bit of downbeat, which caught me off-guard.
I might have to check it out again without commercials.",3.5

"I love both of these stars and the talent behind the camera, but this film did not gel for me as well I wished it had. I can see why Preston Sturges sought his own directing ambitions after this film came out. It is certainly not a bad film, it’s actually quite good. The idea of a prosecutor falling in love with a defendant is interesting, and it’s well executed. The film also touches on Capra as small town sentiments are presented whole heartedly, not out of humor (aside from the citizens arrest sequence). I think I was expecting a screwball comedy and got a melodramatic comedy instead, which is not a bad thing. However, the film is weaker than Midnight. The second act dragged and flopped slightly in its conclusion. Watch this for the performances and careful directing, but not thematic execution.",3.5

"Serial shoplifter, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck), snatches a bracelet from a jewellery store, but gets caught red-handed. Despite the evidence against her, prosecuting attorney, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), is worried she could still get off. It is Christmas after all, and Lee is an attractive woman; the jury might well go easy on her. When a slip-up by the defence results in Lee's trial being postponed til the new year, it's John himself who winds up going easy. He bails Lee out for the holiday season, which is a silly move, because Lee has no place to stay this Christmas. And so, these two people - the criminal and the man prosecuting her - take off on a wintery road-trip to Indiana, to see their respective families.
That synopsis, and the fact that the script is credited to Preston Sturges, might lead one to expect a wackier affair than the one we get. Yes, Remember the Night has its fair share of funny moments - the best coming from Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), who is giddily shipping John and Lee from the moment they enter the house - but on the whole, the movie is more interested in drama and romance than comedy.
There's a gentle sincerity to Remember the Night, but it's not some syrupy concoction. There's something bitter stirred in with the sweetness, and while the overall result is feel-good, things are hardly wrapped up in a neat glittery bow.
And yet, as good as it is, something stopped me from wholly giving myself over to the film. If I had to diagnose it (and I'm writing a review, so I guess I do), I think the problem lies in the fuzzy characterisation. The film (in the first third at least) wants the audience to see John as a shrewd, somewhat dishonourable operator... but it doesn't really work. Sturges and director, Mitchell Leisen, frame John getting the trial delayed until after Christmas as underhanded, though I really don't see what else he could do in the circumstances. He either challenges the defence council's huckster-ish claims and gets the trial postponed for reports, or he lets it slide and Lee goes free to thieve another day. Equally fuzzy is Lee's criminality, which gets vaguely pathologised throughout the film, without us ever really getting to the nub of it.
Stanwyck is fantastic of course, and overcomes this weak characterisation, but still, it was enough to stop Remember the Night wholly clicking for me. I may well rewatch next Christmas, to see if it lands more cleanly.",3.0

"I am sure that people who are already familiar with Remember The Night already notice when it starts to become a more popular viewing choice towards the end of the year (due to it being set during the Christmas holiday period). I wasn't familiar with the film before now, but I suddenly started noticing it everywhere. I can only imagine that it's a solid choice for some of the classic movie channels, and the recent (typically sublime) UK Blu-ray release from Indicator must have helped it become even more ubiquitous than usual this December.
Written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen, all you should need to know to get you interested in Remember The Night is that it was the first movie to pair up Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. It's not their best (because four years later they would work together in the classic Double Indemnity), but it's a very enjoyable use of their talents.
Stanwyck plays Lee Leander, a woman who has been arrested on a shoplifting charge. She did it, and she doesn't seem too remorseful about doing it, but MacMurray's prosecuting attorney, John Sargent, knows that a jury can be affected by seasonal goodwill just before Christmas, which is why he is happy to request a continuance of the trial until after the holidays. Unfortunately, with no family or funds available, this means that Miss Leander will spend the holiday season in jail. Sympathetic to her situation, especially as he caused it, Sargent manages to get her out on bail. Dropped off at his apartment, Miss Leander quickly ends up making Mr. Sargent regret his good deed. He is heading home for the holidays, and decides to take Miss Leander to her family, where she can enjoy some time before heading back for her assigned court date, and so begins a blossoming relationship that could cause hurt and happiness in equal measure.
The thing that works best about Remember The Night is that it's a message movie that delivers a message you might not actually expect. Yes, there are the usual enjoyable character interactions, and there's a fun set-piece or two (small in scale, but there throughout the runtime nonetheless), as well as the strengthening connection between the two leads, but this is a film that uses the goodwill of the season to reflect a light of joy/shame on the many supporting characters. Stanwyck's character is not pleading innocence throughout, nor does she ever really make any excuses for her own behaviour, but viewers, and those in the movie who get to know her without their view shaded by her arrest, can easily see that there is much more to define her than a penchant for thievery.
It helps, of course, that Stanwyck's character is played by Stanwyck, an actress who I've never known to disappoint (although I still have so many more of her movies to get around to). It also helps that MacMurray is putting in yet another of those winning turns that he delivered for a good few decades, making him easy to root for even when he might not have been consistently in the right. Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson are a delight as two members of Sargent's family (his mother and aunt, respectively), Georgia Caine plays a much-less-delightful mother to our female lead, and Willard Robertson, Sterling Holloway, and Charles Waldron all get at least one good moment. It's also worth mentioning the small role for Fred 'Snowflake' Toones, a character actor who may be involved a couple of scenes that disappointingly play to the prevailing attitude of the era, but who deserves to be namechecked nonetheless. (it's the writing/direction that disappoints there, not his performance)
It doesn't overdo the Christmas feeling, but you get it emanating from the screen at key points, making it easy to see why people may choose to keep this one in annual rotation. It delivers familiar good feeling with a satisfyingly unfamiliar sprinkling of realism . . . 1940s cinematic realism, which is still miles away from actual realism though. Determined not to let things turn into a fairytale, nor the characters to transform into a princess or prince, Remember The Night is a great example of how to give audiences what they want without letting them feel as if they have just been served a bland final product from the end of a standardised factory line.
This may not have the constant snowfall and bell-ringing of other Christmas movie classics from this era, but that just gives you all the more reason to revisit it. I know that I'll be trying to make this a new December tradition in my house.",4.0

That unfortunate sign of the times aside, this works as both a Christmas and New Year's Eve movie because it takes place over both holidays, and so it's a fitting choice as post-Christmas/pre-New Year's Eve viewing.
It was love at first watch with this one, a few years ago, and it hits me harder with each viewing. But to be honest, *everything* hits me harder the older I get.
It's a beautiful film about love, compassion, and empathy -- and Barbara Stanwyck breaks my goddamn heart in it.

"A short and sweet quasi-Christmas love story with a sharp and snappy script and great chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.

"Laces its swooningly comedic romantic notes with a surprising approach trying to tiptoe a thin line emphasizing the inherent goodness of its protagonists amid undercurrents of genuine perversion within an otherwise of-its-time moralistic justice system, with the former eventually winning out altogether by means of normative happy endings and the overwhelming force of racist power structures. Wish it veered more into the latter category, but beggars can't be choosers with early Hays era pictures, so hey, at least I can appreciate it as a mostly sweet-natured Christmas film viewed at the proper time of year.",3.5
"I never liked how Preston Sturges treated black characters in his films. And even if he didn't direct, his script sure treated Rufus like shit. It seems to happen in ever subsequent Sturges film, which is why I was never one of those who could take a liking to his work as so many critics of the past seemed to find him in such high esteem.
Once we get out of John Sargent's apartment so Rufus can no longer be abused, the film picks up. If we had stayed in New York, this film would have sunk further. But I fell in love, absolute love, with Stanwyck as Lee. While ""Christmas in Connecticut"" is frothy and light, a romp, ""Remember the Night"" really gives Stanwyck a role to sink her dramatic chops into. The visit to her cold-hearted mother, how she accepts that she must serve her time instead of allowing Sargent to sacrifice for her, giving her heart to him, all the pain of the past and the potential for love in the future; Stanwyck, each and every moment delivers. There really wasn't any kind of genre Stanwyck couldn't occupy, but you give her drama and comedy together, the woman could be a powerhouse.
Seeing Lee come alive when meeting Bondi, Patterson, and Holloway during the Christmas holidays, seemingly finding herself a real family, not to mention, romance with MacMurray, that is where the magic emerges for me personally. Even before the road trip when Sargent and Lee are at the dinner, there are real sparks. I could see why ""Christmas in Connecticut"" might be preferred, but ""Remember the Night"" doesn't embrace screwball totally, which was why I liked the latter more, to be honest.
Besides how Rufus was treated, I didn't care for the detour (literally and figuratively) when Sargent and Lee are held under citizen arrest by a sourpuss not happy about how they run into his fence and slept in his farmland. That Sargent had to flee what would have been charges that cost him his law career thanks to Lee's use of fire, it just left a sour taste for me. I can't fully like Sargent because of how he treats Rufus, and this extra bit of breaking the law ruins him a bit. Some might say this gives him flaws. I dunno.
The Niagara Falls scene is as romantic as any 40s movie could get. Just a beautiful moment.",4.5
You simply cannot go wrong with Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. This has left me as a mushy bowl of feelings.,3.5
Barbara Stanwyck is such a knockout 🥺,5.0
"It says a lot about the power of this movie that I was pissed at it in the opening scenes, but was on the verge of tears towards the end.
I mean, I was immediately turned off by the smug, casual racism and the entirely too long “comedy” of lawyerly speeches, both of which soured me on its whole thing and wacky misadventures. I know it’s of its era, but I was grossed out as I was a bit bored. 
But then Stanwyck and MacMurray hit the road. By the time it gets to Xmas, and she’s surrounded by love of Fred’s family, everyone basking in their unquestioning affection for one another, her eyes brimming over with tears in the kindness and feelings she’s never known. It’s as purely Christmas a scene as I’ve ever seen in a movie, cutting the sadness of the everyday with the joy of the magic of the holidays. It’s beautiful beyond words, and works because of Stanwyck. 
It’s such a genuine film through its middle portions, full of holiday beauty and period charm, that it became what I wanted it to be. This was a really nice surprise.

solely for the pairing of the slightly younger stanwyck and macmurray you see why wilder needed them for his noir classic.

Barbara stanwyck can do no wrong in my eyes and this is no exception. stanny putting on that corset. god damn she is ridiculously beautiful in several scenes. 
the beauty in this film is only amplified by the gorgeous cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff (ie. those shots and that entire scene at Niagara Falls) and the charm is easily found throughout which is no surprise since a personal fav Preston sturges wrote the script (his last before directing)

"Before we have even seen her face clearly, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) has already shoplifted an expensive piece of jewelry, tried to pawn it, been caught, and found herself in the courtroom on trial for her crime. Her public defender tries a convoluted defense claiming that she was hypnotized by the flashy diamonds and wandered away unknowingly, hoping the jury will be sympathetic with Christmastime coming up soon. But ADA Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) is on to his tricks and takes the opportunity to call an expert medical witness, which forces a continuance until after the holiday season. Feeling sorry she will spend Christmas in jail, Jack works it so she will get out on bail, which the bondsman mistakenly thinks means he wants her sent to his apartment. After she shows up at his doorstep angry she won't be getting her free meals in prison (and because she also thought he arranged her release so they could meet), he offers to give her some money to send her on her way so he can go visit his family out of state.
Once Lee realizes that Jack actually had no ulterior motives for helping her get out of prison for the holiday break, though, she actually does end up being more thankful for the kind act. They enjoy a meal together, and eventually they realize they are both from Indiana. After he finds out she hasn't been back home since running away years before, he offers to drop her off at her home on his way back to his own hometown. From there some wild antics ensue as they try to find their way home, eventually leading to a sour reunion back home for Lee. After remembering why she left home in the first place, she begs Jack to drop her off somewhere else. He instead offers to bring her back to spend the holidays at his boyhood home and meet his own mother (the always spectacular Beulah Bondi), but feelings start to arise between them that promise to cause an awkward situation between the prosecutor and the thief (who he is supposed to be trying to put in prison).
I toyed with an extra half a star for this one initially, but I settled on a 3.5/5 because I definitely liked it less than the last Mitchell Leisen movie I watched (Easy Living). Perhaps it would have helped to watch this during the holiday season in order to get fully swept up in the emotions of things, seeing as how the events take place during Christmas and New Year's Eve. Whatever the case, the romance just ended up not hitting quite as hard as I anticipated (at least given its popularity here on Letterboxd). Don't get me wrong, MacMurray and Stanwyck are good together, but they lack that fatalistic intensity they would bring to the screen just a few years later in Double Indemnity. The Preston Sturges script also lacked the comedic flair he is so famous for, but I suppose it's not like anyone ever promised that here. I just wasn't expecting it to be as much of a drama as it was, I suppose. Fortunately the Edith Head costumes are great, so if nothing else Stanwyck is always looking as sharp as ever (even when she is busy helping MacMurray milk a cow).",3.5
"My partner asked why this wasn’t a more popular classic Hollywood Christmas movie.

A part of me thinks this is funny, the idea of her reading this, but that'll never happen. So I could say anything I want about her here. But instead, I'm gonna think back. To that night.

"Just a few years before they teamed up for the indelible “Double Indemnity”, Stanwyck and MacMurray made this Sturges penned romcom. Somehow, Stanwyck makes everything believable. That to me is her genius. 
This is much less cynical than anything I’ve seen by Sturges, and I’m sure he wasn’t too happy about that. Regardless, it is, after all, a Christmas movie, and Leisen should be forgiven for giving us this sugar coated treatment. 
I found myself still not trusting Lee, almost right up until the final courtroom scene. Is she playing Jack? In a Wilder film, that might have been a twist that he would have needed another 15 minutes to straighten out. When Jack’s Mom goes into his history, and lets Lee know how she could ruin him, you think maybe Lee is going to split before they go home. There are a lot of ways the story could have turned from that moment. 
Again- Christmas movie. Sorry all you Scroogy Grinches, they really do fall in love. And you know what?  It’s really touching. The ending is quite abrupt, and I think there were a number of other ways they could have done it better. That, and the Rufus character were pretty much my only issues.",4.5
"That was Niagra Falls. People aren't responsible for what they say in Niagra Falls.
Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are so lovely in Remember the Night. Stanwyck is at her melancholic best, playing both toughness and fragility as she opens up for the best Christmas she's ever had.
This feels like an early road trip by car movie - I'm used to characters in this era traveling by train. It's fun to watch map hijinks and getting lost in a pasture due to a WPA roadworks project. As there ever been such a charming scene as Stanwyck and MacMurray milking a cow?
And I want to shout out the opening credits. Mitchell Leisen always uses style to open his films, but the font here is stellar and so stylish.
The only misstep is the racism imposed on MacMurray's valet played by Fred Tunes. It's incredibly egregious, especially compared to the humanism and generosity that the rest of the characters are handled with.",4.5

"What really would be a 5/5 film for me is marred by the casually racist treatment of the Rufus character (which thankfully is confined to the first act). Sturges didn't like Leisen's ""soft"" direction of his script but the softer elements of both the script and direction are what really work here: how tenderly the gulf between Lee and Jack's family lives are treated, how Stanwyck's performance transitions from tough to truly vulnerable, Leisen's movement in direction from somewhat anonymous to stylized and romantic. That Niagara scene is a total swoon and its studio set Minnelli-level in beauty.",4.5
"Damn this was good. A rock-solid, Sturges-penned screwball romance that really had me in my feelings. There's just something so relatable and sad about watching Babs navigate this domestic fantasy that she's both accepted into and alienated from, that she wants but doesn't want to want bc she doesn't think it could work for her even if she did have it. The look on her face when she learns that Fred's already revealed her secret kind of killed me (though I was admittedly already deceased from that brushed-out bathrobe fantasy look she's working in that scene), as did Fred MacMurray's utter obliviousness to the fact that going home for Lee might, in fact, be hella traumatic. These are the kinds of things that will always make Babs, in my eyes, one of the dolls.
Also noteworthy is the pennsylvania representation in this film, which includes not only a curmudgeonly farmer and a bigoted judge but a scranton shoutout to boot. Were if not for the casual racism of the Rufus character and the fact that the primary love interest is a fucking DA, this would absolutely be a five-star affair.",4.5
"I can't believe Sturges was so mad about how this turned out. It's a perfectly solid movie that plays to the strengths of both its leads and hits harder emotionally than I ever expected. Truly the only weaknesses are the social/political aspects that haven't aged well, but it's still ultimately a halfway woke ""in defense of criminals"" movie that's weirdly aged much better than the similarly-themed Christmas comedy 'Trading Places' (which is also ""in defense of criminals,"" but more anti-racist while still being very racist).

There was also a noticeable absence of score through most of the film which (counterintuitive to the logic of the day) allows the viewer to just watch her and MacMurray behave.

Truly difficult to forgive the way that Fred “Snowflake” Toones, playing Fred MacMurray’s ADA character’s butler, Rufus, is treated throughout the first act. It’s not hard to find examples of this kind of blatant racism all across this era of films, but something about the aggression here is extremely off-putting—MacMurray calls him names even when he isn’t on screen and threatens to hit him when he is, and bail-bondsman Fat Mike shoves him against a wall while sneering and berating him—as part of a joke. That Rufus is shown to be afraid of Fat Mike is part of the gag (which is even worse), but rather than a belly laugh, I got a belly ache, and I couldn’t really forget it for the rest of the film...
It’s all the more unfortunate because the rest of the movie is actually fantastic. Almost as hard to deny as the racism at the start is MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck’s tremendous chemistry, which I know best from Double Indemnity, but which, here, is put to even better use than in that noir classic, mostly because Stanwyck gets to be funny instead of “fatale”—although Barb still gets to lead Fred astray all the same. I just adore Stanwyck in comedy mode, and Preston Sturges’s script suits her no-nonsense patter perfectly. MacMurray also gets to play to his strengths as a square-jawed, square-personality’d boob hung up on Stanwyck’s endless charms. Unfortunately, I’m pretty sure that Sturges was in many ways muscled out of the second half of this film—the romance angle feels so much more cookie-cutter and less zany than Sturges at his best (the cross-eyed grandfather, for example, is Sturges, but the Niagara Falls speech is almost certainly not)—but, still, amazingly, it works! Right up until that Code-approved ending...
One more sticking point before we leave well enough alone: why the hell does Fred MacMurray butter and salt the popcorn if it’s going to get strung on the tree?? Psychotic behavior. Probably the whole reason Barbara chooses to go to prison.",3.5

"Barbara motherfucking Sanwyck. What a talent. What an absolute knockout. This movie is... pretty solid.
Remember the Night has an inherently preposterous premise. A hotshot prosecutor bails out the jewel thief he’s prosecuting and takes her to Indiana to have Christmas with his family. I’m generally not one to nitpick but even in 1940 I imagine a prosecutor taking a defendant across state lines in the middle of a criminal trial would be grounds for disbarment.
If you can bridge that chasm of movie logic, the script by Preston Strugess presents a nice back and forth between its two leads. The movie hints at examining what makes someone a criminal and the stigma that leaves on a person but it never quite follows through. The film ends just as it reaches its the most interesting conflict. I suspect the Code had a hand in that abrupt ending but it’s frustrating  to watch none the less. If you’re making what’s first and foremost a romance, you can’t just cut to credits without concluding said romance. At least we know these crazy kids will be back in a few years for Double Indemnity.

"Probably the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie, at least among movies I like enough to even think about the ending. And I've seen plenty of insane Code-forced morality in the last couple years. A laughable amount of character assassination and logic assassination crammed into like two minutes with her sacrifice being shown as a necessary emotional conclusion in a world premised around a DA's easy ability to get a girl out of jail for no reason. I guess I can't exclusively blame the production code for the messy premise and ending because this was clearly written as a ""their love/adventure corrupted him and saved her"" situation, as if his career success as a DA and the supposed hard work to get there as described by his mom made him a previously uncorrupted moral good and the love of a person from a perfect family was the only thing that could save her from her life of extremely mild crime. But thankfully I couldn't care less about any of this and my brain counts the line where that one juror whispers ""He's just trying to get her in wrong"" as the actual end of the movie and everything else as Preston Sturges doing a bit anyway, so we're all good.",5.0
"Introduced my mom to it today. I know when she isn’t that interested in a film, always interrupting to say something, actually leaving to go to the kitchen and so on. She did a few of those things this time, but I can’t really blame her for it, I couldn’t find any subtitled copy for us and her English isn’t all that swell to understand slang, especially when they are expressions from 80 years ago. I also feel like I should have warned her that this is much different from Double Indemnity. I have the impression that she is too familiar with typecasting and immediately assumed Barbara would be the bad bitch again. And then she even called me out for being “too sentimental” by the end of it just because I was moved as I usually am when I watch my all time favorite.
Anyway, I was able to pay attention to more things this time around. My review today will be dedicated to the awesomeness of Preston Sturges’ story. 
It’s not very easy to use “fate” and coincidences in your screenplay because they are often used as mechanisms to wrap things up or to artificially move the plot forward. Sturges definitely uses it the second purpose, but he makes it seem so organic in the story, even though the eventual path it took relies in many of those events.
This resource is definitely noticeable, and it would heavily bother me in many different scenarios, and it might get in the way in the first viewing. However, Sturges always manages to also include the other side of the balance in the script, sometimes with expository dialogue, other times in a more dramatic way that could only be managed by Leisen.
Showing the other side is extremely handy in order to improve the believability of a story. Demonstrating that your characters are aware of the luck their having over and over again makes us think the film at least acknowledges the situation they’re at, and juices the best they can from it.
Another thing that definitely helps to improve in this aspect is how they face each one of them initially. Coincidences are a great complicators and the film gives them exactly this treatment when they initially come around. For instance, in the very beginning, Lee was okay with spending holidays in jail, she would have food and a place to stay but now that she was out, what should be a great thing after all she had her freedom, was actually dealt with as a complicator. Now she hadn’t anywhere to go but to accompany Jack in his trip back and that’s how it all begins.
Along the way we have more and more of these complicators that are ultimately put to balance in the climax of the story, meaning, most importantly, that every action had a consequence, that would eventually have to come sometime but that most other productions ignore and call it a day. Having a purpose for every aspect is fundamental in storytelling in my opinion. This special dose of realism is just one of the factors that bring Remember the Night so close to my heart, the right story found the right people at the right time and the outcome is this glorious masterpiece.",5.0

"Though I don't like ""Remember the Night"" as much as ""Christmas in Connecticut,"" it is a wonderfully warm Christmas film, notable for its Preston Sturgess script and the performances of the two leads, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.
MacMurray plays a prosecutor, John Sargent, who is stuck with a shoplifting case right before Christmas. He manages to get the case delayed until the New Year, but Lee Leander (Stanwyck), the shoplifter, complains that now she won't have a warm jail to spend Christmas in.
Sargent learns she's from a town that's on his way home, so he offers to drop her off there. That doesn't quite work out - her mother doesn't want her - so she winds up coming home to his family, which consists of his mom (Beulah Bondi), his aunt (Elizabeth Patterson) and their handyman (Sterling Holloway). It's there that she experiences a true family and real love. Before the week is over, Lee and John have fallen for one another.
I always assumed, from ""My Three Sons,"" that Fred MacMurray was a capable actor, and kind of ordinary. Watching his various performances on TCM has changed that impression. Here he's relaxed, natural and very likable, and has his usual good chemistry with Stanwyck. She's wonderful - tough yet vulnerable.
I have a feeling the ending was dictated by the Hayes Code, but this is still a good movie. Preston Sturgess didn't think so - he didn't like the cuts, so this was the last film he wrote and didn't direct.",4.0

"The *other* Stanwyck-MacMurray masterpiece.
The Preston Sturges script gives this more resonance and more of a downbeat ending than you'll find in the average screwball comedy. There are several great sequences: Stanwyck's return home, the musical interlude with MacMurray at the piano, and the final ten minutes.
Most screwballs exchange romance for cynicism; this is one of the rare cases where each is treated seriously. The characters' affection for each other is sincere, but the costs of that affection is realistically handled.
The title points to the past — the narrative constitutes a trip down memory lane for both main characters — and by the end of the film, we see that their romance, this trip to Indiana and their one night at Niagara Falls, will be relegated to their memories. They must remember the night because that's all they have left. None of that happy ending Miracle on 34th Street stuff here.
Any film that is eighty years old has some element of nostalgia to it, but what's curious is how Sturges consciously introduces nostalgia into Remember the Night. The rustic vision of the family gathered around the hearth was already outdated and in the past for most movie-going audiences in 1940 (if it was ever real in the first place). Yet it's there in the core of this film acting like a magnet that impossibly draws the characters together.
The film's critique of nostalgia (i.e. it's inviting but it's a fantasy and at any rate you can't have it permanently) gives this a self-awareness that adds undeniable poignancy to the ending.",4.5

"I'm not exactly sure what to say about this film. The racism and mistreatment of the Rufus character was very cringey, but admittedly was only for a very small portion of the film. I thought I was going to have more to say about it but it never popped up again, so that threw me for a loop. The main characters themselves were lovable and their romance was pretty good at jumping out of the screen at you. Stanwyck's performance is brilliant and she really makes the film alongside the meddling of the Bondi and Patterson characters, actresses that I remember fondly from It's a Wonderful Life and Little Women. Expecting perfection out of your children will get you nowhere, and if you can't show an outpouring of love towards your children after reproving them you are not a parent, you're an overseer. It's true that some people are fairly rotten and little will change them, but it's also true that a number of them could be changed by a little bit of kindness and nurturing and having the opportunity to regularly receive that. Cute film, really wish the racism hadn't marred it.",3.5
Stanwyck and MacMurray in a Christmas film written by Preston Sturges—did my DNA materialize this? More please!,4.0
"I really think this is one of the greatest romances ever produced by Hollywood. A film that revels in gestures and glances, elevating attraction to a poetic form, complemented by Mitchell Leisen's unusually beautiful images, especially his use of high contrast black and white. It’s one of those movies that changes what kind of movie it is every 25 minutes or so, but each new detour is just as wonderful as whatever came before. Fred MacMurray is great, and I really think Barbara Stanwyck is one of the all-time great movie stars. In this, as in seemingly all of her romantic comedies, her soulful performance adds an uncommon level of depth to her scenes with her co-stars - she always portrays her affection and longing in ways that I find disarmingly honest. It’s enough to elevate any film; in a masterpiece like Remember the Night, it’s staggering.",4.5
"A 1940 holiday romance! Someone at Hallmark watch this and learn something.
This stars Stanwyck and MacMurray, a few years before they were in Double Indemnity together too. It's pretty cool movie, I think there's a lot of great details in the script: though the micro levels (dialogue, characters, little inversions of things -- ""I trust her completely. Should I lock up the silver?"" type lines) are probably better than the macro overall story.
I am totally stumped as to why it's called Remember The Night. I must have missed a line or two? I went and Googled it, and found that the original script called it The Amazing Marriage which makes even less sense because nobody is married. What was Preston Sturges trying to do here? *shrug* Best not to think too hard on all that, I guess.",3.5

"After White Christmas and Christmas in Connecticut, the moving subtlety of this film was unexpected and beautiful. There were so many perfect little moments, and if I started listing them it would turn into a shot-by-shot outline of the entire story.
I watched it because I saw it on some holiday movie lists. It does take place over Christmas, and there's certainly enough frivolity and warmth to complement the season nicely. But it's not so festive that it can't be watched at any other time of the year. And it should be watched throughout the year. It should be more widely known than it is.
The thing that struck me the most throughout the film is the strong undercurrent of grace, as the Sargent clan heaps kindness on Lee with no questions asked and without a hint of pity. Lee, for her part, accepts the love without bitterness or cynicism, despite a personal history that would make some amount of suspicion or callousness completely justified. The eagerness with which Lee so excitedly joins in with all the activities--the piano-playing, baking, wearing 30-year-old-dresses--in an attempt to soak up as much goodness as she can is as moving as her disappointing reunion with her mother is tragic.
I’m sure there are more eloquent things I’ll find to say about it after it soaks in a little more, but in short, this movie is very unassuming, but it packs quite a punch.",4.5

I don't think there can really be too many stories told about having compassion for those who've wronged you, and this one is saved from schmalz by a witty and mature script and the charisma and chemistry of Fred and Stanwyck. 
Despite the transparent premise and the unsurprisingly romantic ending, the script is more than just witty, it is mature, and thoughtful, and (most refreshingly) it gives its characters (and therefore also us) some credit. 
The love scenes are beautifully and persuasively acted, and Babs' performance at the end and her sparkly eyes gave me tingles.",0.0

Rarely have I seen a film so rich in warmth and humanity as Remember The Night.

"Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) has been caught stealing jewelry. It’s her third offense and she’s looking at a hefty sentence. In his opening statement, her attorney has cooked up a cockamamie defense involving hypnosis. But district attorney Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) suspects that the jury, full of Christmas spirit, will acquit her. So he arranges to postpone the trial until after the New Year. Feeling guilty over his ploy, he pays her bond so she can enjoy the holidays. Unfortunately, she gets dropped off at his door. When they discover they’re both from Indiana, they agree to take the road trip together. After a close call of their own with the law, they wind up at house where Lee grew up… but her mother (Georgia Caine) wants nothing to do with her. So Jack takes her to his own home, where his mother (Beulah Bondi), Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson) and helper Willie (Sterling Holloway, who I momentarily got mixed up with Stanley Holloway of My Fair Lady) welcome her with open arms.
What a wonderful gem this is. The script by Preston Sturges is full of charming wit and the direction by Mitchell Leisen is incredibly generous with sentiment. Both have their roots in screwball comedy (Leisen’s lively Midnight and Preston arguably the king of the genre) but here they allow the comedy — which itself is delightful — to give way to deep, embracing warmth. Who wouldn’t be bowled over by the hospitality of the Sargent household, with Ma Beulah Bondi (two years after playing a much more elderly character in the gorgeous Make Way for Tomorrow) doting on you and the kindness of Aunt Emma and the goofy eccentricity of Willie (with such a surprisingly lovely singing voice). The contrast between the joy of Jack’s home and the cold rejection of Lee’s home lays the foundation for a fabulous, heartfelt romance.
MacMurray and Stanwyck would of course meet again in the noir masterpiece Double Indemnity and the Sirk melodrama There’s Always Tomorrow (which could almost be an unofficial sequel to this film) among other pairings, but this was their first film together. The chemistry is fully felt, and the sparks fly whether in sly glances or steamy embraces. It’s a beautifully realized romance, the alacrity of which is easily accepted as Movie Magic. The groundwork is laid in their amusing cross-country adventures and the romance blossoms as Lee is welcomed as a human being with feelings rather than a scofflaw and disappointment. And my lord, Stanwyck (who has ties to Sturges in The Lady Eve and Leisen in No Man of Her Own — both fantastic films in their own right) is just the greatest. At the film’s climax we watch her face go from hurt to confusion to revelation to joy and then to sorrow. Seamlessly.
The final scene may seem to be open-ended, but it says everything you need to know. Leisen and Sturges hit the perfect note. Despite the unfortunate circumstances of their love, the relationship we’ve seen develop between Lee and Jack is worthy of celebration. A beautifully rendered, expertly executed, and often exceptionally touching picture. It’s not a feelgood film… it’s a feelgreat film, one full of forgiveness and acceptance and just plain human decency. Possibly a future entry in my top 100. Rating: Great (94)",4.5

It is probably a film which will never see the light of day on DVD, and that's a shame, because Preston Sturges' witty screenplay and the chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray is first rate. The more films I see with the electrifying Stanwyck, the more I begin to feel that Bette Davis was overrated.

"Stanwyck is still a master at facial acting like she was in the Pre-Code era, and she and young MacMarray are gold together.
That said, this has a lot of slow spots, the farm family is impossibly nice, and the courtroom scenes are painfully trite. But we get to hear Sterling Holloway croon, and MacMurray calls convicts ""hobbits""!
It's too bad the Production Code guarantees Stanwyck has to feel massive remorse and serve her time, because this could have been so much better. They also could've gotten more mileage out of a brief gag about MacMurray bringing Stanwyck across state lines, even though I'm pretty sure her character is supposed to be over 21.

"If you were starving, could you steal a loaf of bread? Now, what if that loaf of bread was the love of your life?

Stanwyck is so touching, realizing what her life's been missing after she meets his hilarious, but really very sweet family, that I openly wept through most of the film. Though there are moments of amusing levity, this is really about a doomed romance, though perhaps there's a way for the characters to meet in the middle. Remember the Night shows what Christmas, family and love CAN be, but despite its romantic veneer, there's realism there too. It plays by the rules of drama, not screwball comedy.

With these rewatches, it seems apparent that the person I disagree with the most is myself.
Sexist and racist cultural remnants aside, Remember The Night has a tear-jerking, progressive theme: people can do bad things, but they aren't bad & kindness goes a long way.
My favorite thing about Preston Sturges is that he loves to toy with convention. Here, he's taking the hero's sacrifice—a la Red Dust—and using that on a woman, all while stripping the arc of all its harsh machismo, tough-love, and Stockholm syndrome sensibilities. What results is a gooey warm romance that is really emotional, positive, wholesome from start to finish. The film doesn't shy away from sadness though, which shows great balance by Leisen.",4.0

It's funny that I'd roll my eyes at a ""all the world needs is a little more kindness"" message in a modern movie, but here I'm like ""why yes, darling, I think you're quite right...""

"Never heard of this one, but I checked it out because it's got a pre-Double Indemnity Stanwyck & MacMurray. The plot is so stupid I can't believe Remember the Night isn't more modern. ""Attorney goes on a small road trip over the holidays with the criminal he's built a case against. But get this: the criminal is a GIRL."" I'm pretty sure Katherine Heigl stars in a movie with that exact same plot? But the movie is good, mostly in part from the fun settings and the dynamite performances. Preston Sturges wrote the script, giving me an ""oh duh!"" reaction when I discovered that halfway through the movie. It's not as fast as you'd expect from a Sturges script, and that's my biggest complaint about Remember the Night. I wanted a little more patter. Gimme that patter!
As ridiculous as the premise is, I ended up rooting for these two dang kids. The ending is maybe a little sappy, but the movie won me over, and I prayed that the final shot was MacMurray visiting Stanwyck in prison, and he pulls up his shirt and presses his titties up against the glass. ""I'll wait for you!"" he whispers, and through the power of movies, Barbara can hear that through the glass.

MacMurray and Stanwyck team up 4 years before Double Indemnity to play two really nice people whom we grow to love over the course of a funny, witty, heartfelt, and clever story (written by Preston Sturges) I must admit that I didn't see the clecer conclusion coming, and I must also admit that my vision actually got a little blurry in the last scene! The two leads are great and playing total opposites from the types we know them as in Wilder's classic noir, but other standouts are Beulah Bondi as MacMurray's well-meaning mother, and Sterling Holloway (whose voice you may recognize as Winnie the Pooh) as a simple farm hand. And Willard Robertson's performance as the overly dramatic defense attorney early in the film is one for the ages. This is another great Christmas-set movie that I'd never seen before and which I will now happily add to my list of seasonal rewatches!

"Isn't this damn near unmatched with its heartwarming and heartrending ethos? Not an easy mode to achieve, yet it happens from the moment Lee's trial is postponed by Jack so her Christmas isn't spent in jail. Of course, she's a jewelry thief who he has assigned to prosecute, which gets followed by many contrasts of stirringly immense conduct. Having seen Leisen's Midnight in theaters recently, a glorious paradigm of incidental screwball, that seemed to be my assumption here. Instead, Remember the Night is far lighter on plot, but greatly reinforced by mended compassion. That's a major component of Sturges' script (about 20 minutes at Mrs. Sargent's home, followed by a New Year's barn dance elsewhere), in which Lee's sadness is boosted by curative comfort. Occurring right after the most visceral scene, too, when Lee shudderingly visits her spiteful mother (with some hope she'll be embraced during the holiday spirit), makes this next shift more poignant. As the New Year rings in, a potent reversal unfurls, where even Mrs. Sargent turns pragmatic to suggest that Lee's dishonor could ruin her son's hard work. A vast cavalcade of mutual retraction.
Much earlier, though, it's a bouncier film that wouldn't have prophesized where we'd go. Adored the three main hijinks—which deserve more than a brisk mention—as if we're in Sturges' familiar domain. O'Leary's wacky flamboyance to the jury (""Then, a crazy idea! I'll hoc the bracelet to go to Long Island!""), hands flailing with multiple impersonations, is so dynamic that Stanwyck gazes with astonishment to her attorney, though MacMurray is amusingly content for him to prattle on. (Played by Willard Robertson, a highly prolific character actor who I've seen little else from, yet owns his frenzied theatrics.) Then there's Jack milking a cow after he gets lost in a Pennsylvanian field (along with the hilarity of it mooing through Lee's passenger side), the first sign where a solicitor in New York has embraced his homelier roots as a Hoosier. Equally sidesplitting is Lee's abrupt plan to start a wastebasket fire (or else Hank's claims of their property destruction would be severe), then bested by Mrs. Emory throwing water on him and her husband. In that sense, it's so delightfully eccentric.
In another sense (and clearly the focal one), absolute merit reigns, by dint of Stanwyck's rueful brittleness and amazed gratitude. (A quote that somehow encapsulates both emotions: ""You mean...you're taking me home with you?"") Around a decade has passed since Lee's even considered to return home. Makes retroactive sense due to being banished from her mother because of shoplifting, only worsened when she's rejected again. There's a powerful flourish as Lee's mother walks away from the distant window in left-frame (after gazing at Lee's tearful despair on the porch), casually content to never see her again. I wouldn't quite call this one of MacMurray's best performances—he does what's required as a paean for decency—but offers shades that deepen. Truly enjoyed how his love is conveyed for Lee (by treating her with contempt so the jury can show compassion), and the subsequent close-up of confounded realization is soul-stirringly lovely. That's superb plotting, in which Lee invokes sacrifice to express her love, pleading guilty so Jack's career can stay afloat.
Since when has a Christmas rom-com been concluded with this amount of bittersweet excellence? Far worthier to go there instead of a crowdpleaser (which Jack could've created by telling Lee to jump bail), and if that did transpire, it'd surely cheapen her. (Around this moment, MacMurray and Stanwyck receive a tip-top location where they're stunningly framed at Niagara Falls.) Other grace notes exist from earlier, such as their dance to Louis Armstrong's ""Indiana"" (a nostalgic ode for Jack and Lee's hometown), but then she suddenly departs mid-song, fueled by bleak memories that don't align with the Wabash's moonlight. So close to perfection this could've been (aside from Rufus as a stereotyped black character, then Jack mocks his valet's cadence), nor does that leaven with Fred 'Snowflake' Toones' laugh. Otherwise, I did like the opening 25 minutes (once Jack and Lee leave New York, the remaining hour and change is flawless), right until their acknowledged severance. ""Will you stand beside me and hold my hand when they sentence me?"" ""Of course, I will"", they vulnerably assert in a darkened jail cell, with only wistful patience being strained between them. If that's not love, well, then what is?",4.5
"Christmas gifts arrived late and the tree is still up so it's still OK to be watching Remember the Night, a Preston Sturges penned Christmas romantic comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. No doubt Stanwyck and MacMurray have chemistry, but Sturges script is a little underwhelming, especially in the first half when the film takes the rough shape of a screwball comedy à la Bringing Up Baby or It Happened One Night. It doesn't feel as sharp as Sturges later work, but the film does eventually come into its own as the Stanwyck-MacMurray relationship develops. It's a sincere melodramatic romance, I really believed it. It's a tender and sentimental film, perhaps a little overloaded, but that's typical of holiday fare. Barbara Stanwyck never misses.",3.0

"Criteron tells me this is the last movie Preston Sturges wrote before he started directing--which tracks since it feels like he'd mostly come into his own but not quite.
There's a touch of humor about the Fred MacMurray's black butler (Fred Toones) that just slightly reminded me of Langston Hughes's observation in 1939 that ""as far as Negroes are concerned,"" Hollywood ""might just as well be controlled by Hitler."" But to be fair that part took up maybe 30-45 seconds of the 94 minutes of the movie.
Otherwise:
It was clever. It was fun. It was nicely plotted. It was goofy and ridiculous in the ways you'd expect given the basic set-up but it also had some emotional stakes. I was totally enjoying it as a perfectly decent example of The Kind Of Thing It Was right up until the last 5 minutes, which felt like this weird leaden maudlin thing that had been somehow swapped into the movie in place of the final clever Preston Sturges plot twist that would have given the story the frothy ending it so clearly wanted.",0.0

"Four years before they make history with Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck & Fred MacMurray made this cute Christmas romance. stanwyck is caught stealing a watch, MacMurray is a lawyer trying to put her away, but then they end up on a holiday trip together! 
While Stanwyck & MacMurray are great in this, supporting player Beulah Bondinis quite affective as Fred mother.  She has a really great scene where she expertly tells Barbara that’s she’s great while also telling her that she needs to get away from her son.  A real tightrope, and she walks it so well.
 
I spent most of the film wondering why it’s part of Criterion’s Holiday Noir collection, but that ending is pure noir.",3.5

"I've purposely waited to watch this film. Preston Sturges is my favorite screenwriter and director, and it was one of only a few of his films I'd not seen. Moreover, Mitch Leisen is a director's whose work I always adore, and I've already seen their other collaboration, Easy Living. One can only watch a film for the first time once, after all, and I didn't want to waste one of my last chances to see a Preston Sturges film for the first time, but tonight was the night, and Remember the Night was well worth the wait.
This is a lovely film. It isn't an over-the-top screwball comedy as are nearly all of Sturges' directorial efforts, but his fingerprints are all over the film. Leisen's direction is superb, and MacMurray and Stanwyck are at their best.
Had I watched this in my 20s when I first discovered Sturges, I think I would have identified very closely with MacMurray's character. He reminds me of my younger self in so many ways. All I was missing was my Barbara Stanwyck, but then, who isn't?
The ending is unexpected, yet inevitable, and the most perfect ending to this movie that ever could have been written. Kudos to Sturges for not taking the zany way out.
I've always considered The Hudsucker Proxy to be the Coen Bros.' version of a Preston Sturges movie, and this film solidifies my already iron-clad theory. Not only is one joke borrowed verbatim, but MacMurray plays a wholesome boy from Indiana who makes good in New York City. Go Eagles!",5.0

"My enjoyment of Remember the Night was a pleasant surprise. I should have trusted in Preston Sturges (his last screenplay before he began directing his work himself). And Barbara Stanwyck. I'm not particularly fond of ""Christmas"" films (bah humbug!), that's why I'd never seen this one despite my love for Sturges and Stanwyck. Remember the Night is clearly a Christmas movie. Yet, after a slow start, I was utterly charmed.
The story of Stanwyck, as a thief awaiting the completion of her trial who is taken in by the prosecuting attorney because she has no where else to go during the Christmas holidays, could have veered seriously into schmaltz land. And they travel to Indiana for family sing-a-longs and small town community dances? Oh boy, that plot starts clanging warning bells off for me. Yet, Sturges's script, with enough dashes of humor amid the sentimental, and Stanwyck's beguiling performance, had me falling hard for this warm-hearted romantic drama. It's preposterous to not be amazed by Stanwyck. I don't care if she's simply combing her hair, delivering well-timed lines, or saying nothing at all, eyes brimming with life and possibly tears, as usual, she is impossible to look away from on-screen.",4.0

The moral scrutinies in this movie were driving me up the wall in frustration. Racist treatment of Rufus really stands out w much space Sturges gives other one off side-characters on their path along the way & is a commonality in his writing I’m noticing.

Fred MacMurray on the other hand, has always rubbed me the wrong way ever since I was a kid watching reruns of My Three Sons and the old Disney movies. So, watching his character here throw around casual racist comments and (cute?!) jokes about beating women like dogs, really didn’t make me love him any more. This film is definitely a relic from the past and doesn’t necessarily age well. 
Taking it all into context, I’d say it’s worth watching just for Stanwyck.",3.0

"Everything I've read about Remember the Night focuses on how Sturges didn't like Leisen's changes, which seemed to mostly center on making MacMurray's Jack more reserved and less theatrical. In the hands of Ray Milland or Don Ameche in that regard this probably would be on of the great screwball romances, but I think Leisen's change actually makes a more compelling romance. Sturges and female characters/women in general is complicated to say the least but I wish Motchell Leisen got significantly more credit for his work, particularly in regard to his female characters.",4.0

"68/100
Barbara Stanwyck is incredible, to no one’s surprise—least of all mine—and she carries the shifting emotions and layers of them throughout with her usual mix of constant control and light touches. ”Gee you been sweet”: The way she says it, under her breath, a millisecond before she knows a door is about to opened, almost as a preemptive plea to Jack (Fred MacMurray) to not leave her side, as if she knew it all already—it’s unreal. Otherwise the movie is good at subverting the most basic expectations, and making something of its own from an inherently sweaty comedic premise; it all works, though I waited all movie long for my own complete investment in these characters and their situation—despite the indelible presence of Stanwyck.",3.5

"Lee: ""Supposing you were starving to death. And you didn't have any food, and you didn't have any money, and you didn't have any place to get anything. And there were some loaves of bread out in front of the market. Now, remember, you're starving to death. And the man's back is turned. Would you swipe one?""
Jack: ""You bet I would.""
Lee: ""That's because you're honest. You see, I'd have a six-course dinner at the table d'hôte across the street, and then say I'd forgotten my purse. Get the difference?
Jack: ""Yeah. You're way smarter.""
Lee: ""That's it. We're smart.""
Stanwyck and MacMurray can't wholly shake - or rather, are foreshadowing, since this comes four years earlier - their sensual noir chemistry undercurrent, but then lines like ""How long since you've been home?"" ""Never."" aren't pushing them to.
It's not actual noir like It's a Wonderful Life, nor as hilarious as Christmas in Connecticut, nor as dark as my favourite Christmas tragi-comedy The Apartment (also with MacMurray, and since it was the first role I remember him in he can never shake the core of cheerful sleaze);
but it's got some edge underneath the patter all right - two desperately lonely utterly hilarious con artists, who have friends / family (respectively) in name only, who recognise all those things in each other. (Mum later giving a speech about 'not having enough love as a child' is terribly on-the-nose, but very in-vogue for the 30s and 40 psychology-in-movies, so, we allow it.)
Fred MacMurray hopping around a cow while holding a thermos between his knees and in a suit and dress shoes is not just peak physical comedy but some kinda magic.
. . . BUT what kinda man takes off his leather driving gloves to milk a cow, but NOT EAT A SANDWICH?
Speaking of, there's a cutting burn about the size of Jack's hands vis a vis piano playing, but the way Lee watches Jack butcher the song as she falls for him in the following scene, you know it doesn't matter to her a whit.
""You do love him though, don't you?""

"Mitchell Leisen directing a script by Preston Sturges starring Barbara Stanwyck costumed by Edith Head and art directed by the great Hans Dreier.
How could this film not be a classic? What’s even more surprising is it lives up to its murder’s row of talent in front of and behind the scenes.
The New Years barn dance is like an Americana version of Dreier’s opulent masqued ball in von Sternberg’s Dishonored (1931). It really is just further proof he’s the best to ever do it and if he’s art director then you know the whole film is going to look phenomenal. Also, the Niagara Falls climax is one of the most beautifully filmed sequences I’ve ever seen. It alone would make this a masterpiece.",0.0
"Holy mother Stanwyck.
She’s just on another level here. I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, since this was written by Sturges, and she stars as a smart-aleck criminal, but this is not a Lady Eve rehash or more correctly prehash. The setup and her demeanour make you think Stanwyck is going to pull one over the lawyer, but she turns out to be sincere. I was not expecting such pure emotional heft, while still being a witty, and often hilarious yarn.
The movie jumps between a Screwball Comedy, Romantic Melodrama, Coming Home Pilgrimage, Sentimental Christmas Weepy, and a truly heartfelt Road Movie. Stanwyck and Leisen navigate the tonal whiplash without ever losing sight of the core of the character. Multitudes indeed apply and each style is drawn clearly without mudding the works.
Earnest might be the most apt way of describing the film, but it's an earnest approach that doesn't shy away from the darkness. Stanwyck's performance makes you wonder how they'll skirt around the Hays Code to not completely sink this incredibly likable, but also very guilty character. The answers are not easy. The results knotty. But the actions are heartfelt, even when they sting.",4.5
"Stanwyck and MacMurray are such a great onscreen couple. Just oozes that relatable, working class charm. Similarly to their appearance together 16 years later in Douglas Sirk’s incredible THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW (1956), they are an easy pairing to root for.
Got some pretty rough spots (racist caricatures) viewing this in 2023 that are less brazen and front and center than in some of its other contemporaries unfortunately. The principal story here is well told and it does make for a pleasant Holiday story of forgiveness and understanding through imperfections and screw ups. Solid, not without its problems, but breezy and charming. Doesn’t overtake MIDNIGHT (1939) for me, but a lovely romantic comedy outing from Mitchell Leisen all the same.",3.5

The real climax is in that scene with her and the mother, where it all comes rushing in: despite the charm and resourcefulness and heart, she can't escape her past.

My review of the movie is that it’s favoritism because she is an attractive women. The ending is unknown so I don’t know what to think.,3.5
"Bona-fide new Christmas movie favorite, one that resonates fully and roundly for anyone who looks at friends' Christmas photos with their families and has a mix of revulsion and envy at families where everyone seems to be fully enjoying and getting nourishment from each others' company.
Also, I would very gladly use a time machine to go back to 1940 and be a fumbly mess around Barbara Stanwyk. I'm seriously hard-pressed to think of any performance she gave that wasn't instant five-star. Plus, if you wanna be a dork, you can imagine that this is a prequel to ""Double Indemnity,"" with MacMurray being forced to sell insurance after losing his law license from trying to throw the case, Stanwyk moving to California and marrying into money, and the two pretending not to know each other because of various NDAs and general embarrassment around the events of four years before.",5.0
"Oh this is why Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are so good in Double Indemnity together. They had practice. In Remember the Night - they don't kill anyone, just a little light theft, perjury and arson.
Remember is an incredibly sweet movie. Mitchell Leisen's direction may dampen Preston Sturges' script. You can feel the movie wanting to Stuges Extra, but it never does. Which is maybe why Sturges started to direct his own scripts. I really do love watching Barbara and Fred on screen together - they are so sharp and playful. For me it's why the movie works. That and the fact this movie has freaken Winnie the Pooh himself, Sterling Holloway.",3.5
"não gostei do final, achei que o filme seguiu o romance num ritmo muito acelerado que tirou a naturalidade do desenvolvimento da relação, mesmo considerando a época que foi produzido

"679: A Christmas romance featuring the future stars of the noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY is easy to pass by but manages to stand on its own. The comedy is a bit of a miss, but the film is packed with heart and Stanwyck completely owns it. Add in some nice character work, especially Sterling Holloway who nearly steals his scenes and there’s a lot to like. Stanwyck is just mesmerizing in this, managing to slide from street smart city girl to small town farm girl within a single shot and without a word, all in mannerisms, just incredible to watch and impossible not to fall for. A three star picture with a five star performance from Stanwyck. It’s not a Christmas classic, but it sits on the shelf just fine.",3.5

Power imbalance but still a very engaging Christmas romance. A rather sweet outing for Barbara Stanwyck despite the whole premise being her arrest. Love how despite knowing the truth Jack's family is still shipping
A lot to say about the influence of love on a person in this one, both lack of and upon gaining, positive and negative. A bit of a turnabout from modern Christmas movies where the big city successful lawyer is also the one doing the let me show you the magical small town effect of Christmas

I never get tired of it and because of this movie, I make popovers every Christmas morning. Preston Sturges is one of the greatest writers in film. MacMurray and Stany have the most amazing chemistry that I’m questioning if they were actually in love. There are great performances by everyone. This is just the sweetest little film with a beautifully written theme that never gets cliché or overdone. I just love this movie so much and I look forward to watching it every Christmas.

an odd duck. you can feel the battle between Sturges and Leisen, and i'll side with Leisen every time. classic road picture structure has typical hills and valleys. quasi-irresolution ending took me by surprise. niagara falls scene is stunning, and her turnaround in new york is frustrating (and totally realistic –– it's just that all that we get in between YES last night and NO this morning is the falls fading into NYC –– i guess it's all you ""need"" but it's still jarring).

"Now, this is very old-times romantic, straight, and melodramatic - but if those aren’t caveats, this is one of the best holiday films I’ve seen. It’s just a really good movie, even with a heavily, heavily suspect synopsis like that. I was honestly prepared for some trash.  You’d think it’s puritanical, but actually the messaging is pretty well done too. Especially for it’s time.
It’s toned down from, say, It’s A Wonderful Life anyway, and that’s a heck of a flick even with that baked in.",4.5
"I loved this movie! Deserves a place as a Christmas classic. I’m not always the biggest Fred MacMurray fan, but he and Barbara Stanwyck had wonderful chemistry here and work so well together—in my opinion, even better than in Double Indemnity, which they’d make some years later. I plan to watch this one yearly now!",4.5
"Stanwyck & MacMurray are just such a delightful pairing, there’s no wonder they would collaborate a further three times of the back of this charming picture. Even though I’ve seen it a thousand times, the classic opposites attract trope is so fun to watch play out here & that’s really down to the gravitas of the two leads. Bold ending here as well.",3.5
"Some real charm in this one. Somehow Double Indemnity did nothing for me, but gee shucks. Stanwyck is kinda a doll no? Anyways. Maybe I should give that ""classic"" another go, but I weirdly struggle with thee ole Film Noir in general.
There's enough quick wit to keep the banter flowing and the kinda strangeness of the story make for pretty compelling non-traditional holiday fare.

"Maybe my favourite Barbara Stanwyck performance?? Her versatility is unmatched -- she can deliver sassy wisecracks in one scene, and bring you to tears with her pathos in the next. Plus, she has to act with a cow. Fred MacMurray is kind of a drip, as usual, and barely speaks for a good chunk of this, which is fine with me.
The premise of this movie is completely improbable, but whatever. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I could not in good conscience rate a Christmas movie 5 stars when it ends with Barbara Stanwyck going to prison.",4.5

"“People aren’t responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls”
Well, that’s a surprise. What a perfectly paced, genre spanning, diamond miracle of a film. What starts out as a seemingly normal Preston Sturges slapstick becomes a romance laced with tragedy and hope throughout. Barbara Stanwyck has never been better; watch her fall in love with MacMurray’s Jack Sargent as he plays the piano in his childhood home, brimming with love. Watch her hilarious reaction to Willard Robertson’s Francis X O’Leary’s marvelous “hypnosis” defense (that by itself being one of the funniest scenes of all time).  And watch her face the music and strive for redemption at the end, weeping for the past she lost but finding hope in Jack’s love for her. Loved it.",4.5

"Where has this been all my life? 
Stanwyck AND Christmas. And a script to match it. A well-hidden gem everyone should know about, cause you’ll love it too.
Watched Remember the Night as part 2 of a Mitchell Leisen double feature, after the almost perfect Midnight. Had my hopes up, with Barbara and all (McMurray!), but hadn’t dared to believe this could be the better one. If so, why wouldn’t it be more famous? Still don’t know. 
Because it is a Mitchell Leisen? Outside small circles few know who he was and indeed which films he made. Midnight might not be Only Angles Have Wings, and Remember the Night isn’t as wholesome as that other Stanwyck yuletide classic Christmas in Connecticut – but the films are a lot closer to true masterpieces than most in the genre, and well on par with almost anything Cukor/Hawks/Sturges/Capra made, not to mention celebrated films from guys like Van Dyke, La Cava or McCarey. And yet this is only my third* Mitchell Leisen, and I only now that thanks to a place like Letterboxd.
Apparently Leisen was more or less pushed out of the inner circles of Hollywood for being openly gay, according to this great piece I googled, and his films buried. And with people like Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges backstabbing him (”an interior decorator who couldn't direct”), it’s easy to see how he faded away, with only minor success beyond the early 40s.
Sure, visually he wasn’t always up there with the greats and his output seems a bit hit and miss, especially when he steered away from the comedy route. But the interior decorator had tricks up his sleeve, staging elegant scenes in front of a chateau (Midnight) or inside a Midwestern cottage (Night), or just nailing the meet cute.
Was it the scripts that made him? Wilder & Brackett on Midnight, Preston Sturges on Easy Living and Remember the Night aren’t the worst companions in the industry. But they seem to have complained enough to give us a hint that the director knew something about film. And he did have a knack with actors (at least two Academy Awards wins). It doesn’t hurt to have the ace duo of Claudette Colbert and Barbara Stanwyck in these two films (and Jean Arthur in Easy Living) either – but someone needed to give them direction, and old Mitch seems like the guy who did it right. Colbert isn’t as magic as Stanwyck or Arthur in my book, but by God I’ll never compain when she shows up. The men, ah Fred is Fred and Don Ameche… he’d be fed to the lions opposite Stanwyck but survives Paris as Colbert’s beau (we all know he is).
Ah, just go watch these films, you won’t regret it. Remember the Night is now forever on my Christmas watchlist.

Don't love the ""of the time"" racism, will be skipping those scenes like the scenes in Holiday Inn in the future, but this is definitely getting added to my Christmas movie rotation.",4.5
"Basically designed to ruin me. A movie about going to someone else’s home for the holidays and realizing that you could’ve had it so differently, that there exists a wholeness you've never had access to. I could feel the oppression of that, the sadness—knowing that you are experiencing something that isn’t really yours. That corset scene—Babs squeezing herself into something that wasn’t designed for her, the end result both beautiful and painful. You can’t change the past. And then for it all to be pulled away so gently. With a version of kindness, but one that isn’t directed at her and anyway, she doesn’t really believe it should be.
I’m trying to decide if the code ruined the ending, or forced what is perhaps the only real ending this could have. Is it unrestrained morality, or love as a manifestation of self destruction? Either way, there’s no happy ending here. Romance, but not happiness. Sometimes I wonder if maybe it’s not possible for them to coexist",3.0

Beautifully directed by Leisen from a brilliant screenplay by Preston Sturges – the last before starting his directorial career – this luminous film conveys the sentimental gleam of new-found love but goes well beyond the hide-bound conventions of romantic comedy. Leisen’s handling of the romance between prosecutor Fred MacMurray and the savvy shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) he falls for, caught stealing a diamond bracelet during the Christmas rush, is surprisingly complex and unexpectedly moving. A knowing follow up to the director and writer’s Easy Living, it also features Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway.

"The plot consists of a series of unlikely events and its focus on the importance of familial love should be sweet, but there's just so much distracting from it. The casual sexism is surely something to behold, but you really can't walk two steps out of bed without encountering some form of racism in this movie. Rufus (Fred Toones) deserved so much better than this.
The thesis statement of this movie is that nurture (not nature) is what determines whether a person is a ""good"" or ""bad"" member of society later in life. And that would be just fine, but it goes a step further into ""there wouldn't be any bad people if they were loved"" territory and that's too broad of a topic for this story to tackle well. While I can suspend my disbelief enough to accept the circumstances of this romance plot, the bold claim that ""she falls in love with a man and decides she'll never steal again"" isn't as effective as it hopes to be.",2.5

"There is a mysterious alchemy at work in Remember the Night. It has something to do with the road trip narrative and the way that shapes the movie’s unique stylistic choices; the finite nature of the romance, which imbues every scene with a heartbreaking fatalism (“But you do love him, don’t you?” “I’m afraid so”); the shimmering high-contrast images, suggestive of the wintry season and its melancholy undercurrents; and Barbara Stanwyck, subtle and intense and warm, giving one of the ten or so greatest performances to ever grace the screen. Ultimately, it’s pure magic.",5.0
"In brief:
Beautifully shot with a classic performance from Stanwyck (one of many she did). Solid chemistry between leads. Slightly saggy middle and awkward portrayal of a black servant slightly let it down
In Full:
Gloriously stylish in black and white, Stany never looked better. This is a great tale of romance and redemption.. Stanwyck plays a con artist thief caught stealing a diamond bracelet, Fred MacMurray prosecutes but takes pity as it's Christmas and posts her ball through a slightly nefarious contact who then dumps her on him and they end up on a journey together, through the country, their past and their feelings
I must point out Fred has a black servant who is very yassar and all that kind of thing and is portrayed as a bit dim. This is of course just a cultural element of the time so obviously we can't truly damn it but it does feel a tiny bit awkward this day and age.
To deal with the core of this though, it's a wonderful masterclass in acting from an actor largely forgotten, or at least she's a bit ignored. Her trademark use of her eyes is forever exceptional as they dart about taking in her opposite player and surroundings. Her use of breaking and body language come to the fore in a particular heartbreaking blow scene but as usual from her in a natural realistic way, quite unusual for the time. While contemporaries Katherine Hepburn, Korean Crawford and Bette Davis were all incredible powerful performers, they were always a bit too much on the show boating side. Stanwyck has subtlety and restraint to make her characters feel real.
There is a progressive element to the story too in so far as she's a woman taking control of her own destiny, not defined by a relationship with a man. She makes her own way in the world, albeit by criminal means (in some ways she's almost Catwoman you could argue)
The film does get bogged down a bit of old country America stylings with a sing song around a piano and a barn dance at Fred's family home. It's another 'of the time' moment and to some extent is excusable for the ideas of showing what a caring family is like, it's just a shame it drags the pace and wit down a bit.
The film is also a wonderful example of monochrome photography, making great use of contrasts in the fashion and other careful use of Shadow and highlight.. It's the sort of thing that only works in black and white and really only in that time period.
The romance while obviously going to happen from the start, is built beautifully over the duration. The tension kept for long time to make the get together more satisfying when it happens.
All in all a beautifully made film with a lovely romance and solid Christmas time elements. If you like classic romance stylings without being twee, ensure you see this",4.0

This is Stanwyck and MacMurray's second best film together, but there aren't many duos who can claim that their second best is quite this good.",4.5

Eu gosto de Remember the Night, e nessa revisita ainda me emocionou em muitos momentos.
Porém, é um filme repleto de machismo e exige um esforço deixar esses pontos de lado e investir no romance de Lee e Jack.
É um filme melancólico e que reflete muito do que era o papel da mulher na sociedade americana de 1940s.
Mas vale muito a pena ser visto para refletir sobre a representação da mulher no cinema. E claro, para se derreter com toda a doçura de Stanwyck, maravilhosa como sempre.",4.0
"Pretty good Christmas film. It drags in the first act, but I did feel invested by the two-thirds mark. The film unlocked for me during a piano scene just over halfway through. I wish the cinematography wasn't so plain; the characters and dialogue provide most of the motion and emotion. The lighting is good, so that helps. And this might have been just me, but the Rufus character read like a racist stereotype, and it made the first third of the film much harder to get through.
Give it a shot. It's not amazing, but I'd call it better than decent.",3.5
"First half is some of the most vital, energetic comedy ever committed to film. Second half is just as witty, but also achingly romantic and deeply poignant. Sturges’ scripting is astonishingly dense, Leisen’s direction precise and unfussy with a few perfectly-judged expressive flourishes-the Niagara Falls two-shot is astonishingly beautiful. MacMurray and Stanwyck carry the whole thing with their frankly unreal screen presences and chemistry.

It’s always refreshing to see Barbara Stanwyck play someone other than a conniving femme fatale, though unlike Baby Face and Sorry, Wrong Number where she isn’t a monster but ends up punished for behaving like one, Remember the Night offers her a real chance at redemption in a way that’s bittersweet yet nonetheless satisfying.
A few things are dated by today’s standards, but none more blatantly than the über racist characterization of Rufus, the black servant. If you can make it through the cringe of his scenes without losing your lunch, the rest of the film is a delight. I think it’s earned a spot on my list of great holiday movies.",4.5

There's a shot midway through where Stanwyck and MacMurray are standing on her mother's front porch after having been rejected by her yet again and you see her mother walk down the hall and peer out the door window at them and then walk away and the light goes dark that is just about perfect and possibly my favorite shot of all time.
Wonderful supporting cast, esp. Bondi and Holloway.

"Much more heartwarming than I was expecting, and proved to me how great Barbara Stanwyk was as an actress. She and MacMurray have great, natural chemistry, and she’s just a well written character—she expects nothing good from anyone, is incredibly world-weary, but she isn’t all bad, just grew up rough and turned into exactly why she was expected to be—a thief. Seeing her transform throughout the movie was a treat. I just wanted more dialogue between her and Fred to show their developing affection for each other. Her sacrifice at the end is definitely a tear-jerker…for once, she thought of someone other than herself and wanted to do what was right for him. And it was cliffhanger – how long was the sentencing going to be for? HOW LONG?!?!?

"they’ve made bout 100 of these type of films and they're all just so fire. i dont know if its the charm of the 30s-40s romcoms or what but theyre just so enjoyable. this one has prestons signature screwball comedy that levitates it even more. the christmas scenes are pure elation, perfect to throw on at any time during holiday season. has some great crisp lighting and some the best ive seen preston write romance. takes a pondering dark whirl into the idea of bonding a crook and a family loving attorney. barbara stanwyck is too good at stealing peoples hearts. you also dont see many cameos by windsor, ontario in film so thats a plus!",4.0
"christmas or not, I would watch Miss Barbara Stanwyck read a gd phone book for hours—nay, days—on end, but this witty and sweet holiday flick is made all the more charming as the Sliding Doors-esque yin to Double Indemnity’s deep, dark, noirish yang. if only Phyllis and Walter had met this way instead!

"an adept amalgamation of comedy and melodrama. stanwyck is typically suberb. she has such a singular skill set that ranges from looking ravishing in a fur coat to performing physical comedy with a real cow. and fred macmurray is her perfect foil. it’s all rather hilarious except for when it isn’t, and i admired that it went as deep and dark as it did. there’s definitely some moments that made me cringe, but it has a lot of love in it and i am a sucker for anything with a new year’s scene.",4.0

"This is a lovely little holiday romance and the way MacMurray and Stanwyck look at each other just makes me swoon. It is the cutest and so very believable that they're two very different people falling in love.
The at home 'hick' stuff might have been a little too overdone, but I still enjoyed the time they spent with the Sargent family. When the story came back around to the courtroom it didn't quite go the way I'd thought it would - but I still liked the ending...a real 'love conquers all' sort of message.

"Love blooms between a sympathetic attorney (Fred MacMurray) and the comely shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) he has taken home for the Christmas holiday.
Four years before their classic pairing in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck starred in this very sweet and sentimental romantic comedy directed by Mitchell Leisen from a screenplay by Preston Sturges. Stanwyck plays Lee Lender, who’s arrested for stealing a bracelet from a New York City jewelry store, and MacMurray plays John ""Jack"" Sargeant, the assistant district attorney assigned to prosecute her. The trial begins just before Christmas, but to avoid facing a jury filled with the holiday spirit, Jack has the trial postponed on a technicality. When he hears Lee complaining to her lawyer about spending Christmas in jail, Jack feels guilty and asks a bondsman to post bail, who assumes that Jack wants to force Lee into an affair, and after freeing her, he delivers her to Jack's flat. Discovering that Lee is from Indiana like he is, and that she has nowhere to spend Christmas, Jack offers to drop her off at her mother's house on his way to visit his own family.
Now given this premise and the previous work of Leisen and Sturges, I expected this to be another screwball comedy, but it’s definitely much more of a traditional romantic drama with comedy sprinkled in. When Jack drops Lee off at her mother’s and sees that she doesn’t want a relationship with her daughter, he offers to bring her to his family’s home to spend Christmas with them. Naturally they end up falling in love even though they get back to New York, Jack is still gonna hafta prosecute her for her crime, leading to a surprising, moving ending. 
It should go without saying that MacMurray and Stanwyck are both great with incredible chemistry. It should also go without saying that Stanwyck is ridiculously charming and beautiful. Beulah Bondi is great too as Jack’s mother, while Sturges’ script is great and Mitchell provides great direction. This was a very sweet, pleasant surprise. 
Stray notes:

"Pleasant enough rom com with A list cast of pros working their magic, but it never quite takes flight. 
I’m 100% certain that a mistrial will be declared and Fred’s getting disbarred.",3.5
"REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a strange hybrid screwball comedy/holiday picture/road-trip movie, with a little film noir thrown in. It has the last screenplay written by Preston Sturges that he let anybody else direct, and he didn’t like the changes this director made. Maybe Sturges’ original script would have worked better. The director though is Mitchell Leisen, who directed the wonderful EASY LIVING with Jean Arthur and the equally great MIDNIGHT with Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert. Many people love REMEMBER THE NIGHT as well.
Judging the success of a movie that shifts radically in tone is very subjective. When I think it’s done well, there’s nothing I like better. But this one just didn’t end up working. I loved much of it. It’s very well shot, and is the first of several wonderful pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Most of the elements work fine together. It’s the sudden shifts into dark noir territory that aren’t prepared for or handled well. Those scenes don’t take up much screen time, but they throw the whole thing off.
Most egregious is a lapse in professional propriety undertaken by MacMurray’s character (a prosecutor) and Stanwyck’s (a thief out on bail). I had suspended my disbelief easily because I thought I was being asked to do so for the sake of fun, but unexpectedly this breach of conduct becomes a noirish plot point and in fact central to the movie.
This turning of a silly screwball premise into something serious not only wrecks the mood but wrecks MacMurray’s character as well, a man who we are given to understand is quite smart and ambitious and even street-wise. Such a man would never do what he does, unless nobody would notice in the make-believe world of a particular movie. You can’t have it both ways.
You may be able to shrug it off and enjoy the other 9/10s of the film for what it is, with lots of warmth and humor and terrific acting by Stanwyck. I’m very fond of a lot of it. But there are some odd scenes that go nowhere, and the serious stuff just doesn’t fit in.",2.5
"There’s still some very clear Preston Sturges artifacts that made it through Leisen’s screenplay chicanery unharmed — the high concept storyline of the shady and the righteous melting together is a theme Sturges would revisit frequently, as is the use of travel to facilitate that melting and the visit to the righteous homestead where more rounded characters can help to coax things together. The zip and wit is really downplayed though, replaced with a heaping pile of schmaltz that doesn’t do a great job of selling the ridiculous story. 
Is it really Leisen’s hack job that’s to blame? There’s something about the very unsatisfying ending that feels like some Hays code accommodations were made and that the sloppy results came out of a conference room rather than a bungalow on the lot. Stanwyck is still a force though and this first pairing with MacMurray feels natural and sincere. They’re doing a lot to make this a pretty enjoyable tugging on the ol’ heartstrings, and I couldn’t help but be charmed.
Bonus points for an oddball Sterling Holloway appearance, the cow and the rural courtroom, and a corset tightening; markdowns for some early race stuff, and  the mistreatment of popovers.",3.5
"The chemistry between the lead pair is crackling - they don't even need Sturges' script as their eyes provide their own sort of repartee - but the concept and its equation of financial sense and love is a strange and souring one. This unsettling feeling culminates in the New Years dance which is either meant to be a Barnyard event, or a posh one with a farmyard theme, but everyone looks out of place either way. The folksy affect akin to the Tom character included early on. When we, like the pair, are able to forget about the circumstances that brought them together and simply watch them be there though this is an extraordinarily charming time.",2.5
"This is a really sweet film. It's really wholesome and sincere without suffering from any of the Hollywood corniness of the era. Having been watching a lot of Preston Sturgess films this year and seeing he wrote it, I could sense his fingerprints all over the place. This was a pleasant surprise for a random watch.",4.0

Also the one line where shes grinning her teeth out semi bashful but happy go lucky while explaining that her hotel evicted her. That pretty much sums up what I love about Stanwyck.

"Starts and ends pretty great. The middle is largely forgettable and basic except for the awesome noir style cinematography we get as MacMurray and Stanwyck move through the country.
Love the final courtroom scene. We're drawn in by MacMurray overacting and we see exactly what he's doing. But in the background Stanwyck's face begins to change subtly and her eyes start to glaze over. She does so much with so little. It's an awesome piece of acting.
It would have been so easy to just not have the Rufus character in this movie at all.",3.5
"Cute but contrived -- I mean come on, there is no way an assistant district attorney is even going to have dinner with a woman he's prosecuting for shoplifting, much less take a road trip with her. This is the kind of thing I can accept in a screwball comedy, where everything is larger than life and we're not really supposed to be concerned with realism, but REMEMBER THE NIGHT mostly plays things straight and I didn't laugh that much (and the racist ""humor"" of the scene with John's dimwitted black manservant left a bad taste in my mouth).
Stanwyck and MacMurray have terrific chemistry, at least, and I was impressed that this has a much tougher ending than I was expecting. Pleasant but inessential.",3.5

"The first of four movies barb would make with freddie mac, who btw is only good when he’s in a comedy so thankfully he won’t be too bad in this. When they made the movie, Barb was 32 and fred was 31, both around the same stage in their careers, household names but not the superstardom they’d eventually both reach. Barb was on a big rolL here, Makin golden boy with will holden’s starring debut just before this, and making the lady eve and meet John Doe wiith ball of fire coming soon after. Wild run. preston sturges did the script for this movie and he was getting ready to become a notable American writer/director, This was the last time someone else would ever be directing one of his screenplays. To this point he’d been writing in hollywood for a decade, and for as long as he’d been writin em, he’d be feeling that directors were getting it wrong, no exception here with director mitch leisen. Mitch edited preston’s script to suit for what he thought were the strengths of our two stars here, but in doing so, cut a buncha dialogue that preston wrote. preston had enough and he pushed and pestered producers to let him direct his own screenplays, paramount eventually caved, and preston sold them the screenplay for the great mcginty for $10, on the condition that he would be hired to direct it.
Idk how prestons version woulda been but this felt about as wordy as it needed to be. Unless he had a buncha great funny lines idk how it could be too much better. It’s predictable and good lord do I HATE that ending. That bullshit gotta do the time morality bs. It’s actually immoral to not steal from the rich, it’s a public service to steal from the wealthy irl and url. Anyways tho it’s a sweet christmas movie reminding u that ppl make “mistakes” and ppl deserve forgiveness and that “criminals” can be as good a person as anyone else. Barb is so great as always and also unsurprisingly fred is just playing fred here. Nice Lil movie. Christmas movies are the best. I wanna watch 1 per month until Christmas comes round again.

"A beautiful love story between a pickpocket (Barbara Stanwyck) and the district attorney (Fred MacMurray) assigned to prosecute her. Out of benevolence, he posts bail so she won't have to stay in jail over Christmas and when he finds out she's from Indiana, too, he offers to take her to her family. Some real heartwrenching turns that prove the theme that love heals all wounds: when Stanwyck accepts the offer of a ride to Indiana; the outpouring of love she witnesses when MacMurray's family opens presents on Christmas Day; when Stanwyck realizes, on the stand, that he is trying to throw the case to keep her out of jail and she promptly admits her guilt in order to be worthy of his love.

An almost flawless film, were it not for Rufus's writing, and MacMurray eating a sandwich with leather gloves.",4.5
"A bizarre, hilarious, nuanced, and ultimately grounded story of propriety and romance, a brilliant Sturges script brought to life by a captivating and talented cast, anchored by the G.O.A.T., Barbara Stanwyck.
For me, Stanwyck like no other can move me with a glance or an expression and raise my emotions to make me laugh out loud, spill tears, or feel her indignation. I am hers forever.
It’s not all raves. This tale is glaringly marred by the racist caricature of the black servant, Rufus, who for the short time he spends on screen is regularly demeaned by Jack Sergeant (McMurray). This was particularly disappointing because part of our investment in the trajectory of the main characters hinges on belief in the good-hearted, principaled nature of Jack, and thus his character’s motivations and decisions. 
Fortunately Jack’s transgressions happen early in the film, so though we cannot forget them, they are at least given some distance from the meat of the story. From then on we are allowed to drift and enjoy an almost flawless picture.
This will be a hard watch for some, and rightfully so, but I would encourage anyone who feels they can weather this flaw to do so. There is a beautiful story here.",4.0
The Christmas movie that makes me cry the most. My heart grows every time I watch it. I love it so much!,4.0
"A solid romance drama that at first seemed like a totally goofy comedy but then the other 90% of the movie was super serious and sad. I notice that a lot in old movies.
I thought Fred MacMurray was in his 50s but he's actually younger than me in this movie.
The very odd brother character back home would have been a great Crispin Glover role.
The only real problem with this is some uncomfortable racial stuff in a few earlier scenes that I'd feel somewhat strange not mentioning. It is hard to judge these things...how bad are the intentions? How much is just plain ignorance? Is it a racial thing or a character thing (meaning, is his servant being so dumb just a weird joke that would have worked no matter who was cast, or something more awful?) Did the actor have an OK time on set, was everyone respectful, etc...Who knows...wish it wasn't in the film though!",3.5
"A cutesy Christmas romance pairing the handsome charms of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck together, with a screenplay from the comic master Preston Sturges, is a recipe for success. Somewhere along the way, however, Remember the Night gets bogged down in cheery Christmas hokum and loses the thread of wit initially penned by Sturges in its opening act. The opening of the film is quite humorous, with the improbable meet-cute of MacMurray as the New York district attorney prosecuting Stanwyck’s petty thievery, before extending the case past the holidays and bailing her out of jail to take a trip back to their coincidentally shared home of Indiana. Stanwyck shows off her acting chops in the film’s more dramatic moments, such as in confronting her emotionally abusive mom on the holiday trip home and in being warmly embraced by MacMurray’s humble country family in construct to her years of lowly existence slumming in the streets to get by. MacMurray proves less capable than Stanwyck as the film goes on, leaning into the hackneyed tone of the story as thing ramp up toward a romantic conclusion. Their chemistry as a couple, which started strong, dissipates once their inevitable pairing is confirmed, and the story falls into a rote pattern of romantic tropes covered in a tinsel dressing. There’s some other tedious issues, like obnoxious side characters that border on offensive in their depiction of both a Black servant and what appears to be a mentally deficient sibling, but they are mostly ignorable in comparison to the turgid pacing of the narrative. Still, Stanwyck never gives less than her all, and it’s clear that Sturges screenplay had something to it that just didn’t quite make it to the screen without his deft hand behind the directorial wheel. Remember the Night is a decent Christmas romp, with heart and glee and what not, but it’s just shy of having something special to set itself apart from the pack, falling instead into the realm of general Christmas classics that offer warm feelings for the holidays, but little else.",2.5
"""Right and wrong is the same for everybody, see, but the rights and the wrongs aren't the same.""
Now that's a timeless Sturges line. Stanwyck is luminous and perfect, her chemistry with Fred MacMurray is really lovely. But the dated elements, however brief - the caricatured black servant, the corseted homey costume intended to endear us to a Nice Girl by making her old-fashioned/innocent - stood out to me more on this rewatch. There are really nice elements and sentiments to it; I appreciate the genuine care/respect it has for Stanwyck’s character, and even the corny stuff is nice. But it’s bookended by meandering courtroom scenes and that speaks to the movie’s overwhelming issue, which is its pacing. You can hear bits of Sturges in the script, and it makes me yearn for what this movie could’ve been under his direction. It feels a little defanged, and the beats are often uneven. Overall it’s a nice movie, it’s just never as memorable for me as I think it’s going to be.

"Plot Summary: Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) shoplifts an expensive bracelet and is caught down the street. Charges are pressed. During her trial, just before Christmas, her attorney tries to get her off with a a shaky defense of hypnotism while shoplifting. The DA, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), pulls a fast one stating he needs his expert witness and the expert is not available until after Christmas, effectively jailing Lee for the holidays. John has a change of heart, gets Lee bonded out, and takes Lee to her mother. Things don't go well with Lee's mother, so John takes her home. John's family maker her welcome, like a part of the family, and love blossoms between the two.
Thoughts: A pretty good holiday movie with the hard-hearted DA Sargent softening his heart and shifty, edge-of-the-law Leander learning to love rather than steal. Call it cheesy, but this is good old-fashioned Christmas goodness.
Other: Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson as MacMurray's mother and aunt (respectively) with Sterling Hollaway (voice of Pooh) as the farmhand. There is some pretty disturbing racial stereotyping of Fred 'Snowflake' Toones, as MacMurray's butler/house boy.",3.5

"this was a very quiet film but an absolutely excellent one. the loveliness of this movie truly snuck up on me — by the time it ended, I was in love with Lee and John, and hopeful for their bittersweet future together. I liked the things this movie had to say about morality and everyone’s own moral compass, what we all deserve as humans, and the lengths that humans are capable to go for love. The film’s direction was stellar, and there were moments where I actually forgot I was watching a movie— the reality and life-like-ness of the actors, their movements, and their line readings was striking. I think I’ll be coming back to this movie in future Christmas seasons — it’s charming and sexy and melancholic, too.

"Although I can't stand Preston Sturges' treatment of African-American characters in his films (he wrote the script for this one), and you see that again with Rufus here (MacMurray's butler). Thankfully it is early and Rufus lives at MacMurray's apartment in NYC, so once Fred leaves for the holidays to spend time with his mother and family at his farm, out of state, as out-on-bond (arranged kindly by MacMurray so she wouldn't be stuck in jail during Christmas and New Years) pickpocket, Barbara Stanwyck, tags along (she visits her cold mother, disappointed and rejecting her). Going from her mother's cold reception to MacMurray's warm and friendly mother's farm is quite helps Stanwyck's feelings...the lack of feeling and cruelty gives us an understanding as to why Stanwyck is a wreck. MacMurray's comforting presence is really a big help to Stanwyck after that horrible experience with her mom.
The film, to me--after MacMurray and Stanwyck nearly get arrested by a smalltown judge and a farmer who spite out of town city slickers (Stanwyck lights a basket of letters after they give the judge phony names!), accidentally going through a fence due to a bad detour--really reaches its most pleasant and emotionally rewarding when the duo reaches the spacious farmhouse of Beulah Bondi (playing MacMurray's mom), Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), and the great voice actor Sterling Holloway (Winnie, the Pooh, and Kaa of ""The Jungle Book""). Stanwyck bonds with MacMurray's family, they pass around Christmas presents, play the piano and sing, and eventually attend a barnhouse old-fashioned costume dance. Obviously Bondi, knowing that Stanwyck is a criminal and MacMurray will be prosecuting her once they return to NYC, worries that her son could ruin a bright and promising career if he falls in love. Because of MacMurray's sacrifices, Bondi appeals to Stanwyck, hoping she won't hurt her hard-working son's career.
The film definitely thrives off of the cast, and especially the dynamic and chemistry of the leads. Stanwyck's pain, the lack of a real family and actual love, her relieving Bondi of concern about jeopardizing MacMurray or putting him in a predicament, acknowledging her love for him, and realizing that he would give up everything for her, is all there in her exceptional performance. I prefer Stanwyck here than ""Christmas in Connecticut"" because it is more multi-faceted and requires a lot more nuance. Bondi's work, especially when her sister insists Stanwyck and MacMurray are in love at the dance, is also quite rewarding. The Niagara Falls conversation about romance and MacMurray willing to let Stanwyck go with the melodramatic music, ending with a kiss, then back to the courtroom in NYC. Stanwyck unwilling to let MacMurray convince the jury to let her off because ""women are hard to arrest"" because she loves him...her mind just going when in a cab, realizing he might try to help her because he loves her, Stanwyck really gets the point across that despite how she feels, his career is important to her. She's willing to take the time and how Stanwyck reacts to MacMurray telling her he'd wait for her...Stanwyck is just perfect. Those courtroom tactics MacMurray applies to ruffle feathers (jury and even judge), Stanwyck won't allow it. Great stuff.
The show-stealing scene could very well be early in the film before the judge calls for Stanwyck's case to resume after the holidays, as Willard Robertson's blowhardy theatrics for the jury about HYPNOTISM is hilarious. MacMurray just lets him go then asks for a continuance with Robertson's reaction afterward just priceless. Just a wonderful little movie to watch at Christmas time. This was another film I caught on Turner Classic Movies just a few years ago and is now a gem I watch annually every December.",4.5
"Generic Catholic Festivities 2020, Day 14
Close to perfect! The ""A Perfect Day"" scene really was perfect, in fact more perfect than any other existing recording of that song. Stanwyck doesn't even half convince as a homeless serial shoplifter but she convinces so bloody hard as a romantic lead I'm tempted to consider this her finest hour. Ditto MacMurray; both wring every last drop of wry humour and disarming pathos out of Preston Sturges' script. The ending is Hays Code fodder yet paradoxically better for it - it's a sombre, minor key end to an otherwise chipper film wherein every seemingly insurmountable obstacle was swiftly surmounted using the sheer force of quick senses and true love! Doesn't pander, doesn't wallow, doesn't think anything of itself other than what it is, and what it is is fabulous. Close to perfect, just not perfect enough, cos it's a bit racist.

"There's much to like in this old Christmas movie from 1940 starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. And yet it's not one of the all-time best old black & white films I've seen. There are a bunch of old b&w films I've seen that I liked more than this one. Even if I were to pick just Christmas movies, or Barbara Stanwyck movies, there's still better out there, such as It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, and Ball of Fire, to name a few, or Christmas in Connecticut, which was another Christmas movie starring Barbara Stanwyck.

"I had absolutely no plans of watching this tonight but I found out how to watch movies on my tv and whenever something cool like this happens I always want to try first with Remember the Night. 
My mom walked in and instantly recognized Barbara and Fred from Double Indemnity ( a film she literally hasn’t stopped of thinking about ever since I showed it to her to a point where I genuinely think she is trying to plan a perfect crime but whatever) and she later asked me what crazy thing Barbara was doing in this one because she only knows her a psychopath that killed her husband. I had honestly no idea of how to begin to explain, Barbara is such a versatile actress that you can’t pin down just by seeing one of her performances. She shifts so naturally from one character to another that is hard to believe that those to characters have absolutely nothing in common.
Watching this time I realized how unique the Macmurray/Stanwyck collaboration is. Usually when people are partnered they play solely the same characters in a different context, Fred and Ginger, Hepburn and Tracy, Powell and Loy all play very similar roles in all of their films but not Fred and Barbara. Not only the genre of the films change but also the position of power between the characters, their affinity with each other, the relationships. Very big credits to Barbara’s versatility for this but I’d like to praise Fred for making it look so easy too.

"In a few minutes it is going to be Barbara’s birthday and I wanted to just watch something with her. I didn’t originally intend to watch this one specifically, I watched it not that long ago and was wrecked just the same. The emotional ride this film takes you is So Big! 
This time I decided to give Barbara the most attention ever and there was so much detail I missed the other times, in her quieter moments. Stanwyck can do it all, but, for most, she stood out those very loud and dramatic moments, that are very easy to spot. Somehow, she manages to be even better in expressing her conflict in the very quiet scenes, where the camera just closes up to her and you can read her eyes, not her eyes but Lee’s eyes. The empathy I felt this time ripped me open and I started to get emotional within the first 20 minutes of the film. 
Preston Sturges did his best screenplay in this, Leisen his best directing, Stanwyck one of her best performances, with so much nuances and conflicts that just draws you completely inside this body, Macmurray is also great.
Just wanted to celebrate Stanwyck’s birthday with the film that is probably the most personal to me out of all of the ones she has done.",5.0

This is one of my favorite Christmas films.
In this film, Fred MacMurray plays New York DA John Sargent. Barbara Stanwyck plays Lee Leander, a shoplifter who has been arrested for stealing a bracelet from a jewelry store. Because it's her third offense, she has to go through a trial. John has been assigned to prosecute Lee.
The trial takes place right before Christmas. Rather than risking Lee being acquitted by a jury filled with holiday spirit, John has the trial postponed on a technicality. John then overhears Lee complaining to her lawyer that she'll have to spend Christmas in jail (Though really, Lee, you wouldn't be facing this problem if you weren't shoplifting!). Feeling guilty, John invites Lee to spend the holiday with him and his family. John has the bondsman post bail to release Lee for the holiday.
John then learns that Lee, like himself, is also from Indiana. He offers to drop her off at her mother's home on his way to his own. When they reach Lee's home, she is met with contempt by her mother who makes it very clear that she has no interest in entertaining her daughter for the holidays. John invites Lee to his home, where she's warmly greeted by John's mother (the wonderful Beulah Bondi), aunt (Elizabeth Patterson aka ""Mrs. Trumbull"" from ""I Love Lucy""), and cousin (Sterling Holloway, aka Winnie the Pooh aka Cheshire Cat). Even after they're made aware of the nature of Lee's crimes, she's still made to feel part of the family.
As John and Lee spend time together, John finds himself falling in love with Lee. The conflict now lies with John's career and his relationship with Lee.
This is such a wonderful, heartwarming film that everyone should see.",5.0

Preston Sturges' script is otherwise smartly written and well performed by MacMurray and Stanwyck.",4.0
"As I've said in the past, outside of classic horror movies, I am not nearly as familiar with films of the 1930s and 1940s as I should be. Because I am a huge nerd with fucked-up priorities, I feel actual guilt over this. Luckily, Hollywood has been cranking out movies about or at least adjacent to Christmas since the silent days, leaving me lots of older films to fill my December with.
Which brings me to “Remember the Night.” The film has two factors that attract fans of vintage cinema. It was written by the highly respected Preston Sturges and stars siren of the silver screen, Barbara Stanwyck. (Who I previously encounter in “Christmas in Connecticut.”) Sounds like a good choice to kick off the month with!
A few days before Christmas, Lee Leander is caught shoplifting. This is her third offense and she might be facing jail time. The prosecuting attorney is Jack Sargeant, who successfully convinces the jury to postpone the verdict until after the holiday is over. Feeling bad about Lee spending Christmas in a jail cell, he pays her bail. She accompanies him as he drives home to Indiana, with the agreement that he'll drop her off at her mom's house in Pennsylvania. But Lee's mom is an asshole, so she sticks with him as he visits with his own mom and family. As the New Year approaches, the two start to fall in love.
As in the previously reviewed “Christmas in July,” Preston Sturges' dialogue here has certain zip to it. This extends to the character names – as with a colorful bail bondsman named Fat Mike – on down. From early on, the banter is quick and razor sharp. Probably my favorite example of witty exchanges here is when Lee succinctly points out the difference between her and Jack, with the metaphor of stealing a loaf of bread when starving. Another highlight occurs when she sets a fire to escape a tight situation, Lee dismissing the desperate measure in a typical flippant manner. The film is full of wacky situations – such as the couple falling asleep in a cow field, being accosted by the trigger-happy owner the next morning – but it's that fast-paced dialogue that truly keeps this movie light and entertaining.
What elevates “Remember the Night” further is the surprisingly sincere romance at its center. Jack's interest in Lee is motivated by kindness, an emotion which soon turns to something more romantic in nature. The sexual tension between them is evident in that catty dialogue, to the point where neither the audience nor the characters are surprised when they start snogging during the Christmas party.
Ultimately, “Remember the Night” points itself in even more important moral. Lee's mother rejects her daughter as the holiday approaches, because she's a judgmental bitch. Jack’s family accepts her into their home, and their hearts, immediately. Because family, ultimately, is not who you are born with but who you choose. You don't have to spend time with someone if they make you hate yourself. That's an important message to hear, especially around Christmas.
Tying “Remember the Night” together is its lovable cast. Stanwyck is utterly delightful as Lee. She spits the razor-sharp dialogue with confidence and wit. She also displays a clear vulnerability, revealing the sensitive heart at the center of this thorny exterior. She plays off Fred MacMurray extremely well, who is also excellent as Jack. He brings a light-hearted energy to the part, approaching many every challenge with a smile. It's no wonder the two fall in love, as both are delightful.
In the supporting cast, Sterling Holloway is immediately recognizable as Willie, the child-like handler on the ranch. Elizabeth Patterson is so sweet as Aunt Emma, in scenes when discussing the importance of acceptance with Lee over cooking pies.
By the way, “Remember the Night” has a good share of Christmas atmosphere. Its first shot is a snowy city street, with Santa ringing a bell on the corner. There's a tree decoration sequence, a New Year's party, and a big family dinner. In other words, it's an ideal fit to kick off a Christmas movie marathon with. The cast is excellent, the story is full of humor and heart, and the execution is competent. After enjoying this and “Christmas in July,” I guess I should definitely watch more Preston Sturges movie.",3.0
"A petty thief (Stanwyck) is taken pity on by a prosecuting New York DA (MacMurray) who ends up taking her to his Indiana home for Christmas. The only thing that holds this back from utter perfection is a slightly muddled third act with some forced character lurches. What goes before is just wonderful - a playful treatment of morality and tolerance and family and regret. Such clever scripting from Preston Sturges, it just spins intriguing character beats that create these layered, very human characters. And for a light comedy it has a lot of darker spots and some very downbeat aspects. Stanwyck is just perfect as the most honest and noble of thieves, to the extent that she puts all the good people to shame.",4.5

"This column originally appeared in The Independent:
In 1944, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck co-starred in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, a film noir generally regarded as the highpoint for the genre. One of four films featuring both actors, the first had an entirely different tone and ought to be considered one of the great romantic comedies. Remember the Night (1940) was the last Preston Sturges script shot by another director and it’s nothing short of a masterpiece.
Sturges was irritated by the fact that director Mitchell Leisen shortened his script both before and during filming but the result is a blistering pace and the kind of economy most films would undoubtedly benefit from. We open with Stanwyck’s Lee Leander being arrested for stealing a bracelet from a New York City department store. MacMurray’s Assistant District Attorney is assigned to prosecute the shoplifter and has the trial postponed on a technicality since he is concerned the holiday spirit will lead to a lenient jury. Realising Lee will spend Christmas in prison and feeling a pang of conscience, he agrees to drive her home for the holiday season after learning they are both Indiana natives.
The premise is that simple. A respectable, conscientious lawyer and a jaded, cynical career criminal are forced to learn from and about each other as they fall hopelessly in love over a few winter days. The Second World War was raging at the time of the picture’s release and there is a powerful message about the redemptive power of tolerance and the importance of second chances in a cruel, unforgiving world. More importantly, 77 years on, it’s still funny.
Remember the Night was completed eight days ahead of schedule and $50,000 under budget, facts Leisen attributed to the imperious Stanwyck, saying: “She never blew one line through the whole picture. She set that kind of pace and everybody worked harder, trying to outdo her.” Somewhat sensibly, he shifted the focus of the script from MacMurray’s character to Stanwyck’s and was rewarded with a performance of such subtlety, depth and nuance that it’s impossible not to be moved by a line as simple as, “Gee, you’re sweet.”
The film deftly blends humour and sentimentality while functioning as a courtroom drama, road movie and romantic comedy. The leads are perfectly cast and the pathos always feels earned resulting in a denouement that is astonishing moving. Frank Capra fans will find plenty to enjoy in a rare “opposite attracts” romance that never feels mawkish as will anyone with a beating heart.",0.0

"Now this is more what I was looking for in a holiday Barbara Stanwyck film! The screenplay was written by Preston Sturges and feels like it with screwball moments alternating with genuine pathos. Her and Fred MacMurray are such great actors and really sold the slow attraction between the two on their roadtrip.
Sturges was on set for the filming and his annoyance at the changes the director was making was an inspiration for him to start directing. He was so impressed with Stanwyck's professionalism that he promised to write a film for her, which turned into The Lady Eve.",4.5
"I was up early Christmas morning, so I decided to complete the Barbara Stanwyck Christmas Trilogy. While Christmas in Connecticut and Meet John Doe both feature Babs as a cynical journalist trying to pull off some type of dishonest subterfuge for the sake of her journalism career, this one has her as a thief who is remanded to the custody of prosecuting attorney Fred MacMurray over the Christmas/New Year holiday. All of them basically follow the idea of her being redeemed by the love of a nice guy.
This is a for-real Christmas movie, taking place entirely over that holiday week, and it’s one of the most enjoyable old-timey Christmas movies (up there with Its a Wonderful Life and Miracle of Morgan Creek in my book), but also one that you could watch any time of year as a perfectly fun rom com. MacMurray takes her to his family farm in Indiana and they fall in love, basically the template for a Hallmark Christmas romance.
Stanwyck is so damn good in this! She sells the corniest aspects of it so that you never even question it. When Billy Wilder directed his first feature a few years later, one thing he absolutely did not have to worry about was the chemistry of his two stars! The ending…well, it’s for sure post-code, as they really seem to think Stanwyck’s character has to do penance for stealing a fucking bracelet, but like I say, she sells it so well that it’s…only a little annoying.",4.0

"I honestly teared up a number of times just from how decent everyone was being to each other. The set up feels like the set up of a contemporary romantic comedy but when people would normally turn on each other or make a cruel remark in a contemporary film, they just keep trying to do their best by each other. The break up/pulling apart that always happens in romantic comedies about three quarters of the way through the movie also happens here but instead of being because of some misunderstanding or selfish impulse, this pulling apart happens as the result of an attempt to not harm the other person in some way. It’s definitely all propaganda for traditional American family values. But after spending much of this year moving from place to place across two different countries in order to work temporary positions in socially isolated places, it was nice to buy into the fantasy, if only for an hour and a half.

and Barbara Stanwyck continues to be my new crush. greatest comic skills possible with depths of emotion that never seem overdone in the showing but always brimming underneath.

"Almost works, thanks largely to Stanwyck. MacMurray can't quite pull off the aw-shucks good dude role -- he's a better fit in Double Indemnity -- and I think the conclusion largely doesn't work. For a movie that's about MacMurray's character realizing the cruelty of the justice system and the arbitrariness of criminality, the conclusion being ""And that's why she should want to go to jail!"" is truly wild.",3.5
"A delightful treat for the Eve this year. Had no idea Sturges wrote this until the opening credits rolled, but it makes sense - you almost wonder what he could've done with the material in the director's chair. Leisen is capable enough, as always, but still. After watching this, Christmas in Connecticut and Meet John Doe I wonder if we can't declare Stanwyck the queen of Christmas? I think it's high time. She is paired wonderfully with MacMurray here, a fine couple that almost presages their work on Double Indemnity without all that darkness and complexity. Here, it's very light and frothy, but that's okay! It's a nice enough one to watch during the holiday season as your dad snores beside you. Happy Christmas all! 🎄",0.0

"I was expecting something closer to Double Indemnity or a straight comedy and instead got a deeply felt romance. Threw me at first, but wow does the home stretch nail it.

"Very happy to add another Barbara Stanwyck holiday movie to the list! Very wholesome and goofy, but with a dark edge to it. When Stanwyck's character visits her estranged childhood home, it was truly unnerving and felt like things were about to take a very disturbing turn. The great comedic writing is balanced by a soft sadness, and nothing is wrapped up too neatly. Highly recommended for an alternative holiday flick, or just anytime really.
By the way, similarities to Christmas in Connecticut are:

-Barbara Stanwyck lies a lot
-Rural holiday happiness

"An absolutely adorable Christmas romance movie oh gosh I felt myself melting away at so many points it really doesn't get better than this...This movie had some of the best use of lighting and blocking for a 1940s film I think, especially for a romance movie. You could sense the coldness and hostility from Stanwyck's character's childhood home from how dark it is and the constant shadows used in many scenes at her home (her stepfather's just standing in the hallway with the light shining from behind him so its just a silhouette, her mom at the door after they left and peeking to check if they have left and her shadow slowly moving away from the door being turning off the house lights) like these are just details I appreciate so much!! It didn't necessarily drive the plot any further but it added to the atmosphere and I just really liked that.
A beauuuuutiful movie with a lot of heartwarming dialogue <3 I love the contrast between the Stanwyck's mother and McMurray's mother where one showed distrust and disgust towards her child while one showed love and kindness and even extended it to another person who has committed wrongdoings, with her child turning out to be a successful person in life. Its a bit cliche but love really does go a long way. And you could see that in Stanwyck's character arc too where she realizes she has to pay for her wrongdoings and coming out 'square' and clean so she gets a new chance at life, perhaps with her love of her life too.
Again, TOO CUTE I love this, I love when the situation automatically puts two characters in conflict but they try to work around it so they can end up together. Only request is I wished they ended it with a time skip and an even happier ending (because honestly this is quite an open ending) with her coming out of jail and him waiting for her with a ring. Sounds unrealistic because he could well change his mind during her prison time but hey, that's what movies are for.",4.5

"What a great match of Preston Sturges and Mitchell Leisen. A sharp wit and a tender heart. Here's a premise that made me shelf this movie time and time again, but decided, finally, to give it a shot. Surprisingly, the premise works out pretty plausibly and then, once they've got you, the rest follows into a wonderfully melodramatic climax. Great cinematography from Tetzlaff as well. I don't know that either MacMurray or Stanwyck have been better. Sure, they've had juicier material, but their subtlety and detail hasn't had as nice an exercise as this. Just lovely as hell.",4.0
"Stiff, weird script with a lot of awkward tonal shifts. Impressive for a movie to have made-for-TV vibes over a decade before that was even a thing. Rufus is unfortunately written and directed very racistly. How the “backwoods” Hoosiers are portrayed also leans heavily into stereotype in a way that feels out-of-touch with reality. Preston Sturges was painting with a broad brush for this one, I’m afraid. I’m a sucker for a Stanwyck-MacMurray teamup but this ain’t it.",2.5

"“A fine District Attorney you are.”
This is the kind of film I love to stumble across: something pretty great that people don’t really talk about. It’s all well and good to see great films that everyone says are great, but there’s something special about watching ‘just a film’ only to discover it’s secretly excellent.
The key to this one is all in the balance. It’s nicely Christmassy/seasonal (the story stretches from early December to early January) without being saccharine. There’s both comedy and drama, without the former being too silly to undercut the latter, nor the latter too heavy to undercut the former. Barbara Stanwyck is typically fantastic as a woman who is simultaneously a sassy cocksure criminal and a damaged little girl struggling to forget her history. Fred MacMurray’s role is somewhat less nuanced (though this theme of conflicting duality ultimately extends to him too), but makes a strong romantic foil nonetheless; and there’s a nice supporting part for Beulah Bondi as his understanding mother — who, again, is capable of seeing both sides of the situation.
If I had such a thing as “staple Christmas viewing”, this would definitely become one.",4.0

"Mitchell Leisen’s Christmas-time tale features s brilliant screenplay by Preston Sturges and letter-perfect performances by Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, threading the needle between light cynicism and well-earned sentiment. Sturges’ celebration of country values is sincere and heartfelt, as is his affection for the supporting cast.
This is the first of four screen pairings of Stanwyck and MacMurray. Four years later the couple would make an even bigger impression as very different characters in Billy Wilder’s classic film noir ""Double Indemnity."" This is Stanwyck’s film all the way; her character goes through most of the emotional changes. She handles Sturges’s mildly risqué dialogue with high style.
Sturges and Leisen would appear to be the perfect writer-director team. Their previous collaboration was the charming Depression fantasy ""Easy Living."" During production Sturges reportedly criticized Leisen’s softening of MacMurray’s character, who as written was more of a self-involved egoist. Leisen responded that the change was necessary to fit MacMurray’s personality. MacMurray certainly seems slick enough in his early scenes; perhaps he couldn’t play cynical and sincere. This conflict caused Sturges to become a director in order to protect his material.",4.0

"A holiday film starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, this felt like it was laying the groundwork for Double Indemnity (1944) as it is a great display of the chemistry these two shared on screen. This entire film felt like a weird inverse of Christmas in Connecticut (1945) and the two would make a great double feature. I liked all the driving scenes, especially when they started to get lost, it was an interesting glimpse into how long-distance road trips probably would have gone back in the 1940s, and even though this wasn't a horror film I found it a bit atmospheric, especially with it being dark and they're being some snow on the ground. This is also where they get led into some slapstick later. I like how cozy the farmhouse is and it was an interesting look into a different time and different traditions, as it seems like this community had something going on every day between Christmas and New Year's.

I couldn't get past the fact that he was the prosecutor in her case and none of this movie would be allowed to happen?

Still, in spite of all detours, when she's staring at him with tears in her eyes in the courtroom at the end and he disregards all of the rules of the farcical game at which he is so expert, Remember the Night comes home strong.

"I have decided, now that I'm pushing 60, that I could watch Barbara Stanwyck rip toilet paper. She sparkles as a jewel thief (see what I did there?) who is caught in the act of selling the gem she just stole at a pawn shop. It's a silly way to get caught, but it's the plot conceit in order to get her into the courtroom where she meet-cutes Fred MacMurray, the soft hearted prosecuter whose job is to put her behind bars.
In order to enjoy this movie you need to get past the casual racist treatment of MacMurray's butler, Rufus, played by Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones. The ""Yassah"" and ""Nosah"" was a bit hard to watch. I've quit movies for less than that but we decided to soldier on.
I'm glad we did. The film is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny in several places and it holds up very well. It is a romantic comedy Christmas movie to be sure, but it highlights the importance of love and family without getting corny or preachy about it. Sterling Holloway (who would later become a famous animated voice actor) steals every scene he is in playing a lovable country-bumpkin farmhand.
The film isn't perfect. I mentioned the casual racism, the plot seems forced at times, and the ending is abrupt. But Stanwyck and MacMurray are fantastic together and is a preview to their partnership in the masterpiece ""Double Indemnity.""",3.5

Remember the Night's Christmas in Ohio is an interesting mirror to Christmas in Connecticut. Barbara Stanwyck plays a different sort of small-time professional swindler in each, and in both she wears a fur coat with enormous shoulder pads, pats a cow, and falls for a piano-playing family man. In Connecticut she's the one providing a warm country Christmas for a soldier without a family to go home to, but Christmas is almost incidental to the story. Here she's the one welcomed into a family Christmas when by a softhearted district attorney who springs her bail and invites her home with him when when it turns out the family she ran away from when she was a kid wasn't interested in seeing her.
I don't know how this isn't a Christmas classic along with It's a Wonderful Life. Well, probably I do know how. Maybe most damningly, it introduces its leading man with a racist caricature of a valet. But also its winter wonderland trappings aren't quite so snowy and festively decorated. Its party scenes aren't quite so boisterous, even if folks kissing in the rafters of a barn dance has its charms, too. Its families aren't nearly so nuclear, and there aren't any children in it. It doesn't have decades of syndication propping up its nostalgia factor. 
No one's an angel. But it sure is sweet.

Watched this sitting between my parents with tears in my eyes, trying not to cry, but not able to stifle a sniffle. The shift in tones from humor to drama to romance are excellent and there’s a heart wrenching scene that’s shot in deep shadow that is ominous and wicked, and the juxtaposition of this with the following scenes create a basis for drama, romance, and a feeling of connection and belonging.

"What is beautiful about this film and about Barbara Stanwyck’s portrayal of Lee is that her “flaws” are not inert characteristics used to give texture to a person but actual narrative obstacles, that the world changes her rather than bending to force of her personality. She gives up easy happiness because it might come too close to pity, accepts punishment not because her lover requires it of her (just the opposite, he takes her as she is) but because she knows she must appear to herself as she does in the eye of her beloved. Love is something that is deserved and we should want to be good enough to deserve it.",0.0

"My favorite thing about it is the sympathetic way it views someone charged with a crime, and how silly the justice system can be in how it tries to put people away. My least favorite thing is how it treats its sole black character- little respect by the script or the characters. If it reserved just a little bit extra humanity, maybe it could have avoided a particularly embarrassing bit of racist caricature and aged better on that front.
But, the former is so compelling. The delicate way it draws who these two are and why they might end up together is so complex and messy, and you’ll wanna know when and if it’s going to go off the rails.
There’s an early moment in this that modern screenwriters should study as a way to handle gender dynamics in an age of changing standards (for teh better). She suspects him of using his money and power over him - he recognizes it’s there, but assures her he has no intention of exercising it by continually encouraging her to go do her own thing. After all, he didn’t even invite her over. It’s a fun/funny/sweet scene that has some code-skirting language around sex exploitation.",4.5
"Well, this just charmed the pants off of me. Sentimental, but with just enough bite (thanks Preston Sturgess) to keep it from being maudlin. Has every right to be a Christmas tradition as It’s A Wonderful Life does and probably would be if it wrapped up everything in a nice little bow at the end instead of leaving the audience on a slight note of ambiguity.
Consider me a Stanwyck stan from here on out. She’s a beacon of light every time she’s on screen.
Oh and a special shout out to Disney regular Sterling Holloway for his turn as Willie. It’s a small role but his rendition of “The End of A Perfect Day” acts as the film’s emotional apex — thanks largely to his performance and Stanwyck’s silent reaction — and it’ll be the moment I think about any time I think back on this movie.",4.0
"Very enjoyable almost rom com that set the template for every Hallmark movie you've ever seen. Charmingly opposed couple leaves the big city for the quaint hometown and discovers, family, love, and the true meaning of Christmas. What elevates it is in the writing - a funny script that's never screwball but nevertheless has an extended bit about milking a cow - and performances, with Stanwyck in particular getting across the wounded little bird vibe of her character in a way that's wholly natural and not the least but condescending. It helps to that we see her go through some genuinely painful conversations throughout. Her rejection from home had me legitimately affected, complimented by the stunning shot of her mother leaving her cold and dark on the porch, making the conscious choice to turn the lights off. Further, MacMurray's mother's gentle - but still cutting - refusal to bless rhe couple is pitch perfect. Lee deserves love just like anyone else, but it just shouldn't be with her son. It's a minor hypocrisy, and thus believable.
There's also an understated quality to the romance that works in the same way. Stanwyck and MacMurray just slowly grow on you with gestures and a general affability, there's nothing forced here. It earns its ultimate declaration of love scene, shot in gorgeous silhouette in front of an impossibly bright Niagara Falls. It's their honeymoon, a night they won't forget. I would have honestly been fine with a hard cut to ending there, but the film does enough with its last minutes despite the obvious presence of the Hays Code in the room. In particular, Stanywck's wordless realization that MacMurray really *will* throw the case for her, really *does* love her despite all he's worked for professionally, is just so golly sweet. I suppose it's fitting that she feels the need to make a gesture in return.",4.0

1940 erschienen, aber selbst nach über 80(!) Jahren immer noch hervorragend! 
Die psychologische Zeichnung der Figuren -wenn auch teils oberflächlich- gelingt sehr gut und bettet sich perfekt ein in die dichte Atmosphäre, die den Film seine Laufzeit über begleitet. Während der Film sich keinem Genre klar zu ordnen lässt, und immer wieder zwischen komödiantischen, ernsten und sentimental melancholischen Szenen hin und her wechselt, versteht er es doch, ein Ganzes zu sein, was vor allem durch die sehr gut geschrieben Dialoge und guten schauspielerischen Leistungen der Darstellern gelingt, die ihren Figuren eine angemessene Tiefe einhauchen. Ohne Vorwissen über den Plot ist „Remember the Night“ noch dazu echt fesselnd und unterhaltsam. Zwar hat er seine Längen, doch die stoßen nicht als negativer Aspekt auf, da der Film immer wieder an Schwung gewinnt und neue Elemente aufweist die bezaubern. Gerade das Finale hat mich nochmal sehr überrascht und die für mich aufgebaute innere Logik und gewollte Authentizität des Films untermauert. 
Augenblicke, wie das Close-Up am Neujahres Fest sind einfach toll - genauso, wie das aufmerksame Einfangen der ein oder anderen aussagekräftigen Gefühlsregung der Figuren; diese wirklich überzeugende und gelungene Kameraarbeit unterstützt das clevere Drehbuch hervorragend. Die Qualität der Dialoge muss hier nochmal als echt inspirierend gut, vorgehoben werden. Und ja, die Message mit der Liebe stimmt auch. Abgesehen von rassistischen Untertönen am Anfang des Films, ist das ganze wirklich ein hammer Weihnachtsklassiker.

Released in 1940, but still excellent even after more than 80 years!
The psychological portrayal of the characters - albeit superficial at times - works very well and is perfectly embedded in the dense atmosphere that accompanies the film throughout its running time. While the film cannot be clearly assigned to any genre and constantly switches back and forth between comedic, serious and sentimentally melancholy scenes, it still manages to be a whole, which is achieved above all through the very well-written dialog and good acting performances of the actors, who breathe an appropriate depth into their characters. Without any prior knowledge of the plot, ""Remember the Night"" is also really captivating and entertaining. Although it does have its lengths, these don't come across as a negative aspect, as the movie keeps gaining momentum and has new elements that are enchanting. The finale in particular surprised me once again and underpinned the inner logic and intended authenticity of the movie.
Moments like the close-up at the New Year's party are simply great - as is the attentive capturing of one or two of the characters' expressive emotions; this really convincing and successful camera work supports the clever script perfectly. The quality of the dialog must once again be praised as truly inspiringly good. And yes, the message of love is also right. Apart from the racist undertones at the beginning of the movie, the whole thing really is a great Christmas classic.",4.0

An achingly good film which at the moment is only my third highest-ranked film of 1940 behind The Shop Around the Corner and His Girl Friday. What a year for movies. These three 1940 films make up 16% of my 25 favourite movies ever.
This movie just makes me want to watch more of it, like a more that doesn't exist within the film but exists out there in possibility or imagination. It's hard to put it down and look elsewhere.
I also can't help but watch it without thinking a lot about Fred Toones who is credited by his ""stage"" name ""Snowflake"" in this film. He played over 200 roles in Hollywood movies, only 73 of which are credited. He played a railroad porter at least 50 times. He had to play a dumbed down, emasculated, subservient character for his entire acting career and he died much too young at 56. It's a monumental injustice to think of someone's entire artistic life completely penned in by racism. And the monumental injustices of this type feel almost infinite, even when we only look at the last 300 years of North American history. Fred Toones deserved much, much, much better in life. And I will always feel sad watching him answer the door, make drinks, answer the phone and duck his head to and for Fred MacMurray early in the film.",5.0

"While it's odd at first seeing Stanwyck and McMurray in a romantic comedy drama rather than the Noir of their most famous pairing in Double Indemnity, their chemistry together is easy to see in this. It's a sweet film, lightly romantic but with an edge to it over the emotions that Christmas and family can bring up, comparing the two families and their reactions to their children. It's well shot and has a terrific script from Preston Sturges, his last as just a writer before taking on his own short lived but impressive career as a writer/director. Stanwyck is such a charming screen presence, not typically beautiful but always very sexy and undated in her naturalistic performances, I really need to see more of her films.",4.0

Lee, having no place to go for Christmas, ends up at Jack's apartment, and he ends up taking her along with him to his family's Indiana home after discovering she grew up nearby.
So many overly saccharin, schmaltzy Christmas movies were made during this period, but this movie perfectly threads the needle. All the characters have so much agency and purpose. The scene of the family around the piano is quite exquisitely done.
Thematically, the movie uses the setting of Jack's childhood home to lightly (maybe too lightly) tip-toe into a discussion of fate and criminality, questioning the effects a loving home has on a child.",3.0

"I think the combo of Stanwyck/Macmurray/Sturges made me think this would be something darker or wackier. The initial premise feels like a fun, eat the rich, slightly amoral screwball comedy- something like director Mitchell Leisen's other movie ""Easy Living"" (which I much prefer): Stanwyck is a feisty, repeat offender jewelry shoplifter, Macmurray is the prosecuting attorney who pities her and pays for her bail so she doesn't have to spend Christmas in jail. A kinda fun roadtrip ensues, and then the melodrama sets in. And it is laid on thick. Stanwyck visits her estranged mother who is a Hoosier Demon that ruined her life and set her on the path of being a career criminal through sheer midwest emotional withholding and cruelty. Macmurray's family that they then stay with over Christmas is the polar opposite, and there's some teary eyed intense down home yuletide sentimentality for the rest of the movie. Its good if you want to get a bit emo around Christmas, but it's certainly not funny nor wickedly fun. Its saving grace is the empathy it has for criminals.",3.0

While a Sturges-directed version of this would probably be funnier (or at least have better comic timing from the supporting cast), Leisen makes the critically important decision to center the film on Stanwyck's character (a choice I understand Sturges opposed) - and the ending's very poignant as a result.

El resultado es una comedia amable dirigida por Mitchell Leisen (que venía de dirigir una obra maestra: ""Medianoche"", que contaba de guionistas nada más y nada menos que con Charles Brackett y Billy Wilder). En esta ""Recuerdo de una noche"" el guion sería de Preston Sturges. Y la cosa no salió bien del todo. O sí, según se mire.
No salió bien porque hay escenas que lo mismo resultaban graciosas en la época, pero que han envejecido fatal (la intervención del abogado defensor, el personaje del mayordomo de MacMurray, etc.). Y porque juega a muchos palos, algo poco recomendable. Parece que va a tirar por un enfoque a lo ""La fiera de mi niña"" y luego gira a ""¡Qué bello es vivir!"" o similar, en una historia de carretera con final desconcertante, llevando el nuevo código moral a las últimas consecuencias.
Salió bien porque Sturges decidió que nadie más estrope... estoooo... dirigiría un guion suyo. Ahí salimos ganando por muchas razones. En primer lugar porque Sturges se descolgó dirigiendo ""Los viajes de Sullivan"" y ""Las tres noches de Eva"", así, para empezar. Y en segundo lugar porque Billy Wilder le tomó la matrícula a la decisión de Sturges y, tras la mencionada ""Medianoche"", ""Adelante, mi amor"" y ""Si no amaneciera"", mandó a esparragar a todo el que quisiese llevar a la pantalla uno de sus guiones. A partir de entonces sólo lo haría él.
Wilder a su vez tomó buena nota de la química en pantalla de Stanwyck y MacMurray. Vaya si la tomó. Eso sí, le dio un girito de nada tanto al tipo de relación que plasmarían en el celuloide, como a la manera que tendría MacMurray de encender las cerillas.",3.0
"Remember the Night's story is the most dramatic and grounded I've seen Preston Sturges going. Yet, his ability to infuse a dreamlike quality into even the most realistic scenarios remains intact. The film expertly balances the line between realism and absurdity, serving as a testament to Sturges' 'fairytelling' prowess. You can seamlessly immerse yourself in the narrative without a trace of doubt. Barbara Stanwyck's presence, a strong contender for the title of Hollywood's greatest actress, further enhances the film. Her mastery of the art of make-believe, as seen in other classics like Ball of Fire and The Lady Eve, is clearly evident. Fred MacMurray once again proves to be a quietly great comedic actor, and Beulah Bondi to be one of the greatest maternal figures in cinema.
Might write more about Leisen's skills as a screwball comedy director once I get to Take a Letter, Darling, or Arise, My Love. But for now, I remain thoroughly impressed. 75/100",4.0
"Thinking that he was doing a shoplifter a favour by asking her trial to be postponed until after Christmas, an ambitious lawyer becomes guilt-ridden upon discovering that she was homeless and was hoping for a warm jail cell with a meal in this offbeat romantic drama. Both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray do well in the lead roles, with the film teaming them up a few years before Double Indemnity would enshrine them as cinema legends. Stanwyck's casualness towards stealing - while nonchalantly setting bins alight to get out of sticky situations - renders her a very interesting character, and while it is predictable that MacMurray will eventually develop feelings towards her, he puts up an initial wall of resistance very well. The pair also share some great adventures while on the road together, spending an indeed memorable night (and morning). The second half of the film becomes a bit pat once they get off the road and meet MacMurray's relatives, but this remains engaging while it lasts.",3.5

"I was pleasantly surprised to start this movie and find out that Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray got to appear together in a movie where Stanwyck wasn't just playing him (hello, ""Double Indemnity""!) Then I later learned they're in two other movies together, which I'm going to have to watch now, because these two have *chemistry.*
This is billed as a Christmas movie, but it's not terribly Christmas-y. It does have a New Year's scene which is great. It also has George Bailey's mom from ""It's a Wonderful Life"", playing McMurray's mom here, which is sort of surreal.
This movie is less about Christmas songs, decorations, etc. and more about Christmas spirit and charity, in that McMurray's prosecutor character feels sorry for Stanwyck's thief character who has no place to go at Christmas, so he takes her home. In the process she sees what it is to have a family, and falls for the upstanding McMurray. Of course then they must both choose what to do when it comes to moral duty vs. their burgeoning love for each other.
This movie would be much better if it didn't force a black actor to play a stereotyped ""dumb"" servant character. That was just a big jolt of racism in the middle of this otherwise heartwarming, romantic film. It's bizarre to imagine that people ever found that sort of thing funny.
It retains its many stars, though, for Stanwyck and McMurray's combined star power and sex appeal. Man. I wish they'd made like 5 more rom coms without racial stereotypes. As it is I look forward to eventually watching their melodrama and their Western!",4.0

"Preston Sturges, who hated the directors script alterations, said the film “had quite a lot of schmaltz [sentiment], a good dose of schmerz [pain, grief] and just enough schmutz [dirt] to make it box office.” He also hated that Mitchell Leison put more focus on Barbara Stanwyck than his script did, and was so annoyed he decided to direct his own scripts from then on.

"HERE COMES THE NIGHT AGAIN
- BLU-RAY -
The early going with more traditional screwball fare felt a little rough, like a lesser version of a dozen stronger screwball comedies. But things gradually become more deeply felt, less overtly comedic, and the film considerably improves. Stanwyck is dynamite throughout though, expertly navigating the narrative and tonal turns and bringing incredible depth and ferocity to her character. The ending feels a little rushed and sudden, and not final enough, even for this period of Hollywood’s glory days. Mostly very watchable though, if not up to some of the era’s standout comedies.",3.5

"I liked the simplicity of the movie. Barbara Stanwyck is one of the greatest Actors of her time. 
I have always enjoyed Fred MacMurray, I missed him when he stopped acting to do more directing. I would have never thought to place these two together in a love story. But, wow, I so enjoyed watching their love unfold. To see how much they loved one another, to do what was best for the other. Even when they didn’t want or ask for each others help. It’s a true love story and what a fantastic job they both played in this film. I loved it. The only thing I wish had happened was they had gotten married in Niagara Falls before returning to court, secretly, of course. Wonder how this story would have ended had they done that.
It’s a wonderful story to watch anytime, but especially at Christmas.
 I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",4.5
"What can I say? I'm all for a big cornball of a movie. And this one, with yet another powerhouse performance by one Barbara Stanwick, well supported by all other great actors in it, gets me more than almost all the Corballis I've ever watched.",4.5
"Four years before Stanwyck and MacMurray conspired in one of my favorite films Double Indemnity, they teamed up in this holiday romantic comedy for a much lighter dynamic. Well, halfway. Stanwyck is game for adjustment but MacMurray seems strangely close to the coldness of Walter Neff despite Stanwyck repeatedly saying what a good man he is. I wonder if getting introduced to him in My Three Sons reruns and Shaggy Dog movies gave me more of an impression of him playing against type in Indemnity and The Apartment than he really was.
MacMurray is Jack Sargent, a New York City assistant DA (no relation to the Shaggy one to my knowledge) who finagles a delay in the trial of a petty thief named Lee (Stanwyck). It's hard to get a jury to lock up a woman at Christmastime, you see, so by getting a recess until past the holiday season, Jack stands a better chance of landing (the absolutely guilty) Lee in the clink. But when he overhears that she can't make bail he secretly arranges for the bondsman to let her out for Christmas. The bondsman, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, misunderstands the arrangement and sends Lee to Jack's apartment.
This is already a highly suspect situation of ethics and Jack does everything he can to keep Lee at arms length, shy of doing anything whatsoever. He takes her to dinner and dancing (she's broke and he deprived her of a free turkey dinner in jail, after all) and later they roadtrip together to visit their families for the holidays. It's not love at first sight but it's not hard to see where this is going. The roadtrip angle is drafting off It Happened One Night, though it never matches that movie's energy mostly, it pains me to say, because MacMurray is so strangely committed to being a wet blanket. Even Stanwyck's purposefully-and-beyond stick-in-the-mud partner Gary Cooper in next year's Ball of Fire was better at harnessing comic energy.
But the movie's strengths don't rely on the comedy, but the Movie Gifts theme - family. First they stop by Stanwyck's mother's house to find the cruel old crone has remarried and has nothing remotely kind to say about her daughter. The Preston Sturges script has had crackling moments, but it's neve more effective than Jack reading the homelife Lee has escaped and calmly telling off her horrible mother ""We'll be leaving now, Mrs..."" ""My name doesn't concern you."" ""You've got that right.""
This sets up a contrast with Jack's family, a warm and caring couple of aunts (old pros Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson) and his dimwitted brother (Sterling Halloway playing slightly more cartoonish than most of his famous animated voice roles). They naturally assume that a lady travelling with Jack must be a soon-to-be-wife and welcome her into the family. This is my favorite section, with the aunts bickering and baking and everybody attending a New Year's Eve dance. This is the kind of movie my grandparents would have grown up with, and I can feel the influence of the era (if not this movie specifically) on their lives and homes.
The shenanigans along the way are also a point of amusement about the past that has long fascinated me, mainly how law and accurate record-keeping were enforced in days when licenses were scraps of paper and any central databases covered only small sections of the country. The answer is as I suspected, that people lied their asses of all the time to avoid punishment. Here Jack and Lee lie (and set fire to) a local police precinct, then lie their way through the Canadian border on the way back. Happy New Year! The Social Contract goes the way of auld lang syne.
The movie is bookended by courtroom scenes - a dangerous move in my book - but the first is played for comedy and the last is effective, thanks again to the Sturges touch, as we and characters realize Jack's strategy for getting Stanwyck off the hook without being (more) obvious about demolishing the prosecution's handling of the case. The ending, however, is not quite as expected as the journey would make it seem. Hard to get Double Indemnity out of the head, though this is of course far less extreme.",3.0

The best of the Stanwyck-MacMurray films, and I love Double Indemnity as much as anyone. Irresistible, in part because it’s such a pointed indictment. Leisen’s changes to Sturges’ script as documented on Wikipedia strike me as unambiguously for the better - and the slightly expressive visual touches are the sort of thing Sturges was not quite as interested in when he turned to directing. In every dream home, a heartache. Not quite the best Christmas movie, but in the running.

"The more Mitchell Leisen films I see the more I discover what a great filmmaker he was, with NO MAN OF HER OWN a particular favorite of mine. REMEMBER THE NIGHT brings MacMurray and Stanwyck together before DOUBLE INDEMNITY and the chemistry is undeniable. Leisen capitalizes on Sturges’ script inherent sentimentality and it works, delivering a surprisingly strong ending. Watch for the actor Snowflake, who made a career out of playing the same character in numerous films in the ‘40’s. It would be interesting to see a documentary about his career and the trials and tribulations he faced in performing, repeatedly, such derogatory characters.",4.0
"Remember the Night is pretty good as a lighthearted romantic comedy and pretty good as an emotional Christmas movie but a little clunky when these two things try to mix. It's a nice set-up that puts Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray on opposite ends of a court case before throwing them together in classic rom-com tradition. It is a fun road trip movie for a bit before settling into a Christmas drama as you learn more about her backstory. This part is nice but the film really shines when you get into the third act and the characters lay everything out on the table. There is a beautifully shot scene that is back-lit by the Niagara Falls that sweeps you away in the romance. Then, the courtroom finale has some fantastic payoff when you realize just what's going on. It's just a shame that what should be a feel-good ending is undercut by a moralistic ending that screams of studio interference.

Yes, once again (or rather, once before), Stany is forced to spend Christmas on a farm in the sticks—though it's all a little less screwball this time. In this ""pre-war"" (I mean some countries I could mention were already at war but that's none of my business) melodrama-tinged romcom (heavier on the rom than the com), it's less about whether the career gal will finally settle down (a theme I've noticed in the post-war Christmas films I've been watching lately) and more about whether the shoplifter will finally be sent down. Yes, Stany's a real crook this time, not just a phony, and ol' lantern-jaw himself, Fred MacMurray, is the prosecutor who sees to it that her case is postponed until after Christmas—which means she'll be spending the holiday in jail! Fred feels bad, buys her dinner, finds out she's a hoosier like him and offers to give her a lift to her mother's old place on his way back to visit the family… but will their plans change and she'll come home with him instead and they'll fall in love and she'll learn a valuable lesson? I'll never tell! 😉
I have to say that at first I really didn't think I was going to like this. There's an interminable courtroom scene early on, with the long-winded defence lawyer spinning a yarn about how Stany was hypnotised, which it seems the jury is going to swallow hook, line and sinker. This doesn't seem to be a film which has a lot of respect for either jurors or defence lawyers. Then there's the offensive portrayal of MacMurray's Black servant (Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones) as dim-witted (""but a great cook!"", says MacMurray). In Christmas in Connecticut there's a brief scene of a Black waiter explaining the etymology of the word 'catastrophe' to Uncle Felix; it's fairly patronising, with the humour obviously meant to derive from the supposed incongruity of a Black person being more knowledgeable than a white person (and some additional fun being had at the expense of someone whose first language isn't English), but give me that over this any day.
It does get much better once it leaves the city, though, between the blossoming romance between the leads, the affecting cruelty of Stany's mother, and the warmth and kindness of MacMurray's family (his mother is Ma Bailey!). The ending is perhaps a little unsatisfying due to the constrictions of the Hays Code, which demand that Stany be punished for her crimes, but it's almost more subversive that way—is any audience really going to be rooting for her to go to prison? It's almost like the film observes the letter of the Code while sneaking in some anti-carceral messaging in spirit.
This has a sprinkle of It Happened One Night, and also shares elements with a couple of films that came out the year before: your actual Aunty Em on a farm from Wizard of Oz, and a scene where a woman holds on to a bedpost while another woman tightens her corset out of Gone With the Wind, with which it also seems to share some of its racial politics. Possibly it's all coincidental, and Wizard still hadn't broken even at this point so maybe nobody was consciously emulating it, but you have to wonder.
Stany met screenwriter Preston Sturges on this picture, who would go on to write The Lady Eve for her, possibly her finest moment. Still, I don't know if I've ever seen Stany look more luminous than she does here, her initial toughness quickly giving way to vulnerability.
I first heard about this film on the same Secrets of Cinema episode where I got freaked out by a 44-year-old Celia Johnson being told she was 31 (see The Holly & the Ivy); for a while afterwards I kept thinking ""I must see that Barbara Stanwyck Christmas movie"", and of course THEE Barbara Stanwyck Christmas movie is Christmas in Connecticut, so for a long time I thought that was the one I wanted to watch. This may not have anything like that film's reputation, but to me it's ultimately the more successful of the two, despite a rough start.",0.0

"What a sweet gem of a movie for Christmas!
Lee Leland (Barbara Stanwyck), who has had a rough life, is caught shoplifting right before Christmas. John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), the prosecuting attorney, arranges for her bail, and eventually ends up taking Lee home to spend Christmas with his family. As Lee spends time with John's mother, aunt, and cousin Willie, she is exposed to an unconditional love she has never experienced, and it changes the course of her life, and John's, in an unexpected way.
Though this movie was hard to find (finally recorded it from TMC), I really loved it, especially the messages of kindness, unconditional love, and acceptance. Barbara Stanwyck is such a natural actress. I was mesmerized with how a simple gesture, voice inflection, look... captures my attention and heart. This movie is really hers.
I must express a discomfort on the interplay that goes on between John and his butler, Rufus. Though minor in screen time, it is something that will jump out at our 2022 mindsets. I had to keep reminding myself that this movie is 82 years old. A lot has changed since 1940! Thank God! Is that reason enough not to watch or like this movie? I think that's something each person needs to work through. For me, the overall message that the majority of the movie conveys outweighs the brief discomfort felt when Rufus is on screen.
The only other component I had trouble with is the ending. Things are going and then BAM! the credits are running. Definitely a let down.",4.0

"This is the third Christmas season where I’ve watched this film. It’s so totally perfect. The level of detail in the sets and in every character is of such a high caliber I doubt I’ll ever tire of it. There are many cut-aways to an aunt fantasizing about being young enough to wear lingerie or exchanging a knowing glance. Every character, no matter the size, is specific and gets to have a bit of extra behavior. I don’t know much about director Mitchell Leisen, but the amount of care he puts into each element of this film is something worth studying. At the heart of the film is Barbara Stanwyck playing—I think—her most vulnerable role. We care about her so much because Preston Sturges wrote her to be an unapologetic criminal whose history of rejection and mistreatment gets incrementally revealed, allowing us to worry about her future. We then get to see her seeing MacMurray’s loving, kind family, knowing that it can never be hers, that her destiny is prison, that she has no one to turn to in the world. It’s beyond heartbreaking and it’s a masterclass in engendering--and motivating--viewer empathy for one’s hero/heroine. And of course Stanwyck meets every moment with her superlative acting ability. Everyone should watch this movie. It’s a tearjerker but it’s not at all manipulative. It’s executed flawlessly, aside from a few moments that have aged badly regarding race. Most remarkably, it ends on a hopeful note that doesn't feel even slightly forced or saccharine.",5.0

Chemistry between actors is something I love observing and Stanwyck and MacMurray have it in spades. No wonder they would get paired up together three more times, so much so that it's hard to believe this was their first film together. Her performance is great, really one of her best of the 40+ movies of hers I've seen, and fits right in to the tough exterior with sentimental side that she could play so well.

The latter gives an excellent, subtle performance in the film's key emotional scenes: a fraught reunion with her mother, and a bittersweet Christmas morning that serves to remind her of her lack of a supportive family. Hilarious setpieces throughout Remember the Night are tempered by an unfortunate racist portrayal of the movie's only Black character whose actor is only credited as ""Snowflake.""",3.5

Although it is set at Christmas it is a Romance through and through but it is well made. Beulah Bondi (Make Way for Tomorrow 1937) was a sensational character and really elevated other performers.

"I think Fred MacMurray plays characters that i really like, and here is no exception since he is very responsible, respectful, and willing to do the right thing, but he is also fun, romantic, kind. He is an assistant district attorney. Both Barbara Stanwyck and him are great together. They show once again that they have phenomenal chemistry, they showed it in the psychological suspense movies and right here in the romantic comedy they radiate sympathy, tenderness, splendor.The romance is very well developed, because both characters get to know each other in a reasonable period of time, specifically the christmas season which makes it more beautiful. They have many scenes just them, which allowed the romance that was being created to be conveyed in a better way. What i like about this film is that the romance is not instantaneous or superficial, like other romantic comedies, that is thanks to how the story developed and also thanks to the power and talent of both actors, they are great together. I loved when Jack takes Lee to spend christmas with his family, since she had nowhere to go. His family made her feel so happy and lucky that without a doubt she would remember as a special and unforgettable moment. The end was just as i anticipated. I would have liked it to end differently, but it wasnt a bad ending either.",4.0
I’m sad the world only got two Christmas movies where Barbara Stanwyck is surprised by a cow.,3.0
"“One of these days, one of you boys is going to start one of these things differently, and one of us girls is going to drop dead from surprise.”
Like my favourite Christmas movie, Carol, Preston Sturgess’ screenplay finds Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray (in their first of four on-screen pairings) falling in love while on a road trip to the Midwest at Christmastime. (Both films also happen to feature a performance of “Easy Living”.)
Overall, the blend of romance, comedy, and melodrama yields a quite charming picture aided a great deal by Stanwyck being darn near perfect, as usual. She and McMurray have great chemistry, of course, as do she and a cow who pokes her head through the car window (“Does she like to have her ears tickled?”)
I don’t know if the film’s conclusion was as originally intended or necessary to satisfy the Hays Code. I get that it’s a moral switcheroo, and normally I don’t mind a less-than-happy ending, but this one does seem to run a bit contrary to what the film has been saying up to that point about the circumstances that can lead a desperate person to commit a crime.
Unfortunately, there is some racism of a type common for the time that comes at the expense of Fred “Snowflake” Toones butler/servant character.",3.5

"I’ve thought about this movie so much since I first watched it and couldn’t wait til Christmas to watch it again. It may not be one of the best movies of the 40s but it’s gotta be one of the nicest. So sympathetic, so touching, so wholesome, and so romantic.",4.5
"Directed by Michael Leisen, Remember the Night brings together Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in an offbeat love story written by Preston Sturges. This was Sturges’ last film as a screenwriter only—afterwards he was one of Hollywood’s first writer/directors, and the first who started out as a screenwriter.
It’s a screwball comedy, the genre that Sturges was a master of. Lee (Stanwyck) gets caught stealing a bracelet, and Jack Sergeant (MacMurray) is the New York DA assigned to prosecute her just before Christmas. Jack finds out she is upset about being in jail over Christmas and helps to arrange for her bail, then says he will drop her off at her mother’s house en route to visiting his own family. After that, hijinks ensue and of course they end up together.
It’s a pretty decent film, and of course the leads have plenty of chemistry. It was the first of several films they would make together. It’s a good script, although Leisen chopped up quite a bit of what Sturges delivered (that was one of the catalysts for Sturges to move into directing his own work—and also gave him a chance to offer Stanwyck the lead in The Lady Eve, which established all the modern romantic-comedy tropes). They still remained friendly, and in fact Sturges was on set during much of the filmmaking, which is rare even now. It’s an amusing film that’s a good substitute for It’s A Wonderful Life, if you don’t want to do that again over the holidays. It’s pacy at 90 minutes, and while not quite the bona fide classic that some people have tried to make it out as, Remember the Night is a fun watch.
Remember the Night proved that Stanwyck could do comedy—before, she was primarily known as a dramatic actress playing fallen women or femme fatale types—which opened up new career possibilities for her.
It’s a well-made film, handsomely shot by Ted Tetzlaff, Tetzlaff worked extensively with George Stevens later on, and also shot I Married A Witch, amongst many others (his last film as a cinematographer was Alfred Hitchcock’s screwball-ish Notorious). A few years later Tetzlaff directed one of the great underrated films noir, The Window.
Its great to Stanwyck and MacMurray in their first film together, a pairing that later continued in Double Indemnity, Douglas Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow, and a 3D Western, The Moonlighter.

"Total nicecore, which my milage can vary on, but boy Stanwyck is otherworldly. Could see this becoming a Christmas staple.",4.0
"A classic and yet one most people have never even heard of, ""Remember the Night"" was a Mitchell Leisen movie with an original screenplay by Preston Sturges and stared Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, (before they got all hot and bothered in ""Double Indemnity""), so what more proof do you need that it's a classic and a very funny one, too.
Stanwyck is the jewel thief and MacMurray the District Attorney determined to put her in jail for stealing a diamond bracelet over Christmas but in typical screwball fashion MacMurray ends up taking her home for the holidays to meet the folks. The inevitable happens. Both leads are superb and there are great supporting turns from Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson, Sterling Holloway and Willard Robertson as the defence attorney whose opening speech to the jury is worth the price of admission. It may not be ""The Lady Eve"" but it's certainly the next best thing.",4.5

Simple heart warming movie. Barbara Stanyck is phenomenal.,3.0
"Remember the Night is marred by the racist caricature of MacMurray's servant Rufus (played by Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones, who appeared in hundreds of movies playing similar parts while also running the shoeshine stand at Republic Studios) but apart from that from Preston Sturges' story offers a showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to shine and a place for Fred MacMurray to perform comfortably within his limited range in a pretty decent morality play that edges toward comedy in some scenes. Sturges, who was on set for much of the production, started directing his own movies after this and also told Stanwyck, whose career so far had consisted of dramatic roles, that he would write a screwball comedy for her - which he immediately did, directing her in The Lady Eve the next year.
Remember the Night isn't always effectively structured but lays out a heartfelt and slightly melancholy melodrama of nostalgia, love, kindness, honor, integrity, and healing.",3.0

"Well that's just great. Christmas is gonna fucking kill me this year because I won't be able to stop thinking about this movie and I'll flip-flop between brooding, melancholy aching and straight-up wanting to off myself.
Why do I wallow in this feeling? It's not like I get some sort of catharsis out of it, I just hurt. And that hurt compiles and accumulates until it evolves into outright self-hatred.
And yet I keep on wallowing. Like a lamb to the slaughter, like a moth to the flame, like clockwork. It's never enough.
I yearn for this sort of compassionate, loving connection. What's more odd is that I find great joy in seeing my friends and such falling in love. I don't seethe, I don't complain, I don't pray on their downfall just because they found something I'll never have.
I am happy. And sad. At the same time. So life will always go for me, I suppose. Love wasn't made for everybody. Best accept that now or else things will get much, much worse.

"Remember the Night Stars Fred MacMurray as a prosecuting attorney and Barbara Stanwyck as the petty thief he's prosecuting right before Christmas. Sensing in the judge a streak of Christmas goodwill, he successfully moves to postpone the trial until after Christmas. He feels bad, however, about Stanwyck being stuck in jail throughout the holidays and so offers to pay her bail. Upon finding out she doesn't have anywhere to go for the holidays, he invites her home to visit his family in Indiana for one last holiday before she's locked up. This is a weirdly sweet holiday movie that is a little jarring considering I most know this pairing from their work in Double Indemnity, which is definitely less than sweet. Unfortunately once they've established the sort of unorthodox dynamic, the rest of the movie plays out much more like a typical romance. The ending does go in a slightly different direction than I expected, but thinking back on it that's the only part that really took any chances with the story. It's probably worth seeing especially if you are fan of either of the stars, but it didn't blow me away.

"Thanks Josh! A total delight. Love the actors, director, and screenwriter. A bit broad in some of the comedy and melodrama, but then super tight in MacMurray's dialogue/patter. And Stanwyck -- the camera loves her look and her talent, and so do we. A winner! Reminiscent of many other lovable films, too numerous to mention. Well let's mention a few: I Know Where I'm Going!, Ball of Fire, You Can't Take It With You, Christmas in Connecticut, It Happened One Night, The Princess Comes Across, Hands Across the Table. Double Indemnity! Arsenic and Old Lace! Very fun, and dare I say, moving. Quite different from the Sturges/Stanwyck The Lady Eve, and Leisen's Midnight and Easy Living.

"Before Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray costarred in Double Indemnity, they got a trial run together in Remember the Night. Very cool to see them and together here. The writing by Preston Sturges has moments of witty and smart humor alongside drama, and there’s no one I’d rather hear read some snappy dialogue than Stanwyck. I started to think it was an allegory for how bad society treated women who weren’t considered “pure” enough in those days. Sadly the ending moments, while emotionally satisfying in some ways, totally ruined that hypothesis I think. 
All that almost distracted from the racism directed towards the one Black character and the treatment of the seemingly neurodivergent cousin played by the guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh.",3.0

I enjoyed this Preston Sturges movie. Both Fred McMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were adorable, especially Ms Stanwick as the lass from the wrong side of tracks. The scenes where she ends up with him at his family's Ohio farm are just too precious for words. I kinda what they were going to do for an ending, but it didn't pull any punches and was satisfyingly vague.
There were some pretty funny scenes too, and some touching and some heartbreaking. It was an excellent little soaper and it made for a good movie to wrap presents to.",3.5
"There's a lot to like here and when the Sturges dialogue hits, OOH BABY, but also you can see how this was probably one of his reasons for wanting to direct his own work in that it sometimes drags.
It sorta starts like an almost-screwball comedy before dipping into some romance, some light noir and even some 'woman in trouble' stuff (which was probably a bit of a callback to Babs' early fans).
It's not perfect but there are lots of interesting things here and a never better Stanwyck performance does a lot - some of her best acting in this one I think.",3.5

Not here. Here, Stanwyck, all on her own, decides to take her jail sentence right on the chin, because then, when she’s released, she’ll feel worthy enough to marry an upstanding corn-fed Indianan like Fred MacMurray’s Boy Scout lawyer. Through no fault of her own, she was dealt a bad hand at birth, used her wits to survive, and now wants that large, loving, Norman Rockwell family that she never imagined she would have had the need or desire to procure. But Christmas can work its voodoo, especially when you’re all alone.

"Thought it was going to be a screwball comedy in the vain of the charming Christmas in Connecticut, but after some shenanigans in the first act (including an extended courtroom monologue and a sequence on a farm), the film reveals itself to be a delicate romance between two people who know they shouldn’t be in love but happen to be anyways. I call this the Brief Encounter school, where love just happens to people whether they mean it to or not.
The Christmas scenes at the Sargent house are delightful and Beulah Bondi turns in another incredible performance that just makes me wish more and more I could have her as a grandmother (nothing against my own, I love them but Bondi could be my third grandmother). The fact that the ending chooses an ambiguous romantic note rather than a comedic one just goes to prove how seriously Leisen and Sturges took this material, regardless of how wacky it may have started out. They always believed wholeheartedly in their characters above all else, even at the expense of a gag, and the quiet strength of both leads in the final scene says leagues more than any pat finale ever could.",4.5

There are also some wonderful set pieces here - the scene where Stanwyck and MacMurray visit Stanwyck's character's mother is haunting - there is a definite sense that the two are stepping into the grave when they cross her mother's threshold. The whole sequence is creepy, and then at the end as they emerge from the house and return to the world of the living we get a fantastic shot of the mother turning out the lights behind them as we focus on Stanwyck and MacMurray.

"One of the coziest movies I've seen in a long time, earning its omnipresent sentimentality with a thoughtful script and layered performances. The actual plot is ridiculous, but that stops mattering the second Stanwyck tells MacMurray ""Gee, you're sweet.""
I feel like I say this a lot, but Stanwyck has probably never looked more beautiful than she does here. She's playing a somewhat more laid-back version of the Hawksian woman for the first bit, but as the film gets more nakedly emotional in the final act, she shines like a Christmas tree. There's one scene in particular where she pivots from openhearted sweetness to cynical anger so quickly and believably, it's easy to forget she's acting. GOAT, as the kids would say.
Also, props to Leisen and Sturges for the ending, which manages to be both a happy resolution and ambiguously open-ended in one fell swoop.",5.0

The opening courtroom scene is ecstatically screwball. Stanwyck’s defense attorney delivers the an insane closing argument for his kelpto-client. It’s a perfect introduction for Stanwyck, who gets to silently react to this incredible bullshitting with devilish smirks, half feigning innocence. 
The movie takes a strange turn in the middle, transforming into a strange heartwarming Christmas family tale. The characters opine about the nature of criminality and importance of hard work and honesty.
That all sucked, but it’s saved with MacMurray and Stanwyck’s drive back to New York. They have chemistry together, to be sure, but she could conjure chemistry with a hat rack.",3.0

Here we have a screenplay by Preston Sturges, but he does not direct. A good romantic comedy/drama, but without a traditional “happy ending”. Very enjoyable, mostly because of the terrific acting by the two leads.

"I didn’t expect this to hit me in the heart as hard as it did.  I guess I’ve been longing for a little bit of love and redemption for myself lately.

"Perfectly pleasant as one of the first wave of romantic comedies to rise from the primordial Hollywood ooze. Lacks a certain cinematic quality that both helps and hinders.
Stanwyck and MacMurray are wonderful together and their work here retroactively elevates their chemistry in DOUBLE INDEMNITY even more, The relationship and rapport are just as striking, but completely different.
Stanwyck in particular has risen tenfold in my book, taking what could have been a comedic bother of a role (convicted shoplifter turned romantic road companion of the lawyer trying to convict her; think Goldie Hawn or Queen Latifah terrorizing Steve Martin) into a pragmatic, and deep exploration of how a woman in her position would deal with unexpected warmth and compassion.
REMEMBER THE NIGHT is always enjoyable, yet rarely interesting which only goes so far in making a memorable movie. A HIS GIRL FRIDAY type back and forth would make for a totally different tone, as would a collection of zany gags. REMEMBER THE NIGHT does succeed in what it's attempting to do; it's just too bad it never quite becomes remarkable.",3.5

"My first Mitchell Leisen, Midnight, stands out in my mind primarily for its absolutely bonkers narrative (for my money, perhaps the craziest I have ever seen in a film). It's anchored by two great lead performances from Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche, but the film's frequent twists and misunderstandings mark it as the most screwball of comedies. Remember the Night, now my second Leisen, has a much less ridiculous plot—even if it's about a district attorney falling in love with a defendant during one Christmastime—and instead works primarily through Barbara Stanwyck's wiles and Fred MacMurray's inability to resist them. Their romance is predicated on a lopsided power dynamic where Stanwyck virtually has no choice but to seduce MacMurray, as it is the only way she can save her own skin, and as this plays out in their increasingly morally strained romance, the emotional resonance becomes tempered with fears of the ramifications of such concessions.",4.0
"This packs a lot into 90 minutes. It’s mostly silly and even at its most serious Remember the Night has a light touch. But maybe director Mitchell Leisen has too light of a touch? Needed some extra oomph in the last half; it feels like everyone is just kinda going through the motions until we get to the ending, which is inevitable if you know anything about classic Hollywood cinema but still nicely done.",3.5
"Fred MacMurray is the nicest guy here. He’s not overly naive though which I liked very much. Both him and Barbara Stanwyck are magical together. I loved that both characters got to meet each other and hang out properly before falling in love, in so many of these old timey romantic movies they’re only pushed by the plot and by the end they’re suddenly in love without really knowing stuff about each other. I really enjoyed the holiday vibes and the unpretentiousness of the Sargent family. Only moments where I cringed were the POC treatment, it’s really bad and cheap comedy. And that ending is 100% the hays code fault. But at least Fred MacMurray’s character was aware that it wasn’t a matter of bad woman leading him to perdition (which is curiously subverted in Double Indemnity) but more like we are all human and made mistakes and we deserve second chances.",4.0

A comedy that takes a premise that is a bit stretched and makes it something quite wonderful at times.

"Saw it mentioned repeatedly in Dec on Old Hollywood Twitter and had to see it as it stars Stanwyck. Was not disappointed by this Preston Sturges penned winner.
Plot should not work, but it does. And Stanwyck and MacMurray have great chemistry.
There are several small touches that really make this movie. One is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Stanwyck's character has just had a terrible interaction with her hateful mother and she and MacMurray are standing on her mother's front porch talking. You see her mother walk up to the front door and pull the curtain aside to peek out, then walk away from the door down the hall and turn out the light. This part of Stanwyck's character's life is forever closed off from her. Beautifully acted and filmed.
The other small scene I love is later at MacMurray's family home. His mother talks him into playing the piano and singing. He plays it hesitantly, with mistakes, just as one would if you knew how to play, but hadn't for a long time. Very realistic and utterly charming.

"Warm and lovely, though you get the sense Sturges would have toned down some of the sentimentality and let his dialogue go off more. What's left in there is strong—the blustering defense lawyer in the early court scene is unbelievable. The central dynamic (the DA generously inviting the defendant home for Christmas and falling in love) is so absurd as to not make sense, and Leisen plays it pretty straight here. It's not bad; just silly. Sturges might have had more fun with that tension. Who knows.",3.5

"Not really a spoiler, but I’m seeing a lot of flack for the ending. I kind of liked the ending? I didn’t expect it to be so heavy, so I appreciated being surprised.

Not sure if I'd never heard of this before because of the racism at the beginning (which isn't too too bad considering the year) or because it's a Christmas movie that isn't heavy of Christmas themes but I thought this was solid and I'm surprised I hadn't heard of anything about it sooner.,4.0

"My cousin told me this was the last script Preston Sturgess wrote that he didn’t direct. Apparently, he wasn’t happy with Mitchell Leisen’s interpretation. 
I’d certainly like to see what Preston came up with but I fear he wouldn’t have felt at home in the farmhouse Christmas or the romance in Niagara Falls. 
I’ve always struggled with Fred MacMurray as a romantic lead seeing him first as the straight-laced, sexless father of My Three Sons and as a whacked out scientist/professor in Disney fare. This might be his most convincing for me, especially opposite Barbara Stanwyck. They have quite a history together. 
Except for the embarrassing peek into white privilege with his butler, played by Snowflake as a stuttering pleaser, this film has so much going for it. 
It’s smart, heart warming and clever. 
Perhaps just to please Preston, Mitchell left in the portrait of the cross-eyed grandfather.

Mais um melodrama com traços cómicos, que se desenrola sob guarida do road-movie, do que uma comédia screwball de ritmo alucinante repleta de situações caricatas – uma constatação que tem o seu quê de surpreende dado que Remember the Night (1940) foi escrito por Preston Sturges. O modelo narrativo do road-movie, que na época se tratava de um género ainda com poucos exemplares, é empregue com distinção. Dois desconhecidos evadem o caos da cidade de Nova Iorque rumo ao estado de Indiana onde ambos nasceram. Durante a viagem pela América rural, os protagonistas reencontram o seu eixo no mundo e reconhecem que a mão um do outro é aquela à qual querem dar a sua para o resto da vida. Embora a província norte-americana seja retratada com contornos mofadores (a sequência do julgamento é a mais engraçada), o elogio aos valores de família e honestidade campestre são de um candura inegável. A órfã é recebida de um modo tão acolhedor pela família do advogado do ministério público que a acusa que é como se ela estivesse a ser adotada em idade adulta. A presença de pieguice melodramática é incontestável. Contudo, o tato do realizador, e em particular do duo de protagonistas, faz com que Remember the Night tenha um núcleo emocional autêntico. O dilema moral construído por Sturges demonstra também o quão apurada era a sua escrita. A estrada que a ação percorre conduz-nos a um ponto no qual os protagonistas têm de se autodestruir de maneira a provarem o seu amor. Sargent tem de sacrificar os anos penosos que passou a estudar para ser um advogado em Nova Iorque e Lee tem de abdicar da sua liberdade. Sturges sacode o final feliz que seria protocolar e faz com que uma autoemulação se transforme num ato de redenção e legitimação de amor.",3.0

This is an odd duck. I'm not surprised to read that Preston Sturges was upset about his script not being fully filmed. It feel kind of disjointed. Luckily that variety of tones does not hurt anything until maybe the end. The climax doesn't really earn the melancholy. So much before it is rom-com or just slapstick silliness.

"Apart from the first 15 minutes of this film which contain incredibly racist, cringeworthy exchanges between the Fred McMurray character and his manservant character this film is a pretty fun Christmas Romantic comedy (written by Preston Sturges) starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray and their first ever film together. Also, a fun supporting performance by Sterling Holloway a.k.a. the voice of Winnie the Pooh and cool costumes created by legend Edith Head.",3.5
"Confounding but comforting because of a mostly secluded Christmas setting. Barbara Stanwyck good, Fred MacMurray up for debate. The Rufus character, a Black servant to MacMurray, who says things like ""massa,"" is a shamelessly racist portrayal that dampens much of the picture.
Watching the sequences with Rufus, beyond just the historical racism of them, is jarring because you can almost see the actor, Fred Toones, ""dumbing himself down"" for the role, which is even more sinister considering his character is mostly played for laughs, and as a device to essentially cement white supremacist racial hierarchies and confirm status quo.
This is a recurring issue I've had with cinema, when you see the intrinsic racism of the form, or the storytelling, it makes me look inward like, ""is this, my favourite thing in the world, filmmaking, inherently evil?""; or is it a reflection of the times and a medium that shapes itself to the creators, however evil, or benign?",3.0

"An early rom com starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, this film about a DA who takes a shoplifter home for Christmas was funny and romantic, and sad too. Stanwyck, who had a bad childhood and was driven to kleptomania from the emotional wreckage of her youth, ends up spending Christmas with MacMurray’s family and sees what a functional family should look like. (Relatable.) Being treated like a person is healing for Stanwyck, and falling in love is corrupting for MacMurray, who goes from being a straight laced DA to trying to throw off Stanwyck’s theft conviction for love. Anyway I loved this. Barbara Stanwyck carries the movie (though MacMurray is very charming too).",4.5

"The chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray simply pops off the screen in this quintessential Christmas romance. The court room drama and setting affords the story the necessary subtext to really dig into the developing relationship, and the result are scenes that arrive full of tension, both of the relational and moral. Beautifully constructed scenes with emotionally drawn backdrops and complex dialogue (the night time scene is a stand out) make this effortlessly watchable and impossible to resist, giving the relational arc a dynamic and captivating presence.
Warning: for a film of its time there is a bit of racism present. With that as the film's single drawback, this is a must see for any seasonal watchlists.",4.0

"Lee said right and wrong are the same for everybody, but the wrongs and the rights are different and i agree with that",4.5
"Scripted by Preston Sturges, his last as solely a screenwriter before he made the jump to directing his own material. Not as screwy as his screwiest, more firmly in the romantic-comedy territory than satirical mayhem, but it's still quite delightful.
Fred MacMurray is a boring square, which is fine as long as he's *playing* a boring square; he's not exactly Gary Cooper but he gets the job done at least. Stanwyck sells their romance with no help from him; in fact there's tons of tiny little moments here to remind you that Babs is one of the best actors of all time, just breathtakingly good, elevating already-solid material 3 or 4 levels higher by her performance alone.
I watched a VHS tape of this (shout-out to Beyond Video!) which was so poor-quality I might as well have been listening to a radio play. Halfway through I gave up on trying to make out the great stage sets through the muddy analog murk, and just listened on while I resuming reorganizing my tape library. I still got plenty of enjoyment out of it, but I'd love to catch a proper print or restoration of this some day. Good enough to rewatch.
I was also pleasantly surprised, re: this is a Christmas movie, by the moral lesson that the criminal justice system is unnecessarily cruel, that shoplifting from 5th-Avenue department stores is actually fine, that people are shaped by their circumstances and turn to crime because intractable poverty doesn't offer them any better options. I felt for sure she was leading him on with the whole hometown bit, the way that narrative pays off is actually really touching and good. This movie will definitely activate your Christmas Spirit zones without getting sappy about it. Many have complained about the ending, surely a necessity under the Hays code; it still ""works"" for me, because even if MacMurray and the audience can forgive Stanwyck, society never will, and thus the film, in microcosm, cannot either.",4.0
"I first watched this movie on Christmas 2018, when I received the blu-ray as a gift. A nearly perfect film for what it is, yet another under-rated example of peak golden-age Hollywood film-making.

Cinephiles of course must compare it to Double Indemnity because of the stars, and it does not have the sizzle of that movie, but there's also absolutely nothing wrong with it.

"A really moving film. Stanwyck is at the top of her game, the story is a great one, and it doesn't work out exactly like you expect which is always a welcome turn.
It's the norm in old movies like this for a couple to quickly fall in love without any real reason to do so. In Remember the Night, it feels earned. But for as good of a romance and melodrama as this is, it goes even further by way of its portrayal of a a broken person who has no home and who has never experienced family or love (or at least has no memory of it if it ever did exist). Preston Sturges's script is a perfect hybrid of romance, light comedy, and deeply affecting pathos. The humanity in this is just beyond the norm for old Hollywood, but certainly not beyond the norm for Sturges who was one of the most empathetic screenwriters we've ever had.
For all the goodness to be found in this movie, it's doubly baffling to see such extreme racism around the character of Rufus. I'm used to seeing racist bullshit in old movies because these are literally documents of a completely different era with completely different values and perspectives, but this one just went beyond the norm in the worst ways. The big difference here is that multiple characters in the film verbally abuse Rufus, the black servant character, and for no reason whatsoever. None of it builds on the story, and none of it does anything for the characters, so it's really hard to understand why any of it is there. It's a counterweight to everything that I wrote in my previous paragraphs, but at least the there's very little of it in the film even if it is infuriating when it shows up.",4.5

"A Sentimental Journey
If you asked me about my favourite Christmas film, I would promptly name Frank Capra’s classic It’s a Wonderful Life, a movie that has become part and parcel of our family’s Christmas traditions. And then, I’d probably stop, scratch my bearded chin and say, “But let’s not forget about Remember the Night.“ The only thing is that my children would hardly enjoy it as much as James Stewart realizing what life in his hometown would have been without him.
Still, Remember the Night is among the Top Five Christmas Films for me because it aptly balances sentimentality and tragedy and as the script was written by Preston Sturges, it also throws in buckets full of intelligent humour. Paradoxically, the script may owe part of its power to the Hays Code, which insisted that a crime must not go unpunished, and so the thieving Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) has to atone for her act of larceny, which consists in stealing a ring – whose symbolical meaning may be read as a desire for human closeness. When we later come to meet Lee’s mother, a cold, prim and proper Puritan lady, living in a decaying and dimly lit Gothic building, we can understand why Lee has drifted into her petty criminal life. Interestingly, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) has grown up in similar circumstances, and when he was a boy, he also once stole milk money from his mother (Beulah Bondi) – but it was his mother’s love, rather than an adament moral self-righteousness on the part of his parent, that made him realize the wrongness of this act and consequently work off his moral and financial debt. The message is clear: It is more through love, kindness and human proximity rather than through the unfeeling insistence on an ethical code that children are taught to become reliable and valuable members of society. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Sargent home stands in stark contrast to the Leander home, the former being brightly lit and full of chattering people where the latter is gloomy and inhabited by two human gargoyles. Lee’s mother pretty much ignores John Sargent – probably because her Puritan imagination can come up with only one explanation as to why her daughter should be travelling through the country with a male stranger – but Mrs. Sargent and her sister receive John’s female companion with open arms, with the warmth of the season and, this can hardly be over-estimated, without questions. And yet, the script is not so starry-eyed as to be blind to a mother’s natural worries for her son, which becomes clear in one of the film’s highlights, namely the scene where Mrs. Sargent, after realizing that her son has fallen in love with their unexpected Christmas guest, goes into her room in the last night of their stay, in order to probe Lee and to gently point out to her the social danger Lee is putting John in. Stanwyck is standing in front of a mirror here – like in another of her famous films during an interview with a mother figure – but this time, she is holding a comb in her hand and the mirror stands for Lee’s look into her own soul.
As I said above, the Hays Code may have helped here, but Preston Sturges might have come to the film’s conclusion, anyway, and so we don’t have the typical cheesy Christmas ending but a more mature denouement, which takes into consideration the fact that a person may not be ready for true happiness and freedom until they have fully come to terms with their own past and accepted responsibility for themselves.
Despite this rather serious message – a message which successfully fends off cheesiness, by the way –, Remember the Night is a delightfully humorous Christmas film, and Mitchell Leisen’s direction is both lavish – as in the scene where John and Lee visit the Niagara falls at night – and exuberant. The director made some changes in Sturges’s script, which put off the latter to such an extent that from that moment on, he would direct his own scripts himself, which may be seen as another Christmas gift this movie makes.
So, even though It’s a Wonderful Life will remain my unconstested Christmas favourite, Remember the Night will also keep its unshaken place in my Top Five Christmas Movies.",4.5

First time watching of this film has made it become a stone cold classic for me. Stanwyck is my favorite actress of all time and she shines so bright in this film. Such nuanced character work from her. The production really works. The coldness of her family to the warmth of his. The shadows and blocking really sell a mood.

"I had watched Remember the Night six years ago apparently, but had very little memory of it. Back then, I gave it a 'C+' and said that the film had a dull second act that bogged it down.
While I still agree that there is a portion in the film's opening hour that is a bit of a drag, something about this resonated more with me this go around.
It's a simple picture, but one that has an abundance of heart, a touch of Christmas spirit, and a surprisingly complicated romance at its center that while perhaps a bit far-fetched still manages to feel fully realized and believable in large part thanks to Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray -- two of my favorite actors from this era of filmmaking -- who once again are fantastic here.
The film itself with a lovely screenplay by Preston Sturges is directed with a surprisingly deft hand by Mitchell Leisen who does quite a bit with shadows and light to make this film stand out from the typical holiday norms (that Niagara Falls scene!). And not only does Leisen get great turns from Stanwyck and MacMurray, but Sturges' script allows for secondary characters played by Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson, and Sterling Holloway to add emotional depth here as well.
This is a MUCH better film than I remember.

"Planning to watch the film later, but logging listening to the Lux Radio Theatre production for now. Jean Arthur replaces Stanwyck here and I imagine it gives a completely different tone to the whole affair. Lee seems so tragic played by Jean and I'd expect Stanwyck to play it a bit more wry. As is, though, this thing made me fuckin' SAD.
So, Babs plays it a little more wry, but not as much as expected. She and Jean both play the character as a little tragic and in need of affection. The film, unfortunately, allows more time to suggest that what the character needs is to be tamed through domesticity and traditional femininity, but the emotions are still really potent. That Niagara Falls scene is top tier and Stanwyck commands the film, really investing us in the character's arc and the morality play at its heart. A genuine unexpected gem.",4.0

"It was nice to see Stanwyck and MacMurray in something a little more tender. They would have such great chemistry in Double Indemnity, this is less steamy and murder-filled, but nonetheless really charming. How can you not fall in love with them when they're clumsily trying to milk a cow while lost on the road?
Preston Sturgess' script is terrific. Lots of great lines: ""That gag is so old it's got whiskers."" It has the workings of a screwball comedy, but outside of a few funny scenes it takes the question of their love fairly seriously. It uses the holiday setting very well as a way for characters to confront their past, examine their choices, and navigate their feelings. The Christmas scenes in the Sargent household were so pleasant and peaceful. MacMurray slowly hammering his way through Swanee River on the piano, mistakes and all, felt like a real family gathering.
There's a real melancholy through line knowing Stanwyck's time as a free woman is short. The resolution is somewhat surprising, it doesn't give you the happy ending you'd expect. I liked the subversion, she chose a fate for herself that she thought was fair, even if it wasn't what she wanted.

"4 years before they teamed up for Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray starred in this sentimental romantic dramedy (notably, the screenplay was penned by Preston Sturges, in his last? non-directorial effort). Stanwyck is Lee Leander, a shoplifter who is nabbed and sent to trial a few days before Christmas. MacMurray is John Sargent, an attorney assigned to get a conviction on her. Suspecting that he is about to lose the case to the in-the-holiday-mood jury (and the truly inspired theatrics of Leander's lawyer (Willard Robertson), probably the funniest scene in the movie), Sargent maneuvers to get a continuance until after the holidays. But feeling guilty about it, he bails Leander out so she can at least enjoy the holidays. This presents more problems, though, as Leander has nowhere to go, so Sargent ends up taking her with him on his planned trip home for the holidays.
This movie looks great, from the sets to the lighting to the costumes. The tone is light-hearted, small-town America, home for the holidays… a very nice, romantic Christmas time movie. There’s singing around the piano, gifts to unwrap, a warm kitchen, and a lively dance. But this Christmas movie also has a melancholic bite to it, a dark cloud in the form of the uncertain fate awaiting Leander in court, which becomes a storm when bonds eventually form between Leander and Sargent. And without giving anything away, the ending is well-done; memorably touching.",4.5
"An assistant D.A. takes a shoplifter home with him for Christmas when she has nowhere to go. A great and overlooked holiday film. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are great together (as always). Stanwyck especially so. Even the supporting work by Beulah Bondi is great. At times, the film feels a little stagey, but it doesn't completely derail the film. The script is nice and polished and the direction keeps everything moving without halt. A film I'd enjoy rewatching every yuletide season.",3.5
"Sentimental. At times silly, at times serious and often heartfelt. This one plays with light and shadow in the most interesting way. It's holiday classic I've never known until now.

"Part of December to Remember.
A Stanwyck vehicle that also stars Fred McMurrey and was written by Preston Sturges, how can you not like it! This is Stanwyck and McMurrey's first film together, they would work on many other films together in different genres. Here we have a comedy romp set during Christmas, Stanwyck plays a shop lifter who gets caught and sent to court for her sentencing. McMurrey is the prosecutor of the case and wins, putting Stanwyck's character behind bars. But he has a soft spot in his heart and decides, since its Christmas and all. What follows is the two characters having an adventure together while getting to and visiting McMurrey's family for the Holiday's and guess what!? they fall in love!!!
The dialog is 100% Sturges, its witty, whimsical and very smart. It is not however, directed by him, which is kind of a bummer. But director Mitchell Leisen puts Sturges script to top form, making it all about McMurrey and Stanwyck, but still getting great performances out of his supporting cast, which is what Sturges would do with his films like ""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""Hail the Conquering Hero""
It's not a complete masterpiece or anything, probably because Sturges didn't direct so the story does feel a little watered down and kind of goes into sappy old Hollywood territory. Stanwyck and McMurrey are great, but if you want to see them together at their finest, watch Billy Wilder's classic Film-Noir ""Double Indemnity.""",3.0

Simple will they won't they set up of the former as a petty thief and the latter as the lawyer prosecuting her who end up on a Christmas getaway. This was the first proper writing credit for classic comedy director Preston Sturges (The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels), who apparently felt his script was somewhat gutted and would eventually prompt him to direct his own work. I liked it, but I could definitely sense something lacking and is maybe a little too endearing by its moralised bittersweet ending. Main takeaway is that Stanwyck might be my favourite classic Hollywood actress.",3.5

Enchanting screwball comedy structured on grief and redemption. Mitchell Leisen allowance aesthetic captures the essential joyous nature of the material while offering insight and reflection on the consequence of events. Stanwyck and MacMurray possess dynamic chemistry displaying an effortless ease of banter with a strong acknowledgement of emotional undercurrents.

"Preston Sturges really is one of the best screenwriters of all time. However, this might be my least favorite script of his I've seen. It has the same crackle and linguistic fireworks typical of Sturges, but the story feels so hollowed out with a lack of stakes in the middle. I understand the escapism of the middle is supposed to yield tragedy at the end, but it just feels like everything is played so close to the vests that the romantic development just feels stunted. There are certainly beautiful, stunning moments (Niagara Falls scene!). It also just sort of ends out of nowhere, because there was no way to keep the happiness while maintaining the moralistic standards of the Hays Code.",3.5
"""Always laughin' at serious things, she was.""
There's a dread that punctuates the comedy and romance of Remember the Night, a haunting that comes to the fore as MacMurray accompanies Stanwyck on an executioner's walk to her childhood home, a Victorian Gothic shadow on ""the other side of the tracks."" After their brief and disatrsous reunion, MacMurray comforts Stanwyck on the porch as her mother passes like a ghostly apparition behind a lace curtain in the window. By contrast, MacMurray's childhood home, suffused with the warm light of family and filled with Americana characters right out of a postcard, would seem entirely opposite. Yet, when MacMurray's mother (Beulah Bondi) makes her cruel turn — pulls Stanwyck aside and tells her she's not good enough for her son — the camera captures Bondi's reflection as she ascends the staircase and locates in her another maternal ghost standing at a callous distance, framed by a window of sorts. Stanwyck is a woman who doesn't need to be told to give a false name, having already cast off her inheritance years ago, and she is more than ready to accept that she doesn't deserve MacMurray's name either. Stanwyck's brilliance as an actor is to convey this roiling tragedy beneath her shimmering surface. MacMurray, by contrast, relies on his large frame, its solidity giving greater weight to his straitlaced kindness as his life begins to revolve around Stanwyck's.
On their journey back to Indiana, the two end up sleeping in a farmer's field and are wakened when a cow greets them through the window, rurality intruding upon these fallen city folk. This picturesque romantic scene is interrupted by a farmer, brandishing a gun, who soon embroils the two in petty legal squabbles. Their adventures with the justice of the peace mark a turning point in the dance that sees MacMurray become disillusioned by the justice system and Stanwyck become enamored by the possibility of her redemption within it. By his mother's machinations, MacMurray ends up giving both her and Stanwyck a perfumed called ""One Hour of Ecstasy."" His mother has no need for it and Stanwyck comes to believe she doesn't deserve it. This refusal is put to the test at Niagara Falls, the icy water glowing pure white as the lovers embrace in dark shadow. The hour passes, and Stanywck chooses to submit herself, for the first time, to the ordeal of holding fast to her own identity.

"""a double-bill review with TITANIC (1953)""
Two Barbara Stanwyck pictures, REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a choice Christmas movie, directed with a nimble deftness by Mitchell Leisen from a Preston Sturges script, and betokens the first pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray in a motion picture which would continue for overall four times, among which the apotheosis is Billy Wilder’s noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944).
Stanwyck’s Lee Leander is a homeless (yet inexplicably glamorous) shoplifter under arrest and MacMurray’s John Sargent is the assistant district attorney, her assigned prosecutor. Out of the latter’s tactic and conscience, they end up together for the holiday season, with the court will resume after the New Year. After realizing both are from Indiana, they embark on a home-coming trip which will only compromise the case when they inevitably fall in love with each other.
REMEMBER THE NIGHT is notably for blending heterogeneous elements from Sturges’ script together: a courtroom drama (with Robertson shamelessly and ludicrously hoking it up like nobody’s business as the defense attorney, but marred by a sign of the times of portraying an African-American manservant as a halting prat), a zipper caper (their detour in Pennsylvania allows John a taste of the brush with law, as they are accused for trespassing and destruction of property), a holiday heart-warmer (with John’s convivial family warms up to Lee, who is rejected by her own remarried mother, even ), and eventually a swooning love story (a romantic interlude in Niagara Falls, foregrounded by shadows and profiles of embracing and necking) that feels convincing and surprisingly grounded with a sagacious ending.
The film has more than enough Midwestern goodwill, homespun folkways and level-headed charm to spare, especially in John’s family. Sterling Holloway’s cousin Willy is a buffoonish simpleton, Elizabeth Patterson’s aunt Emma is a hoot of a spinster and as John’s mother, Beulah Bondi is expertly tactful in handling their budding romance with an earnest plea that is quite tricky to pull off. While MacMurray proves to be understatedly amiable, Leisen’s natural propensity warrants that the stakes are in Stanwyck’s performance, which is as extraordinary as you might hope, even Lee’s characteristics are within a conventional spectrum, she is a crook without a wicked bone in her. Her outpourings always hit the mark because she can dial up the degree of intensity at the drop of a hat (checking her scenes with Bondi during their crucial exchange and in the final court kerfuffle), without looking theatrical.
Jean Negulesco’s TITANIC is 20th Century Fox’s first enterprise about the proverbial ocean liner tragedy and an antecedent of James Cameron’s juggernaut. Boasting the accuracy of its navigational textual actuality, the film fairly sheds light on what is the causation: two mixed telegrams about the threat of an iceberg (one of which is delayed), the pursuance of a record-setting speed and shy on binoculars for lookout, it is the combination of manmade error, poor judgment and technological deficiencies.
Stanwyck and Webb play Julia and Richard Sturges, a wealthy, but estranged couple. She plans to spirit their two unwitting children Annette (Dalton) and Norman (Carter) away to her hometown in Michigan, harboring a not-so-popular idea of raising them as down-to-earth Americans than rootless Continent-dwelling-and-trotting expatriates. Their heated ructions reach the flashpoint when Norman’s paternity is divulged, that embitters Richard and deeply wounds his consanguineous pride, whereupon he cruelly snubs Norman and busies himself with playing bridge. Only during the moment of life and death, heartfelt reconciliations (first with Julia, then Norman) become the balm that eases him into accepting his fate with the Grim Reaper.
Among other passengers, Thelma Ritter is always a sight for spontaneity and sideswipes as a nouveau-riche grande dame, who refuses to be manhandled by anyone and is uncannily acute to spot a pond scum amid the melee; Richard Basehart’s defrocked, self-hating, bibulous priest is a lost cause whose emitting of vicariously felt distress saves his final sacrifice becoming an empty gesture. Also Brian Aherne’s sturdy captain betrays minimal outward emotions, maintaining his honor and dignity until the last minute but a glint of regret and guilt isn’t entirely negligible in his eyes.
The film’s shipwreck visuals, as a matter of course, look dated and artificial on a “a boat in a water tank” level. However, when the ship is in extremis and the Christian hymn “Nearer, My God, to Thee” is playing, Negulesco nearly captures the solemn pathos that elevates the film’s projected impact.
It is interesting to see Stanwyck play another woman who stands on a lower moral ground than her male counterpart, but Julia holds her own despite of her unfaithfulness. Thanks of Stanwyck’s standing, her measured elegance and approachability, Julia isn’t a mere faulty part in the tug of love, against Webb’s slightly intolerable priggishness, but a woman whose realness reflects, however subsidiarily, in this handsome, but overly drawing-room drama-cum-fateful disaster spectacle festooned with the gravitas of respectability and nobleness.",3.5
"Cute holiday rom-com with the interesting twist that the man has to prosecute the woman for shoplifting when their vacation is over.
   Barbara Stanwyck plays a devious yet charming and likable character (as she usually does), but with a bit more warmth/vulnerability than usual.
   I like the aspect that the two have very different places in society, yet had similar childhoods growing up. Both even stole money from their mothers, with the key diverging point that John’s mother forgave him, and he paid her back, while Lee’s chose to throw her out.",3.5
"Another Stanwyck and MacMurray joint, incredibly wholesome and with a crackling and funny script by Preston Sturges (the last one he did before he started directing), I was pretty surprised by how much this connected with me. For all its syrupy sentimentality it also cuts through that a bit with a pretty moving humanist bent about although some people react to adversary in their upbringing in different ways, everyone is deserving of forgiveness and a chance to see the goodness underneath their flaws. Plus, Stanwyck and MacMurray had great chemistry, and the rest of the cast is also really good, particularly the mom and the aunt. Something about that scene where they are signing around the piano on Christmas Eve, I don't know what it was, but it got to me. Mitchell Leisen and Sturges were a good team, this one worked for me. And the end, when she says she won't be afraid if he holds her hand and stands next to her - inspiration for the song ""Stand by Me""?!?",4.0

This is probably my favorite screenplay written by Preston Sturges. It's funny as well as very sweet and heartfelt. It's about a district attorney (Fred MacMurray) who feels bad about putting a shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) in jail before her trial is over because he wanted to go to his house for Christmas, so he bails her out so she can go home for Christmas before the trail resumes. He even agrees to drive her to her parent's house for Christmas. The writing is fantastic, but the chemistry between MacMurray and Stanwyck is on another level.

Everything with Rufus is so cruel and I do not like it! I watch a reasonable amount of movies from this era and it's always disheartening to see black actors exclusively play servants, but the characterisation here is just evil. Rufus is slow and incompetent, he's threatened with violence. There isn't a comedic angle to it, there isn't any other black characters in the movie to offer any point of difference or wider representation, it's just the filmmakers' and culture's barbaric outlook on race. The best thing I can say is that it's fleeting, but it's rightfully a deal-breaker for people who face this sorta thing a lot more than my stupid ass.",4.0

"I watched Remember the Night as I was trying to resuscitate any sense of Christmas spirit in 2023. It didn't quite do that but I think this should be part of the rotation of Christmas movies.

"I don't why, I don't know how they did it but somehow this cliché of clichés stirred up a ripple in me that I thought wasn't possible. I was perfectly fine being forever single. Preston Sturges knew what he was doing.
Oh... To have someone brought me home for the holidays when I'm at my lowest, kissed me new year under the wondrous backdrop, declared they love me in front of Niagara Falls ""Your hand has always found mine and mine has always found yours."" and willingly risked their livelihood for my mistakes.
But weren't they a wee bit overdramatic? As if it would be death sentence when it was just petty shoplifting??

I know he didn't direct it, but I have to say -- having seen more of his work, I seem to respond more to Preston Sturges' work when he's in full-tilt comedy mode than he is when he's in comedy-drama mode. Remember the Night, sensitively directed by Mitchell Leisen, is firmly in the latter camp. When it's trying to make the audience laugh, it's very charming. When it's trying to make the audience cry, it's touching, but a bit baffling. I think I may be in the minority on this, but it felt like its melo-rom-com tone sat uneasily in Remember the Night.
It did not sit uneasily in Barbara Stanwyck, though. Always reliable and one of the best actors to ever stand in front of a camera, Stanwyck does admirable work here. She, as she usually does, is the film's beating heart. She's matched by a charming young Fred MacMurray, but it's hard not to feel like he's a little out of his depth. Beulah Bondi also does some reliably beautiful work as MacMurray's mother, effortlessly embodying the film's complicated tone. It has some real pleasures within it, even with a striking and odd ending, but it doesn't quite feel totally successful.
And yikes, Fred Toones deserved better than this. He mercifully exits the film after the first fifteen minutes, but even by 1940 standards, it feels like a pretty racist character. Not fun!",0.0

Fantastic movie,5.0
Something that has started to annoy me lately is the pervasive cynicism in both society and movies. But what I now understand is that most movies that are cheerful are often built on disingenuous foundations. They trivialize the darkness in the world and as a result seem crude rather than hopeful. Remember the Night has it both ways. Its cynicism imbues the cheerfulness with authenticity.,0.0

"“That was in Niagara Falls! People aren’t responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls” had me cackling…
But truly, I always love MacMurray and Stanwyck’s flirty banter. And this truly took on depths I did not expect, conveying the strongly held views about overall good and evil and making “morally right” life decisions that the decade embodied. 
Not sure how I feel about the ending, as it felt like the audience was supposed to have pity for Stanwyck and her sad upbringing, only to have the moral of the story be that you aren’t cleared of your past sins until you’ve served your time. I think the Hays Code influenced this type of story line, as it specified that people guilty of crimes couldn’t be let off the hook~ but until the end, the movie came awfully close to having us sympathize with Stanwyck and wanting her to be loved despite her past~ but maybe that’s the point, that she wanted to atone as a way of showing that her moral compass was changing and she wanted to be free of her past…",4.0
Stanwyck’s defense attorney really swinging for the fences. Dialed up to 11 and pulled out the hypnosis defense. Gotta respect the effort.,0.0
"Apparently a movie divided against itself can stand, more or less.
You can often feel that Strueges's script wants to go a little more madcap, a little zanier. So it's very obvious that Leisen shifted the tones around a bit, tweaked performances so as to end up an occasionally comedic melodrama.
And the melodrama aspects do work (how could they not, with this cast?), but the movie feels more than a little bit lopsided as a result. (The visit to Lee's mom, in particular, feels a like too much of twist of the knife here, especially as severe as it is.)
The comedy is a little spottier. Silly defenses of hypnosis play as belabored instead of an attempt at razzle dazzle. Goofiness with a cow is oddly shot, if still kind of funny. And there's setting a trash can on fire for...Reasons?
The key problem is that Jack never loosens up; indeed, the movie pushes back against this, and aggressively so. The plot, however, is structured so that he should. Ah well. It's still a good way to spend some time.

Remember the Night-1939 A Christmas holiday is spent together with MacMurray and Stanwyck years before Double Indemnity. MacMurray plays an attorney prosecuting a shoplifter (Stanwyck). He takes sympathy on her and brings her to his family home for the holidays. Naturally they fall madly in love. They don’t really wrap everything up in this and I found the story to be pretty far fetched. But the acting was good and I liked watching the 2 of them interact and the whole Holiday theme.,2.5

Barbara Stanwyck is the real star here, sorry Freddy but this one was a little lacking.

"Christmas set drama that’s big on the notion of second chances, places Barbara Stanwyck’s light fingered jewellery thief in the company of the lawyer (Fred MacMurray) charged with securing her conviction after the holidays.

Beulah Bondi stars as the doting mother, lending a little of that It’s a Wonderful Life magic to matters and although there’s romance at the film’s heart which you cannot help but root for, the film’s moral conviction ensures we get an ending that best serves the tale, rather than the crowd.",4.0

It begins in manic Sturges fashion as a courtroom comedy with Stanwyck’s attorney putting on a bloated performance for the jury. But things turn dark, both visually and emotionally, in the haunting scene of Stanwyck reuniting with her estranged mother. The deep-seated resentments, the coldness of Georgia Caine’s performance, and the inky black shadows of this scene have stuck with me for years. They cast a pall over the blossoming romance and the joyous festivities for the rest of the film, as both we and the characters are aware that once the holidays end, we must return to harsh reality. Like any good New Year’s film, this one has hope for better things in the future, but they won’t come without sacrifice and a few tears shed.

"Wonderful Christmas movie. The set-up is awkward but from their first dinner together onwards is great. Sturges' script is more infrequent with its jokes and slapstick compared to his later films but it's no less of an enjoyable watch because of its tender, melancholic story. Barbara Stanwyck is phenomenal in this and completely steals the show. Fred MacMurray is good as a square lawyer but Leisen correctly re-frames the camera around Stanywyck, focusing more on her inner turmoil and redemption and letting her performance breathe. The beautiful Niagara Falls scene, which has perhaps the most sublime lighting in a movie with all around great lighting, really highlights this because MacMurray's face is totally eclipsed in shadow while Stanwyck's beautiful, tear-stained face subtly glows with heavenly lighting as they share a tender scene. All around a great film but its Stanwyck's performance that ultimately elevates this above some of the other Golden Age Christmas classics.",4.0

But you can’t go wrong with the amazing Barbara Stanwyck, who plays both cool and vulnerable with her usual charisma, and Fred MacMurray at his usual perch on the edge of sin.

"Emotionally recognizable, to say the least. And by that I mean Lee's frustrated tearfulness at her mother's cold rejection and her quiet tearfulness at what a loving home looks like. Stanwyck is downright startling in the former scene and oddly relatable in the latter scene for the way she's leaned over the bed. One of the great Hollywood actors because of her acute awareness of how her posture works in tandem with her emotional/facial expressiveness. What makes the film truly great, though, is the bold choice Sturges makes of giving this loving, midwestern family realistic shades by having Jack's mother deliver her own rejection to Lee, albeit far more gently. What other Hollywood film would do something like that?
Another moment I love: Jack's mother's doubt about Lee being a thief and incorrectly referring to her as possibly being a hypochondriac. That naive, motherly faith.",0.0

"To start, I wanted to bring up the character of Rufus. He is a superfluous character who only seems to be here as a joke. The bumbling, Black idiot butler who gets confused a lot but means well. I bring this up because the movie works without him, and it’s a very charming movie with a lot going for it, but the inclusion of Rufus feels like a stab at minorities watching it. It reminds us that we are not welcome into this space, even if this space is that of the Christmas spirit. 
Removing him aside, there is a lot to love about this movie. Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic as a thief raised on the wrong side of things who learns how to be loved by a family of welcoming, small town folk. But what’s so interesting about this is the structure. It’s a story that blossoms, unfolding in surprising ways. Where stories today milk drama for the sake of drama, this story pivots every time. A secret that might be kept is revealed and we are forced to spend time on what happens next. A character is falling in love? They admit it and we focus on what happens now. It’s a gentler, kinder way of storytelling that I do really, really like.",4.0

"One of those wonderful surprises that has way more substance than you expect going in. The racism at the beginning is obnoxious and infuriating, if typical for movies of the time, but it's fortunately short-lived. And the ending has a sliiiight ""Will Hays Made Us Do It"" feel, but it's not enough to negatively affect this lovely, lovely movie. Stanwyck shines, as always, as the intensely likeable crook, Lee. The scene with her mother is honestly brutal for being all of about 90 seconds long, and the scene with Beulah Bondi telling her about her son's efforts to overcome poverty to become a lawyer actually made me tear up. This is a Christmas rom-com but it's also a movie about someone experiencing a lot of different kinds of love all at the same time and more importantly for the first time, and it makes the iffy ending easier to take. There are people and relationships worth bettering yourself for, even if you haven't previously considered your own well-being worth tending to. So glad I watched this.

The combination of Stanwyck’s radiant performance, Preston Sturges’s zingy script (the last he wrote before embarking on his own career as a director), and Leisen’s polished sophistication yields one of the most intoxicating romances of the 1940s.",4.0
"Very little about this film worked for me.
From the racist caricature of MacMurray's manservant Rufus (Fred Toones credited as Snowflake) to the utter lack of chemistry between MacMurray and Stanwyck to the wet blanket moralism driving the picture.

But the thing that gets REMEMBER THE NIGHT a heart is Barbara Stanwyck. HOT. DAMN. She single-handedly pulls the film out of the clutches of mediocrity. Leisen and his DP Tetzlaff also know how to frame Stanwyck so we can understand how a man could fall in love and lust with her. Her performance is so textured and layered, especially in the courtroom scene where we can see her piecing together what MacMurray's character is doing- brilliant work.",0.0

"Remember the Night is a melancholic, Christmas classic that is full of genuine emotion. It starts off as a standard screwball comedy during its first half, but becomes a rather tender and tragic romance in the second half.
Director Mitchell Leisen and screenwriter Preston Sturges are invested in these characters and it shows especially in the second half. The second half of the film touches upon how Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) and John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) had very similar rough upbringings. They both came from very poor families, but they ended up living very different lives in adulthood due to how their parents raised them. Leander's parents hate her and practically ruined her life. She has to steal in order to survive because no one would give her a job after her parents call her a dirty thief in front of everyone in their small town. John had a loving mother who encouraged him to work his way into law school and he ended up having a successful career as a lawyer. What I'm basically saying is that Remember the Night is about nature vs. nurture.
Barbara Stanwyck gives such a great performance in this that I'm surprised she wasn't noticed for awards season when this originally came out. Barbara says so much with just her facial expressions. You don't need to hear her speak in order to understand what she is feeling. It's honestly these types of subtle performances that I tend to adore than the bombastic performances that you tend to see win awards (I like to call it the ""YELLING MEANS I'M ACTING"" performance).
I do want to talk about two other things. The cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff is a thing of beauty. The way he uses low key lighting during the night time scenes makes it look like an expressionistic, film noir at times (which is appropriate since it's a romance between a lawyer and a thief). Remember the Night will probably be considered corny by some due to its sentimentality. I personally don't think it's a bad thing at all. I actually missed it when films showed genuine emotion instead of hiding behind self-aware irony because studios are afraid of audiences thinking a film is cheesy. That type of self-aware irony makes a movie just plain cold and emotionless. It's why I gave up on majority of modern Hollywood blockbusters because there is no soul behind any of it.
Remember the Night is a pleasant Christmas film that I will be rewatching during the Christmas season for now on.",4.0

Long take ball dances always reminds me of Ophuls.

The first and last 30 minutes are far better then the middle— it’s because the drama of the plot is great and the twists and turns are exciting but the logic and romance at the core of the film falters. If it wasn’t for Stanwyck’s undeniable charisma this wouldn’t work, but because of it Fred MacMurray’s character doesn’t hold in the middle— he’s far too shrew and emotionally aware as a lawyer to be that blind of the situations he’s put himself in and the love he feels for her. The middle was missing that tension between distancing from her as a woman of trial and falling in love helplessly - there was no moment where you see this switch happen or feel that anything really changed so drastically to justify his behaviour at the end. John was aloof and carefree during the whole holiday season and only considers whats to come when he’s in Canada. And on the other hand— Barbara was already in love with him after he decides to take her home. 
They should’ve either put John in a situation where he must win this case in order to her a promotion that he’s been desperate for - or forced their time together somehow due to a storm or some sort of situation - with him constantly trying to dehumanise her in order not to fall in love. These are the just the most basic and cliche ways to get that push-pull effect which i think the film lacked and made it a bit too flat. Which is probably why it’s not the most popular classic in the first place. 
The cinematography after the Christmas Eve is brilliant. Almost every shot is masterful — The contrast, the halation, the focus/depth of field switching, and camera movement. Everything.",0.0

"Barbara Stanwyck Christmas movie double feature!
The simple country boy cousin, Willie, is played by Sterling Holloway, best known to me as the original voice of Pooh Bear. Retroactively, I have to tip my yodeler's hat to whoever at Disney made that call; it's terrific casting.
I didn't see fit to mention the two Black characters in Christmas in Connecticut because their presence is so brief, but they are exemplars of nuanced character writing compared to Rufus the dopey manservant in this movie. Fred Toomes was a funny guy and he deserved better than what his era gave him.
This and Christmas in Connecticut are the only Barbara Stanwyck movies that I have seen, but from what I understand, she was an early ""chameleon performer"" who acted in a lot of different roles. Despite these both being light comedies, we definitely get to see a darker, more devious side to her in this one, especially in the fire scene and her ultimate decision to go to jail. She and MacMurray have world-class chemistry, and their final scene together is undeniably moving. I admire the choice to go with an unhappy ending, even if it does give off the vibe of some Hays code sycophant wanting to make it absolutely certain that stealing is wrong.",4.0

"Weirdly the movie allows you to forgive the racism, ableism and sexism, as being of the time because the filmmakers are  aware of it as something outdated in their own time. So when it’s doing things that might make you sit back and go ew, you don’t so much, because there’s an extent to which it’s being presented as it perhaps was, but as if the film is above it. 
Which allows the film (even though it shouldn't really get away with it) to just be very very cute, with some great lines, while winking to you as if to say: “We all know that this isn’t cool don’t we? Oh these silly prejudices. What are they like eh!?” Which obviously isn’t the strongest stance by today’s standards but for the times, it could be worse couldn’t it?

I did not realize that this was written by Preston Sturges. I am a huge fan of the films he has directed, so I was excited to see his name show up in the opening credits as the screenwriter. That excitement pays off with dialogue that crackles and a story that resonates.
Stanwyck and MacMurray have wonderful on-screen chemistry and deliver performances that are heartfelt and true.

Watching Barbara Stanwyck react to watching her lawyer utterly BS the jury by blaming her thieving ways on hypnosis filled me with a joy I never knew I needed. Than she goes and bests herself in another scene with her nod of approval and a-okay gesture after their arrest by unintentionally trespassing and cavorting with cows. Oh, Barbara lol.
I don't like how disrespectful Fred McMurray's character John is towards his employee Rufus (played by Fred Toones), both in-person and otherwise. But I remain quite smitten by Barbara Stanwyck who has a a down-home yet glamorously intense presence whenever she's on the silver screen. ""Remember the Night"" is filled with charming moments courtesy of the divine Barbara Stanwyck alas, as a feature film it really doesn't maintain the momentum. 2 stars for the superb Barbara Stanywyck and the portrait of the cross-eyed grand-daddy which made me laugh like crazy.

"So good. So, so good. 
I looove Barbara Stanwyck. Damn, if it weren’t for the fact that she’s a big movie star and i’m not, and the small difficulty of us not living on earth at the same time… 
And with this rewatch, I realize I didn’t give the leading man, Fred Macmurray, enough credit the first time. He’s really good, and really charming. To pull off a love story with these lopsided dynamics, you have to convince us that this man is a genuinely honest and well-intentioned man, and he does just that. 
Which gets to why the movie is so good as a whole. This story has so many complicated dynamics, and could easily be thrown off by poor execution. But instead, it’s all handled with so much care and intelligence, that it’s pulled off so well. Jack’s mom is a perfect character and a perfect representation of this point. She’s a good and caring woman, who isn’t looking down on a woman for running into the law during tough times. BUT, she also knows the damage it could do to her beloved son’s career. And the way she went about it all was so well done and sensical, and you respect her even when she’s trying to keep the leading romance apart.
Of course the one downside, as I recalled from my last watch, is the “unintelligent black butler” character, and how they treat him. Pretty tough to watch. But that to me is the only aspect that has aged poorly, because everything holds up incredibly well. 
If this were remade today, Jason Sudekis would be the leading man.",0.0
"B-A-R-BARA, that spells Barbara! Rockin’ that shit like she’s wearing ten ton galoshes. Good lord can that woman just devour roles. Amazing actor. She’s the absolute lynchpin in this, without her, this script, this ensemble wouldn’t even get off the ground. 
To cross the gender gap I’ve always had an issue with Fred McMurray. I saw him for the first time in The Apartment (1960) and ever since then I’ve never been able to get his character out of my mind. The same happened with Bruce Dern and The Great Gatsby (1974). You play an irredeemable asshole once and if I saw it young enough, you never outlive the stain. No, I think it’s to do with their lack of range. McMurray has never played against his type: clean cut, cold behind the eyes, and smug. 
I don’t know Mitchell Leisen the writer from Adam, though I fancied seeing Death Takes a Holiday (1934) after A Matter of Life and Death (1946). I do know Preston Sturges on the other hand, and I think he could have pulled this off. I’ve been meaning to see The Lady Eve (1941) and it looks like Barbara Stanwyck plays another crook in that. 
I realise this is post-Hays and that’s why the ending is that way, but I so badly wanted Barbara to be a total chiseler and conwoman. Like fiendishly adept at wriggling her way out of and yet into trouble, drop her right down with boy scout McMurray and have them drive each other crazy. More screwball is what I’m asking. Lots of cut downs, playful toying with each other, and ending up in glorious love. 
Instead this is a rather nice but sappy morality tale about what lack of love does to some people. That segment at Stanwyck’s old familial home was heartbreaking and done rather well. The atavistic portrayal of a home christmas in this was wholesome yet awfully treacly. I thought it was alright, palatable for sure. 
Though I have issues with the script and especially the construction of scenes, I enjoyed parts of it. Seeing Barbara in a dress from 1908 was just amazing, a corset and everything. Even if they improperly cut away from the reveal of her descending the stairs. So many transitions in this were botched or didn’t fit thematically or emotionally. 
It’s still worth watching just to see Barbara the charm and spark behemoth leave a path of destruction in her wake. She outplays everyone she’s onscreen with.

You do get some brief moments between her and MacMurray where their chemistry is so good that it practically feels like a test run for Double Indemnity. Generally, the film is good-hearted, but there are no surprises.",3.0

"Yule Log
So, this isn't the film I wanted to watch, I had mentally switched this and ""Affair to Remember""'s names around in my mind. So when I started watching this I actually thought I'd started the wrong film by accident. As it happens, it's all serendipity and Remember the Night operates well as a romantic comedy melodrama. There's the classic Stanwyck charm where she can command an entire room, so that every scene that isn't about her becomes about her and how she can handle props, how she can place her body, how she can give 5 layers of emotion through her tears.
Fred MacMurray is somewhat out of his depth in the comedic moments, and once I thought this I kept feeling it the scenes thereafter, he misses the beat, the tempo, the rhythm of Barbara Stanwyck. It seems amazing that this is the same duo of Double Indemnity, to me. Perhaps it's the script, but he feels so incidental to the film, it's wild.",3.5

How have I only now discovered the powerhouse that is Stanwyck. It is truly her that makes this movie. She knows how to play a tragic character so well and damn it worked for me. The movie is certainly a Christmas movie but without the usual sappy and holly jolly nature. It's a human tale with quite something to unpack. It's not evenly paced throughout but that damn ending left me heartbroken and deeply touched to the core.
It's in the small moments that I felt a deep connection to these people. Fred MacMurray singing to his family while she is falling deeply in love made my heart bloat with warmth.

This movie captures a spirit of the rom-com genre that has continued on to this day, including many holiday films. You cannot watch this and not think of movies like While You Were Sleeping, or thousands of subpar Hallmark, Lifetime, or Freeform Christmas movies. Tbh those movie channels have a lot to thanks to give to this movie since it’s the spiritual successor to the movies that flood our mother’s dvrs during this time of year.

"While there are two gaping plotholes as big as this earth, it is still a fantastically touching and entertaining movie.
First big plot hole: farmer gets his car stolen and yet nothing is reported after.
Second big plot hole: her sentencing was “next friday January the 6th”. They left on New Year’s day, were at Niagra Falls at night, and got back to NYC on the 2nd. Next Friday is impossible to be the 6th, as the 2nd would be that Monday. It would have to be “this Friday”. not next.
Back to the movie, we get to see Stanwyck in a corset, and he stunning chemistry with Fred MacMurray. We also get to see her in the most wonderful fur coats, and dresses. She is stunning as always, and MacMurray almost plays the sap to her again in this movie.
Cinematography and lighting was great, and there was one seen where the moonlight lit up Stanwyck’s face as she was tearing up, underneath a fanciful canopy bed. To me, her mother in the picture was showcased just enough to get an insight into their relationship without dwelling on the two too much.
Elizabeth Patterson as the aunt of MacMurray, and Beulah Bondi as his mother play a great role in portraying his family as loving and making the house a home.
Sterling Holloway also showcases his wonderful singing voice while maintaining his goofy goober persona otherwise. Also, Tom Kennedy, though brief, makes an entertaing bondsman. Fred Toones lastly plays the over-the-top black servant to a tee. Exagerration makes for great comedy.",5.0

"As a fellow Hoosier, any movie that takes place in Indiana will always peak my interest, but I was determined to watch this movie when I found out that one of my favorite filmmakers of the classic Hollywood period, Preston Sturges, wrote the script for this movie. Sturges got his start as a screenwriter, but eventually worked his way up to director after a good decade in the business and getting annoyed with the changes to the script he wrote, including this movie. As a Sturges fan, you can tell traits of his style in here, but it lacks that tight pacing and cutting wit that his films would become known for, as this is more akin to the style of someone like Frank Capra with his more sentimental work. That isn't to say Remember the Night is lesser, as this is a very charming holiday romance from two legends of the screen, but my expectations were completely different to the final product as something akin to the Lady Eve or the Palm Beach Story. Anyways, Remember the Night lives and dies off of the two leads, and fortunately both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray deliver. This was the first of four collaborations, and it is easy to see why as both play off of their types very well and you believe their growing romantic relationship later on in the film. Stanwyck in particular really shines here, as the material she was given really does showcase the dramatic range she had, and filling out the complicated role rarely given to women at the time with such grace. There are plenty of fun supporting roles too, including Beulah Bondi as another mother type and of course she kills it, and it features Sterling Holloway in probably the most on-screen appearance I had seen him in a movie. I can kind of hear Pooh and Kaa, but not really. The movie isn't really all that funny, which I feel is where that Sturges touch is sorely missing the most, but Remember the Night is still very irresistible as a solid romance and a good message about kindness and compassion for others. Which is a perfect message for the holidays!",4.0

"Before Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray heated up screens in the Film Noir Double Indemnity, they made this lovely romance that takes place over the Christmas and New Year's holidays where their chemistry was just as strong, albeit a more tender side of romance.
The plot of the film is a bit far fetched but the gist is Stanwyck is a woman on trial for shoplifting theft, and MacMurrray is the hard nosed prosecutor. He is concerned the jury will acquit her of the charges because of Christmas so he asks for a continuance until after the holidays. When he understands Stanwyck will spend Christmas in jail, he kindly put some wheels in motion that she can be out on bond for the holidays. You'll have to watch the movie to see how that decision plays out!
I enjoyed this much more than I expected and it's completely to the credit of Stanwyck and MacMurray that this is even remotely believable. If you're a hopeless romantic, this is the film for you!",4.0

"I have a vague memory of seeing a bit of this on TV about 40 years ago, so I had a memory that it is about an upstanding law man (Fred MacMurray) who for some convoluted reason ends up taking a woman he is prosecuting (Barbara Stanwyck) back home for Christmas. And that is the basic plot, but I had forgotten so much of the details that I won’t click the “watched before” button. 
The film was written by Preston Sturges, but except for certain misunderstandings that people have about their relationship, there isn’t much of the “that’s the way the world works” cynicism usually found in his work. Instead, the film has a lot of pathos, as Stanwyck finds acceptance and more from MacMurray’s family. 
The film was directed by Mitchell Leisen, who also directed another Sturges’ script (Easy Living). Reportedly, Sturges demanded that he be allowed to direct his own scripts because he was so upset about Leisen’s work, something I’ve never understood. 
In any event, this film is all about Barbara Stanwyck. She is such a tremendous performer- all you need to do is watch the way that she looks at MacMurray throughout the film. 
Please be advised that there is a stereotypical African-American butler character as well as a comment about beating wives among other things that I suppose are what we say are “of their time.”
One other little thing that I can’t stop thinking about:  in one scene, MacMurray makes popcorn, putting a lot of butter and salt on it. As he and others take a few nibbles, someone says “don’t eat it all, we’re going to string some and put it on the tree!”  And I can’t stop thinking of putting popcorn with all that butter and salt on the tree.",4.0

Preston Sturges is working out his voice with this one. Some lines pop sharp but the movie plays more like Capra - Barbara steals a bracelet and gets caught, Fred is the prosecutor who covers her bail so she doesn't have to spend Christmas behind bars, romance ensues, but how will it all end?

This greatly exceeded my expectations. I went in expecting an enjoyable hour and a half and I got so much more. This really is a classic Christmas movie that deserves more attention, all about guilt finally catching up to you. As soon as I saw Preston Sturges’ name in the credits I knew it would be something very special.
This has my favorite Fred MacMurray performance, and my second favorite by Barbara Stanwyck (besides Double Indemnity of course). It feels so much more layered than the usual sort of holiday movie from this time. 1940 was an excellent year for Christmas movies. This film, along with The Shop Around The Corner, make a great pairing. Wonderfully written romances with a hint of melancholy.
What else surprised me was how Christmasy this was. John’s family is so kind and warm and welcoming, and it’s just the perfect cozy family Christmas. This is seriously a film that in my opinion should be remembered in as high a regard as films like the original Miracle on 34th Street (although it’s still a tad short of living up to It’s A Wonderful Life, but most if not all movies are).

An older Christmas that I’ve never heard of until I saw it pop up on greatest Christmas movies, and once you get past the yikes 2 scenes in the first third with Rufus (let’s just say typical 30’s racism towards minorities) your in for a pretty charming rom com.
To start off this movie is pretty funny (much funnier than I would think) with Fred MacMurray giving some funny lines and deliveries that really made me like his character instantly. The story is your typical rom com so it’s kind of the cliches you’d expect although I’ll be nice to this movie since this was made way before the cliches really started since this is one of those movies that was early on them. One thing that makes it more charming is the chemistry between Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck is infectious and both are extremely charming together with some really engaging conversations they have. One thing I also kind of like is they are kind of criminals, well at the beginning the lady is one while Fred eventually does, so they are like a way cleaner Bonnie and Clyde (sadly not as good).
Honestly don’t have too much to say since it’s kind of a typical rom com and what your seeing is what your getting. A cute enough movie but definitely not an all time great Christmas classic.

"It might just be one of the most perfectly constructed screenplays ever and makes me want to just bow down at the altar of Preston Sturges. Who apparently thought that Leisen's execution of it was too sentimental, but I disagree. The completely earnest touch is actually exactly what it needs, it has to to be incredibly warm and tender and needs to not bring any note of irony to the idea of the all-importance of being raised in unconditional love. Stanwyck's performance just melts my heart, all sass and smarts but the vulnerability just below the surface is always tangible. Her line reading of ""I'm afraid so"" while she pauses brushing her hair and looks into the mirror might be the finest moment of her career (you'll know what I mean when you watch it).

Four years before they teamed up for the iconic film noir Double Indemnity (1944), Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray starred together in this nice little rom-com and their strong chemistry is just as evident here.
The movie contains several familiar tropes of the genre, and being of the 1940s you'll find some screwball comedy here as well. It's also a Christmas movie, not only because it's set during the holiday season but it really embraces the themes of the importance of having people around you who care about you, and to remember that we are all human and a little empathy goes a long way.

"Mitchell Leisen, a director of both melodramas and screwball comedies, is here given an early Preston Sturges script that has elements of both of those genres, albeit often approached with a more low-key style than Sturges would bring to directing his own material (which he began doing almost immediately after this film was released).
In a decided shift from their subsequent pairing in Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck play a prosecutor and an accused jewel thief who, upon their case being adjourned over the Christmas holidays, end up roadtripping together to their mutual home state of Indiana. Rather contrary to the principles of legal ethics, they end up falling in love. Assorted screwball hijinks are involved, but there's a quiet authenticity to a number of the key scenes and the chemistry between the two leads is strong. Key supporting work is provided by Beulah Bondi, the everymom of classic Hollywood cinema, here playing MacMurray's mother.
One would be remiss not to mention Remember the Night's most obvious flaw, that being the gratingly caricatured servant role given to black comedian Fred Toones. This unwelcome bit of pure minstrelsy makes many of the early scenes a bit unpleasant to watch, but thankfully that character is not brought along on the holiday trip.",4.0

"There's some very wince-worthy stuff early on involving Fred MacMurray's butler, but as the movie moves away from late 30s racism, it gets smarter, funnier, and sweeter by the minute. As a huge fan of MacMurray and Stanwyck's performances in Double Indemnity, it was a real treat seeing them go for the Lubitsch-esque pairing here.",3.5

MacMurray and Stanwyck sweep you off your feet in this Christmas time romance. They milk a cow for breakfast, give false names when arrested in a kangaroo court, and talk about honeymooning in Niagara Falls when they are in Niagara Falls.

"Mitchell Leisen, Preston Sturges, and Barbara Stanwyck is more or less the best comedy combo you can have of Golden Age Hollywood creative voices. This is a very conventional romcom compared to most of the ones Sturges worked on later, but the melancholy undertones and True Confession-like wallowing in amorality kept me amused.
The plot's a good Christmas movie with just enough wrinkles. My family has definitely had some Christmases with aspects reminiscent of these. Gotta love appearances from Beulah Bondi and Sterling Holloway.
And good luck not being charmed up to your elbows by Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Does that mean it feels like a Double Indemnity prequel? Maybe, a little, at some point!

"There was a real niceness to this one. It was sweet, had the Christmas spirit but at its core also has a larger story at hand with a bit of intrigue to it. I liked how the characters were both flawed and managed to still grow a connection, but that it wasn’t all so straight forward. It fitted being set at Christmas, and like all the best Christmas movies, it’s a good story even if you strip it of the holiday season setting. 
I am not sure how much potential there could be for a rewatch, but I would certainly add it to one of my favourite Christmas movies based on the first watch. I liked how they didn’t cop out of the ending or come up with a cheesy excuse how they could avoid it, but at the same time still managed to stick a satisfying ending. 
Much better than I thought it would, the ‘oldness’ of it honestly added to its likability. It’s a movie I shall be rewatching without a doubt!",3.5

"A good hearted law man and a cutie who’s a crook in a mink coat become a minor Bonnie and Clyde esque pair in this sweet little holiday road movie and romantic courtroom drama. “He may have a fever for me, but it’s not going anywhere.” The enemies of the courtroom lives intertwine after lawyer Jack pulls a fast one in court and thus extending the case through Christmas. Feeling guilty for putting a woman behind bars for the holidays, he pays the $5000 bond for her to enjoy Christmas with her loved ones. But, as it turns out, there are no loved ones. Through the plot of the fill we discover that she really has no family, and the ones that are left are cruel, cold hearted, and spiteful. Quite the opposite to Jack’s home which is warm, spirited, honest, and welcoming despite their tragedies, and through their time together, they fall in love.
With stunning shots of Niagara Falls in winter (outside of the studio!), New York City from above, and more this charming holiday film ends with moral messaging fitting for the time it was produced. Doing the right thing usually isn’t the  most cinematic and you see this here in this case.
Overall, a pretty okay movie! I wasn’t falling head over heels for either of them in this picture, but there were moments of remark. The scenes of singing around the piano, exchanging gifts, popping the popcorn and threading it on string to place on the tree, snowy scenes and more were picturesque and intimate, and the plot a lovely progression…. It’s just at times the dialogue was far too old timey that it felt like a dated showcasing of what was popular (can you imagine a film saying ‘woke!’, ‘gave me the ick!’, ‘okay boomer!’ every five seconds? Yeah, it’d get annoying). I didn’t feel their chemistry early on in the film and it made it hard for me to fall in love with them in watching this picture, but maybe I’ll give it another try some other time.",3.0

I don't think this movie will ever be a Christmas classic, but it's still a very good movie.",3.5

"Someone sang ""The End Of A Perfect Day"" in Ira Sachs' Passages (2023), but I didn't recognize the tune, so I went scouring the web trying to find it. I found some version of it on Youtube with lyrics that seemed to match what I thought I remembered hearing. I saw a comment from someone saying they loved the song and how movingly Barbara Stanwyck sang it in Remember the Night. I looked it up, saw that it was a Christmas movie and kept it on ice in my watchlist for a few months.
A couple weeks ago, I was in the Christmas spirit and decided to watch it. It wasn't streaming anywhere, so I rented it on blu-ray from a local video store. It looked as pristine as a crisp winter's day in Pennsylvania, but to my displeasure, there were no subtitles available on the disc. And I really depend on subtitles. I had to turn it way the hell up to understand what they were saying (Preston Sturges wrote it, and Fred MacMurray muttered a lot, so the dialogue was really fast but also really quiet). I probably understood about 45% of what was said, but it was sweet and I liked the sentiment. And Barbara Stanwyck sure sang a nice rendition of ""The End Of A Perfect Day.""
Well anyway it's two weeks later and the Criterion Channel has uploaded Remember the Night, complete with subtitles! This always seems to happen when I rent a movie from the video store. So you're welcome! Enjoy Remember the Night, and check out Passages while you're at it. Merry Christmas!",4.0

"Indicator Films, Spine #294.
I sadly was left bitterly disappointed with Remember the Night. Individually as performers, I love Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Together they also have fantastic chemistry as shown in Double Indemnity and There’s Always Tomorrow. This happens to be my least favourite film of the three. I thought MacMurray was okay here but not his best. Barbara Stanwyck to me carried the film. She was amazing and proved to me once again why she’s my absolute favourite actress of all time. 
Remember the Night is a romantic comedy for 95% of the film and then the ending turns into a drama with a very serious tone. I don’t mind the ending actually to be honest but the rest of the film missed the mark for me. I didn’t find it to be funny, really at all. I think it’s a nice good feel movie (again, 95%) but I was just left wanting more. It was written by Preston Sturges who’s done some great work previously. I’m not sure, perhaps I’ll revisit this around Christmas time again to see how I feel but I was so excited to see this pairing again and they were good and the story was solid but I think just overall, it’s a dull film.

"Four years before the classic noir Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck starred in this romantic comedy, though the comedy is in a surprisingly minor key. MacMurray plays a prosecutor and Stanwyck plays a thief he's prosecuting, and they both improbably end up on a road trip back to Indiana for the holidays. MacMurray and Stanwyck are believable enough together that they help paper over a variety of weaknesses in the script -- ethnic stereotypes, so-so comical misadventures, overly sentimental depictions of small-town life, etc.. The story has a few unexpected twists interwoven with familiar cliches, and there's an unusual air of melancholy that runs through the film. Certainly not on par with Double Indemnity, but has a little more heart than you might expect.",0.0

"이 영화를 보고 프레스턴 스터지스가 이후 자신이 직접 자신의 각본으로 영화를 찍겠다고 결심했고, 그 해 <위대한 맥긴티>로 데뷔를 하게 되었다고 한다. 그 이유는 이 영화의 각본 중 여러 부분이 스터지스의 동의 없이 감독 미첼 레이센의 임의하에 잘렸고, 그런 부분 또한 잘 묶여진게 아니라 어딘가 중간에 끝난듯한 느낌을 준다. 가령 검사인 잭과 피고인인 리가 중간에 사유지를 모르고 침입하였을 때, 치안 판사에게 데려가는 순간 치안 판사가 보는 현상 수배범의 사진을 클로즈 업 하더니만 이후에 그와 관련된 일이 전혀 나오지 않을 뿐더러, 엔딩 또한 중간에 끊겨 이후 재판 과정의 일이 나오지 않고 엔딩 크레딧이 올라온다. 더욱이 프레스턴 스터지스 본인이 감독한 영화와의 차이가 많이 드러나는데, 만약 그였다면 인물들의 카우보이 숏이나 혹은 풀 숏으로 인물들의 코미디를 찍어냈을 장면같은 것들이, 가구나 인테리어 등을 전경에 배치해놔서 오히려 사람은 가려지고 소품들이 강조되는 일들이 꽤 많다. 하지만 아이러니 한 점은, 미첼 레이센의 전작이자 스터지스가 다른 각본을 쓴 <이지 리빙>에서 처럼 이러한 방법이 주제면에서 꽤 잘 맞아떨어진다는 것이다.
영화의 오프닝에서 부터, 미첼 레이센은 도둑질 하는 바바라 스탠윅의 모습을 찍는것이 아닌, 그녀가 보석 팔찌를 차는 장면과 손이 사라지고, 그 자리에 있던 종업원이 다른 보석을 찾는 것을 진열장 사이로 보여주며, 카메라가 빠지면서 종업원의 말과 표정으로 그녀가 보석을 훔쳐 달아났음을 보여준다. 더욱이 이후 그녀를 곧바로 포착하는 것이 아닌, 팔에 찬 보석을 클로즈 업 한 쇼트로 넘어간 뒤, 카메라가 점점 트래킹하면서 뒤로 물러 나면서, 그녀의 모습이 드러나는 방식으로 찍었다. 더욱이 그녀를 변호하는 변호사가 배심원들에게 보석의 마력과 그것을 원하는 사람들의 심리를 이야기하는데, 이 때 레이센은 단순히 보석의 아름다움을 표현하려고 하는 것이 아닌, 그것으로 인한 사람의 도덕의 이중성을 보이려고 한다. 물론 그것을 훔치는 것은 잘못되었지만 반대로 보석에 대한 이끌림을 표현하고자 하는 것이다. 게다가 아이러니 하게도, 이후 이어지는 리와 잭의 고향으로 향한 여정은 보석에 대한 이끌림이 아닌 그저 환경 때문에 훔칠 수 밖에 없다는 상황을 역설하기에 정반대이다. 이후 이러한 보석에 대한 사람들의 동경과 같은 쇼트는 미국 시골의 전원적인 인테리어로 대체된다.
그 이후 잭의 집에서 풀 숏을 찍은 구도를 보면 대부분 전경에 가구를 배치해 그러한 시골집의 분위기를 자아내는 쇼트들이 많다. 반대로 리의 집에서 리의 어머니가 그녀를 보고 싸늘하게 대하는 장면 또한, 인물들을 찍는 와중에 어두운 집의 조명과 반대로, 전경에 놓은 램프의 불 빛과 같은 경우로 표현된다. 여기서 왜 스터지스가 레이센과의 결별을 선언했는지, 그리고 빌리 와일더가 그를 가장 싫어한다고 했는지 이해가는데, 미첼 레이센은 소품들을 사용해 분위기를 자아내려고 하며, 심지어 그것을 위해서 각본을 어느 정도 희생하는 경향을 보인다. 하지만 아이러니한 점은, 반대로 그렇기 때문에 오히려 각본에 다른 강점이 생긴다는 것인데 보석을 훔치며 살아가고 또 그 보석에 매혹되는 여성이 반대로 그런 부와는 정반대인 시골의 집과 그를 대표하는 검사인 잭과 사랑에 빠지게 되는 모습은 앞서 보석을 강조하며 그것의 매혹을 뽐내었던 연출들과 같은 방식으로서 제시된다는 것이다. 물론 이는 <이지 리빙>에서도 보였던 레이센 특유의 인테리어적 미적 감각과 연결되는 것일 수도 있다. 인테리어 디자인만 따진다면, 당시의 영화들 중에서도 몇 십 년은 앞서있는 것이 많으니 말이다.
하지만 그렇기에 <이지 리빙>과 같이 그러한 보석에 대한 매혹과 분위기에 매혹된 여성의 모습을 보여줌으로서 <그 날 밤을 기억하라>의 연출은 그 효용을 얻는다. 난 이것이 <이지 리빙>의 예외라고 생각했는데, 이 영화를 보니 아마 이것이 미첼 레이센의 스타일인거 같기도 하다. 더욱이 그에 대한 글에서 처럼, 그의 영화는 도덕에 대한 양면성이 그 스타일과 어우러져 있다. 잭과 리가 다시 뉴욕으로 돌아오기 위해 거치는 곳인 '나이아가라 폭포'에서 잭은 리와 신혼 여행으로 나이아가라 폭포에 오겠다면 좋겠다고 이야기하지만, 리는 이미 여기가 나이아가라 폭포라며 키스한다. 그리고 바로 다음 쇼트에서 나이아가라 폭포의 물줄기들은 뉴욕의 마천루로 변하게 된다. 어느 정도 이분법적일 수도 있겠지만, 여기서 미첼 레이센은 도덕의 양면성을 보석과 전원적인 생활로 나누어 보여주고 있다. 하지만 그의 연출 스타일과 동일하게, 우리 모두는 그것에 끌린다. 물론 그것을 훔치거나 하는 것은 영화 속에서 계속 언급되어진 것 처럼 환경이나 인물의 문제일 수도 있겠지만, 리가 정말 배고프면 빵을 훔치겠다는 잭의 말에 ""당신은 정말 정직하다. 나 같으면 레스토랑에서 풀 코스를 먹고 지갑을 잃어버린척 하겠다.""는 말처럼 그것은 상황의 문제이기도 하다.",4.0

"A tepid and tonally haywire festive drama of romantic redemption with strong but capricious notes of screwball comedy at its beginning and very end. It was in and around the courtroom, on the day before the Christmas recess, and the day after it, that the film thrived, the sly manipulation of the system and the commentary on the practicalities of convicting someone during the season of charity and good cheer drawing chuckles if not belly laughs with their cutting cynicism, but during the road trip and the family reunions which constituted the Christmas bit of the film proper, the slapstick was half-baked, then eschewed in favour of some rather too easy and ultra-predictable invocations of love and graft.
The start was a promising one, and a very Christmassy one, too, light glinting off jewels, shop frontages busy, and Jingle Bells integrated into the score; the contrast with the clipped, sanguine conversations about strategies for prosecuting repeat offenders taking place in the much staider professional interiors suggested a screenplay well attuned to the comic potential of souring the Christmas spirit, and which was only going to get funnier as the plot found more ways to counterpoint the wholesome and the pragmatic; this was not quite what happened, however. Fred MacMurray’s demon lawyer had a black manservant who was slow-witted to an extent and deliberate in his enunciation in a manner which accorded exactly with the racist stereotype, miring the film down for a time, before prosecutor and perpetrator set off on their seven hundred and fifty mile road trip of what seemed set to be madcap misunderstandings and smart one-liners delivered across the dashboard (if cars of the era had such things) from opposite sides of the legal fence. The screeching to a halt before diversion signs on icy roads was carried off rather well, with the vehicle apparently genuinely out of control for a stretch, although the cow-milking and citizen’s-arrest routines the closures ultimately gave way to were each one or two calamities or awkwardnesses short of inducing hilarity. The odd droll development, an ungainly crouch or a preposterous cover story, got a titter, but these were not compounded with further insults or injuries before the scenes came to their mildly underwhelming ends.
Having arrived in Indiana, the thrown-together couple’s first stop-off all of a sudden indicated that their tale was absolutely no laughing matter, despite the fact that that was very much what it had been being presented as for well over half an hour by that stage. The chill villain of the piece had a few too many details to hand to have convinced fully even in a melodrama, but it was more that melodrama was the genre in which they plainly belonged, not the knockabout stuff of Remember the Night, which proved so off-putting about their appearance. After that, it was on to the film’s goodies, who among their number featured another Hollywood simpleton type, the purified ‘Willie’, this one’s interventions coming nasally and at a high volume, plus a character who was the perfect host except for repeatedly forgetting that things were in the oven, precisely as someone with her wherewithal would not have done. Things became extremely relaxed upon this rendezvous, with singing and present-opening so sincerely serene that the temptation was to leave them to it, and to have a snooze. Events which might have been grand comedic set-pieces, the jumble sale and the New Year’s Eve dance, were permitted to pass with only a brief look-in to check that all was well, which of course it was. The recollections concerning corsetry and the associated dressing procedure from the house’s elderly resident offered some astonishment at what was by all accounts the historical standard, but there was no intrigue to be found in the question of whether there would be an acceptance of a criminal brought into the upstanding citizens’ midst, nor in the question of whether criminal and attorney were going to be sharing a kiss come the end of the holiday period. She seemed to have forgotten that she was given to stealing things, and even if she had been given to slip a candlestick into her handbag, the tolerance of those adopting her knew no limits, while MacMurray was hardly given any opportunity for reckoning on the now-serious situation, merely falling into the pair of arms which had been positioned next to him and stage whispering to the face above them.
It took them a while to get back to the courtroom, via some studio space vainly aping some majestic exteriors, and some dialogue which skated over the tough moral quandary which had been contrived for them. The final darkly comic sequence did go a little way in terms of restoring the film to our hearts, as the bite returned to the principal tongues and a situation was allowed to become unbearable. Overall, though, slow and draped-tinsel loose as it was, Remember the Night did not provide a night to remember.",2.5

"If you were to ask someone their favorite thing that comes along with the holiday season, you might hear answers such as the gifts (giving or receiving), the time spent with loved ones, the spirituality of it all, or even for some simply the day off work. However I believe one of the greatest qualities of this time of the year is the forgiving of past wrongs from loved one to loved one (even if it’s just for a few days) for nothing more than the sake of a holiday. Almost no other time is this kind of apathy practiced, but for those few days out of the year it’s such a beautiful thing to see people look at each other with such innocence in the face of all potential prior ills. However, before tonight I’d never found a film that properly represents this wonderful aspect of the holiday season. This constantly charming film fills that void in such a moving & emotional way that I couldn’t help but smile with satisfaction, knowing I now have a piece of art in my life that represents one of my favorite aspects of the season. I could go on and on about the technical aspects of the film (this is one of my favorite pairs of lead performances ever!), and maybe later I’ll do that, but for now I just want to sit back and appreciate this endlessly special film. Forever thankful to Preston Sturges❤️",4.0

"Very sweet, going-home-for-christmas movie with a twist. Fred MacMurray plays a hard-working, well-off lawyer, who brings home p(r)etty thief, played by Barbara Stanwyck.
It fails with its attempts at humor, but wins you over with heartwarm, feel-good sensations; and may leave you teary-eyed.
Stanwyck's jewelry theft is not frowned upon by the film; actually it's quite sympathetic to her, as her actions are traced back to a dysfunctional childhood. Quite a refreshing, nuanced portrayal of crime for a movie granted the Hay's Code seal of approval.
Unfortunately, the ending is totally in line with the Production Code; namely her court confession, literally saying she deserves to be punished. You'd think she was quoting a Hay's Office moral clause verbatum.
The romance between the two blossoms while visiting MacMurray's family (God, are his relatives cute and wholesome!). Just when everything appears to be harmonious, a forced conflict intrudes, related to MacMurray's career ambitions. We didn't really need that.
MacMurray is so-so. He plays as if he's totally unaffected by everything, constantly responding with an ironic smirk, even in most inappropriate situations. Stanwyck is just perfect and effortlessly outshines everyone.",3.5

"I like this movie more each time I watch it. It’s so lovely to watch Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck fall in love slowly, they have outstanding chemistry from the beginning and it’s the regard and love you can feel growing throughout the film. Stanwyck in particular is in top form, every choice she makes is perfect (and of course she looks absolutely gorgeous).
I don’t remember catching the two egg money stories the first time around, how those short little stories can explain why these two turned onto the life paths they’re on. Obvious maybe, but I thought it was a lovely touch. A better ending would be Fred MacMurray using his dirty legal tricks to get Barbara Stanwyck acquitted and they get married immediately. What we could’ve had if not for Joseph Breen!

"My first time watching this romantic comedy, set during Christmas season. I think the emphasis is on the budding romance between Fred and Stanny, more than the holidays, but it’s a pleasant sentimental backdrop. Stanwyck looks positively stunning and I fell in love with her too. There’s some gentle laughs throughout and the ending is heartbreaking and slightly ambiguous.",3.5
"The TCM stream I saw could really use a restoration, but it was watchable enough. It’s a really sweet and well made movie. Not as Christmassy as I hoped, but still has the sweet redeeming feels you’d like in a Christmas movie. It’s a surprise courtroom drama too, which is fun.",3.5
"If your looking for some MacMurray and Stanwyck without the murder, then you’ll love this. Brought together in a film that moderately mirrors the feeling of a extended family Christmas. Except this time you have some charm. Let alone you get a caring romance that culminates at a flawless scene at Niagara Falls. A film that has nothing missing except any scene with Fred MacMurray smoking. Nonetheless, it is charming, sweet, and worthy enough to be a movie played in the background.",3.5
"A woman with a track record for stealing gets caught trying to pawn a stolen bracelet. Her theatrical lawyer nearly has the jury sold on a wacky story about her being hypnotized into the crime, but the prosecutor used the defense’s closing argument to open the case back up to investigate the hypnotism charge, and a continuance is granted. But the prosecutor immediately feels guilty when he realizes she will spend Christmas in jail…so he has her bailed out and when he discovers she comes from a town in Indiana near his own hometown, he ends up taking her to his family’s Christmas…and they unwittingly fall for each other in the process. 
This is a classic old school Hollywood movie. The love may be improbable, the circumstances unlikely, but the heart in the movie makes you root for the romance to succeed, even if when Christmas is over he is going to have to do his job and try and put her in jail. I enjoyed the hell out of it. There is something about the Golden Age of Hollywood that just warms my heart. 
Stanwyck and MacMurray are likable, and the film is wonderfully written by Preston Sturges, whi has been on my radar for sometime as someone I needed to see the films of. He didn’t direct this one, in fact it is one of the last films he wrote that he did not direct, but if this script is the kind of films I can look forward to, I am bound to love his work.",4.0

MY REVIEW - A Christmas Time and Also New Year's Romance film and what makes this film work is the great chemistry between the 2 Leads, as they slowly fall in love with each other as her trial looms.

It doesn’t kick so hard until the arrival at Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson’s house 45 minutes in, but it’s so good at setting up a powerful force field of home/family issues that the sleight-of-hand of Stanwyck’s reform seems almost plausible, happening as it does in the background. There’s a direct, solemn/sad emotionality in the film that doesn’t seem like Sturges. The script is brilliant though, full of slight smart digressions that establish and deepen the characters, so that no one seems a mere repository of the film’s (considerable) wit. Just wonderful.",5.0

Tricky to categorize, it's not a screwball comedy. It has comedy, it has romance, and it has drama. What it has mostly is heartwarming romance and melodrama during the second half where things really ratchet up emotionally.
Stanwyck and MacMurray do a great job here. It's there show all the way through. What really sells the movie is the final third, when the two of them reach MacMurray's family home. The supporting work by Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson are absolute perfection. You believe Stanwyck's transformation completely here, and the film reaches emotional depth you didn't think possible earlier.

My favorite Christmas movie. I suspect it intentionally gets forgotten at times because of the more famous Stanwyck/MacMurray pairing in Double Indemnity.,5.0
"Four years before making Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray filmed this enjoyable romantic comedy, directed by Mitchell Leisen from a Preston Sturges script. The story is far-fetched – lawyer MacMurray prosecutes shoplifter Stanwyck, feels bad about leaving her in jail for the holidays and bails her out, only to be stuck with her on a Christmas trip back home, and you know they will fall in love. Stanwyck is wonderful as always; some of the best moments in the film are when she doesn’t say a word but expresses a range of emotions with her face. MacMurray is solid as the decent guy trying to do the decent thing. Sturges was unhappy with the film because they cut some of MacMurray’s speeches to make him more laconic, and that convinced him to direct his own scripts, so there is a second reason to celebrate this film.",4.0
"Spotted in a 'best Christmas films' list, even though Christmas features mainly (and correctly) as an administrative nuisance and an excuse for a road trip.
It's a smart movie. Psychological/emotional acting is remarkably good while staying buttoned-down in a 1940s way, and it doesn't cop out of some difficult decisions. Barbara Stanwyck smoulders like a goddess and has some magnificent outfits.

"As always, Barbara Stanwyck was just beyond enchanting in this. She and MacMurray have their fantastic chemistry that would carry over into Double Indemnity four years later. It’s odd that I had seen the made-for-TV Christmas movie remake of this (“Undercover Christmas”) that started Jami Gertz as the Stanwyck character before seeing the original. The only negative about this one is the unfortunate and racist characterization of MacMurray’s Black butler at the beginning of the film, a problem that plagues countless films of the time. Thankfully that is just an issue for the first couple scenes. Sterling Holloway was a hoot in this, as well.",4.0

the moral conclusion of this otherwise potentially timeless story is BUNK.  The whole movie toys with the eroticism of moral ambiguity and subjectivity and then throws it all away for Hayes Code style Ethics.

She attempts to show appreciation for the compassion she receives but her eyes give away how undeserving she feels and how painful it is to be reminded of what she never had, and it’s so bittersweet.

I fell in love with this last year, and as with any movie that’s ten out of five stars to me, I have so much trouble expressing those feelings. It’s why my 'reviews' are often lists.
With pathos and shenanigans, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, and the age old movie debate of right vs wrong this movie traverses it’s subject with a canny smoothness that couldn’t be guessed at in the tug of war I outlined. My one very small dislike, in a movie that was allegedly cut down by the director (Mitchell Leisen) to the ire of the writer (Preston Sturgess), is that it didn’t judiciously choose Stanwyck's more emotional scenes. She cries about three too many times, is what I’m saying.
But more than all that, there’s a grace in the brief visit home that's enough to remind one of the small kindnesses that are needed by everyone.",5.0

"Ever so slightly a Christmas movie, but it doesn't much matter as I'll watch Stanwyck in anything at this point. She is on trial for stealing a bracelet and MacMurray is the prosecutor. After he figures a way to postpone the trial until after Christmas, he bails her out and while she was supposed to be released, the bail bondsman brings her to MacMurray's house, they go out for dancing & dinner, and he eventually invites her to meet his family after they realize they both grew up in the same state, in what are likely nearby towns. You can probably guess where it goes from there, though the ending will surprise.

"Sturges’ immense capability for feel-good sweetness pours off the page of his script here. Four years before MacMurray/Stanwyck dazzled in Double Indemnity, they consume the screen with a wholesome,star-crossed lovers tale. The film is beautifully mounted, with unobtrusive but elegant camera work and a fine touch of editing from Doane Harrison (most beautifully the cross fades of Aunt Emma cutting through ribbon and pulling back newspaper as she looks through her old wedding invitations and gown). It adds so much depth to the concept of valuing shared love above all. The entire sequence with John’s family is some of the most heartwarming you’ll see.",0.0

"Four years before their legendary pairing in ""Double Indemnity,"" Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray teamed up for the first time in ""Remember the Night."" Written (but not directed) by Preston Sturges, it features many of the trademarks he'd come to be known for - quick banter, sizzling chemistry, and a skillful mixture of comedy, drama, and romance.
The premise: It's Christmastime, Stanwyck is in court for shoplifting, and MacMurray is the lawyer opposing her. He realizes the jury is much more sympathetic during the holidays and likely to acquit her, so he convinces the judge to continue the case after the new year. That means Stanwyck will spend the holidays in jail. The sympathetic MacMurray calls in a favor and bails her out. As far as ""meet-cutes"" go, this is a pretty good one. One thing leads to another, and they end up on a road trip together to meet her family and then his. But it's strictly platonic, of course. Or is it? Of course it isn't!
Don't go into this expecting ""Double Indemnity"" - that is an all-time revered classic - but this is an enjoyable holiday romp featuring two of the era's most likable stars.
RACISM WARNING: African-American actor, the dubiously named Snowflake (real name Fred Toones, who you may remember from Sturges's ""The Palm Beach Story""), shows up here acting mentally challenged - simply because he's black. Terrible! There is also a vile joke about Chinese people eating dogs, which is an old chestnut that's unfortunately still repeated today. This type of outdated ""humor"" sometimes makes an unwelcome appearance in older movies - and Sturges was especially guilty of it.",0.0
"""I suppose you do this with all the lady prisoners""
Classic screwball comedy full of situational silliness & a large dose of sentimentality. Part courtroom drama, part road trip movie, & part holiday special... and somehow it all still works.

"Charming, romantic, highly enjoyable. Although the racial stereotype stuff was a bit unsettling.",3.5
"Props for not having the exact ending you would expect for this kind of film, though I suspect that the Code had something to do with that. This movie ultimately does something similar to another film from the ‘40s called Moonrise, directed by Frank Borzage, in that it calls on people who have committed crimes to turn themselves in. Not sure if this was a message that the U.S. government asked Hollywood to actively inject into their films around this time to make law enforcement officials’ jobs easier or what. Moonrise is ultimately the stranger, more interesting of the two and, as an added bonus, its single African American character is at least treated with respect by the filmmakers, unlike in this film. Barbara Stanwyck sure knows how to say “good night” though.",3.0

"I knew this would be a nice time at least for the fact that this has Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray as the two leads, plus the fact that it was written by Preston Sturges.

It's all around a solid screwball comedy, the only real issue being one extremely dated and uncomfortable side character, but that is thankfully a small issue within the larger story.",3.5

"Has elements of a winner (Stanwyck and a solid romantic comedy premise) but dragged down by some extremely dull moralizing.

"Leisen, it seems, is in the nebulous zone that Hoberman dubbed something like ‘not quite an auteur but more than a hack’*, which feels almost right but doesn’t quite explain the grace and thematic thoroughfare of his pictures. His directorial choices aren’t showy but his attention to even the smallest background detail is extraordinary (he was both an art director and costume designer before he became a director), he elicited mostly excellent performances (especially from his women), and his best pictures explored class conflict, gender, pretense, conformity. (Yes, he was gay, and as out as one could be and still work in Hollywood.)
Take, for example, Mrs. Sargent and Aunt Emma in this film; sure, the script probably says that they’re blood or in-law sisters, but from the moment they appear onscreen it’s obvious to modern eyes that they’re a couple. A loving, kind, awesome couple. 
But…
Wilder and Sturges had legitimate gripes with what he did to their scripts; while I’m fairly certain Sturges would’ve also had Lee Leander’s (great name!) attorney deliver most of his bullshit summation in a single take, it definitely would’ve played better if Sturges was behind the camera. 
*Wish I remembered the exact line and who exactly he was referring to - I think it was Sonnenfeld?",3.5
"Watching the goddess Stanwyck crush as usual. The first half of this movie plays out like the Sturges screenplay but once Stan and MacMurray get to her mom’s house that tone totally shifts and onward to his family’s house. Cinematography and contrast lighting were awesome. Never been a MacMurray fan and he’s always just reading lines especially at the Niagara Falls scene. Stanwyck’s eyes from her piano scene through the rest of the movie were filled with emotion and on verge of tears until that breakdown at the end. 
They used to make movies just based on any premise? A DA takes a parolee to his family Christmas? How does someone even come up with that?",3.5

"Four years before Double Indemnity, Stanwyck and MacMurray star together in a fairly lightweight romcom that's nonetheless essential viewing for Stanwyck fans and probably not for much else (but don't get me wrong, that's enough).
Stanwyck is one of the all time great actors and all one needs to do is juxtapose this with Indemnity to see her range.
MacMurray is... well... less so. He's doing the same thing here that he does in Indemnity and the film does not call for it. To be honest I never had a read on his character. Was he a cynic or a good Midwestern boy? Most of the time, what he was, was a big ol' jerk. It's not hard to notice that Stanwyck falls in love with his lifestyle more than his personality.

"The premise is clunky. The leads have no chemistry. The racier jokes and schmaltizer scenes sit uneasily together, neither getting much breathing room. Anyone (like me) who came here because it's a Preston Sturges-penned comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck will be disappointed to find that this is closer in genre to Hallmark Christmas movies (apparently the story was borrowed for one); but if Sturges' bursts of humor and Stanwyck's bursts of wit feel stifled, it may also be that neither could navigate the movie's different tones and needs as easily as they would do the next time they worked together, on The Lady Eve. Point being, know what to expect. Know that you'll get kind of stiffed on the ending, too. The lighting is nice though - that's one thing Sturges never did better.",3.0
A really great script by Preston Sturges and superior acting from Stanwyck and MacMurray lift this film to the top of the heap. Watch it and feel all warm and cuddly.,4.0
"Alarming – if only for a second - to see MacMurray and Stanwyck together, as I naturally pair them in my mind as rotten insurance fraudsters first, and as actors who collectively starred in hundreds of movies and television shows *second*. Both are caught up in Sturges’ updraft, a wonderfully perilous journey through morality and slow-cooking romance, and later, sacrifice. Leisen’s softening of Sturges’ madcap bent works wonders; I marveled at the balancing act between comic set-pieces and heartbreaking sincerity. Truly, the highs and lows are (sometimes) unbearably polar in their opposition: Stanwyck confirming her mother’s steadfast disdain for her before arriving at MacMurray’s home of origin, a home whose picturesque family, location and tone are located at the intersection of sweet and warm. (Spoilering: And then, in reverse, the downright moving litigious action MacMurray takes to get Stanwyck cleared of her legal trouble and then her insistence that their connection be forged in the pureness of honesty subsequent only to her having faced responsibility for her crime.) 
This is first rate, a gem, and I expect to be watching it again around holiday time.",4.0

Giving this the extra half star for Stanwyck. Impossible to be stony to her wiles no matter how generic the script. Another strike against this movie is it has no Sturges regulars, those bunch of rowdy rascals that I dearly love.
The black help is troublingly dopey.",3.5
"S'good, but the previous two in our Leisen season put it slightly in the shade. Fred MacMurray is the usual treat, and in this outing the closest to leading-man-who-sweeps-ladies-off-their-feet role that I've seen. Miss Stanwyck also delivers ice and melt in what seems like just the right proportions. But some plot implausibility was just a bit too stretching, and some of the comedy scenes -the milking bit for instance - seemed awkward rather than cute. However, the Code's constraints on the ending are overcome in a manner that satisfied this viewer.",3.0

Þetta var náttúrulega hittarinn sem gerði honum kleift að verða writer/director.

"Consider a portion of those four stars conditional, as some parts of this feel a little too Christmas-movie to watch outside of December, but overall it’s got a lot of good bits. Barbara Stanwyck’s stealing bracelets and stealing hearts, Fred MacMurray is the D.A. that brings her home to meet his parents. We meet Stanwyck’s mother, too, and she’s awful, and maybe that’s a type of scene in movies that always works for me: I loved it in Minnie And Moskowitz, and it’s a major part of Little Murders. Meeting people’s horrible parents is a big part of being in love! This movie sort of builds most of its story out of Stanwyck’s finding MacMurray’s family to be lovely, but that’s not even home to the best bits here: There’s a part where the two of them get citizen’s arrested by a gun-toting farmer that’s great, and then there’s a pretty incredible ending.",4.0
"Mixed feelings. A la fois chiant et émouvant. L’aspect comédie lors du Road-trip ne fonctionne pas malgré le script de Sturges. De même, le contraste entre les deux familles, l’une froide et aigrie, l’autre chaleureuse et aimante est trop appuyé.

The Bad: It's a great movie marred by MacMurry's butler whom is portrayed in a way that I thought (hoped maybe) would have been out of place by 1940 but I guess not. Even the credits are out of line on this front, crediting Fred Toones as just ""Snowflake,"" like he was a dog or a cow or something.",3.5

"I was originally going to start off my review by saying ""I think romantic comedies set around Christmas that came out in 1940 are my new favourite genre of film"" but considering I didn't love this, I opted not to. But hey, this is still pretty damn good, though it would be pretty hard for a film starring Barbara Stanwyck & Fred MacMurray that was written by Preston Sturges to not be. I ultimately just wish there was a bit more plot, meaning that the relationship between Stanwyck and MacMurray could've been developed a little bit more, in my opinion. Still charming, still a lot of fun.",3.5
"An uncommon Christmas romance written by the incomparable Preston Sturges. Sturges is famous for his great romantic comedies, here he tones down the comedy, and delivers a smart touching screenplay.

"75/100
Calling it: Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together are one of our greatest screen couples. Here it’s not the savage seduction of Double Indemnity, nor the mature melodrama we saw in There’s Always Tomorrow, but a third mode – I suppose you would call it a romantic comedy, though the mode is really only comic for the first half hour or so, and built into the slightly contrived bunking opposites setup. But that arrangement doesn’t generate the usual steamy tensions and flirtatious sparring - instead the lightness disguises a layered drama full of hard edges and outright cruelty. The dynamic between them has the same basic shape as always - he's a domesticated professional, perpetually befuddled but drawn towards Stanwyck's hungry outsider, lonely and a little desperate - but Remember the Night puts them on a journey of dawning possibility and growing empathy. Sturges and Leisen put a lot of work into nailing the warm and tender scenes, both between the couple and (especially) in MacMurray's hometown, and all of the genuine decency is both moving and really lets the filmmakers twist the knife when they need to - Stanwyck is twice rejected by families in deeply painful ways, both entirely unresolved by the film's ending. It's terrific, tonally fluid plotting, culminating in the kind of obvious home-run climax (MacMurray throwing the case by purposely being too cruel to win it, with Stanwyck unaware until partway through) followed by a more grounded bittersweet final moment. Beautifully calculated throughout - good things do exist, but compromise is everywhere, people don't easily open their hearts, but love can and often does win out.
Other thoughts:
- I gave measured praise to Sturges for allowing black performers to be somewhat funny within but not because of stereotypes in The Palm Beach Story; that is decidedly not the case here, with a reasonably unobtrusive but still embarrassing and crudely treated figure played by poor Fred Toones.
- Looks like there's one more Stanwyck/MacMurray partnering out there: a 3D western called The Moonlighter that has no reputation I'm aware of. Something tells me it won't be as rich as their big three, but I'll seek it out anyway.",4.0

"I think films like this prove that the strengths and weaknesses of certain genres can be a fairly timeless constant. There are the hiccups more befitting of the era, like problematic depictions of minorities and an occasionally indulgent hokey tone, but honestly the majority of this films are highs and lows you see in a lot of romantic comedies. Endearing, if generally unrealistic and rushed romance at forefront, with a foot dipped into a more dramatic pool of water, yet still too shallow to really prove anything substantial for the plot. The comedic aspect kind of swings back and forth on this one. The beginning of the film is hilarious, with biting dialogue at every moment, but as it gets further into slapstick territory, it never really comes back to its Zen state of humor for more than a brief, intermittent one-liner. The way the plot progresses near the end is more meaningful than the average romantic comedy, but at the same time, predictable. Fairly sweet, but at the same time, I don't think I'm the intended demographic.",3.0

"Some first impressions:
_ The same way Lee says she wants to stay at Jack's apartment when he shows no intention of keeping her there, Lee decides to confess her crime precisely when Jack starts secretly acting in favor of her acquittal, in other words:
the only way conceived by Lee to achieve her freedom, the only way she would no longer be indebted to Jack (since he had not only paid her bail but also was about to be responsible for her acquittal) would be subverting the role of justice (as performed by its male commissioners): making bourgeois law operate out of the way chosen by those used to controlling it, that is: making it fail, at least for once, to serve as an instrument of legitimization of male/class control over her destiny. It is as if Lee was unconsciously saying: “I am going to jail and I may marry you, but I hope one day I get out of it owing my semi-freedom to none of you moral/law-enforcers”.
_ Maybe the “happy ending” here is achieved not by the fact that the couple finally acknowledges their mutual love and promises to get married, but rather by the fact that the social fiction of law and order can still go on unharmed despite its obvious gaps and contradictions;

___________________________________

algumas primeiras impressões:
_ da mesma forma que Lee diz querer permanecer no apartamento só porque Jack disse não ter qualquer intenção de que ela permaneça ali, Lee decide confessar seu crime justamente quando Jack demonstra agir disfarçadamente em favor de sua absolvição, ou seja, a única forma imaginada por Lee de alcançar a liberdade, por meio da qual ela deixaria de estar em dívida com Jack (já que ele não só havia pago sua fiança como também seria responsável por sua absolvição) seria subvertendo o papel da justiça (embora esta subversão não deixasse de possuir um gosto amargo): fazendo a lei burguesa operar fora do caminho escolhido por aqueles que sempre a controlam, deixando, ao menos por um momento, de servir como instrumento de legitimação do controle masculino/classista sobre seu destino – é como se inconscientemente ela dissesse: “Eu vou presa mas espero sair da cadeia sem dever esta minha semi-liberdade a nenhum de vocês”.
_ Talvez o “final feliz” aqui seja alcançado não tanto pelo fato do casal se dizer apaixonado (com promessa de casamento, etc.), mas sim pelo fato de que, ao fim do filme, toda a ficção social da lei e da ordem ainda conseguiria seguir ilesa apesar de suas imensas lacunas e contradições;",0.0
"Plenty of weird “punish me daddy!” guilt about a little old shoplifter (a victimless crime), and a healthy dose of racism and anti-semitism, but Barbara Stanwyck brings unreal depth and emotion, and it’s fun to see Fred MacMurray play an asshole who catches intense feelings for Ms Stanwyck. Who can blame him, right?",3.5
"Minus the racist remnant of the era—a portrayal of a black servant so outdated that every line he spoke repelled me away from the film—it’s one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen. Something about the holidays that causes the resurfacing of repressed memories and feelings, and if lucky, makes possible a catharsis through confrontation. (Though I must say, I can’t help but be unsatisfied by the succinct manner in which their visit to her mother’s summarizes her character, though the subsequent deed of inviting her to his home makes for such a sweet gesture—perhaps the sweetest even, in a film filled with many such gestures—that I more or less don’t mind.) Somewhat rocky early on, as it starts off rather odd with how abrupt it is, then settles—though not before a longwinded court scene—into a romance at its first stage(perfect!) then rocky again once they take their road trip when they start driving through random forests and hills and fences, sleeping in the middle of nowhere and milking random cows, etc. Whatever effect is intended with the consequent escape—whether it’s thrills or character-motivated—doesn’t really land or register for me. (Though it's functional too I guess, as it serves as a direct precursor to their later traverse through Canada.) It picks up again once they get to his home though, making for a picture filled with warmth and embrace and every jolly quality that you could ever hope for from this period of the year. Sort of conflicted by the mother's—gently delivered—wary addressing of the quixotic situation going on though, as it ostensibly comes to inform much of the critical choices made in the last portion of the film. I very much like the choices and the manner in which the finale plays out, but it would resonate more if it was a self-arrived destination. Of course, it’s possible that Lee would have come to her senses on her own, but as it stands, mama Sargent points us towards that inevitable direction a little too hard. In any case, this is truly as tender and—at the risk of overusing this word—sweet as any film could be without becoming saccharine. It had a great effect on me, though my response was unfortunately dampened heavily by other factors (some actually invoked by it, others mostly external) and their consequent long pauses.",3.5

"I honestly don't know if I've ever seen Barbara Stanwyck be so charming. Granted, I haven't seen a ton of her films, but usually she's cold and calculating. She's still a tough lady in this one, but I can totally understand Fred MacMurray falling for her, as opposed to in Double Indemnity where I just wanted to slap some sense into him.
Anyway, this is the last film that Preston Sturges wrote without also directing and it's just as witty as his other great films. Maybe more sentimental than he usually allowed later on, but still so good. It's definitely a lesser known Christmas movie, but it really needs to be rediscovered. It's just so good.",5.0

Well, better to say it incorporates Christmas tradition into the film, but is only about Christmas as much as it can be used to depict the familial love of family the protagonist has experienced all his love in shown contrast to the family dysfunction and misery the protagoness comes from.
This romantic comedy is the first pairing of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, before they went full and famously breaking bad, in the classic ""Double Indemnity."" But here, Babrbara Stanwyck is only in it for petty larceny, not murder. Busted, she falls in love with the Prosecutor of her trial case, whilst on a road trip adventure where she comes to the farm of the aforementioned loving family.

"Beautifully occupies space between Christmas and the new year, which incidentally marks the one time I ever smoked heroin; however, that lived experience of mine just can’t stack up to this genre bending Preston Sturges invention. Opens with cum tribute ready shot of a foot mannequin with lacquered nails and anklet. Court room scenes bookend the movie, in the first one there’s a gag of hammy defense lawyer claiming his client was under hypnosis, kinda funny but runs too long. Rufus the black valet is mistreated at every turn, and that turns my stomach, but he’s given a hype malaprop. This is all gristle, the real movie starts when they make it to Indiana. On the 24th Stanwyck and her estranged mom fail to make nice—love one dimensionally evil mom’s ghostly silhouette listening in as daughter sobs out in the cold. On the 1st in a town 50 miles away Stanwyck and her brand-new momma have a difficult but kind of lovely talk, best scene in the picture, think I teared up. Stanwyck didn’t make one false move during the shoot, Wikipedia fact. Oh there’s also the corset scene with the aunt, that’s another high point. Stanwyck’s face during the Christmas Eve piano performance; panning through the barnyard during the nye hoedown; Niagara Falls, calm before the storm. So, like I’ve been saying, works primarily as terrific showcase for Stanwyck’s abilities and warm salute to that last week of the holidays spent in a flyover boomtown with sense of community.

It was hard for me to root for the leads, due to my hatred of thieves, no matter what their motivations.

"This summer I am once again presenting on behalf of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the Hudson Institute in Washington a series of six movies. The general theme this year is Middle America and the Movies. The films are being shown at the Hudson Institute, 1015 15th Street N.W., Suite 600, and you can go to the Hudson website for details or to register to attend. The series began on Tuesday, June 10th with a screening of Remember the Night of 1940, written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen. It stars Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, Along with Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway. Before showing the film, I spoke for a few minutes about it as follows.
Welcome to the Eighth Annual Summer Film Series, jointly sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the Hudson Institute, which we thank for the use of these facilities. My name is James Bowman, and I am the film critic for The American Spectator, as well as a Resident Scholar at EPPC. I would ask you, before we start, to turn off your phones’ ringers and any other electronic noise-makers you may have. I’m going to say a few words about tonight’s movie before we see it, and afterwards, as those of you know who have been to the past years’ series, I invite you to stay around, if you can, for a brief discussion of what we have seen.
This year’s theme is Middle America and the Movies, and the first of the six films which we are to see is Remember the Night, starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, four years before they starred together in Double Indemnity of 1944, the classic Billy Wilder picture that we saw in our third series, in 2009, on ""Crime and Punishment."" This one is directed by Mitchell Leisen, who was a Michigan native and a well-known director in Hollywood for nearly 40 years, though he is all but forgotten now. Better known is the screenwriter, Preston Sturges, himself someone who would go on to become one of the great directors of the Golden Age of American movies. If he had directed his own script he would surely have done things differently, though not necessarily better.
He is also, probably, the one we ought to blame for several instances of egregious political incorrectness which require me to make, by way of preface to tonight’s screening, what certain highly sensitive and politically-trained academics these days are said to call ""trigger warnings."" Accordingly, I am grieved to report that this film includes an appalling racial stereotype by a black actor calling himself ""Snowflake"" (real name, Fred Toones) who got his start shining shoes on the lot of Republic Pictures and became one of the busiest character actors in Hollywood, appearing in over 200 films between 1928 and 1951. And then there is the hasty and gabbled repetition by Fred MacMurray of an old rhyme that, in his version, goes:
A woman, a dog and a hick’ry tree
The better you beat ‘em, the better they be.
Pretty clearly he is intending to make a joke here, but I don’t need to tell you that it is the kind of joke decent people no longer make. I hope you can find it in your hearts to overlook such examples of chronological ignorance for the sake of the many good things about Remember the Night.
The story, briefly, is one of an attractive woman shoplifter, played by Barbara Stanwyck, whose name is Anna Rose Malone but who is rather oddly known throughout the movie by her alias of Lee Leander. She is put on trial in New York just before Christmas. John Sargent, the assistant D.A. played by Fred MacMurray, knowing the difficulty of getting a conviction at Christmas-time, especially against a woman, contrives to get a continuance until after the new year. Feeling guilty that he has condemned Lee to spend Christmas in jail, he then bails her out, only to find her, through a series of improbable misadventures left in his charge as he is about to drive home to spend Christmas with his mother and aunt in Indiana. Even more implausibly, he decides to take her with him. I don’t think it can possibly count as a spoiler to tell you what is clearly signaled almost from the start, namely that the two are destined to fall in love.
As an example of ""Middle America and the Movies,"" the first thing we ought to notice about this movie is that it is unabashedly a look at Middle America as seen from the coast, and in particular the East Coast. And, in even more particular, from Manhattan — though it is the Manhattan of 1940 and, therefore, it no longer exists, which I would like to think is not true, or not entirely true, of the movie’s sympathetic version of Middle America. At least the latter is not an idealized portrait. We are given three separate glimpses of the country west of the Hudson, two decidedly unflattering while the third is a mixture of good and not-so-good with a tilt of the balance to the former. Though the movie is about goodness and where goodness comes from, it is under no illusions that people, even midwesterners, can be easily classified as merely good or bad.
The first of the movie’s three different takes on the American heartland begins in the cow pasture of a Pennsylvania farmer, where the car containing the prosecutor and the thief crashes through a road-closed barrier and the couple are forced to spend their first night together uncomfortably dozing in the front seat. Then, when the shotgun wielding farmer puts them under citizen’s arrest, it shifts to the home office of a justice of the peace in a nearby small town. ""Looks like business, Clyde,"" says the wife of this local magistrate as she sees our two heroes, covered by the farmer’s shotgun, being marched up to her house.
""With that new detour he gets them all the time,"" says the JP, who is presumably in cahoots with the farmer in fleecing passing motorists from elsewhere.
Here the D.A. and the shoplifter become minor law-breakers together, and we are encouraged to take their side against corrupt authority. We also admire the shoplifter’s clever trick to cover their escape — one which, we may suspect, she has found occasion to use before in perhaps less propitious circumstances. John Sargent doesn’t even know it’s a trick until later, when he disapproves. We are reminded of Lee’s earlier wondering observation: ""You’re so sweet. You never think of anything that’s wrong."" Though that doesn’t remain true for very much longer.
The movie’s second take on the heartland comes at the gloomy home of Lee Leander’s gloomy mother, played by Georgia Caine, a religious fanatic who long ago disowned her daughter for some childish misbehavior and thus (so, I think, we are meant to understand) launched her on her life of crime. It’s surely significant in a comedy that the first item in the mother’s bill of indictment against the daughter — after ""she’s just like her father, she is"" — is that she was ""always laughing at serious things, she was."" So, I can tell you, was Preston Sturges and the audiences that flocked to his movies.
Lee’s mother’s house looks a bit like Edward Hopper’s famous ""House by the Railroad"" of 1925, and we hear a train whistle as she and Sargent approach it. Hopper’s painting is said to have been the model for the Bates Motel in Hitchcock’s Psycho and, as it does there, its middle class Victorian domestic architecture turns it into a ready-made symbol for what at the time would have been called Victorian Puritanism — or the kind of stern moralism that had gone out of fashion at least two decades earlier. Hollywood at this time, as we’ll see even more clearly in King’s Row next week, was already coming under the influence of what the journalist and commentator Anthony Daniels calls ""the hydraulic theory"" of human sexuality, derived from popular Freudianism, namely that sexual ""repression"" is the worst thing in the world for human happiness and well-being and the source of many if not all of our social problems.
In Remember the Night, however, the authors’ attitude towards the Victorians was more nuanced, as we shall see. The house serves as the backdrop to John Sargent’s moment of revelation, when he sees in Lee’s bitter and loveless home, maybe more clearly than she does, the point at which their two experiences of Indiana and Middle America diverged and the germ of her criminal career. It also provides the occasion for him to show his sympathy for her not only in their first embrace, at this point a non-sexual one, but also by inviting her to spend Christmas at his own Indiana home, which is much more like the ""vision fair I see"" that ""casts a spell o’er me"" from the song, ""My Indiana Home,"" which is the movie’s musical leitmotif.
The warm, loving home kept by Sargent’s mother, played by Beulah Bondi, and Aunt Emma, played by Elizabeth Patterson, thus becomes the movie’s third and most attractive scene of midwestern life and values. There we learn that there was in John Sargent’s younger days a parallel crime to that committed by Lee Leander in hers but that, unlike her, he was allowed by his female parent’s love and forbearance to atone for it. ""You made me understand,"" says to her now, referring to the development of his mature moral sense.
""No, dear,"" she replies. ""It was love that made you understand."" So it is also natural for her to believe, when she is told of Lee’s rap sheet, that ""she probably didn’t get enough love as a child"" — something that the earlier stopover at the Hopper house has made us, too, predisposed to believe. As a general explanation for criminal behavior this would, of course, have seemed simplistic even at the time, though in the mouth of this Indiana farmer’s widow, about another Indiana farmer’s daughter, it seems to make perfect sense, as the film is so constructed to make it seem so. I think we should allow ourselves to accept that the warm welcome Lee receives and her experience of the gently comic goings on in and around the Sargent house at Christmas-time should work some kind of moral transformation in a woman who hasn’t had much love or luck in life. At any rate, it’s not the most implausible thing about this picture.
As in Fargo, which we also saw in the ""Crime and Punishment"" series five years ago, the transparent decency of the good characters here has the effect of isolating and overwhelming the badness of the bad. Also as in Fargo, the power of goodness appears to rise out of the country itself, or that slice of Middle America — there, Minnesota, here, Indiana — which the art of the film-makers has caused to be ever present before our eyes and thoughts as the backdrop to its human story. The ""love"" which is supposed to have a transforming effect on Lee is thus not merely that of Sargent’s mother and aunt, but that of a whole culture which has put the family at the center of life even if, in such cases as that of Lee’s mother, it doesn’t always work out that way. This almost imperceptible generalization from one family to a recognizable way of living also helps us to believe in the morally healing touch of Middle America itself on someone who really didn’t get enough love as a child.
That third idea of Middle America is meant to stand for the rest, it seems to me, but the first and second remain with us and remind us of the dark side — Remember the Night! — which was to become more prominent in later films. It’s a rather facile moral and psychological lesson for us, but rendered with humor and with such a light touch that we hardly notice the taste of the medicine going down. To me it is also interesting that this moral drama plays itself out at the same time as, but often in contrast to, the sexual dance between the two main characters. Just as the architecture of the Victorian house suggests an older, rather forbidding attitude to moral rectitude, so does the Victorian corset into which Lee Leander is painfully laced for the barn dance suggest a deliberately archaic, Victorian approach to relations between the sexes. Yet that, too, works a kind of magic, as both she and John Sargent have to put on the respective costumes of their grandparents in order to realize for the first time, and with the new year, that they are in love.
As one does in each of the next three movies in this year’s series, one has the impression here that the film-makers are looking back on a period thirty or forty years in the past as a touchstone or a model of what Americanness means in a time — as all times since have been — of rapid social and cultural change. The deliberately archaic context also has the effect, as their falling in love in New York presumably would not have done, of locking the two would-be lovers into a world where, in the words of the Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen song of a few years later, ""Love and Marriage/Go together like a horse and carriage."" Sargent’s suggestion after the dance that Lee come to his room for a smoke clearly stands for something else that New York women might do that Indiana women might not, and it is his mother’s reminder of what Sargent’s Indiana values of hard work and moral steadiness have done for him and, therefore, what he stands to lose by forgetting them, that persuades Lee not to go.
For her own chances of turning her life around depend on the same moral steadiness and are by this time beginning to seem real to her. We’ll see the more usual approach of the 1930s and 1940s to Victorian sexual customs in our next two movies, King’s Row and The Magnificent Ambersons, both of 1942 and both taking a less than benign view of the beliefs and customs of our ancestors. But here there almost seems to be the same kind of nostalgia for whalebone and silk hats that there is for the moonlight on the Wabash of ""My Indiana Home."" The Victorian parlor song sung by Sterling Holloway, ""When you come to the end of a perfect day,"" which had been immensely popular thirty years earlier, adds a touch of Victorian sentimentalism to the movie’s Victorian moralism, but I confess I find it charming. The sense of the family as the vehicle not only for rearing children with love but also for an essential continuity between the generations is what I think the movie is getting at here, though you may not agree.
For we are also made aware that things have already changed a lot since father courted mother in the cornfields of Indiana. Moral ambiguity abounds here, as it does in the big city, which makes the romantic dénouement by no means the sure thing that the Hollywood comic idiom of the period would seem to predict. One of my favorite parts of the picture comes near the beginning when Lee is brought up to Sargent’s apartment by the bail bondsman Fat Mike, played by Tom Kennedy. Fat Mike, ""because he’s got a mind like a sewer,"" as Sargent says, assumes that he must have expected a consideration for bailing out this pretty shoplifter, and so does she. The sparkling, Preston Sturges-penned dialogue between them as they sort out this misunderstanding is a delight. ""One of these days,"" says Lee in persona as one of the brassy dames of so many contemporary films, ""one of you boys is going to start one of these scenes differently and one of us girls is going to drop dead from surprise.""
But of course the ""scene"" does start differently, and it leads them both to some place which is — in the real world, at any rate, then as now — much more surprising than Lee can imagine. The slightly odd use of the word ""scene"" can also be taken together with several references to acting and the theatre as self-conscious pointers to the artifice of the movie scene’s construction. After Sargent at first offers to lend Lee his apartment when he goes home to Indiana for the holidays, she observes that ""it sounds like a play.""
""It sounds like a flop,"" says Sargent.
But by calling attention at this point to its own implausibility, the script helps us to forget just how much it, too, sounds like a play. My favorite line comes here, too, when Lee realizes that Sargent genuinely expects nothing in return for his generosity to her — which, as he later admits, is partly owing to guilt at the trick he has played on her lawyer to effect a conviction. ""Now,’ says Lee, ""there’s nothing as dangerous as a square shooter. If all men were like you, there wouldn’t be any nice girls left."" It’s a lovely paradox and also an indication that Lee, however improbably and whatever other wicked ways she has fallen into since coming to the big city, still considers herself — as does Sargent — to be a nice girl.
Of course the Hays office would have frowned on any suggestion that she could have been anything else, yet this is not the first or the last time in our experience of these old movies when we may suspect that the censor’s demands could, in some instances, have made them better than they would otherwise have been. Those of you who are able to make it to next week’s movie, King’s Row, will see an even clearer example of what I am talking about. Almost a decade before the Kinsey report, we can be pretty sure there was already a widespread awareness that the ostensible social and moral norms assumed by the censor were no longer normal, if they ever had been. But then and for some time yet to come the ordinary people for whom the movies of Hollywood’s Golden Age were intended, could still see the point of imposing a moral discipline on popular art, along with the expectation that sexual continence, in particular, should be treated as if it were still the norm — as it may even, once, actually have been. Long ago. In Indiana.

Gonna be my go-to Christmas movie,4.0
Remember the night is one of those classic 40’s movies about Christmas that never mentions Christmas too much. The idea of a felon falling in love with a lawyer isn’t explored too much and really works. The holidays provide a great environment for this old school romance to happen naturally and interestingly. What I mean is that the romance in this movie is almost as good as the writing. The writing really brings the movie together and keeps you moving forward. You never know where our characters will end up in the next scene but you know it’ll be fun. Don’t forget that Barbara Stanwyck was seemingly bred for romantic black and white lighting.,4.0
"Couldn't decide between a Mitchell Leisen or Preston Sturges film. Turned this on to see it was written by Sturges so problem solved. Despite having to watch it on a very standard definition presentation, this was a moving work from Leisen, Stanwyck and MacMurray. The ending particularly sank into a mire of uncertainty in the way I feel a lot of these older films didn't which was a welcome surprise.",4.0
"Comedy is an ephemeral art-form: most of it feels stale after ten years. Preston Sturges, however, cracks me up after eighty. I went on a Sturges splurge a while ago, having learned of his influence on John Swartzwelder, and thus many of The Simpsons' finest episodes. This led me to such joys as The Great McGinty, The Lady Eve and Unfaithfully Yours. I never got round to Remember the Night, which is weird, given I'm a Stanwyck Stan.
Turns out it's charming and delightful! The middle sags somewhat, and the character of the dim-witted black servant is tough, but the dynamic between Barbara and Fred is never less than compelling. Extra points for the ending, which resists rom-com wish-fulfilment.",4.0

Written by the legendary Preston Sturges, this romantic comedy is a smart, warm and funny festive joy that must stand as one of the most underrated Christmas movies of all time. The chemistry between the leads is wonderful. Stanwyck always rises to the occasion... Especially when the role demands hard edges and a hidden soft centre. Needless to say, she is terrific in this this. The direction is without fuss and the script is both charming without being mawkish and madcap without getting ludicrous. Plus it has Beulah Bondi playing MacMurray’s mother!

[blu-ray]
Never much of a Barbara Stanwyck fan, I think re-watching this moved me closer toward her camp. Her face really never stops emoting, even in - maybe especially in - her silent moments. Now I'm excited to see FORTY GUNS for the first time when it's released by Criterion later this month.
The idea of having to spend Christmas in jail seems like an old conceit, but I'm hard-pressed to think of a filmic example aside from the occasionally cinematic-sounding song by The Youngsters (here's a link to it on YouTube: youtu.be/cM38kN4AOys ) wherein they're pulled over for drunk driving, whereas Stanwyck faces time for shoplifting. MacMurray - the prosecuting attorney - has sympathy for her and takes her to his home for the holidays. His down-to-earth and charming-right-out-of-Norman-Rockwell family have a sobering effect on Stanwyck's character and - you guessed it - the two fall in love. The ending plot movement isn't 100% predictable, but it is emotional and affecting.
Preston Sturges wrote the screenplay, and his style is obvious, particularly in minor character quirks (I'm thinking of the defense attorney presenting an elaborate alibi in front of the jury that goes on f o r e v e r, and MacMurray's little brother's yodelling antics - these are stock Sturges characters, if ever there were some).

Barbara Stanwyck is stunning, and Fred MacMurray completely clicks with her. Each of the supporting actors (except Stering Holloway) is perfectly cast and adds something to the story. The conflicts and character arcs are on point. Yet despite this being a Christmas film, it doesn't have a happy ending.

Funny how Sturges can come up with such original premises, riddle his films with cliches, and still produce something affecting.

"A twin bill: Easy Living and Remember the Night, as part of Strictly Sturges at the Film Forum.
Easy Living is an absurd bit of fluff, but at the height of the second half of the Great Depression, the idea that a hard-working everyday gal (Jean Arthur) could have a mink coat thrown on top of her while riding the open upper deck of a city bus, be given a swank penthouse apartment (by Edward Arnold), and fall in love (with Ray Milland), might have seen like a great bit of escapism. At least it has a great cast.
Then again, screwball comedies of the 30s that I could watch again tomorrow are thin on the ground. It Happened One Night, yes, but My Man Goddfrey and Bringing Up Baby, no.
The 1940s have the 1930s beat here. Remember the Night, 1940, is a much better movie than Easy Living. His Girl Friday is 1940 and The Lady Eve is 1941; between the two of them they pretty much have the entire 1930s beat. Born Yesterday feels like a 30s movie, but it's 1950 (and adapted from a Garson Kanin play by Albert Mannheimer).
It's easy to forget that Remember the Night is a Christmas movie. Not only do Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck get together because he (as an assistant district attorney) doesn't want her (as a petty shoplifter, but a three-time loser at it) to have to spend the entire Christmas week or more in jail before her trial comes up, but when they return to their hometowns, it's the different ways in which Christmas is celebrated that highlights the differences between where they came from and who molded them.

"Stanwyck gives a marvellously chameleonic performance here, anchoring the character's changing personality which moves smoothly between the film's three acts without jumping jarringly between disparate moods. Stanwyck shades the character with a cunning intelligence which makes her behavior seem calculating at first before tapping into a deeper, emotional register to capitalize on the darker elements of tragedy the film brings to her backstory, ably laying the groundwork for a third act turn towards more traditionally sentimental, moralizing ground. Stanwyck is stunning in all the various forms of the character, from the lustrously sexy con-woman who shrewdly uses her sex appeal as a tool in getting ahead, to the unsympathetically frank street-wise petty criminal that openly admits her base motives to MacMurray's stodgy prosecutor, or the soft, vulnerable young woman at the heart of this jaded exterior who slowly falls in love with MacMurray and the promise of forgiveness and contentment he represents.
The film's slyly cynical first act is followed by a striking turn towards darker melodrama on the way towards the schmaltzy return-home stretch of the third act, but this turn towards the expected does not betray the more daring first third as it offers no easy escape for Stanwyck but simply provides an opportunity for slow, moral awakening and accepting her guilt.",3.0
