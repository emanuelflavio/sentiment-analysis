"What I love about this film is that Douglas Sirk, the man who was maybe best known for giving women a voice, telling their stories of quiet imprisonment in their 50s households, turns it all around here by introducing us to a man who's struggling with domesticity, and no, not in a ""oh gosh, I really gotta go out there and put my dick in something else"" kinda way, no, Sirk tells this story with the same sensitivity he applied to his ""women's pictures"", and I feel that's what makes this movie unusual and daring. Fred MacMurray's character is a gentle and sensitive man, an attentive husband and a generous father, and his family is obviously taking him for granted. I am completely against the idea that only women are in danger of losing their identity in marriage and family life, men can feel just as unseen and unheard, and There's Always Tomorrow shows us such a man, and as the days pass by we care more and more for him and are with him in his subtle pain that comes to the surface through an encounter with a former employee (Barbara Stanwyck). He isn't looking for a quick adventure or an easy escape, he wants his existence to deepen instead of broaden, he wants to be here, the full owner of his life instead of feeling like a robot whose path is dictated by a set of batteries. He wants kindness and appreciation because he gives kindness and appreciation. And now and then, he wants time to stop, just for a moment, be able to look around and feel certain that this is exactly where he belongs. Home, instead of captured.",4.0
"Vague spoilers ahead.
Douglas Sirk makes movies about suffering. Suffering that is intense and pointed, yes, but it's also suffering that, often, comes from within; suffering that begins only when his characters open their eyes, and realize with horror that they've been miserable for years. Often, external voices (usually, it seems, played by William Reynolds who, for a brief period in the mid-1950s, cornered the cinematic market on loathsome, arrogant sons) enter the fray just as the characters awaken, articulating…",4.5
"Don’t let its toy shop setting fool you. Douglas Sirk’s “There’s Always Tomorrow” is one of the most complex depictions of married life ever written for the screen. 
Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Bennett and Fred MacMurray fumble nightmarishly through the middle stages of partnership and infidelity with a nightmarish quality equal to “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolf” and a tragic restraint to match “Brief Encounter.” 
Sirk’s domestic drama lives entirely in the realm of misperception, where boredom or loneliness push a family of five to each write their own narratives to a relationship. 
While the love triangle aspect might tease at soapiness, “Tomorrow”‘ is less about the outcome of the interwoven passions, and more revealing of the desires in those pretending to observe their passing. 
What unfolds is a layered play on gender and emotional infidelity that the script writers from “Mad Men” no doubt cribbed from decades later. 
Douglas Sirk’s work was known in its time for being adored by female audiences and abhorred by male critics. “Tomorrow” is proof that Sirk had a vast understanding and empathy for men and women, for lost hopes, and for unrealized dreams. His is a filmography worthy - finally - of the same adoration in return. 

That’s it for the Sirk marathon! Time to pull out the tissue box and have a good cry over the lot of them... ",4.5

"Another subtle and deeply felt melodrama from Douglas Sirk. Sirk examines the fault lines inherent to the structure of the nuclear family here, where everyone is expected to fulfil their roles perfectly and without complaint, playing out the same routine every day. Cliff is unable to express his middle-aged discontent to his family because they’ve been taught not to care- the family patriarch is expected to be the breadwinner and a bastion of masculine stoicism, nothing else. This leads to…",4.0

"Probably Douglas Sirk's darkest and cruelest melodrama. I'm shocked he got away with it, seeing how scathing it is of heteronormative gender roles and suburbia.
Stanwyck and MacMurray are paired again, teaming up for yet another masterpiece after Remember the Night and Double Indemnity. He's a family man, she's a career woman, and they're both absolutely miserable. They're not miserable because being a career woman is inherently bad, or because having a family is inherently joyless, but instead because of…",4.5
"Yet another neglected masterpiece. An ironic yet moving portrait of American middle-class life in the 50's. Fred MacMurray stars as a toy manufacturer who feels ignored and unappreciated by his wife and children. Alone and despondent, he meets an old flame (Barbara Stanwyck) and develops a friendship with her, but fate doesn't allow him to have even that little bit of happiness. Sirk could do melodrama in his sleep and this is just another example of that. He exploits every dramatic situation to its full potential. He also does a great job visually to depict how trapped MacMurray's character truly is. The shot of the toy robot in the end says it all.",5.0
If I’ve learnt anything from Douglas Sirk it is to never ever have children,3.5
"Last year I attended a high school reunion. My first feeling – beyond a secret desire to discover imperfections in others’ lives equal to my own – was one of vertiginous unreality. The men and women, reflected in time’s less-than-funhouse mirror, appeared as grotesques of my memory of them. No expensively tailored suit could disguise the paunch of the athlete, and multiple childbirths had transfigured the ingenue. These were people mostly healthy, and mostly accomplished: still, none could successfully escape a comparison to bygone youth, and one could’t help but read in the wrinkles something faintly ridiculous. Looking in the mirror, of course, one was merely laughing at oneself.
I had the same reaction to first encountering Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in Sirk’s film.
I’d recently viewed Double Indemnity, that masterpiece of youthful double-dealing. Double Indemnity youthful? Yes, I think so: any entangling fatality heading deathward draws along with it the shadow of romance, even if curdled. Eros and thanatos strengthen each other en route to Liebestod, even – or perhaps especially – if the desire schemes, dissimulates, or is laced with well-spoken poison.
A dying man’s cigarette is more glamorous than a living man’s cough.
It’s a different kind of tragedy to have no tragedy at all – merely to outlive one’s youth, merely to be happy in all the acceptable ways.
And so, having elided the decade between Wilder’s film and There’s Always Tomorrow, the first thing that struck me was the inevitable, aging softness about Fred MacMurray’s face, and Stanwyck’s intelligence having hardened so subtly about the eyes.
Both Clifford Groves and Norma Vale have made a success in the world – and both have done so by finding a way to transform pleasure into long, honest work. Clifford’s is the steady industry behind the child’s plaything, and Norma’s the cool acumen behind fashion’s dream of elegance. The necessary inessentials – the recreational, the beautiful – are the products that sustain them: administered, rather than enjoyed, in a symbol of maturity’s increasingly functional approach to the romance that once was its impetus.
The movie came over me more like a patterned feeling or a color than a thought – a color, despite its being shot in black-and-white, though a black-and-white so rippled and deep I wanted to bite through it.
Clifford’s home, despite its well-ordered appointments, is no place we’d want to live: almost every shot is hedged by some imprisoning lattice, or crossed with bars of shadow or metal. Despite having a whole house to roam, we spend most of our time cramped in the entranceway, pinioned among front door, stairs, and telephone – and the effect is not one of open passage, but of criss-crossing energies bottled to the brink. Shadows as deep as any noir swallow up whole portions of the wall – and all throughout, Sirk’s camera, testing the boundaries of its set, prowls back and forth with the coiled vitality of a panther.
In the headiness of this mid-life swoon, you imagine that one of the two must be a trick of the light – the happiness or the despair.
But you’re never sure which.",4.5
"Screw it, decided to watch this again in the context of Stanwyck and MacMurray. Also as i have found out there were four films, as they appeared in a Western together called the Moonlighters, my bad. Also, they play ex-lovers, so I will need to find that.
OK to get this out of the way, this is my 2nd fav Sirk, Tarnished Angels is the fav. Sirk, I find to be a very mid director with flashes of brilliance. 6…",4.5
"incredibly moving film about being stuck in a rut or never having a rut to be stuck in. it lacks all judgement, no one is a bad person - Sirk understands these people and their impulses enough to let them lie in ambiguity.
MacMurray and his percolating desire is terrific, but Stanwyck steals it. she's so subtly vulnerable, meticulously shedding layers to reveal a deep sorrow.",4.5
"“The movie was so young and romantic I kept wanting a shoulder to lean my head on”
Love is reckless and I don’t even know if it’s good. The older you get the more you unlearn your recklessness and I don’t know if that’s good either. I do know that there are far worse things than having a family to come home to or a successful career to fall back on, even when the loneliness feels unbearable. I’ll probably still keep your picture, so long.",3.5
"Sameness and loneliness: MacMurray's dissatisfied Cliff feels heavily the burdens of a 20-year stint in the role of patriarch in his household that makes him feel increasingly unappreciated and alone. Right on cue, old flame Norma comes forth as a welcome blast from the past albeit alone and pining in her own right, finding success in her own life but tethered to Cliff in a timeless manner they're both acutely reminded of. As Norma's clarity of vision regarding Cliff's mistreatment clashes with the realization that she stands to potentially knock it all down, what comes to light is how true desire is both unending and harmful to what it obfuscates. There's no time like the new present but the past, sadly, must return to where it was despite how emotional desperation ingrains itself in our every fiber to force the hands of an initially appealing lapse in judgement.",4.0
"""Love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it isn't even a good thing. When you're young and in love, nothing matters except your own satisfaction. The tragic thing about growing older is that you can't be quite as reckless anymore.""
It's astounding how a film as well-written and well-directed as Douglas Sirk's There's Always Tomorrow can be so overlooked and underappreciated, when in fact it should rank right next to the most acclaimed of Sirk's classic works.
The reasons for this are likely the obvious aspects that define its distinction from Sirk's more famous films: it is filmed in black & white rather than the glorious technicolor (though it still looks gorgeous!), and it is by far not as pulpy and exaggeratedly fancy as some of his other works. In fact, Sirk makes a point of depicting the American Dream not quite as dream-like as it might theoretically appear to be, and establishing the idea that even the most idyllic, picturesque of familial and occupational success can render unhappiness. In this case, it's the husband and father figure who feels suffocated by the boring and repetitive routine of his domestic life and seeks adventure and, more importantly, some variation from the imprisonment that he perceives his life to be.
As Barbara Stanwyck says, ""love is a very reckless thing, maybe it isn't even a good thing"", especially when you have reached an age when ""a birthday is only a time to turn all mirrors to the wall"". It's not used as an excuse to justify cheating, but rather as an opportunity to reveal the lengths people will go to escape the mundanity of their ever-repeating routines. Sirk also shines a light on the main character's three children, who fear the influence of their father's affair and want to return to their blissful, happy life that might have been repetitive, but lacked the turmoil that is now invading their family.
Sirk impressed me heavily with this film. It's only eighty minutes long, but still feels like a family epic that tells a story most other directors would have stretched out to more than two hours, yet it also never feels rushed or too fast-paced. Even the secondary characters are strong and intimately developed; the screenplay grants a look into the feelings, fears and longings of every character. It's all a compilation of extraordinary performances too, even though it should have been expected that not even Fred MacMurray and Joan Bennett could have taken the spotlight away from Barbara Stanwyck, who as usual steals every scene she is a part of with an emotional and heartwrenching performance. The accompanying score is great as well, in addition to the cinematography which perfectly captures the idyllic suburbs of Los Angeles. In its essence, it's one of those rare films that gave me an instant urge to start right at the beginning again after the ending credits began to roll, and experience it all again.

"Douglas Sirk tries to dissuade us from having children, #37.
An incisive, if not exactly subtle study of conformity and the American Dream - the director's pet theme - with successful, married father-of-three Fred MacMurray growing tired of his stifling life, and seeking escape with old flame Barbara Stanwyck.
It's brilliantly directed and sensitively played: the ultimate showdown between MacMurray's eldest kids and his mistress providing both dramatic fireworks and rhetorical resonance. His other child, Frankie, is basically the worst person in the world.
This may be the last and least of the three Stanwyck-MacMurray collaborations that I've seen (they made four films together), but since the others are my all-time favourite film (Remember the Night) and Billy Wilder's sublime film noir, Double Indemnity, I think we can let it off.",4.0

"Undercurrents of familial strife run through this picture, never once explicitly declared until misunderstandings birth false revelations, but in doing so they help realize underlying feelings and so become actual truth.
In this way tensions are just unfulfilled desires finally emerging once they become actually feasible, and conflicts just the clash of wills once the status quo is challenged; it is when power dynamics are stagnant that people become complacent, but when they become malleable people become inflamed.
Such is the life of toy manufacturer Clifford Groves, a husband and father whose existence is taken for granted. The love he's to received from hist nuclear American family is non-existent, replaced by annoyance from his kids and apathy from his wife. And so it is when he encounters someone who sees him differently that false assumptions are made, but hearing these lies helps him to realize just how unhappy he's always been – maybe they're right after all?

"""Love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it's not even a good thing.""
This film doesn't seem to be as well-remembered as some of Douglas Sirk's other 50's melodramas, but it should be. That might be due to the lack of the beautifully artificial techincolor photography that characterized so many of his best films. Though the black and white images he creates here are just as impeccably composed. And all his other visual trademarks remain present--figures boxed into frames-within-frames, characters divided by artificial barriers, and other such images suggesting the comfortable trappings of domesticity transformed into a self-constructed prison of sorts.
The story is also a bit more restrained and not quite as pulpy as some of his bigger hits. Not as salacious as Written on the Wind, nor as grand and topical as Imitation of Life. It compares most readily to All That Heaven Allows, concerned as both are with middle-aged parents struggling with a lack of fulfillment. But this time the issue is more complicated. It's not quite as easy to know who to root for.
I kept wondering how much we're actually expected to sympathize with Fred MacMurray's character. Just what does he really have to complain about, anyway? That his wife is too busy being a responsible parent? That his older kids have lives and interests of their own now? Seems pretty childish to me. Then it hit me: the guy makes toys for a living; he compares moments of happiness to scoring touchdowns in a football game; he really is just a big kid who never full grew up in a lot of ways. But that doesn't mean his emotions aren't still valid. The occasional indication that his family appreciates him doesn't seem like too much for a father to ask for.
His kids do take his love and support for granted and they do expect him to be impossibly strong and pure. On the other hand, they also aren't entirely off-base in their concerns directed towards him, selfishly motivated as they may be. After all, if you were stuck in an unsatisfying home life, and Barbara Stanwyck showed up on your doorstep reminding you of the good old days, you might let your imagination run way with you, too.
So what it boils down to is a conflict with childish hypocrites on both sides to one extent or another. And--as is often the case with us straight men if we're being honest--it's the women in their lives that have to call them all out on their bullshit. In a way, it's Stanwyck's ""other woman"" who comes off as the most sympathetic for the clarity she provides--the final shot of her is a real heart-breaker.
The fact that Sirk could juggle all this while still telling an emotionally resonant story, and working in his usual critiques of the American Dream (the otherwise happy ending concludes with an incredibly subversive composition), is a testament to his genius as both storyteller and cinematic craftsman. It not only deserves to be mentioned alongside his other classics, it belongs near the top of the list.",4.5
"“Love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it isn’t even a good thing.”
Atomic love. Mac and Babs together again in this Sirk directed form of big screen birth control. Wind-up boy Cliff (MacMurray) is in a self described “rut in life,” a “tomb of his own making,” and happens to chastly bonk heads with former friend and coworker Norma (Stanwyck) at a business retreat in Palm Valley/Springs, California. His selfish kids don’t believe the relationship is pure, and after a while, Cliff isn’t so sure either. 
MacMurray is ace as the innocent big boy, a haplessly married man who finds himself caught in a “Blue Moon” dream of middle age. Stanny is in her underrated latter period career coda, no longer teasing with anklets, but with her sexual maturity and unmarried, independent spirit. It doesn’t offer any easy solutions to the 50s man-in-crisis. Be thankful for what you have? Respect your dad? Get wife Joan Bennett some weed so she’ll loosen up? Or, beware: the things we do for love are going to come back for us one by one.",4.0
"Really enjoyed this. Occupies thematic territory similar to All That Heaven Allows—how comfortable is bourgeois suburban life, really? what does a parent owe their children?—but the plotting is so much less emphatic than that of most melodramas. (The affair that drives the story never even happens!)
That said, the film's light touch sometimes make it feel a little tepid. Though I'm wondering if the fact that I've seen this milieu and these scenarios in dozens of movies made after it is coloring my opinion. The subplot about MacMurray's son reminded me of Biff in Death of a Salesman; postwar American cinema was always so fixated on any perceived deficiencies in the next generation.
The dramatic stakes here often lie on the surface of the dialogue. But despite some mild frustration I have with the writing, this is still quite impressive. I'll never not be bowled over by the way Sirk's camera navigates rooms, sets up spatial relationships between characters, and especially his use of mirrors and windows—a couple shots of Stanwyck's face streaked with shadows of the rain are just magnificent. (What's the likelihood, by the way, that Stanwyck and MacMurray should costar in this, Remember the Night, and Double Indemnity, 3 great but wildly different movies by 3 great directors?)
Especially fine use of ""Blue Moon"" (a song I've had on the brain since Blue Jasmine) as a melodramatic leitmotif, sometimes played downbeat and other times with perhaps a music box quality.",3.5
"MacMurray's life is meetings and children, house and wife. Back into his life comes Barbara Stanwyck, an old flame, independent, and obviously Barbara goddamn Stanwyck. His certainty is rocked, they spend time together, they click.

"Pain. It comes as a surprise to me that my favourite Sirk melodrama is certainly also his bleakest; not to mention this is the only non-Technicolor film I’ve seen from him, and the visuals were the biggest compliment I can offer the director for his previous efforts. I’m guessing this was a conscious choice to compliment the themes Sirk wanted to explore (The delusion of 50s American family life/consumerism), and the rainy atmosphere that was ever-present set the tone effectively. Noticed rain only stopped when Fred McMurray’s emotional turmoil is resolved, albeit bittersweet. Visuals aside, narratively this is his best work and MacMurray & Stanwyck were a great duo.",4.0
"“All of a sudden I felt desperate sitting in my own living room.” If Sirk turns cozied domesticity and nuclear heteronormativity and the expectations of good behavior into just so many kinds of cages (“The kind you always wanted!”), they’re ultimately bearable ones relative to the inescapability of time’s passing. “When I think of all the disappointments…” A film as much about the lines and creases accumulating around Stanwyck and MacMurray’s eyes as it is about a love that might have been if it weren’t always already too late. All the Groves’ post-War suburban world’s bounty paving the way for a bright future for their children, the girls with their ballet lessons and tidy moralities, the son with his fascist buzzcut and infantile swagger; the paterfamilias looking at everything he’s made for them and finding it all so dull, so empty, left holding tickets to a show no one in his life wants to see with him. “I’m not taking about expenses, I’m talking about life!” If he and Stanwyck dare to flirt with the possibility of walking through the doors that are never really truly locked, she at least knows that the things that really hurt the most are just going to keep following them wherever they’d go. There is indeed always tomorrow, for the kids to slowly turn into their parents, for the living room to feel just a bit more suffocating, for youth’s recklessness to fade just a bit farther into the distance, for another risk not worth taking; MacMurray left standing exactly where he’s supposed to be, the traditional family unit survived intact, just facing another tomorrow that already feels like yesterday. “They make a handsome couple, don’t they?”",4.5
"Sirkian marital middle-class melodramatic maelstrom as Barbara Stanwyck crashes back into the life of neglected Fred MacMurray, whose wife Joan Bennett is all about their kids and nothing about him. There is much to savour here, observing Babs and Fred squirming under the microscope of misery, thanks to some of the most annoying offspring in cinema history. But it still feels like it could have been so much better. Just imagine that screen widened with vibrant Sirkian colours illuminating the moods of the characters into a much richer and more emotive experience.
Don't take it from me - take it from Mr Sirk himself: ""Both MacMurray and Stanwyck were excellent. But I think there was probably a flaw in the casting of the other woman, and in the writing. And the other thing was that the picture needed colour, which was planned.""",3.5
"De hecho, Sirk oscurece tanto lo que en principio no parece más que un drama burgués común y corriente que cuando en los dos últimos planos recompone lo que fue rompiendo no queda en pie mucho más que el cumplimiento de la convención, desnudada en cuanto tal. Con el paso del tiempo, en sus expresiones mayores, la necesidad del Hollywood clásico de someter las historias a un marco medianamente aceptable se revela tan frágil que termina por acrecentar el peso de los desafíos apresuradamente conjurados con el golpe de timón del desenlace.",5.0
"This is less well-known than other Douglas Sirk melodramas of the 1950s (and in black & white rather than Technicolor). But it's a real gem and it's what Sirk does best - deconstructs 1950s domestic conformity and subversively critiques it. This time around, though, it's not about women but rather about an unfulfilled husband in a picture-perfect suburban household who's experiencing a midlife crisis.
It doesn't hurt that the film has two excellent leads - Fred McMurray as the unhappy husband and father (and the CEO of a successful toy company) and Barbara Stanwyck as a former employee who shows up unexpectedly one night and rekindles his passion and lost hopes. Stanwyck is truly at her best here, as a fashionable ""career woman"" from New York who's nonetheless lonely. Just as in Sirk's ""All That Heaven Allows"", the three children are selfish and see their father only for what he can give them, and his wife (Joan Bennett) although gracious, is preoccupied with her children and seems to be uninterested in sex or romance.
A few more highlights - Stanwyck's stylish and sophisticated outfits, the scene when the two older kids confront Stanwyck and she turns the table and shames them, the toy robot which is a metaphor for McMurray's robot-like existence, Stanwyck crying alone on a cross-country flight with an empty seat beside her, and the ambiguous ending.",4.0

There's always tomorrow––until there isn't––which is worse?
This might be the best script Sirk ever worked with, in that all the major strengths of the film evidently existed in it already: children trying to be adults, adults being children; the circular rhythm of the film; the unified plot and subplot.

"Mr. Clifford Groves, both a husband and a father, wears the face of ennui. His years are a blur of routine, staggering into a pile of coercive introspection. Cracks slowly crawl on the seemingly pristine family portrait. Moulds form around their supposedly well-maintained house. The threat of an irreversible marital split looms upon a stifling air of neglect and unconcern. The past, with its financial trials and emotional tyrannies, nudges; holds the knob of chance. A knock, a turn, a step, a smile. Clifford Groves unknowingly stands at the unlocked door of temptation. Norma Vail, an ex-coworker, separated from her husband, greets him with reminiscence. Oh, this is not your usual tale of adultery.
Sirk leverages tension with ample melodrama, gripping Clifford and Norma with engrossing restraint. From their shared mid-life longings subtly leap a youthful bliss. Eyes glimmer with understanding. Brief touches sate a craved comfort. But what intensifies each encounter is the innocence of each gesture, together with the tug of its unrequited flush. Then they are strewn apart by unfounded suspicions, peered under the gaze of malice. Malice distorts innocuous situations, until distortion itself becomes truth. Similar with other works of Sirk, there are oppositional elements in “There’s Always Tomorrow”, but they are bolstered by conscience and confusion on Clifford’s part, until there is a downpour of a desire that cannot be contained by the outstretched hands of capitulation. More than a film about (un)faithfulness, the film delves into the sin of thought and sin of action. Ruinous consequences amidst. The wife devoted to her chores, and the husband devoted to his profession are the archetypes of a society inflexible with its expectations; robotic; model toys of American conventions. Unlike the wife wallowing in blind gratification throughout, the husband discerns the existential drought under his soles. Of course, the film also warns of late realisations, the fleeting surge of joy at any kind of attention that instantly fills the emptiness. Some loves thrive in the tedium, others in the forbidden. But when children are a part of that love, there is the belief you need to sacrifice your own needs, to not doubt your disposition. Children seem to ask too much of their parents sometimes. We seem to ask too much of ourselves. 
Sirk does not need to settle anything in “There’s Always Tomorrow”. He leaves us in the room of ambiguities. The film looks ahead with glassy eyes—happiness seems to be a state of mind.",4.0

Just like emotions alternate and try to find their world, so dances light and shadow in the faces of our characters, so alternate the flame and water, past is present, present is gone, tomorrow is safety but only if we have yesterday. It's a film about words we say and words we wish we'd say and words we wish we didn't say or words we wish we'd say differently. These characters are wrong at the wrong time, it's all about the timing - Norma appears to the porch on that rainy evening, Frankie twists her ankle, Vinnie sees his father, Clifford falls in love when Norma suddenly understands, people cross each other and rarely even stop. It's all there in the way people move, the childish enthusiasm that slowly turns into old age's solidity and loneliness. The contrast between real and dreamy is so strong that from everyday life we suddenly jump into understanding that we are truly watching a film - the moment when Stanwyck's and MacMurray's dreams finally meet each other, they share a moment in the light that only film conveys but someone has already moved further. For a moment it is true but soon shadows fall on the faces of our protagonists.",5.0

This is a portrait of a middle-aged man trapped in the monotony of married life, sensitively portrayed by Fred MacMurray in probably the best performance I've seen of him so far. He conveys his feelings of loneliness in such a way that we feel them too. Stanwyck is excellent, as I knew she would be, but Joan Bennett has little to do. You cannot blame MacMurray for wanting Stanwyck and wanting to break free from his stifling home. I personally would want to break free from those horrible children who apparently have nothing better to do than pry into the affairs of their father (like the children in Sirk's All That Heaven Allows). The only sensible and likeable youngster is the son's girlfriend, played by Pat Crowley.
There are two pivotal scenes that create an emotional punch: the one where the children confront Stanwyck and she tells them off; and the most heartfelt one where Stanwyck tells MacMurray she's leaving and he should stay with his family (Stanwyck is terrific in that scene and she makes us feel her loneliness and sacrifice). I thought it was really sad, and yes, I cried. And although the unhappy happy ending is appropriate, I hate the Code enforced last scene with MacMurray and Bennett together and the children looking on and one of them expressing that horrible last sentence, ""They make a handsome couple, don't they?"". It really doesn't do justice to this fine restrained melodrama.",4.0

"Without the distraction of the trademark sumptuous technicolor, Sirk's incredible mastery of telling you everything you need to know with shot selection, shadow and light, and the subtly delivered word or phrase comes into the foreground. This, what I would consider a true masterpiece in both directing and acting, has such a variety of examples that stand out, I'd be up all night writing about them. How this somehow got lost in the shuffle is beyond my understanding.
Pairing Stanwyck and McMurray again is perfect casting. They're both attractive, but neither glamorously so; believable as two people who missed an earlier opportunity with each other. Cliff Groves (McMurray) and his wife Marion (Joan Bennett-excellent here) would seem to have the perfect life, but Cliff feels like a stranger in his own family. She is so devoted to her kids' happiness that she virtually ignores every attempt by Cliff to rekindle romance. The kids? Oldest Vinnie (William Reynolds) is a petulant man child, high schooler Judy invents emotional issues with friends, and youngest Frankie is a child prima donna demanding endless attention. Into this walks Norma Vale (Stanwyck) an old business associate of Cliff's who has become a famous dress designer in NYC. From the minute she walks into the door, the hope in Cliff's eyes is palpable. Is Norma the last chance at happiness before the gate closes? Their interactions are essentially innocent, but son Vinne spots them together and assumes nothing but the worst, and enlists daughter Judy to the cause of proving his suspicions correct. Marion, so romantically distanced by her unquenchable devotion to their children's endless demands for time and attention, doesn't even notice Cliff's obvious frustration. The only marker Sirk missed was having her put on a sleep mask.
I'm doing a terrible job here, because what really makes this Sirk's best realization and deconstruction of the 50's suburban myth isn't the story, but the manner in which he presents and stages it. One of many standout scenes has Vinnie's girlfriend Ann, who is becoming more upset with Vinnie's suspicions trying to explain to Norma, who is continuously getting interrupted, what is being imagined behind her back. She never gets it all out, but Norma decides it's enough to call off Cliff's sudden urgent desire to meet that evening. Cliff, frustrated to the breaking point, comes home, lights a cigarette, wanders around, and finally sits down at a desk and picks up a newspaper. In front of him is a family portrait, but a portrait that is missing Cliff, just mom and the kids. He raises the paper up to block it from view, gets up and tosses his cigarette out the window where Vinnie and Ann had just been watching him. With no dialog, his frustration and sense of pent up anxiety is perfectly expressed, and the portrait portrays everything that is toxic in the family.

"By transporting Clifford back to his youth, Sirk deals with doubts and cracks in the nuclear family dynamic. The musings on mundanity, aging, and responsibilities are concocted through vibrant performances and effective tone variation as conflicts . Dreariness is expertly balanced with the sweet and the weightless. Sirk's film is acute. It understands the generational gap and misguided enthusiasm of the youth which it navigates in a mature cause and effect narrative. Obviously everything has a cause and an effect but I mean that there is quite a complex push and pull between the children and the adults. They're putting each other into situations where misrepresentations and desires obscure their reality and sometimes feed into fantasies that can never become real. Aside from one scene that pushes the blame of Cliff's emotional state too heavily on the kids, it handles the topic extremely well.
There's Always Tomorrow is bittersweet because the film underlines sacrifices from which you get diminishing returns in a communal dynamic that has been commodified. Its core ideas about the world being more open to you when you're young and your perspective changing as you get older don't necessarily comment on that last part but the richness comes from Sirk digging his hands into a murky territory to evaluate the idealized family unit's realities.
Stanwyck-MacMurray pairing is impossible not to love.",4.0
"There’s Always Tomorrow isn’t Douglas Sirk’s most florid or subversive melodrama, but it might be one of the most quietly complex and adult examples of the genre this side of Daisy Kenyon. Every time it seems to introduce a simple dichotomy— the doting family man vs his unappreciative family, the bull-headed son vs his father’s seemingly innocuous friendship– the film complicates it with a clear understanding of each character, so that their clashes unfold with a kind of tragic inevitability. Let’s start with Clifford’s son Vinnie, the closest thing here to a “villain”: his unwavering judgement of his father starts out as a stubborn but logical misunderstanding, then becomes a naïve (but logical!) failure to grasp the unresolvable realities of adult life. He’s not wrong so much as short-sighted and temperamental, which makes his girlfriend’s admonishments of him both satisfying and, ultimately, just a different kind of naivety.
That extends to Joan Bennett’s wife character, an almost Zen-like homemaker whose worst crime is being oblivious to the extent of her husband’s emotional needs. She just happens to be as content with the role Clifford has assigned her as he is ambivalent about the consequences; this would be a very different movie if her “offenses” weren’t mostly reasonable, and likewise if she had been painted as a kind of villain. But no one is either fully held to the fire or let off the hook. The point is that Clifford’s final decision is a matter of which compromises he’s willing to make, and neither option is ethically or practically easier than the other. For a film that on the surface lands somewhere deeply conversative, it painstakingly acknowledges everything that must be sacrificed along the way.
So while this may technically concern a forbidden romance, it’s one that’s on mainly existential terms. For all their genuine affection, Clifford and Norma are never painted as simply The Ones That Got Away; the film is too attuned to what they represent to each other, making this as much about their personal crises and what’s a stake for everyone involved, including Clifford’s family. And of course there’s the baggage that comes from the casting of a reunited Stanwyck and MacMurray, who both give such measured performances that it’s hard to believe this was the fiery couple from Double Indemnity just 12 years earlier.
There’s Always Tomorrow is generally knowing about relationships and family life, so it only skirts simplicity when it comes to Norma’s impassioned admonishment of Clifford’s children, which risks reducing things to a lesson about showing appreciation for your hard-working father (and then maybe he won’t have to cheat on your mother!). But by the time the bittersweet ending rolls around, not even the daughter’s final line can tie things up in a neat bow. These spouses may indeed make a “handsome couple,” but we’ve seen both the bliss and the painful limitations that come along with it. Sirk isn’t often known for his work in black and white, but this film is still anything but.",4.0
"Love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it isn't even a good thing. When you're young and in love, nothing matters except your own satisfaction. The tragic thing about growing older is that you can't be quite as reckless anymore.
Imagine a time when Hollywood could contemporaneously comment on the issues of the day.
This perfectly captures some of the pitfalls of the nuclear American suburban family that came in the 1950s, with Levittowns sprouting across the country and the birth rate booming. The opening title card referring to ""sunny California"" gets at this. Sunny is more a feeling than a weather description. It actually rains for much of the movie. Douglas Sirk understands things are not all swell and these homes that seem so content from the outside.
Instead, the nuclear family breeds feelings of frustration and entrapment. It foretells the discontent that would follow a decade later, with the rise of the counterculture battling back against the squareness of American life at that time.
And it smartly never treats its characters as villains to the sanctity of the American Family Unit. They are all humans making understandable decisions based on emotions. Other media of this time would be quick to denote characters like Barbara Stanwyck's as homewrecking heathens. It's even willing to show an adulterous kiss. Oh my!
Of course, she must step aside for the goodness of the AFU, leading to a saccharine ending that, while superficially nice, still sidesteps the feeling that nothing has really improved here to assuage Fred MacMurray's discontent.
I guess that's the hardest job to learn in the whole world, how to give love and expect nothing in return.",4.0
"""Love is a very reckless thing.""
This is a delicate story and in less skilled hands it really wouldn't work. Fortunately it's the perfect formula for a skillful master like Douglas Sirk. I love the way Fred MacMurray's relationship problems are mirrored in his son's, and the way the mood is reflected and underlined with the changes in LA weather!
Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck both put on killer performances here individually, but together they're absolutely electric! They're easily one of my favorite on-screen couples, and this material really is perfect for them.
The story in this starts with a pretty basic melodramatic plot, then escalates and crescendos across the movie until the end where it ends up saying something that I found pretty profound about love and relationships that is still super relevant today!
Also wow, Palm Springs really hasn't changed much from the '50s! Not that I really thought it did but here's visual confirmation, kinda makes me wish this was filmed in color like Sirk's other big films of the 1950s.",5.0

Perhaps it is because this film isn't filled to the brim with Technicolor beauty, but I finally feel like I'm really seeing the technical mastery that Sirk envelops these otherwise rather dim and simple stories in. This is the first time I've really noticed the immaculate way in which he blocks his scenes. In fact, I've rarely seen camera movement complement a story so neatly. And for a story that's as basic as this, a tale of lost attention and regained love placed in the confines of a love triangle, it sure does know how to push itself to becomes something greater. Instead of just building the triangle on itself, Sirk uses the world around the three victims and creates a hefty family drama on top of it, complete with different layers and viewpoints on what love can mean. It's not just the tale of a man who is taken for granted by his family and thus finds his love with a different woman, it is also a dense character study with the main character not being the husband but the many forms that love takes on in this. It somehow feels like the unifying statement of all of Sirk's films I've seen so far. Yes, his stories may be the most melodramatic representations of romance one can find this side of Hollywood, but they're also undeniably true. From sweet, blossoming puppy love with all of its hassle to the struggles of a long-lasting marriage and the possible boredom of the mundanity of such a relationship to the complexity of love within a family itself, There's Always Tomorrow manages to grasp it all and place it carefully in a mere 90 minutes of film. A glorious achievement!

"Engraçado como é um filme que fica entre uma vitimização masculina e uma subversão moral familiar mais direta (uma anti-propaganda familiar mesmo). Quase um equilíbrio ambíguo entre comodismo e maturidade. E ao mesmo tempo que é um filme cheio de meias palavras (praticamente ninguém usa o termo traição), ele tem um jogo dramático muito aberto e frontal, especialmente na relação com os filhos e no embate familiar todo.
Não deixa de ser bem surpreendente perceber como o Sirk trabalha com a atmosfera sem o uso de cores. Existe um certo histrionismo de elementos no espaço bem particular (o porta-retratos familiar sempre proeminente, o robô de brinquedo como espelho dramático do protagonista, o próprio figurino quase vanguardista da Barbara Stanwyck). É um pouco como se a cenografia e a ambientação pulsassem no lugar da cor, ainda que mesmo no pb existe um contraste muito conceitual (especialmente na cena em que o personagem do MacMurray se declara pra Stanwyck).",4.0

"100 Films by 18 Directors: Douglas Sirk
Every once in a while, there will be a film where you find yourself not only enraptured by what is transpiring, but having to hold back cheers as you watch. There’s Always Tomorrow is one of those films, as was Douglas Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows which kicked off my journey into Sirk’s career. Yet, since then, there have been good films but nothing quite on the level of All that Heaven Allows. Now, over a year later, I have found it again in There’s Always Tomorrow. From the small details to the overarching themes to the emotion, There’s Always Tomorrow may not be as celebrated as its predecessor, but it is nonetheless every bit as good. As an aside, it is somewhat interesting that Sirk made both films at about the same time with both of them coming out just a month apart in both Los Angeles and New York City (All that Heaven Allows came first in LA and There’s Always Tomorrow came first in NYC). Not only was it a terrific time for cinema, but it speaks to something within both films: imprisonment in the suburban home with the quaint little family who barely knows you are there.
Yet, unlike All that Heaven Allows, There’s Always Tomorrow is about a husband. From the very onset of the film, Sirk clues the audience into the unusual nature of the subject with an introduction that welcomes viewers in “sunny California” before cutting to an exterior shot with rain pouring down in sheets on the streets of Los Angeles. The film then does for trapped suburban husbands what it did for trapped housewives. The issues are slightly different, as the housewife is, naturally, contained to the house while the husband is able to get out. Thus, many seem to be under the belief that the husband, due to the fact he can get out and meet people everyday, may not feel the same way as the unsatisfied wives of the nation. Yet, in Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray), Sirk shows that is untrue. Yes, he is able to get out of the home, but at the expense of his family’s affection. Perfectly capturing this early in the film as Clifford, giddy about his plans to take his wife Marion (Joan Bennett) to the theater for her birthday, tries to call home repeatedly from the office, only to get a busy signal. Managing to secure tickets to the sold out show on his way home, he shows up to find his middle child, daughter Ellen (Gigi Perreau), on the phone talking to a friend about boys. His youngest daughter, Frankie (Judy Nugent), is excited about her dance recital that night and is preparing. His eldest son Vinnie (William Reynolds) is busy preparing for a date with his girlfriend Ann (Pat Crowley). As he rushes into his room to tell Marion to get ready for their date at the theater, he is informed that she, too, is about to leave in order for her take Frankie to her recital. Asking everyone else in the home if they want to go to the theater with him or if Vinny wants to take Ann to the show, he is constantly rebuffed. Downstairs, even their housekeeper Mrs. Rogers (Jane Darwell) cannot go with him as she has to babysit for her daughter. Dejected and now in an empty home after having built up his expectations of having a great family night, in walks Norma Miller (Barbara Stanwyck). An old flame who he broke up with over 20 years ago after working with her to help start his toy company, she still has feelings for him, even after she was briefly married (in an attempt to soothe her loneliness over losing Clifford), and is eager to hang out with him and catch up.
In presenting the loneliness that Clifford feels, the film does not wish to justify his emotional love affair that will unfold with Norma - though they stop short of anything physical - but rather call to attention the plight of the then-modern husband. The only question his kids stop to ask him before they rush out in the opening sequence is if they can have some money. His wife barely even stops during the film, both skipping out on her birthday celebration and a weekend couples getaway to Palm Valley in order to care for Frankie. It is no surprise he winds up rushing into the arms of the only person to give him the time of day as he is only good enough to them for what he brings financially. With Norma, she finds pleasure in his every spoken word, allowing him to ramble on about his life before even bothering to offer up details of her own. At home, as he sees it, he is like the new toy his company is going to release called “Rex the Walkie Talkie Robot”. In Rex, he sees himself as he gets wound up each morning, sent off the work, and then he comes back at the end of the day and shuts off until someone winds up him again to do it all over. He craves excitement, something new, and adventure, yet his wife has nothing to say but to put down that ambition and say doing something all the time would be tiring. In Norma, he not only finds joy in revisiting his youth, but she does things with him. From swimming to horseback riding, their time together for a weekend in Palm Valley - they accidentally met up there after Clifford went anyways after his wife cancelled on him - is pure bliss. It not only makes him feel young, but it makes him feel wanted. After so long being ignored, he finally finds something that makes him feel happy. However, as Norma later says, one cannot only do something for that reason when they are older as they have to remember that there are other factors in love than satisfaction. In one’s youth, only satisfaction matters, but that cannot remain the same way forever. Everyone must grow up.
This is what also makes the film so great, as it uses a subplot where Vinnie believes he saw his father and Norma engaging in an affair while in Palm Valley - Vinnie drove up with Ann and some friends to get away for the weekend, believing his father would not mind - so well. Far too many filmmakers would use it as a source for considerable conflict. Sirk even does this a little bit, building up terrific dramatic tension as the audience realizes that every action Clifford takes is feeding into Vinnie’s convictions. Even his upfront explanation about how he spent the weekend with Norma and how his business meeting in Palm Valley was cancelled at the last second see Vinnie cite “An American Tragedy” by Theodore Dreiser and claim that husbands will tell just enough of the truth to appear innocent. His later phone calls and meetings alone with Norma may even begin to prove Vinnie’s suspicions correctly. Yet, Vinnie’s girlfriend Ann is fed up. Not only did she believe in Clifford without an explanation, but she is furious with Vinnie’s childish beliefs. He lashes out at her, calling her naive. Ann continuously strikes back before leaving him, calling him a young boy instead of a man and stating she could never love a boy. By the time Vinnie and Ellen confront Norma, Sirk is able to show to what end this perfectly composed subplot was actually used for. For one, it was to show the lack of affection given to Clifford by his children. So willingly, they believe every little detail of his life could somehow be insidious. He has earned no trust from them, as he is practically a stranger. Norma calls them out on it, even finding fault in Vinnie’s justification that he was just looking out for his mother. In Clifford, Norma sees a sensitive and incredibly loving father. In return, his children pick apart his life, ignore him, and then begin to lash out at for what they have convinced themselves to be the truth. Second, Sirk is able to use it to explore the nature of love. Once more, he definitely is on-the-nose, but the film’s honesty brims through as Vinnie apologizes to Ann and confesses he was being a boy before. Now, thanks to Norma and these events, he realizes that one must also give love rather than just take it, as they had done for so long with their father. There is no big confrontation scene where Clifford must explain to Marion what the audience already knows. There is no big scene where the kids accuse him and he, again, must explain. Sirk knows the audience already knows the details (and even manages to critique the natural suspicion around men and women being ""just friends"" as a result) and that there is no need to rehash them again. Instead, he uses it as development for those characters to allow them to grow up and realize their father’s plight. He needs love, not further ostracization. It does not justify his emotional affair, but who can blame him for falling for the only person who seems to care about what he says?
Where There’s Always Tomorrow is able to flirt so brilliantly with perfection is in two particular conversations. One, with Clifford speaking to his wife Marion and two, Clifford speaking with Norma. In the former, as alluded to, he confronts her about his feelings of being trapped, of being like this walkie talkie robot, and how he just wants to do things with her. As stated, she largely rebuffs him before leaving to go care for Frankie. Visually, Sirk dominates the scene. In line with the film’s reversal from being in “sunny California” and about the struggling suburban housewife, There’s Always Tomorrow is a black-and-white film that came at the height of his technicolor melodramas. Thus, Sirk is able to tap into the same shadows he so gorgeously employed during his late 1940s and early 1950s film noirs. As Clifford and Marion speak to one another, their faces are often bathed in shadows. Clifford’s face cannot even be seen as he sits on a bench, dejected as his wife pretty much writes off his concerns. In isolation, the scene itself is brilliant. From the writing to the impassioned acting to the lighting, Sirk is able to capture just how much they are missing of one another. They talk past another, as though they were having different conversations in different worlds. The shadows in the scene highlight this fact and just how much they do not see one another, both literally and figuratively. In so many years of marriage, they have grown complacent, neglecting one another and Clifford is feeling the brunt of this isolation.
Sirk then counters this with conversation number two, shared between Clifford and Norma as she breaks it off with him due to her conversation with Vinnie and Ellen. Realizing she is taking him away from his family and recognizing how much he would grow to resent leaving Marion due to what family events he would miss, Norma selflessly gives him away and declares her intent to leave for her home in New York City. Naturally, Clifford is quite hesitant and tries to convince her otherwise. Though they disagree, Sirk bathes the scene in light. At first setting their conversation in the background, Sirk puts Rex the Walkie Talkie Robot right in the foreground, recalling the earlier conversation where Clifford noted his similarity to the toy. This allows the audience to read this scene, in particular his dialogue, with that fear of turning back into the toy in mind. Sirk then cuts to a close-up of the pair as they speak with light poured on both of their faces as Norma confronts the harsh truth that, yet again, she fell in love Clifford only for him to either not love her when they were young or for him to love what she represents (freedom) and not her now. Sirk then further nails the moment as she rushes out and Clifford chases into the rain, only to be left standing in the street all alone. Back in his office, he walks over, turns on Rex the robot, and walks to the window as he gathers himself. The isolation as well as the symbolic nature of Rex making his noises, walking to the edge of the table with nobody there to catch him, sums up the despair that Clifford is feeling in that moment. His melancholy and depressed feelings, akin to him walking right to the edge of the world and seeing no way he can prevent himself from jumping off.
All of this builds to one of the best closing sequences I have seen in recent memory as, once more, Clifford returns home to Ellen on the phone, Vinnie out in the yard with Ann, and Frankie nagging Ellen to use her cologne. As he gets ready to sit down, he cannot help but think of Norma. Just then, a plane can be heard overhead, which he just knows carries his beloved Norma. The longing, the “missed connection”, and the solemn realization that they were never meant to be, that he must to return to this life of isolation, and that he will continue to live in “neutral” wash over the scene. Yet, Sirk then changes everything. His kids drop everything to pay attention to him. His wife Marian, instead of going inside, sees he is distressed on the front porch and opts to go for a walk with him. She even tells him she wishes he had gone with her and Frankie to the movies, as it was some stupid young love movie (how perfect, given his own “young love” feelings for Norma) and she wanted to sleep on his shoulder. Though they walk off the screen, one needs only to see Mrs. Rogers’ ear-to-ear grin upon seeing them walk to feel tremendous bliss. After a film in which this man desperately beat against the bars holding him in his cell, he is finally given the key to get out: the acknowledgment, love, and affection, of the family and wife he loves so dearly. Beautiful, stirring, and a perfectly tearjerking way to end this classic Sirk melodrama.
For some reason, There’s Always Tomorrow is not as watched as some of Sirk’s more well-known works, which is a shame. Fred MacMurray is excellent in the lead role, capturing the boyish giddiness of Clifford when he has dates planned with his wife and, later, as he plans evenings with Norma. Barbara Stanwyck nails the role of the incredibly lonely Norma who wants Clifford, but not in the way she would have to have him. Joan Bennett and the family nail their roles as well, capturing the aloof and quintessential American family of the 1950s who go about their own way, hogging the phone, and focused only on their own endeavors. Emotional, perfectly composed with great lighting, a great use of sound, great music that helps to build both the tension and drama in the film, terrific acting, and a highly conventional story that does for the suburban husband what Sirk often did for the suburban housewife, There’s Always Tomorrow is a pitch perfect work that is another example of Sirk’s brilliance.",4.5
"Douglas Sirk was the master of ""50s soap."" Many of his films are well-known, films such as ""Imitation of Life,"" ""Magnificent Obsession,"" ""Written on the Wind,"" and ""All That Heaven Allows."" Hidden amongst those films is this film. And I must say, it's as good as the rest.
What you'll find in most of Sirk's films from the 50s is a focus on a female character. It is often her feelings that we live with. For ""There's Always Tomorrow,"" Sirk chooses to ""flip the script,"" placing a man and his feelings at the forefront. It's a great change of pace. But you're not going to find just a man's feelings, though. No, underneath it all is also a woman's feelings.

Time, if nothing else, will vindicate Douglas Sirk as it has already vindicated Josef von Sternberg. Formal excellence and visual wit are seldom as appreciated at first glance as are the top-ical sensations of the hour. Yet, The Defiant Ones and On the Beach are already dead, whereas Written on the Wind and Tarnished Angels become more impressive with each passing year. Sirk requires no extreme rationalization, and his films require no elaborate defense. The evidence of his style is visible on the screen. It is a personal style, distinct from the impressive techno-logical apparatus of the Universal-MCA-Decca complex. David Miller's Back Street and Norman Jewison's Forty Pounds of Trouble can serve as decisive cross-references against the theoreticians of studios as auteurs. Even before Sirk came to Universal, he displayed his audacious talent in films like Summer Storm, A Scandal in Paris, and Lured. The essence of Sirkian cinema is the direct confrontation of all material, however fanciful and improbable. Even in his most dubious projects, Sirk never shrinks away from the ridiculous, but by a full-bodied formal development, his art transcends the ridiculous, as form comments on content. Whereas John Stahl transcended the lachrymose dramas of Imitation of Life and Magnificent Obsession through the incisiveness of his dark humor. If it be true, as veteran Polish director Aleksander Ford once observed, that the cinema of tomorrow is the cinema of wide screen and color, then Sirk's formal achievements will have helped lead the way into a more sensuous future. Visual style is never an end in itself, and it cannot be ultimately defended except as it relates to a director's taste and sensibility. Any visual style can be mechanically reproduced, but without the linkage to a directorial personality, the effect is indeed mechanical. Sirk's taste is exquisite, and hence, inimitable. One big obstacle to an appreciation of his oeuvre is an inbred prejudice to what Raymond Durgnat has called the genre of the female weepies as opposed to the male weepies, particularly the kind from Italy that are hailed as ""humanist.""",0.0

Schoenfeld have the narrative take a surprising turn in the final act adding more emotional and thematic profundity, followed by a perfect ending which refuses to take the easy way out.* Top-notch direction and exceptional performances to boot.
*Have not read the source material, so I cannot comment on how faithful this is.",4.5
"No-one should marry out of loneliness.
Not as dagger-sharp or emotionally shattering a critique of postwar suburban conformity as the preceding year’s All That Heaven Allows—in particular, the material with the children (all monstrous, in typical Sirk fashion) is somewhat clumsily handled. He is still in the god-level phase of his career as regards form, however, and the mise-en-scène fetishists among us will have a ball with the surfeit of mirrored surfaces, grotesque plants, and bar-like structures on parade here. The toy factory and fashion boutique settings offer further opportunities for a proto-Petra von Kant proliferation of non-human anthropomorphic objects, too. And the economy of the narrative keeps the pace engaging throughout. Reviews on here make it sound like this Sirk’s male melodrama, but Norma’s offscreen eternity of loneliness and longing—the abject outsiderhood of being defined as the “other woman”—is just as important as Clifford’s middle class angst, if not more so. I’m impressed by how elliptical the representation of their mutual passions is—there are big melodramatic declarations at the end, of course, but for the most part the romance is just dead in the cradle, stifled before it even really begins. No wonder it concludes in possibly Sirk’s most overtly dystopian ending.",4.5
"Many are satisfied by the traditional landmarks of marriage and family, but Douglas Sirk is making movies for the outliers--those who checked off all the boxes and are confused in their discontent.
Really interesting to see him apply his stylized empathy to a male viewpoint. Fred MacMurray quietly symbolizes a decent man who is paralyzed by his lack of satisfaction doing everything correctly until an old flame looks him up.
As shitty as his kids are in this, there is a stark realism in mental strife you undergo when you realize your parents aren't infallible, but just people making their own way in the world.",3.5
"An incisive examination of family life that somewhat comes to the defense of the father. Here Sirk contrasts the seemingly sappy with dead flowers, rain, and creepy toys as only he can. Fred MacMurray stuns as Cliff Groves, a toy maker with a beautiful wife of 20 years (Joan Bennett) and 3 kids who never give him the time of day. One day Barbara Stanwyck rolls into town as an old flame rekindling their fizzled out former attraction to each…",0.0

"Altruism: The Movie
There’s Always Tomorrow reunites Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, who enjoyed great success together in Remember the Night (1940) and Double Indemnity (1944). They also paired-up in a 1953 western called The Moonlighter. I’m guessing that these earlier cinematic liaisons served as useful shorthand for audiences in 1955. For me, though, it’s so long since I watched Double Indemnity that I barely remember it and I’ve never seen Remember the Night (although I do want to check it out).
Anyway, without any real knowledge of Stanwyck and McMurray’s onscreen history, it still works very well, which is just as it should be. And it’s a Douglas Sirk film, which means I expected melodrama, particularly given its position in his filmography but it's equal parts light romantic drama, which is an aspect of the movie I enjoyed.
The film’s third wheel is played by Joan Bennett. She’s Marion, Clifford (MacMurray)’s wife. And Norma (Stanwyck) is an old flame whom he’s not seen for years. I’m not going to spoil what happens but There’s Always Tomorrow could be viewed as a companion piece to 1949’s Reckless Moment, which provided Bennett with a much more prominent role. There's Always Tomorrow isn’t anywhere near as noir as that film and, here, Bennett’s character is oblivious to what is or isn’t going on behind her back.
Essentially, the film’s about growing up, particularly the male characters. (Sorry to shock you but I’m a man and I can attest to how difficult this is.) The story looks at both Clifford and his teenage son Vinnie (William Reynolds). The former is still hanging onto his youth and the latter… well, despite being a young adult, he retains a rather childish view of people and relationships. I guess the main theme of the film is the fragility of the male psyche. It’s only the women who know what’s up – just like in real life 😃.
And finally, There’s Always Tomorrow begs us to acknowledge the good things in our lives – and to hold on to them with all our might.",4.0
"There was a point at which this could've turned into a precursor of Antonioni's Story of a Love Affair, in which an investigation into an event precipitates the occurrence of that very event. In the end, though, it's more like a less self-reflexive version of what Past Lives more recently attempted, in the way that the wish-fulfillment fantasy of the leads (MacMurray and Stanwyck) getting together is predicated on extreme temporal concentration and the deliberate elision of a long-term relationship (in this case, some twenty years of marriage). The script is superbly structured: genre convention leads us to sympathize with the constraints experienced by the pair, but is counterweighted by our limited access to MacMurray's home life and our extremely partial access to his reunion with Stanwyck. And the entire cast, particularly the three children, with their varying ages and concomitant sense of their parents' marriage, is well used to reinforce the structure: we have about the same access to the mother as to the youngest daughter, who have the greatest and least sense of the marriage, respectively; the eldest son and his girlfriend, who are on the cusp of adulthood, take opposed sides, the former choosing to take the cynical view of his father, the latter grounding herself in the family history we don't see; and the younger daughter, who is in a stage of simulating ""emotional problems"" with her friends, goes along with her brother, in a sense preferring the drama that ensues. Put differently: our sense of the film as presenting two characters trapped or victimised by social circumstance is severely complicated by the structure, which makes it rather difficult to see the film as an indictment of bourgeois materialism, American domesticity, or whatever the usual line on Sirk is nowadays. (All That Heaven Allows, this is not.) The complexity of the Stanwyck character is quite well-judged in this regard: clearly interested in MacMurray, but genuinely eager to know his wife and family; intrigued by the power she is able to wield over him, but also realistic enough to avoid recklessness. In short, she is able to pull off the fantasy role while finally reinforcing the reality principle.",0.0
"Immaculate filmmaking from one of the most precise directors of the golden age of cinema. Even so, I found the ending of this to be totally unsatisfying and even a little cloying. Not to be too harsh but there's little reason to believe that MacMurray's character would go on living after all this. The music swells and the children are happy, having meddled in grown-up affairs, and Joan Bennett is completely clueless about what has transpired. Great performances all around of course, blocking and shot composition are perfect, but it lacks that bittersweet pizazz that makes Brief Encounter so very good.",4.0
"I was shocked how much this film got to me. I really felt for Fred MacMurray’s Cliff. Married to Marion (Bennett) who seemingly lets any of life’s minor entanglements come before her hard working husband who honestly busts his ass to spend time and enjoy companionship with her. 
At one point later in the film he tries having a deep conversation with her about his concerns and feeling a little ignored and taken advantage of and she flat out blows him off. As emotionless and blank as a drugged out Stepford wife. 
That robot Cliffs toy company has been working on, marching ahead blindly and mechanically until it falls off the end of the table a perfect metaphor for Cliff and Marion’s life together. 
Innocently enter Cliffs old design assistant and flame from 20 years ago, Norma (Stanwyk). She’s newly single and, I think it’s up for debate, the level of her romantic interest in Cliff. She seems lonely, not a lot of close friends and seems to just enjoy hanging out with Cliff for a few laughs. She’s adamant on meeting his wife and kid and does indeed make it for dinner. 
I actively disliked all of Cliffs kids, especially his eldest Vinnie who’s such a humorless, pompous buzzkill even his very nice and understanding girlfriend drops him like the drip he is. Take your James Mason affectation, astronaut haircut to the bricks, pal. 
Babs has a terrifically written scene which she knocks outta the park near the end where she’s explaining what the future would look like and the absence of his kids in his life should he leave his wife for the excitement of a new start. She’s right and he begrudgingly comes around. 
Just a nifty film and a strong reminder of the chemistry between Stanwyk and MacMurray. It made me want to watch Double Indemnity yet again.",4.5
"Douglas Sirk ranked
The American Dream is a nightmare
Every time someone talks glowingly about the good old days of the 1950s-1960s, it’s films like these that I want to make them watch. Because the shadow side of the American dream is a horror movie.
Cliff (Fred MacMurray) has everything: tastefully decorated upper middle class home, beautiful wife and children, domestic help, and a job he is good at (he runs a toy company). He also has nothing. His three children are entitled monsters and his wife (Joan Bennett) is so consumed by her role as being the perfect 1950s/1960s housewife that she is oblivious to him and his efforts to rekindle their love life. And then an old friend, Norma (Barbara Stanwyck) walks back into his life.
From what the internet tells me Douglas Sirk had a different darker ending in mind, but even with Ross Hunter’s interference, this is plenty dark.
I have had this on my watchlist forever because of Joan Bennett. Marion is not a great role for her because Marion is all surface, oblivious to Cliff as a human being. They give a dinner party for Norma where their children behave atrociously and yet Marion concludes that it went well. And in a supreme bit of irony, also sees Norma’s life as empty because she believes that all women want to be wives and mothers. And you can practically hear Cliff howling into the void.
The camera work is great. Cliff is often framed in a way that evokes prison. Babs, of course, is excellent. She underplays Norma quite beautifully and it’s very apparent that, despite Marion’s pronouncement, when Norma leaves LA for home that she’s going back to something larger than Marion’s pasteboard paradise.
I do wonder how Sirk would have interpreted this in color, but what he ended up with is nothing to sneeze at.
It’s a damned shame this is not better known.",4.5
"1955 Ranking 
Something so captivating about seeing Barbara Stanwyck play into her barbed sharp presence with the businesswoman side of Norma and when she cuts down the stupid kids (seems to be a melodramatic tradition lol) but also the warmth.

I liked this. Not one of the more visually memorable Sirks I’ve seen and wouldn’t have minded it being a little bit longer but I dug it largely.",4.0

"There's a moment at the very end of There's Always Tomorrow where a series of three shots articulates absolute longing in a way only the mechanics of cinema can:
a. Fred MacMurray gazing out his window, up into the sky
b. A distant airplane: just a dark, almost invisible smudge in a field of grey
c. Barbara Stanwyck, seated at the airplane window seat, tears glistening down her cheeks
The camera's gaze traverses a terrain beyond human vision. Here, the camera is a tool of parallels. The two lovers peer into each others' directions, separated by two fields: earth and sky. And yet, they cannot see each other. Cinema becomes the connective tissue, assembling what could've been two adjacent gazes into one shared look. It's a look of yearning, delivered with such understated emotion: an unforgettable image in one of Sirk's best films.
This is a sad movie about compromises. Not just individual compromises that form our relationships, but the larger ones too: compromises on our own lives. The idealistic image of a Rockwellian patriarch is smothered in exchange for a nuanced portrait of domesticity. It's a movie about foreclosing desire and youth. And so, Sirk's casting is ingenious: MacMurray and Stanwyck, two iconic lovers from Hollywood's past decade. They're older now, more withered. Stanwyck is forty-eight at the time, MacMurray forty-seven. Yet their romantic iconography becomes an intertextual substitute for the characters' own past intimacy. And that's why the weight of time manifests with such force in There's Always Tomorrow. It's like an epilogue to an era of Hollywood cinema.",4.5

"I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I am more familiar with Douglas Sirk from his influence on younger contemporary filmmakers (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Todd Haynes, Pedro Almodovar, Wong Kar-wai, David Lynch, and John Waters, amongst others) than from seeing his melodramas made in the 1950s. With only nine weeks left in the year, I thought it was time to remedy that omission.
Bernard C. Schoenfeld adapted the screenplay from a novel by Ursula Parrott, whose romantic fiction - novels and stories - had been adapted for several films and who practiced what she wrote about - reportedly having affairs with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis as well as four husbands. Edward Sloman had directed an early talkie with the same title (1934) adapted from Parrott's novel by William Hurlbut and starring Frank Morgan (pre his role as the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz), Binnie Barnes and Lois Wilson.
What makes Sirk's romantic melodrama stand out from similar films made in the late 40s and 50s is that the story flips the usual plot on its head. Here it is not the wife whose inner emotional life is being strangled and who is taken for granted, it is the husband.
When toy manufacturer Clifford Groves (Fred McMurray) arrives home from his Pasadena headquarters with theatre tickets and dinner plans to surprise his wife, Marion (Joan Bennett) on her birthday, she casually brushes him off because their youngest daughter, Frankie (Judy Nugent) has her first ballet recital that night. His other two children, teenage daughter Ellen (Gigi Perreau) and older only son, Vinnie (William Reynolds), turn down not only the invitation to accompany him but also to use both tickets, making it plain that their interests take precedence over his by a long way. That does not stop them hitting him up for cash for their nights out, though. Even the family's cook, Mrs Rogers (Jane Darwell) turns down the offer of the tickets as she is spending the night babysitting her grandchildren.
The kids here are exceptionally vile and self-centered, firmly establishing that millennials and Gen Z are not the only ones with a grossly overdeveloped sense of entitlement.
As Clifford is eating a lonely solo dinner at home (complete with wearing one of Marion's aprons to protect his clothes - Sirk is not subtle here with his symbolism) the doorbell rings and there on the rainy doorstep is Norma Vale née Miller (Barbara Stanwyck) who had worked as a toy designer for Cliff when he was just setting up his firm and is now a successful New York fashion designer. She of course, leaps at the chance to go to the theatre with him since she has been carrying an Olympic sized torch for him since they worked together years earlier.
As a set of innocent circumstances (which the kids discover and blow up into a grande crise that still manages to put them and their emotions at the centre of things) throws them together over the next week or so and, as Norma puts all her focus on him and his happiness, he comes to see just how unsatisfying his life with the family has become.
The three leads are excellent here. Stanwyck and McMurray had worked together before - in the romantic comedy Remember the Night (1940), the western The Moonlighter (1953), and their best-known pairing, the classic film noir Double Indemnity (1944) - and they are clearly very comfortable together here. While the film does spiral into melodrama as the end approaches and Norma and Cliff have to make some hard choices, their scenes together in Pasadena and Palm Springs are very effective at showing two adults approaching middle age realising that they are falling in love and really enjoying it. Bennett is also very good here at portraying the perfect 50s wife and mother, albeit that her inability to read what is going on emotionally within her marriage potentially risks everything that gives her life meaning and purpose.
Before the melodrama swamps the story line, both leads get their chance for a "" big scene"" and both of them nail it - McMurray where he pours out Cliff's frustrations to his startled wife who still doesn't really hear what he is saying to her, and Stanwyck where she turns on Vinnie and Ellen when they come to confront her and gives them some unfiltered feedback about what shits they are to their father.
Stanwyck, whose character's job as a fashion designer gives her the chance to wear some stunning clothes (by Jay Morley Jr.), is wonderful here and, although Sirk was disappointed that the studio knocked back his plans to film in Technicolour, I can't help thinking that Russell Metty's B&W cinematography works better for her than colour would have done. He and Sirk also are able to bring in some lighting and framing from Sirk's expressionist background and some of the use of light and shadow links back to the noir film his two stars had made with Billy Wilder twelve years earlier.
There is an interesting scene towards the end of the film where Norma has made her decision about what to do and Metty films her, with tears in her eyes, sitting inside a window which is the major light source for the scene. He frames her so that the rain running down the window pane reflects onto her face making it look as though she is weeping a river of tears. More than a decade later, cinematographer Conrad Hall would shoot a similar scene in Richard Brooks's In Cold Blood (1967), where Perry Hall (Robert Blake) appears to be weeping when talking about his father. Hall said at the time that his shot was unplanned and he only realised that the lighting set up he was using was creating the effect when he saw it through his camera lens. However, the similarity between the two scenes is very striking.
Although the ending was unlikely to rattle the constraints of the Hays Code, it is possible to read it as Sirk giving the ""perfect American family"" another solid jab. It is impossible to misread the implications of the final scene of Rex, the walking talking robot, headed towards a drop off the table top, and the film's title does not totally close off the possibility that the penultimate scene is another staging point and not the end for Cliff and Norma.
It has also inspired me to seek out some more Sirk films.
The extras on the Madman Director's Suite DVD include audio commentary by Melbourne critics and academics John Flaus and Adrian Martin; an essay by Melbourne Cinémathèque co-curator Adrian Danks; So Many Years . . ., an interview filmed for the DVD release with cast members Pat Crowley and Gigi Perreau; and Perspectives on the American Family, an interview with film and TV director Allison Anders who, notwithstanding the dirtiest feet I have even seen in this kind of documentary, has some interesting things to say about Sirk's treatment of the American family in his films.",4.0
"My first - long overdue - experience of Sirk, and trust me to pick one that everyone seems to describe as something of an outlier in his career! There's Always Tomorrow focuses on a man rather than the ""woman's pictures"" he is largely known for, but it still offers the nuance and sensitivity that I'd been led to expect from his films.
The story tells of Fred MacMurray's unappreciated husband as he reconnects with a woman from his past and begins to wonder what might have been. Barbara Stanwyck plays the woman from his past, which adds a sweet layer of extra chemistry, given their previous roles together, and their initially innocent reunion starts to enter dangerous waters - largely due to the suspicions of MacMurray's asshole son, who almost causes the disaster he's so desperate to avert.
Some elements of the story feel very much of their time (Joan Bennett's old-fashioned wife makes some sweeping statements about women's place being in the home, not the workplace) but the treatment of Stanwyck and MacMurray's almost-affair is quite progressive, and Sirk's sympathies make the story rise above its soap-opera roots. I also really liked the repeating motif of the song 'Blue Moon', which adds a sweetly nostalgic element.",4.0
"Man, this was great.
I had no idea it was a remake from a couple decades prior. I just happened across it on the Criterion Channel's list of films leaving March 31st, and when I saw that Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were teamed up again, I watched right away. Didn't even care what it was about.
I found this a lot more relatable than I expected to at first. Sometimes it can be easy to feel ignored when you're always moving at top speed without feeling acknowledged by your own family for your hard work and personal sacrifice. Now, I don't run my own business and definitely haven't rekindled an old flame out of some desire to escape my boring life (to be clear, my life is certainly boring, but I'm totally fine with that), but the theme of sometimes feeling lonely in your own house, even while surrounded by your loved ones, is a resonant one.
This is expertly directed, composed and edited. There isn't anything that really calls attention to itself, but there are several moments throughout the film where small, chance moments are blown up into larger issues, and they all come together so well with the way things are blocked, how the camera is positioned and moved and how things are cut together. It feels like the kind of film that won't ever get its just due on the technical front, but there is an admirable level of precision at work here.
The performances from the two leads are exactly as strong as I had hoped for, and the chemistry is great. They are both struggling to either accept or push away how they feel about each other, because of what that would mean for each of them. Cliff has a family that he loves dearly, even if he feels unappreciated by them. And Norma has a successful career she can't risk, especially because it would mean grappling with the idea of being a homewrecker. Joan Bennett also does well as Marion, and I appreciated that the story allowed her to be a trusting figure while the seeds of doubt were planted with the children. The acting from those children isn't great, though I'll give credit to William Reynolds as the oldest, Vinnie. I couldn't stand him for the way he often treated his sister and the giant assumptions he made at first, regardless of how things looked later in the story.
This takes a great look at how men value themselves and how the sexes view the ideas of success, happiness and virtue. People will always torture themselves over the what-ifs and what-might-have-beens of their lives, and a film like this works to show that there are layers, morality issues and deeper themes at play. Things aren't as simple as we want to make them.",4.0
"The Age of Innocence

"MacMurray's life, like most of the family men, is reduced to a ""robotic"" series of actions, just like his latest creation, the one he's most proud of: Rex, the talking automaton able to walks...it's a simbolic reflection of himself.
The point I dwelled on is: why did Stanwick return after 20 years to Murray, her secret love? What do she really want from him? Her ambiguity is splendid!
She seems to be constantly flirting with him, without wanting to point it out. She asks him to give up the second stage act for stay alone together (then she just wants to see his toy office), then she brings out all the fondest memories from their past.
She insist on getting to know his wife, is she genuinely interested about her or she is aiming for something else? Even Murray's photograph falling from her purse seems part of a plan to win him over.
And yet, finally, she seems to be really a selfless romantic (Stanwick in an altruistic role!)
I say ""she seems"" because when she rejects Mac Murray, even though she loves him, the question remains whether she does it for the good of Murray's family or simply because she does not accept a love forced by loneliness (she sees herself in him, married only for loneliness).
What really binds the two lovers is, in fact, loneliness.
What unites the two spouses instead is a certain good-natured naivety of those who do not realize what is happening and why (while Stanwick is able to do).
What they don't have in common instead is the kind of happiness they seek. For the mother, happiness is in the family, for Murray is in entertainment (contrary to what Stanwick says, I find that he neglects the children and not vice versa).",3.5
"The consensus take seems to be that Sirk recalibrated his “women’s picture” sensibilities for a masculine perspective here, when he’s sneakily inverted them instead, with the film’s emotional impact still hinging on Barbara Stanwyck, even if it cedes more screentime to Fred MacMurray. His suburban malaise is personable, until you chip away at it, and realize the position of privileged stability it originates from, so that he’s almost arrogant in what he believes he deserves, even if he means well (and endures some expectedly shitty Sirkian children). Stanwyck, on the other hand, occupies the more desperate social strata, wherein her age maroons her in an era where everyone is married off by a certain age; her happiness is at risk of being exclusively predicated on her being the other woman, a title she bravely bucks in that devastating last conversation with MacMurray, and the precise interval when Sirk’s radical narrative experiment unveils itself.",4.0
"I loved it. Stanwyck and MacMurray are fantastic as two old friends who meet up after 20 years. He's married with three kids and she's divorced and a successful clothes designer. Over the course of a few days they come close to having an affair. It's a simple story so well done by Sirk and the actors. Not sure what I think of Stanwyck's speech to his kids. Interesting to turn the blame around and not shame the adults.
Anyway, recommend it.",4.0
"Mediocre melodrama, but a great story exploring the frustration of married men who are ""taken for granted."" Don't often see this point of view, especially in older films. I appreciated that.

"Inmediatamente después de verla me ha quedado la sensación de que es la mejor de Sirk. Quizá cuando vuelva a las otras, que ya andan algo lejanas, puede que me decante por el color de All That Heaven Allows o la fantástica manera de mezclar guerra y amor de A time to love a time to die.
¿Por qué pienso que es la mejor? Porque me parece la película más concisa y extraña de cuantas he visto suyas, posee un personaje masculino realmente fascinante, y porque tiene los primeros 10 minutos que más me han impresionado desde hace mucho tiempo.
Sirk nos presenta a Fred MacMurray, que lleva un negocio de juguetes y de primeras lo vemos atrapado. Un par de conversaciones sobre un nuevo robot que han diseñado y todo filmado con travesaños, columnas, muebles y estanterías que cercan al personaje. Ya nos dice que, evidentemente, su trabajo le acarrea un agobio pese a que parece que funciona bien. De ahí pasamos a un plano de su casa, una vivienda que se nos muestra como una cárcel: al fondo los barrotes de la escalera, a la derecha los barrotes que separan el pasillo y el comedor, y también vemos arriba como asoman los barrotes del piso superior. Incluso las sillas del comedor recuerdan a la celda de una prisión con el respaldo lleno de varillas verticales. Llevamos 4 minutos y ya sabemos muchísimo de ese personaje y su vida. MacMurray aparece por la puerta, su hijo mayor en primer término, las escaleras en segundo y él al fondo (lo que nos da entender la relación que poseen distanciada). Cuando se acerca a saludarlo el hijo le manda callar. El padre, con unas flores en la mano, verá como su hija pequeña le saluda y pasa de largo. Sube las escaleras y no le da tiempo ni a besarse con su esposa (si no se fija bien la atención parece que sí se besan pero no, no llegan a juntar los labios porque otra de las hijas requiere la atención de la madre). El resto de la película es una consecuencia simple de lo que nos ha ido mostrando Sirk con pequeños detalles: que su familia pasa de él. Nadie quiere acompañarlo al teatro y se queda solo en casa cenando en su particular Sing Sing.
Estos diez escasos minutos le sobran a Sirk para primero, presentarnos al personaje sobre el que gira todo y el cual ya conocemos de sobra apenas ha comenzado todo, y para comprenderlo en futuras decisiones que tome. Él es un hombre de buen carácter y que parece no perder los papeles, que pese a que sus hijos y su mujer no lo tengan en cuenta sigue intentando reconducir la situación (las flores que trae al llegar a casa por el cumpleaños de su mujer por ejemplo), en cambio todo dará un giro cuando a su puerta toque Barbara Stanwyck.
Cuando se habla de Douglas Sirk siempre va acompañado el término puesta en escena. Pero, ¿qué es realmente la puesta en escena en Sirk? Todo lo comentado arriba y más, como por ejemplo cuando el robot creado por la empresa de juguete echa a andar por azar y MacMurray está al fondo entre luces y sombras; o cuando está leyendo el periódico en su casa, la cámara se sitúa detrás de su espalda, y tapa la foto en la que aparecen su mujer y sus hijos –pero él no– con un movimiento vertical de la gaceta. Toda la película está llena de detalles así que hacen fluir las imágenes maravillosamente.
Como también ocurre en muchas de sus películas, todos los personajes de alrededor son seres muy antipáticos, en este caso toda su familia, apegados a un conservadurismo que no entiende de edades, puesto que su hijo mayor es el que lo ejerce. Este aspecto refuerza, si cabe, la comprensión de los enamorados y toda decisión que vayan a tomar, ya que como viene siendo habitual todos los protagonistas de sus films son personas que viven en una burbuja, alejados de la mentalidad reinante, como si fueran seres venidos de otro planeta. Sus protagonistas casi siempre van a contracorriente, se aíslan de todo y de todos. Además, y como también ocurría en All That Heaven Allows, Sirk introduce la idea de que el tiempo se nos escapa de las manos, la fugacidad apegada a la rutina desde la primera vez que MacMurray entra en su casa y que Joan Bennet, su mujer, representa. Ella siempre rechaza cualquier plan a su marido aunque sea en fechas señaladas tales como aniversarios, dándole siempre prioridad a sus hijos.",5.0
"Here's another very Sirk-defining film and it makes us wonder once again, how it took so much time for cinephiles to find Sirk? I shouldn't be afterwise, I know, but his cinema is inseparably his own.

Here the stunningly beautiful emotion is achieved through understanding that ""everyone has their reasons"" and…",5.0
"Early on it becomes clear this isn't a movie about an unhappy marriage but about how raising a bunch of bratty kids can ruin your life, then Barbara Stanwyck gives this amazing monologue really laying into these shitty, spoiled teens and blaming them for their father considering adultery and it fucking ruled lol",3.5
"Perhaps it's appropriate that a filmmaker renowned for his looks at the pressures of women in postwar America would take a hard look at the pressures of men in that same society. Perhaps that's part of what makes Douglas Sirk a master ironist; if he can subvert traditional household roles of the time, why not subvert his own resume and give us one of the few ""men's issue films"" (strictly in the same sense of his ""women's issue films"") made by a major studio?
There's Always Tomorrow is a portrait of a man in a midlife crisis. On the outside, it would seem like Cliff Groves (Fred MacMurray) has it all: a successful business with a toy company in Los Angeles, nice suburban house, loving wife Marion (Joan Bennett), three children. Perfect nuclear family, right? So it would seem until a face from the past literally comes to his door.
The face belongs to Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck). Twenty years prior, she was an employee who designed clothes for his dolls before splitting to New York ""because she couldn't face reality"", as she explains late in the movie. Now, she is a successful fashion designer, formerly married but no children. With the family preoccupied for the night, he takes her to a show and catches up with her, continuing to do so when he takes a vacation that goes otherwise sideways.
Before long, the impression that they are having an affair is planted in the mind of Cliff's asshole son (William Reynolds). Despite the reasonable theories provided by his sister and his girlfriend, both of whom he treats so much like shit that it's amazing that both of them give him the time of day, he insists that he is carrying on based on mere instinct.
The fact of the matter, as laid out by Norma, is far more damning to the family. When Cliff saw Norma, he had started to realize the hollowness of his situation. He's being stifled by a family that takes him for granted, by a job that has lost its luster to him, by a life so ordinary that he feels like the very toy robot that his company manufactures. When he sees her, he remembers the passions that used to surround him in his youth, making the ""mistake"" of professing his love for her and his willingness to run away with her. It's an unlikely source that snaps him back to reality, a cold and harsh one that infers that the title is less a wistful sentiment and more of a prison sentence in a gilded cage.
Given the starkness of the material, it's amazing when one knows that, in a rarity for Sirk's melodrama phase, the movie being in black and white wasn't his idea, being instead imposed on him because of the jittery executives at Universal. The material, which is actually a remake of a 1934 movie based on a story by Ursula Parrott, calls for the exact opposite of the vivid color palette of Written on the Wind, and Sirk and cinematographer Russell Metty make great use of the circumstances, photographing the Groves house not unlike a prison, bars and all.
One has to wonder if his casting of MacMurray and Stanwyck was meant as part of the subversion. This was their fourth movie together, none more famous than Double Indemnity. No doubt that Sirk would lean on their tested chemistry together to invoke an image of the two lead characters of Billy Wilder's masterpiece if everything after their initial meeting at the staircase had been different. How would they have turned out? Would something like this be the result anyway?
In any event, it's a shame that we don't have more ironists in cinema. Our own society could use the type of mirror that Douglas Sirk wasn't afraid to hold up 70 years ago.",4.5
"1956 - USA was well into post WWII economic boom ‘golden age of capitalism’ unprecedented material prosperity in the history of the world; but…look through the eyes of Douglas Sirk at your average family dynamic and the demographic bulge - a marked increase in consumerism, houses, cars, family, leisure time, and emptiness [those three brats are the epitome of shallowness and banality].
This film looks at the American family of mindless relationships: a father - worked hard in successfully building his own business, goes to work, makes money, comes home like the robot allusion, mother - consumed with children perhaps finding asylum in children, eldest son - all-American jerk, eldest daughter - teenybopper, youngest daughter - clueless. Blah.
Despicable interactions, for these people there’s always tomorrow because they do not live much in the moment. Clifford (Fred MacMurray) has an inkling of this, questions it, and is open to change.
Yet here’s Norma (Barbara Stanwyck) sort of deprived of all this, sees the situation clearly and is immersed in the quagmire of her own loneliness. Does she envy the situation as an anodyne for her sorrow? Of course not but she cannot save Clifford from the social norm of the time. It's too high a price to pay. And she cannot consummate her love for him for the same reason.
It's clearly a soaper but it's a relic with such mastery of character portrayal by Sirk, MacMurray, Stanwyck and Bennett.",4.0
"""That's the hardest job in the world, to learn to give love and expect nothing in return.""
Although lacking his famous tools of technicolor and cinemascope, and featuring a romance whose conclusion is deterministic under the production code, Sirk's tonally-tuned B&W riffs on the same themes as All That Heaven Allows* and delivers an exponentially more devastating conclusion. Deepened by Stanwyck and MacMurray's re-teaming as careful withholder and naive dreamer respectively, its tear-strewn, now lined faces take on a weight far greater than this contained narrative.
Makes the case for Sirk to join the ranks of Hitchcock and Ray as champion of cinema du escalier. While David Lynch may have zeroed in on the ceiling fan as psychic dumping ground, the definitionally liminal staircase is the nucleus of domestic strife.
*boomer teens as a deleterious force on society, consumerism and conservative values turning the average American man to automaton, and the wry irony that in the freest country of the world it is not your self-image that matters, but your reflection in the eyes of others.

"This is a bit more straightforward than Douglas Sirk's best melodramas, and being in black-and-white it's not quite as visually alluring either. But it's still terrific, proving that regardless of all the satire and psychoanalysis critics have retroactively attributed to his work, he was essentially a populist; that's not to say that he gleefully churned out trash, but rather that he always had a finger on the pulse of both his characters and his audience - one particular image late in the film, in which rainwater pouring down a window casts Barbara Stanwyck's face in a teary shroud, encapsulates the Hollywood melodrama's nakedly earnest appeal to the emotions.

"God-level takedown of capitalism and heteronormativity with Sirk at the top of his game. It’s outrageous that this isn’t mentioned in the same breath as ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and WRITTEN ON THE WIND, his defining work of this period.
The reunion of MacMurray and Stanwyck is especially potent a little over a decade after DOUBLE INDEMNITY. MacMurray will forever be known as the Absent-Minded Professor and the villain of THE APARTMENT, but he was quite the leading man too. Stanwyck is just off-the-charts spectacular as always, and though both characters are flawed the real antagonist (as in all Sirk films) is the repressive society that squashes individual hopes and desires.
Universal didn’t give Sirk the budget to shoot this in color, and I think it might be more well-known if they had. But that doesn’t stop Russell Metty from crafting some astounding images - the house as a confining, prison-like space, and a rain shower reflected like tears onto Stanwyck’s face.
While a few elements have dated, it’s remarkably wise for a film over 60 years old, and although the dynamic between MacMurray and Stanwyck isn’t as fiery as in DOUBLE INDEMNITY or even REMEMBER THE NIGHT, the passage of time is a sobering reminder that we only get one chance to find happiness in life.

"Aching, painful longing; an exploded view of the repressed wants of the happy family unit. Sirk constantly pushes us to look at the various moving pieces from the outside in, each exaggerated emotion ringing louder through the window panes. While our perspective is pinned to hopelessly pining “nice guy” family man Clifford Groves, it’s his old flame Norma Miller who proves the most intriguing, hemmed in on all sides by the social stigma of being an unmarried older woman. The final scenes are some of Sirk’s best, burrowing into what it means to owe anyone anything, and the way we aggrandise the supposed sacrifice of the breadwinner.",4.0

"“Love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it isn't even a good thing. When you're young and in love, nothing matters except your own satisfaction.“
This is an extraordinarily restrained and thoughtful piece of work; those who think of Sirk as soapy and over-the-top won't find too much of that behavior here - except, unfortunately, in William Reynolds as son Vinnie who seems to take the oedipal thing way too far in an otherwise fairly realistic film; he also seems to have a slightly different, sort of upper-crust accent, which threw things off a bit for me. All three of the Groves kids seem in a sense to represent a conservative, critical and nosey sensibility, going at times well beyond the more placid attitudes of their mainstream, middle-class parents, and I think that while their roles and attitudes are important, there might just be a bit too much focus on them.
This film could have been corny in lesser hands but wasn't and remains, 50+ years later, pretty relevant in its themes and still isn't dated. The buildup is nice... at the beginning, we see Groves (Fred MacMurray) enduring the small disappointments of life, his wife (Joan Bennett) and children too busy for him. He doesn't really realize how sad he is, until Vale's (Barbara Stanwyck) appearance. Gradually, what starts as just catching up with an old friend becomes more, as his unhappy family life pushes him further. And Vale is dealing with her own unhappiness (poignantly understated in a simple scene with a photo). ""Blue Moon"" is a frequently used song, and it is very effective at setting the mood.
The ending is emotionally devastating, for both Groves and Vale (Sirk more often than not rips my heart out in these tear-jerkers). I've read that he originally wanted an ending with a little more finality to it, but the ending here, though conventional on the surface, is also (to my interpretation) ambiguous enough to be quite crushing in its open-ended nature—the title of the movie has to be some kind of dark, ironic joke...

"Lesser-known, lower-key Douglas Sirk dissection of domestic discontent and a husband’s mid-life crisis made a decade or so before that term came into common usage and the idea became a cliché pervading popular culture. Toy manufacturer Fred MacMurray is unsettled and unhappy despite (or, perhaps, because of) having the perfect stay-at-home wife (Joan Bennet) and family. This he begins to recognize only after his old flame (career women Barbara Stanwyck) comes to town and their relationship rekindles on ambiguous terms. The suspicions and judgement of society are personified by Fred’s son played by William Reynolds who seems to have been Sirk’s ideal representative for mid-century American priggishness and self-involvement since he served the same function that same year as Jane Wyman’s loathsome son in Sirk’s All That Heaven Allows. This film is less floridly melodramatic than that or at least seems to be, possibly because it is presented in black and white, not glorious technicolor. Or possibly because the core transgression, a husband possibly cheating on his wife, is less threatening to the social order than a respectable older woman carrying on with a younger man, especially with a studly hunk like Rock Hudson.",3.5
"Reuniting Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray for the last time, 12 years on from the flawless Double Indemnity, There's Always Tomorrow is a study in unfulfillment and neglect, posing as a romantic melodrama. What makes There's Always Tomorrow unusual, other than Douglas Sirk's sensitive direction and the noir-tinged shadowy photography, is that the focus is on the male being unhappy in a melodrama, rather than the female.
Fred MacMurray is the ignored party, suffering a mid-life crisis; his family are busy with friends and ballet, while he sits at home, alone barely eating. It is a nice transfer of the usual equation; it is essentially a ""women's picture"" with a gender realignment. It is Brief Encounter, or Max Ophuls' Caught, with a male slant.
The film is beautifully directed and produced. Made during the absolute peak of Douglas Sirk's powers. The film he made before it was All that Heaven Allows, the film after was Written on the Wind. His melodramas at this time were consistent masterworks. There's Always Tomorrow is not quite in that league, however it is very good. My only major critique is that the film is only 81 minutes long; which means though it moves at a good pace, a little more run-time would have allowed Sirk to ratchet up more tension, and play with more character moments. However, this is mere wish fulfillment criticism, as what we have is excellent.
Barbara Stanwyck gives a superb, heartbreaking performance as the other woman, to Fred MacMurray's unsatisfied husband. While Joan Bennett treads a fine line between being unsympathetic and letting the plot unfold. My favourite support performance was Pat Crowley as Ann, a slight outsider to the family. Crowley trades dialogue with aplomb, against any of the three major actors.
There's Always Tomorrow is a really fine picture, from a major director. It may not be as well respected as his best work, but this is another triumph from Douglas Sirk. Regressive politics overcome by movie magic and ironic robots; isn't it always the way?",4.0
"In one of his later interviews — possibly with Jon Halliday, possibly Fassbinder — Sirk talks about this as almost an addendum to All I Desire, an unfinished thought that didn’t measure up to the earlier film. As much as I enjoy All I Desire, there’s a reason I own a lobby card for this movie. It isn’t the only male-centered melodrama in Sirk’s Hollywood career — The Tarnished Angels would come later — but it is unique in being so domestic in scope. This is a gender-swapped version of the film immediately before this, All That Heaven Allows, right down to William Reynolds being literally the worst son ever.  Clifford Groves, like Cary, is living a life of quiet desperation, aching to make a connection with anyone at all, but hemmed in by the weight of societal expectations.

"Another Douglas Sirk romantic melodrama.
If this was made by at least 90 % other directors, it would be average at best. But Sirk focuses on Fred MacMurray’s character as the gentle and sensitive and often ignored “man of the house”. He’s feeling like life is passing him by, while his kids and wife keep making plans that don’t include him. One day, an ex employee comes unexpectedly comes back into his life.

"To be upfront, I typically prefer Fred MacMurray in darker roles such as The Apartment and Double Indemnity over his more chaste, “aw shucks” fare.

"This is the second time I've become emotionally invested in a 1950s melodrama starring Barbara Stanwyck and boy did I enjoyed this. There's just something about melodramas and Barbara Stanwyck that really hits me, ya know? Anyway, here's why I love this movie so much.
First of, there's just the general premise and vibe of the movie. A tale of two people hung up over missed opportunities and what-ifs coupled with themes of neglect and marital monotony? I eat that shit up. Plus, there's the spellbinding chemistry between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. They were just as enchanting here as they were in Double Indemnity. Naturally, it is also mandatory for me to commend the performances of everyone here as this movie wouldn't have been possible without them. Like I previously mentioned, special props to Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray with their ""right person, wrong timing"" dynamic and making me actually root for them even if they were almost having an affair. Joan Bennett also shined here as Marion Groves, the oblivious and emotionally distant wife of Cliff Groves. The fact the film never portrayed her in a bad light is just so refreshing to me because often in movies there has to be a horrible spouse to justify an affair but here, Marion's only flaw was being too focused with the children and housework and neglecting her husband's emotional needs which is not even considered a flaw by some people. Anyway, I wanna thank the actors of the kids for playing the most annoying children in the planet. They weren't that bad, just extremely bad with communication but they were still really annoying so props to them. I sure hope those kids actually treat their dad right after the movie ends. And major props to Pat Crowley as Ann for playing the only non-adult character with more than a half a braincell.
Overall, I highly highly recommend this film if you wanna feel empty and sad for the next few hours. Idk why but this just resonated with me so deeply. Maybe it's the what-ifs of Cliff and Norma's relationship. Oh well, I also let you know that I teared up at the ending so there's that warning

"""It's so easy for a man to slip into a rut and once he's caught in it, he doesn't dare do the things he used to do, he doesn't feel the excitement he used to feel. If anything he feels a little scared of life.""
Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray team up again, this time with Douglas Sirk at the helm, and they're not out to commit the perfect murder but instead, the perfect heartbreak.
I will always sing the praises of Fred MacMurray as the antidote to the mid-century macho man. In There's Always Tomorrow, he stars as Clifford Groves, a toy manufacturer whose wife declines his romantic gestures and whose kids treat as a walking, talking bank. Then, out of blue, returns an old flame, Norma Vail, played by the inimitable Barbara Stanwyck, and sparks immediately begin to fly. Clifford Groves is such a unique character for the 1950's: the neglected husband. Most depictions of married men in this era uphold traditional masculinity, with the man being the unquestionable head honcho; for Cliff, it seems like quite the opposite. Fred MacMurray never had the ego many of his contempories had and he wasn't afraid of playing men who didn't come out on top and never does it show better than in There's Always Tomorrow. MacMurray takes on his most vulnerable role yet. There's such a marvelous sensitivity and emotionality in his work that it is impossible to envision any other actor as Cliff Groves. If there was any role where he should have been nominated for an Academy Award and won, it's this. The yearning in his eyes at the last scene as he watches the plane taking Norma back to New York will bring tears to yours.",5.0

"[Mild spoilers for this 65 year old film]
A mid-life crisis melodrama framing social conformity as a personal emotional prison.
The title is a jaded label for a world where everybody is either miserable or fooling themselves. The son is “suspicious,” his girlfriend is “gullible.”
Ellen’s piano playing sucks. “Ellen is doing so well with her music, isn’t she?”
The single career woman pines for a family… until she doesn’t. She’s not really conflicted “I have my life” and nobody mentions what busting up the home would mean to the man’s wife.
According to this story the real torture victim of post-war Levittown 9-5 suburban hell is the husband who, because of the social stigma of divorce, has to choose between his love for his old flame (who, again, is meh on the whole idea) or ever seeing his kids again.

"For me, watching a Douglas Sirk melodrama is not dissimilar to watching sports in that I spend the entire time screaming at the television. In the case of Sirk, instead of bitching at the refs for blowing a call, I'm getting mad at the teen-aged characters who are always interfering with the love lives of their parents and shouting things like, ""Vinnie, you ungrateful little shit, leave your dad alone and let him fuck Barbara Stanwyck already!"" It's a lot of fun.",4.5
"Douglas Sirk movies always make me stop and think, do I *really* want children?",3.0
"A revisit of this black-and-white gem confirmed that There's Always Tomorrow is as good as anything that Sirk has put forth, save for the utterly overwhelming emotional heft of Imitation of Life and All That Heaven Allows. Toy-maker Cliff (Fred MacMurray) may feel taken for granted by his wife Marion (Joan Bennett) and his three children, but he's also never a caricature: this is a mid-life crisis, not a full-blown marriage-in-crisis, and that's a much more compelling narrative. Sirk's understanding of gender dynamics is masterful here—Cliff's longing for the excitement and spousal attention of pre-children youth is much more powerful than normal because, frankly, he's not a dick. He's frequently thoughtful and tries to plan romantic getaways with his wife; he's polite and warm; he works with toys, for heaven's sake! His desires seem to be for balance, not self-centered ego-filling. One gets the sense he'd be perfectly content with weekly evenings out and occasional lingerie. And yet, he's still obviously oblivious to how much Marion takes on with keeping the house and raising three boisterous kids—an observant, knowing comment by Marion near the finale about where they are in their lives really resonates as hitting the nail on the head.
Meanwhile, Norma (Barbara Stanwyck) serves to fill the supposed hole in Cliff's heart, but as a strong, career-oriented woman, she's hardly just a supporting pretty face. In fact, she's the perfect complement to Cliff and Marion—fiercely successful, smart, and loving, but lacking the familial touch and, despite appearances, also missing something in life. Their newfound rapport is built on genuine common interests and feelings—they were sweethearts 20 years prior to Norma knocking on Cliff's door—but also symbolizes that bittersweet need to rekindle a connection built on the sense of optimism that can only come from the (mostly) unknown. Nuances such as this are what make There's Always Tomorrow so, so strong. Vinnie (William Reynolds), the oldest son, smoothly adds a layer as the suspicious son whose guess of a full-blown affair between Norma and Cliff—and subsequent headstrong actions—are simplistic as only a teenager can be, if not lacking in some (major) level of truth. When Cliff tells Norma that he loves her, it's hard for us to know how much is that and how much is his infatuation with the idea of her. MacMurray and Stanwyck, 12 years after teaming up in Double Indemnity, are both lights out here, hitting all the notes with just the right levels of pitch.

The moment MacMurray and Stanwyck reunite on screen (for their characters about the same amount of time has passed since they first fell in love as different people in their first film together) is one of those perfect, mythic movie magic moments because of the actors' shared histories in other worlds. We recognize them their union as both fated and meant-to-be (Remember the Night) and devastatingly toxic (Double Indemnity). It's the perfect recipe for the most impossible impossible romance and that is my favorite sort of romance.

"Douglas Sirk frequently makes some of the most beautiful color films I’ve ever seen, and here he made one of the most beautiful B&W movies I’ve ever seen. The use of pitch black shadow is astounding.
It’s also a wonderful, emotional story that rarely gets told. Sirk takes the “married guy wants to have an affair” story and examines the question of “why?” deeply to create a film with sympathy and understanding for everyone involved. 
Everytime Joan Bennett says “alright I’m going to sleep now, goodnight”, you feel MacMurray’s pain. Sirk just wants people to have sex more, and you gotta respect him for it.",4.5
"This is one of those movies which I wish existed in a form where it was longer without actually adding any scenes or making the film more expansive. I think this slightly suffers from the moments not playing as long as they could and there not being enough to perfectly establish the emotion at hand.
The story is quite great in its own right. A working father and a husband feels neglected because he yearns for a connection with his family, but the moment he comes home his kids and his wife are too busy for him since they understandably have lives of their own. He plans a trip for just him and his wife, but just before the trip the wife can't go because the youngest kid sprains his ankle. The ankle sprain is a rather nifty injury to pick because while it definitely hurts and requires care, it's nothing that the maid and the older siblings couldn't handle. So the wife insisting on staying home to tend to the kid does signal that she's so attached to motherhood that she can't let go for even just two days.
The man ends up going alone as he coincidentally is able to schedule a business meeting to the destination to justify the trip. He comes across an old friend he used to work together who's now divorced. A tension and a connection flares up between them which becomes overwhelmingly strong as it is contrasted with his mundane life. He luckily isn't portrayed like a flimsy man who's chasing the first sight of excitement even though Stanwyck is stunning and one could think that way. Sirk wisely starts of by showing MacMurray simply seeing Stanwyck like an old friend. There is not lust in his eyes which completely sells you on them having just been friends. The lust only comes later when their connection grows.
Having more time in the narrative to let the emotion grow would make the film better as MacMurray's turns at times happen a little too soon and I think the film could have used more moments to fully convince me on his emotional drive. All of what happens in the movie makes sense, but I struggled a little at times because MacMurray partially acted selfishly and didn't downplay his emotions when he really should have for the sake of decency since he's a married man with children. I empathize with his dissatisfaction, but the film doesn't make me fully feel his dissatisfaction and I think it really should have.
The Bigamist doesn't really have anything in common with this film considering the stories are so vastly different, but I would say that both films have the connection of a man engaging in something which is ""wrong"", but which would also be understandable. The difference just is that The Bigamist makes a far better impression when it comes to the male lead being as well intended and empathetic as he can be and this one clearly wants us to empathize with the man, but I'm not fully sold in on him.
I still love the whole movie because the tone is fantastic and the subtext is sound when it comes to the examination of heteronormative family norms. The performances are also great especially from the three leads and the ending is just downright juicy in its melancholy. I also just wish that it had been a little longer.
As much as this is quintessential 50s cinema with its melodrama, I genuinely think a fantastic remake could be made out of the story with today's indie drama sensibilities.",4.5

On that level, sure, I can appreciate the multi-entangled depiction of the domestic as 20th century spiritual prison (trapping the hapless family man within and locking the intelligent career woman out), but this is every inch the graceless, didactic melodrama Sirk was accused of making before the auteurists got their hands on him. The films idea of moral shading is to balance out the nefarious, buzz-killing teenagers who are certain dad’s having an affair despite having zero evidence by, get this, making dad get interested in having said affair AFTER said teenagers have already convinced themselves. Oh the dramatic irony! Doesn’t help that the emotional distance shown by his sexless wife is toggled on-and-off depending on whether we’re supposed to sympathize with his entrapment or tsk-tsk his actions.

"Easily one of the most underrated movies of all time, There's Always Tomorrow might just be one of the saddest films ever made. This movie blew me away the first time I saw it and blew me away again today. Another masterpiece of 1950s melodrama, There's Always Tomorrow is an amalgamation of Sirkian themes. For one, the film is about the suffocating existence of middle class suburbia. Part of me finds this film to actually be a dark comedy because I find so much humor in how miserable the American Dream actually is. Other common Sirk themes include the crisis of womanhood stemming from the dilemma between career pursuits and domesticity as well as the toxic consequences of gossip. But my God, Sirk directs the hell out of this film. First of all, Sirk wanted this to be in Technicolor but the studio refused. The fact that the world was deprived of another Sirk Technicolor masterpiece is sickening. However, I'm not as pissed as I should be because although Sirk is renowned for his use of Technicolor, he was equally a master of expressionism. Shot by master cinematographer and frequent Sirk collaborator Russell Metty, There's Always Tomorrow is a breathtaking visual experience. The deep focus expressionist cinematography brilliantly emphasizes the tragedy of the story at hand. The shot of MacMurray sitting alone, blackened by shadows, smoking a cigarette while his wife tends to the children is gut wrenching. Oh, and of course that shot of Stanwyck next to the window while the rain reflects on her face making it appear as if she is crying is orgasmic. Sirk's mastery of mise en scene is also fully on display in the film. Love how Sirk uses the home, particularly windows and banisters, to make it appear as if the home is a prison. There's also a fantastic sequence involving candles that visually separate and represent the doomed fate of the characters. There's Always Tomorrow is also another Sirk film that originally had a different ending. However, I actually prefer the ending included in the film, because it's reaped in irony. It has the appearance of being a happy ending yet is anything but. And that gets us to another major Sirkian theme, appearances. The 1950s were all about the artificiality of appearances. The American Dream is a facade, a nice cover up for a society in turmoil. I said this yesterday in my review of All I Desire but I'm definitely buying this movie very soon. It's certainly one of my personal favorites",5.0
"99/100
Sirk, every the autocritical maker of melodramas, takes one of the most basic and effective narrative templates ever conceived- an emotional affair between two repressed individuals- and pursues it from every possible angle, giving every principle role a well-developed perspective that they’re never able to fully communicate to the other characters. The result is nigh unbearably moving- like the director somehow engineered an Ibsenian level of emotional complexity out of Brechtian dialectical dramatics. Almost certain this would be regarded as the filmmaker’s best work if it was shot in color.",5.0

"The Fred MacMurray risking it all for Barbara Stanwyck cinematic universe got to be my favourite franchise. He’s just like me. But nah seriously their chemistry is amazing as per. Sirk’s direction has a lot of flair here and the cinematography slaps as I’ve come to expect in his films. I enjoyed every minute of this due to the concise scrpit and symbolic silhouettes within it. It wasn’t afraid to get bleak and really subverted some classic hollywood romances tropes. A deep, layered and powerful voyage into the male psyche on several fronts.",4.0

"Idk, maybe I am addicted to the drama because almost every Douglas Sirk movie I've seen is a 5 star movie to me! I love his direction, his emphasis w/ shadows, especially in the Groves' home, and his knack for pushing his camera into the scene- highlighting character moments and observations and amping up the emotion! Superb direction in There's Always Tomorrow with solid shot compositions, and juxtapositions - whether it be a shot of two characters, or a man next to a picture of his family (as he thinks of his mistress). Intelligent staging!! He always holds the shots just long enough to break your heart.
Unlike most melodramas, There's Always Tomorrow centers on a man. Sirk usually depicts suburbia as a prison, specifically for women, and how it limits people to the straight and narrow. I find his focus and scope to be surprisingly nuanced and biting for his time. I was afraid the movie would be a soft apologia for adultery, but with Fred MacMurray's nuanced performance and Sirk's emphasis on the family, it's easy to relate to Cliff on some level. The emotions are rich! It's not always a subtle movie, everything with the toy robot was hilariously effective yet on the nose! But There's Always Tomorrow is a powerful reminder that marriage and conformity also harms men in ways often less examined in fiction.
So much of the movie is wondering ""if they will or they wont"" hook up. And Vinnie reflects his father's masculinity - he thinks love is being in control or something you can take. I couldn't stand Vinnie!
But Cliff and Norma are also allowed to be messy characters too. We see Cliff crossing every boundary time and time again. And Norma's speech about their potential affair to Cliff's children would be quite cruel if she didn't also lay it into Cliff a scene later. The movie's ending is bittersweet. Their relationship represents a simpler time in the past for Cliff. His complicated present makes him yearn for yesteryear - it's so relatable!
Joan Bennett is so sweet as Marion. All that grace for a man about to cheat on you!!

Spoilers follow.
There's Always Tomorrow is a prison movie disguised as a melodrama, and while there is an optimistic way to interpret the ending for at least one of the main characters, there's also a much greater number of ways to interpret it as some form of soul-crushing purgatory for him, while the other two primaries are consigned to a ghost of a marriage and a life lived loveless.
The tragedy for Fred MacMurray is that even if the movie ended the other way, he can't ultimately be happy there, either. He's succeeded too well at living the life he's ""supposed"" to live, and too much of the programming is hard-wired into him to ever truly escape. For a few beautiful days, he thinks he's Neo, seeing The Matrix and even how to break it, but actually he's Cipher; he can see The Matrix, all right, but if he left it wouldn't be long before he was begging for a way to plug back in (and like Cipher, he'd have to betray the woman he loved to do it, and probably would).
MacMurray is the perfect actor for the part, both for his sheer talent (which is considerable) and his own specific cinematic legacy. We have seen him before, many times, as the kindly suburbanite. We have also seen him before as the ultimate cog in the American dream (and dream-crushing) machine (The Apartment) and more than once before we have seen him meet Barbara Stanwyck and find her awakening a thrilling, dangerous part of himself he didn't know was there (Remember the Night, Double Indemnity). All that familiarity heightens the effect of his inescapable rut, and makes his eventual resignation to it heartbreakingly routine.
Stanwyck is, of course, electrifying. I recently noted in a review of Baby Face that as great as she was there, she'd be even better later and, well, this is later. The movie lets her rope-a-dope us for most of its runtime, with us mostly locked into Fred's point of view, before unleashing Babs late in the game with two searing emotional eviscerations, first of Fred's kids, then of Fred himself, and they're the two best scenes in the movie. She can also see The Matrix, but the difference between her and Fred is that she knows he can never break out, and more than that, that even if he could he probably shouldn't.
Joan Bennet is our third and final character of any substance, Fred's loving wife, who's settled into the routine just fine and can't imagine why anyone else wouldn't. It's a perfunctory part the movie needs to be there, and in many ways Bennet is overqualified to play it, but seeing a star of her magnitude confined in this blandly pleasant serial domesticity works for what the movie is doing thematically.
The movie is not perfect, though it's also not terribly far off. The weak spots are gnat bites, not bullet holes, only mildly irritating and small enough to go easily unnoticed unless you're already thinking about them. MacMurray and Bennet have three children, none of whom can really act*, but all of whom have to be there to shove the plot along. Occasionally the metaphors can get too cute by half (the robot toy near the end may as well have had on-screen SparkNotes to make sure we get it). The film moves along at a good pace, but probably could have gotten a little more mileage, and a lot more melodrama, out of the segment of the story between Fred's confession and Babs' rebuttal. The plotting generally is just good enough to get from Point A to Point B, but never particularly clever or inventive. And so forth.
*Though at least one of them does have a girlfriend who can, played by Pat Crowley.
But ultimately it's a great little horror story/morality play/melodrama depending on which level you want to meet it, and it certainly brought today's cinematic batting average up for me.

"There’s always tomorrow is a great film about the loneliness of being a man. Being stuck within an environment that doesn’t care about you as much as others, forced to wallow away so that others can be supported off of you, and not able to do anything due to what others need. The story is about Clifford groves, a toy maker with a beautiful wife and kids that don’t seem to want to notice him. He reconnects with a childhood sweetheart and starts to genuinely have a conversations and experience that youthful joy he has been missing. But life and society seem to make him be forced to stay within his own depressed life, and the main question is will he be able to get out of it?
The acting is great from everyone in the cast. Mcmurphy in particular is absolutely great in this, his constant desperation to have an emotional connection being very palpable and his wanting to regain his youthful ambition is perfectly captures through Mcmurphys line delivery and physical performance. Barbra stanwick is also wonderful in playing a woman who is also dealing with that emotional loneliness and is able to get a really fiery and powerful performance. This is especially true during the climatic scene with Lenny, Clifford’s son, where her demeanor and powerful voice makes a messagey monologue into a beautifully powerful scene. All the other actors are also great and sirk is really able to get great performances out of his casts, even if he has similar types of characters to his other films I’ve seen (an uncaring son, a teenage daughter that is typical 50s etc)
The photography in this is great, with its expertly designed composition and beautiful use of lighting. What I especially love is how sirk blocks everything so that there are barriers and entrapments that are surrounding Clifford. It’s similar to how he used mise en scene in all that heaven allows as a tool to tell his story; but, instead of using color as a guide for the audience and to show the inner-emotions of the characters he uses intensely deep focus shots, dynamic camera moves to have us focus on the scene, and a brilliant use of the scenery to show the isolation and alienation that he feels and what makes him want to be with Stanwick. I also loved how Sirk uses composition to tell the story effectively, not just for the pretty images, even if the dialogue can get a bit on a nose at points.
Now for the story itself, it’s well told and illustrates the point of how societal conventions imposed on men lead to distance from familial life. It’s a very sharp critique on that aspect of society that seems to even be prevalent today and it’s one I really appreciated being told in a story. I also appreciated the theme of the sort of midlife crisis that Clifford has, wanting to regain his youth through the freedom of being with someone from his youth. I thought those aspects really did work well.The plot is well paced and the hour and a half runtime goes by quickly. The set design is absolutely fantastic and works in the mise en scene that is meticulously planned to show the isolation. 
If there were some problems I had with it, it would be that I absolutely hated the kids in this film. They’re overly entitled and unsympathetic towards the father, Lennie basically acts as the antagonist by not believing in his father and assuming something he shouldn’t have ever believed. Lennie is obnoxious to watch and he gets so much screen time to ruin everything and be a spoiled brat. I know that it is the point and all but it doesn’t stop the fact that all of this melodrama comes from something that could have been solved with a simple talk or understanding. I get this is a melodrama and all, and I even respect the film for its ending for the darker elements of it. 
Personally I think I’m a bigger fan of all that heaven allows, or his use of color in general,  but this was great. I loved the photography along with the themes of it, and it is definitely a film that if I watch again as an older man that I’ll find it even better.

"ENGLISH VERSION BELOW
Barbara Stanwyck kehrt nach vielen Jahren der Abwesenheit in ihr altes Kaff zurück, trifft auf einen alten Bekannten und bringt - ziemlich viel durcheinander...
Ziemlich bald stellte sich bei mir ein Déjà-vu ein. Gleicher Regisseur, gleiche Hauptdarstellerin, ähnliche Prämisse. Die verhandelten Themen: Geschlechterrollen, Lebensausrichtung (Karriere/Familie) und -mittelpunkt (Stadt/Land). Dazu das unangenehme Gefühl, dass sich ergibt, Menschen mittleren Alters beizuwohnen, die fundamentale Entscheidungen Jahrzehnte später hinterfragen...
Im Direktvergleich zu „All I desire“ mag dieser Douglas Sirk Streifen zwar etwas runder sein, doch durch die fehlende Mutter-Kind-Dynamik ist er weit weniger bitter und fällt für mich etwas ab.
Dennoch gilt das Gleiche: Durch die nachvollziehbaren Themen, starken Charaktere und tadellose Inszenierung mag „There’s Always Tomorrow“ Herz-Schmerz-Kino sein aber eins auf verdammt hohem Niveau!

Barbara Stanwyck returns to her old town after many years of absence, meets an old acquaintance and - quite a lot of things get mixed up...
Pretty soon I had a feeling of déjà vu. Same director, same leading actress, similar premise. The themes dealt with: Gender roles, life direction (career/family) and centre (city/country). Plus the uncomfortable feeling of watching middle-aged people questioning fundamental decisions decades later...
In direct comparison to ""All I desire"", this Douglas Sirk flick may be a little more rounded, but the lack of mother-child dynamics makes it far less bitter and it falls a little short for me.
Still, the same holds true: Through the comprehensible themes, strong characters and impeccable staging, ""There's Always Tomorrow"" may be heartbreak cinema but one on a damn high level!

"I would like to say that this film is responsible for two things: first is that it made me realize just how important blocking can be and the second was confirming Barbara Stanwyck as my favorite actor from classic Hollywood. So, it is a fair reason to revisit this on Stanwyck's birthday. Plus, rewatching this also furthers my need to watch more Sirk films, this still being the only one I have seen.
There’s Always Tomorrow explores how the mechanical nature of our lives—that is in its repetitiveness—perpetuates a feeling of loneliness created by a prison of routines. Even Cliff (Fred MacMurray) proclaims the lifestyle of him and his nuclear family is a tomb of his own making. That tomb or prison or whatever you want to call it, is the occurrence from years of routine that feel like robotic steps getting ever closer to the edge. Sirk establishes this notion through his excellent use of blocking and framing of characters.
Through just the simplest of blocking and framing, both the family dynamic of the Groves is established and the dynamic between Cliff and Norma (Barbara Stanwyck). By presenting the characters through an obscured frame, the prison-like bars through which characters are repeatedly framed by in the Groves’ house or how the kids partake in a voyeuristic observation of their father. In some way, Sirk is constantly able to visualize the emotional distance between the characters that only exacerbates a feeling of domestic isolation.
Where this really shines is in its portrayal of Cliff and Norma’s relationship. It is the reconnection of two people on varying paths of loneliness. Quickly though, the reality of the situation is that the distance between the two is irreconcilable. Their first meeting after twenty years is defined by a wooden beam that would initially separate them. Had it been moved though there would be irreparable damage to all parties. Again, there is the use of characters being obscured in the frame, Stanwyck and MacMurray’s characters moving so they are no longer behind the barriers that obscure them. Their phone calls to make plans to see each other are their momentary escape from their loneliness.
In the end what truly sells this is the chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray, when on-screen together both of their characters are so full of life. At the same time there is an undercurrent of searching, of hoping from both that somehow, their loneliness is quelled. MacMurray portrays just how complacency can lead to an unnecessary pursuit towards desire. Stanwyck carries a business-like confidence that vulnerability shows is just a façade in comparison to her emotional reality. That confidence for Stanwyck is a constant and part of what makes her an incredible actor. Yet, with that confidence is such tremendous emotional range, that her characters are always real, and There’s Always Tomorrow is undoubtedly an example of that. It may at times feel a little hokey, but it is a rich exploration of loneliness and desire.",4.5

"No story that Sirk that ever told better understands the themes and messages he tried to hammer home his entire career than “There’s Always Tomorrow,” a film about a young man locked inside the body of an aging toy manufacturer, whose last chance at youth is foiled by selfish accusations of adultery by his children. It is almost nihilistically pessimistic, sometimes painfully sad to watch, and all takes place under the constant hand of fate: irony. Ironic, yes, that a series of coincidences fool him into thinking his destiny lies with a former girlfriend, and yet she had no intentions of being with him all along. Ironic that a man so entranced with the idea of adolescence is at odds with his children. Ironic that the film is called “There’s Always Tomorrow,” yet so thoroughly conveys that for this man tomorrow will only bring the same old stuff. Douglas Sirk is best remembered for his Technicolor melodramas, and when he made this film he had just completed a massive hit, so it’s financially strange but creatively fitting that he would follow a film so full of counterpoints with a film excluding one major one: the color cinematography. While usually employing color to act as the aesthetic antithesis to his generally sad narratives, There’s Always Tomorrow embraces the melancholy and uses black and white to mournfully paint the portrait of a man whose happy life is dead in the coffin, without a single shred of hope. In that, he creates what might be his most subtly intellectual film. Sirk is never direct or on-the-nose about a message he’s trying to send. Instead he opts for clever ambiguity by having an image have one obvious meaning on the narrative surface, and another below. Case in point: when his newly returned former lover confronts him about the the facts of life Sirk, in deep focus, ingeniously shows a toy robot in the foreground and the action in the background. On a story level, the toy has sense to be there since they are arguing in his toy store and it serves as a minute background subplot that the scene before it discussed. But this also reminds us that the robot represents the aging businessman in microcosm: he tries to surround his career with youth, yet the disappointing reality of life is always there to trample his attempts. By burying the meaning, the film becomes even more provocative and sorrowful. Unfortunately this great film is never mentioned on the shortlist, or even the list for that matter, of his masterpieces. It seems a minor work, and by largely excluding two of his major themes (artifice and stylistic counterpoints) from the veneer he creates something deceptive and harder to analyze. But to those who do, there are layers and layers to this great film, and in that more and more experiential rewards. If one were to pull them back, what is left is one of the key films of his masterful and quietly but strikingly auteuristic career.",5.0

"It would be difficult to argue that Douglas Sirk is a restrained director - certainly, nobody would have dreamed of trying during the years he was active in Hollywood, when his almost too-obvious use of symbolism and lady gush saw him summarily dismissed by the critics. I’m not convinced though. Yes, Sirk is prone to some very conspicuous directorial flourishes and they are not always subtle, but I recognise, even within Sirk’s overwrought context, notable instances of restraint that reveal just how controlled he was as a filmmaker – it is just that his threshold the melodramatic was set much higher. So it goes in There’s Always Tomorrow.
Take “Rex the Robot” as an example. The mechanical toy produced by Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray) at his toy company, is the perfect symbol for its creator's life. The miniature windup automaton cannot feel or control his own actions, it is just going through the motions. Clifford is part of a domestic machine, he plays father and provider and his wife Marion (Joan Bennett) tends obsessively to their three children. Everything is well oiled, operational and, as Clifford has come to realise, entirely meaningless. His epiphany is sparked by the arrival of a former work colleague, Norma (Barbara Stanwyck), whose flinty career-womanly ways ignite Clifford’s memory of his life before the family factory. It all comes down to an inevitable (and all too Sirkian) choice, stick with convention, pretence and conformity (route Rex!) or throw caution to the wind and fly free.
Just as Clifford makes his choice (or, rather, the choice is made for him), Sirk presents us with a marvellously framed shot of Clifford and Norma, flooded by the projected rain, with Rex grinding precariously towards to the table’s edge. It’s a symbolic sledgehammer, to be sure, but the beauty of Sirk’s shot is that by the time Rex has reached the edge, Sirk has panned past him. As heavy handed as Sirk’s image may be, he has held back the crucial payoff of watching Rex tumble from the table and he relies on the audience to fill in that gap – and they will be desperate to do so.
That is restraint.
Sirk is similarly restrained in his approach to the characters. Although he gives each of them the trappings of aspiration and motivation (and some incredibly OTT acting moments), he is deliberately piecemeal in his approach, leaving enough ambiguity of purpose so that the audience is forced to interpret the characters' actions through examining their own life experience. Why, for instance, is Clifford’s son, the insufferably straight laced Vinnie (William Reynolds) so eager to believe the worst of his father? Why is Marion so blissfully disinterested in what is going down in her husband’s life? And why is Norma even there?

Tender men's melodrama. Fred McMurray is perfect as the kind hearted toy manufacturer feeling neglected by his family. It’s his best role and this is the best movie he ever did with Barbara Stanwyck.,5.0
"Aww, Fred, I feel you, man. Been there myself. Dad of a family where everyone is too busy to pay attention to you, feeling that midlife ennui when you have everything you thought you wanted but it doesn’t quite measure up. “Paradise is exactly like where you are right now, only much, much better,” right?
So I get why you felt you were tempted by the old flame who came back into town, free and unencumbered, representing a time in your life so far in the past that you were staring to wonder if it really happened.  She’s Barbara Stanwyck, and she’s independent and special and truly interesting. This woman treats you like you’re special, not just someone taken for granted, and it feels… good.
But yeah, can you really throw it away, drop all you accomplished in the trash, because your kids are too busy with their lives to give you what you deserve? Your life is directed by the sublime Douglas Sirk, so no matter what happens, tears will flow.
Sorry, Fred, none of this is your own fault but things will feel less crazy when your nest empties and new passion will arise. It’s all worth it.",4.0
"One of Douglas Sirk’s more affecting melodramas, which is a surprise because his signature use of lush, almost garish color is nowhere to be found. Instead, the characterization feels more tender, more believably humane, and this ends up giving us very nice work from Barbara Stanwyck in particular. An interesting picture as it sort of inverts the genders of a common story of suburban anguish (here, the kind-hearted husband is genuinely put upon and taken advantage of by a rather soulless family, and he stumbles innocently into love—not lust—with another woman whose delight in his simple personhood comes as a revelation), and it’s riveting stuff.",4.0
"Douglas Sirk gives us Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in their best film (aside from Double Indemnity) and let’s us cry to the romantic notes of Blue Moon. I think this film is severely undervalued in Sirk’s cannon, it’s just as good as his other masterpiece melodramas. The difference here is that Sirk is able achieve his heightened emotional center without the assistance of technicolor. I think Clifford Groves (MacMurray) embodies the dissolution of the 1950s nuclear family suburban dream. He is clearly a broken man and suffers from a family that doesn’t appreciate him. Sirk loves dissolving the illusions of social class and boundaries. I think There’s Always Tomorrow is among his tender of these depictions.",4.0

"Whilst Douglas Sirk’s films don’t radiate modernity in style, conceptually they hold more modernity than any Citizen Kane or Kenneth Anger, his films battle with ideals taboo and provocative and he approaches him not from a protest stance but from understanding and apathy, whether it be racism, domesticity or homosexuality.

"Douglas Sirkin 50-luvun laatumelodraamojen sarjaa, vaihteeksi mustavalkoisena. Hieno filmi tämäkin. Kompakti napakasti kerrottu tarina, jossa saippuaisen juonen alla paljon viisautta. Hyvät näyttelijät ja kaunista Russell Mettyn kuvaa (tämä on jo kuudes Mettyn kuvaama Sirk-leffa kolmen vuoden sisään). Lelutehtailija Clifford (Fred MacMurray) havahtuu yksinäisyyteensä ja elämän yksitoikkoisuuteen huomatessaan, että kotona kaikki pyörii lasten ympärillä eikä kukaan lotkauta korvaa hänen toiveilleen. Juuri tähän hetkeen jostain yhtäkkiä ilmestyy vuosien takainen ihastus, uraa muotisuunnittelijana tekevä entinen alainen (Barbara Stanwyck), herättäen Cliffordissa henkiin sen miehen joka hän joskus oli.

Wasn’t sure how the black and white would fare having gotten used to his lush technicolour, but it truly works brilliantly here. Creates such a bleak atmosphere, Sirk also uses rain to a great effect.
Barbara Stanwyck is sensational here. Brings her signature hardness and charisma but there’s also so much pain and loneliness that you can’t help but be drawn to her character.

"This has been the Sirk film at the top of my to-see list for ages (15+ years?) but 35mm prints rarely showed near me and when they did it was never at a time I could go. So I broke down and made it my last “leaving this month” Criterion watch for March. I’d definitely like to see again in a cinema but I wouldn’t prioritize it over any of his Technicolor works and can understand why it shows less frequently than several of those.
Something of a gender-swap of All That Heaven Allows, here MacMurray takes Jane Wyman’s place as a disaffected head of household at odds with their kids’ values, and Stanwyck plays the independent interloper role Rock Hudson had. But MacMurray’s character is no widow(er); Joan Bennett is spot on as a wife so wrapped up in her kids’ lives she has no energy for her husband. As a consequence of this key change, Sirk builds more sympathy for all the main characters’ points of view than he did in his previous release, where Wyman was the only effective audience surrogate in a film where everyone else is either idealized (Hudson and his circle) or unreasonably judgmental (her own kids and friends).
William Reynolds (who passed away just last summer at age 90) plays the disapproving son in both films, but if All That Heaven Allows framed his judgment as Oedipal irrationality, in There’s Always Tomorrow his over-the-top behaviors have basis in a reasonable anxiety: Vinnie fears his father is falling in love with a woman who is not his mother, and his fears are not unfounded. Contrasting his perceptions and instincts against those of his girlfriend Ann (played by Pat Crowley, still with us at age 89), who believes nothing adulterous has occurred between MacMurray’s and Stanwyck’s characters, is a fascinating distillation of some of the same quandaries facing filmmakers working under the Production Code in 1956. She, too, is technically correct in that there has been no physical act of betrayal of fidelity to family. Censors wanted films with no sex, but filmmakers knew audiences sought films that hinted at it through codes and danced around it like a moth circling a flame. Vinnie and Ann take opposite sides in interpreting his father’s actions and motivations, both half-right and half-wrong, and it’s like a meta-commentary on how to read a Sirk film, whether in 1956 or 2023. (Notice he pushes the parents’ double-beds together, which would have been totally unacceptable to censors if he ever showed MacMurray in his while Bennett was in hers.)
Of course I need to say something about Stanwyck here as well; it’s another magnificent performance from her as usual. I mentioned that she’s not idealized like Hudson’s character in All That Heaven Allows and in fact her ethical dilemma is probably the dominant, most audience-identifiable perspective in a film generous with them. It’s performances like these in which she so precisely pinpoints the conflict between desires, which show why she became such an important gay icon (There’s Always Tomorrow made it onto George Kuchar’s Sight & Sound Top Ten in 1992), a prerequisite for her becoming a cinephile icon soon and forever after.",0.0
"It opens with ""Welcome to sunny California,"" except it's raining, and continues at that level of cutting anger all the way through till the end of the movie. I think maybe it flinched a little bit, but only a little, and the schmaltz was saved for the kids. Fred MacMurray doesn't look terribly pleased.
Speaking of which, Joan Bennett has sort of a thankless role but she played it quite well. She can't be sparkling, or the movie loses all…",4.0

"“Waiting is part of being in love.“
One of Sirk’s best films. The only thing better would’ve been MacMurray and Stanwyck scheming to kill Joan Bennett. 
As a sort of spiritual companion to All I Desire, There's Always Tomorrow explores domesticity from the husband's perspective. Fred MacMurray plays a toy executive whose wife and three kids don't have much time for him anymore. When a former coworker played by Barbara Stanwyck shows up, he exploits her arrival as a welcome distraction from his frustrated midlife crisis.
What sets this movie apart is that these two never consummate their love nor is it ever explicitly realized. When MacMurray spends the weekend with Stanwyck in Palm Valley after his work meeting is cancelled, he's upfront and honest with his wife (Joan Bennett), even going so far as to invite Stanwyck to have dinner at his house and meet the family. You get a real sense that these two are sincerely just friends.
The son, suspicious of a dalliance after catching them in Palm Valley, creates the narrative conflict that drives plot but it's MacMurray and Stanwyck's internal struggle over the choices they've made that is the heart of the movie. There's a real earnestness to MacMurray's character and even when he confesses his love for Stanwyck, it's the idea of who she represents that he's fallen in love with rather than the woman herself. Yes, they have real chemistry and the film hints that it's all leading to some grand embrace of their love but that's not really the point, is it?
Like All I Desire, this is an exploration of domestic life; the joys and perils of a construction of family our society has defined as happiness. Joan Bennett as the wife seems to be the only one in this picture who understands the grass is sometimes greenest where you are. A truly mesmerizing film.

Oh, the malaise of discontent.
When I sat down to watch this tonight as a slight change of pace from my last several watches, which were all part of my March Around the World marathon, I was not expecting to find a new favorite Douglas Sirk movie. My parents were in town and were interested in watching something with me, so I picked something leaving the Criterion Channel that I figured at least my dad would like. I know he is a big fan of Barbara Stanwyck, so whether he had seen this one or not I figured it would go over well (and, midway through, he remembered where things were going enough that he was confident he had seen it all). The most noticeable thing about this one when you compare it to the most popular Sirk melodramas is its lack of striking Technicolor, which is admittedly quite a change of pace. I think the movie probably would have worked fine in color, but it certainly didn't need it, either. The characters here aren't larger than life and exaggerated like they are in some of his other melodramas, so perhaps you could even argue it works just as well without the look so commonly associated with him.
Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray) is a successful toy manufacturer living on the outskirts of Los Angeles with his wife, Marion (Joan Bennett), and his three kids. The relationships between the members of the family are what you might expect from a group of people having lived together for a number of years, with plenty of affection to go around but with a bit of complacency starting to creep in around the edges as well. One particular day Cliff tries to do something special for Marion's birthday, but she ends up spending the evening with one of the kids instead. Cliff feels personally rejected rather than seeing the act for what it was, and a chance encounter with a former employee of his, Norma Vale* (Barbara Stanwyck), leads him down a road where the two become increasingly more involved. While they never actually begin any sort of physical relationship, Cliff's son, Vinnie (William Reynolds), sees and hears some things that convince him otherwise. Eventually Cliff and Norma do begin to fall for each other, but some well-timed meddling by some of the kids might just be enough to prevent them from completely ruining everything they already have.
The thing I found most fascinating about this is how some seem to characterize it as a sort of criticism of the American dream**, whereas I didn't feel that way at all. Cliff's issues didn't stem from any sort of inherent issue with a specific system or way of life he was entrenched in, but rather with his own attitude towards his situation. If you look at the things in his life, he really didn't have any reason to go down the path that he did. His wife was incredibly loving to him most of the time, and she was equally invested in the lives of their children. Sure, maybe she turned her attention away from their marriage on occasion, but that happens in all relationships. They are difficult and imperfect in general, and they take work from both parties involved. You shouldn't be too surprised if you need to have a conversation with your spouse about prioritizing each other once every twenty years. The same can be said for their kids, who were generally affectionate towards their father (at least as much as can be expected of kids who are mostly worried about themselves). As a parent, you just can't expect too much out of them. So sure, while there was a very specific malaise that arose at just the wrong time, it wasn't a direct product of his surroundings.
Instead, Cliff sensed all these things boiling up inside him and did what any selfish, sinful human being would do: he sought fulfillment wherever he could find it. For a while he genuinely made an effort to mend the bridges with his wife and kids, which was a commendable thing. Even after he had his first few encounters with Norma, he hadn't really crossed a major line. Sirk obviously shows him as considering it, but he knows it's not for the best. Instead, Cliff goes back to his family and tries to make things right. To his frustration, he just can't quite seem to get the response that he craves. At a certain point, then, he finally caves to the temptation and pursues Norma. His longing for companionship is such that he even convinces himself he is in love with her. Thankfully, though, Norma has also seen the light by this point about how their relationship could never work out. She reminds him that their supposed love for each other is ultimately sort of a fickle thing, and that the emotions it is based on won't last. There will be instances in the future where it won't hold up to the deeper bonds he has already built with his family, and tearing those down for a brief affair will never be worth it in the end.
That's probably enough rambling about what I liked about this one from a thematic standpoint, so hopefully that all made sense. The other thing I really wanted to say about this was just how much I love the way Sirk stages his movies. Russell Metty did the cinematography for this as well as all the other big Sirk melodramas, and you can really tell in all of them how much attention to detail they place on really having every scene framed so perfectly. There are too many scenes to mention here where things unfold in such beautiful fashion, but so often characters will be moving around the frame, almost interacting with the camera in a way that really gives a life to the picture. It also didn't hurt that Sirk was smart enough to reunite Stanwyck and MacMurray, as the two really do make for such a surprisingly great screen couple. And Bennett is amazing as well as the doting wife who is sort of innocently caught in the middle of this domestic mess, just going about her business loving on her kids while unaware as to the drama going on around her. It's almost a shame she ultimately gets overshadowed by Stanwyck to a degree. But, then again, pretty much everyone who acted opposite Stanwyck got overpowered, as there were few who could hold their own with her.

Sirk handles every scene with a delicate care. They all have their own desires that are not being met and none are right or wrong in any way. They are just beautiful flawed portraits of human nature. Stanwyck and MacMurray are excellent here. Stanwyck especially has a puppy-eyed nature at the beginning, enthused to spend time with the man she has always loved. But when it turns into something mutual, she realizes he's too good of a man to ever be with her. It's a devastating portrait of everything related to domestic life.",4.0

"Man, it’s certainly rare to see a serious adult movie about the problems of middle-aged men. Which is perhaps odd, since 80%+ of films today are made by middle-aged men. How is it that we basically own Hollywood but we don’t ever get films like this anymore?
You know what? Fred MacMurray is terrific in this. He gives a great, subtle, nuanced performance as a husband who’s constantly disrespected by his wife and kids, and feels compelled to stray outside his marriage just to feel alive again. The man may have played an awful lot of silly parts in his time, but he was a real actor and here’s proof. 
MacMurray meets up with old flame Barbara Stanwyck, and he gradually flirts with the idea of an affair. His (terrible) kids see him hanging out with Barbara and leap to conclusions.
Most Sirk films are “women’s pictures,” and this one is definitely focused on the man. MacMurray plays the head of a toy company, and Sirk keeps equating his character with a walking talking robot that the company is producing. The cumulative effect is extremely effective.
Really liked this one, it deserves to be discussed with the other top 1950’s Sirk melodramas. Very strange to see a “sensitive” men’s picture, to be quite honest. Highly recommended.",4.0
"Had this been poorly made, I think I would’ve hated it with a passion.  The whole “my wife is too involved with mother stuff to placate my ego” thing rubbed me the wrong way, though the aspect of being bored with a mundane life that is always more or less the same is very resonant now too.  The film was something of a role reversal, showcasing a husband and father (MacMurray) who is deeply unfulfilled and dissatisfied with the predictability of his daily life as a toy manufacturer.  Even the walkie talkie robot doesn’t help.  Enter Barbara Stanwyck as his old flame, who causes him to see just what he’s missing.  Overall, I liked this, though I objected to the framing of the family as “negligent,” and therefore maybe asking for him to ditch them.  His wife is well-meaning, but oblivious, and the children are self-absorbed…well, children.  All in all, I think it is a good exploration of domesticity, suburban life, and the need to shake things up (though hopefully done without potentially hurting loved ones.)",3.5

"A sad little music box that just keeps running. On the one hand, I’m impressed by how this treats Fred MacMurray’s character as just as interior and lonely as all the longing housewives that typically characterize these suburban melodramas. It’s especially refreshing because when there’s movies about men in suburbia being bored with life, they usually involve dumb Oscar-baiting arguments like in Revolutionary Road. The scenes between MacMurray and Stanwyck…well, Remember the Night and Double Indemnity are two of the best movies of the 40s for multiple reasons.
On the other hand, the film is perhaps a little too loyal to MacMurray’s perspective at times. Joan Bennett gets nothing to do except act perpetually sleepy. The kids in this are a little too young to make their horrible noseying feel plausible (the kids in All That Heaven Allows were older). The latter does pay off in its own way, though, with Pat Crowley as the son’s sympathetic girlfriend emerging as the most level-headed.

Most people these days probably know Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck from Double Indemnity, and it's wonderful to see them in completely different roles. There's Always Tomorrow is about real people grappling with the quiet desperation of real life, and it's all done with a very light touch.",4.0
"It’s shocking how sympathetic Sirk is with every single character. That is almost subversive now, let alone in the 1950s.

"Around the World in Cinema 2018 - USA
Another Douglas Sirk film I hadn't seen until now, and another with a high score just from the impact it had. View it as the mirror to All That Heaven Allows, only from a perspective of an older man rather than an older woman. Whilst I was unfair to him in Double Indemnity, between his supporting role in The Apartment and his lead performance here, Fred MacMurray does stand out as a great actor here depicting a mid life crisis. Whilst we rightly talk of the oppression women go through, we forget that a mid life crisis isn't something just for bad bro comedies in the modern days, but an issue of existentialism that everyone suffers through regardless of gender, pertinent here as MacMurray looks to his company's brand new robot toy and finds an uncomfortable similarity with.
The film like Sirk's most famous film All That Heaven Allows that is filtered through the coldness of modernity and the selfishness of one's own children. The difference, evoking back to Double Indemnity, is Barbara Stanwyck who plays a complicated character, not the stereotypical figure of temptation but a childhood love who slowly realises the scenario she is within and has to deal with the emotional consequences to it.
Only around eighty minutes the film manages so much, filmed with such eloquence that even my preference for Sirk's colour films isn't a factor. Its an intriguing drama in how it goes against expectations for an adultery plot which adds a greater moral weight to the proceedings, such as the oldest son's girlfriend played by Pat Crowley being the voice of reason however shouting into the wind. That sense of complexity to the material, that it doesn't end in a way that is either a happy or sad ending, but both, is what always stood out in Sirk's melodramas and shows itself here especially.",4.5
"If There’s Always Tomorrow makes do without the punch-drunk quality of Douglas Sirk’s best work, it is in accordance with the demands of the material. A rich but melancholy dissection of the repression and thwarted desires of middle America, embodied in the travails of Cliff, played by Fred MacMurray. The head of a toy manufacturing outfit whose discontent with his family life, composed of his perpetually busy wife, preoccupied children and an otherwise colourless quotidian existence, leads him to the precipice of an extramarital affair with an old flame, Barbara Stanwyck’s Norma.
Sirk expresses the principals’, and therefore the world’s, lingering malaise through deft manipulation of the mise-en-scene, particular when trapped within the bounds of the house. A pitch perfect example of 50s suburbia which ranges from being lit up, day-glo bright, by a charitable gaffer to noirish chiaroscuro when MacMurray is overwhelmed by his guilt-ridden yearnings or engaging in covert midnight trips down to the telephone. It this dynamic shift in tones that makes flesh the divide between what society’s expectation and our inner most desires, and the disorientation that occurs when Cliff switches from indulging one and the other.
In focusing on Cliff, the film tangentially yet powerfully comments on how the two women in his life react to this same divide. His wife Marion, despite being the slighted party and whose wellbeing that two elder siblings Vinnie and Ellen claim to have in mind, is a very much a peripheral character. Defined by her constant exhaustion and the unrelenting attention she pays towards her domesticity. She isn’t privileged with the time and therefore the opportunity to confront any ill feeling she may bear towards the state of things. In sharp contrast, her spouse’s restlessness is a luxury that he is afforded by his position as patriarch within the family and society at large (It is key that he is in management and doesn’t have his hours eaten up by the factory floor).
Barbara Stanwyck plays a different kind of woman, yet she is arguably equally trapped. An unmarried fashion designer, she is a sort of Nora, having achieved a peripatetic independence at odds to the life lead by Marion. This is the second instance where she has played this type for Sirk. The previous outing being All I Desire, where she appears as a Broadway star returning to parochial Wisconsin to visit the estranged family that she had departed years before in order to pursue her dreams. In this film, she’s no family to either skip out on or be reacquainted with but Stanwyck plays her with much of the same sadness combined with all of the same easy-going sophistication.
The film and its denizens root her sadness in her lack of domesticity. Perhaps conservatively so, though another culprit could be her taking on an undue share of the blame for this quasi-affair, prompted by her diversion from gender norms. Which makes her, in the minds of Vinnie and Ellen, an easier target on which to pin the status of ‘homewrecker’. For they have no real trouble in directly confronting and disparaging her, but when their father is around all they can muster is a cold shoulder and maybe a walk out.
Before all the tension that has been steadily building can boil over, the film reaches a conclusion that at first seems like a poor fit. A bow-like tying up of the plot that was clearly born from an exceutive’s memo yet through Sirk’s assured hand it becomes one of his best ‘unhappy happy endings.’ Where the possibility of an affair is extinguished and so the family is preserved, but dysphoria lives on in MacMurray and Stanwyck’s sombre and desperate farewell being paired with the fake-seeming joviality of the triumphant children. Their movements not unlike the programmed rigidity of Rex the toy robot, which McMurray, and Sirk, uses to crystallise and stow away his disquiet, encasing it in a plastic exterior and a white picket fence.",4.0

"If ""All That Heaven Allows"" was a feverish, nightmare-tinted look into the consequential reality of ""forbidden love"" (petty & repressive as it may be); one whose reciprocation in the end feels like a warm, soul-freeing liberation -- ""There's Always Tomorrow"" is Douglas Sirk's stark, grounded, & on-the-nose follow-up, where practicality triumphs bitterly over a passion that closes as soon as it opens.
""There's Always Tomorrow"" is about a great many things pertaining to 50's culture, upon reflective analysis. Fred MacMurray plays toy manufacturer, Clifford Groves, a tired, work-burnt father who is victim to the duty & genuine care of raising a family [one who takes him for granted -- NOTE: ""traditional,"" ""nuclear,"" & even ""heteronormative"" are the first words to pop up, when thinking about his position]. His proud new business-invention, the robot Rex [guaranteed to bring in good sales], serves as the acknowledged metaphor to how he functions -- he gets wound up and goes straight to work, he unwinds only to be wound up again to take care of his children (the bills, the house) and when the fun is over, he gets pushed into a corner until he is toyed with again [work culture].
He suddenly reconnects with an old-flame, Norma Miller Vale (Barbara Stanwyck) from literally out-of-the-blue, who scratches an itch about his ""care-free"" days, and a need to get out of the suffocating, domesticated life he's created. Their innocent rendezvous at a Palm Valley resort leads to more frequent visits, and an eventual confession on MacMurray's desperate, lovelorn part [that taboo love]. Unfortunately, MacMurray's kids get an early drop on his initial advances, and squawk & sneak around the issue until they confront Stanwyck's Vale in her hotel room. This hotel-scene is striking on two-levels:
1.) We're provided a voice of credence to the Sirkian father, after seeing films dealing with the mother.
2.) We hear the most searing indictment of the uncaring and unforgiving Sirkian family-type in practically any of his films.
'Why do you neglect him, and you take and take and never give back one shred of love in return?...How many years can a man put up with that?' Of course, this retort gets answered with dramatic irony ('so that's why he fell in love with you') - one of two striking instances where such pain and agony gets thrown back into your face. The other comes so shamelessly at the ending where, MacMurray, haven lost the battle of passion to a plane-departing Stanwyck, is led away by his unwitting wife, Marion (Joan Bennett). His youngest daughter says as they walk away: ""they make a handsome couple, don't they?""
In this Sirkian team-up, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are an electric, melodramatic duo. Russell Metty's continued collaboration with Sirk is excellent, in how he externalizes the near-psychotic break that MacMurray's Groves is on the verge of suffering (most of the dramatic scenes infuse him with low-contrast lighting...but in general, Sirk's movies look so nice). There are the graceful tracking shots, ones interestingly used to convey parallel storytelling (where the end of one relationship starts, the fraught desperation of another continues).
I think what I'm most taken with about this film can be found in two short blurbs Sirk manages to say in Jon Halliday's book, ""Sirk On Sirk"":
[On T.A.T.]: ""He has a toy factory, which he cannot break away from, like he can't break away from his past. He is like a naive American boy who has never grown up. And then Stanwyck comes back from his past - but she doesn't find a grown man. She leaves.""
[On Children]: ""They are symbols of melancholy, not purity...I think it is the tragedies which are starting over again, always and always...""
Sirk places an interesting (albeit psychologically subliminal - yet overly expressionistic) focus on the tragedy of generations - in particular, that of father & son. The naivete that MacMurray's character experiences (though deeply soul-felt as it can be) is reflected back into his eldest son, Vinnie (William Reynolds). Whenever MacMurray is in a scene completely shrouded in darkness & shadow, similar lighting befalls Vinnie in a following scene. At the height of their emotional desperation, where Vinnie's girlfriend Ann (Pat Crowley) breaks up with him over his suspicion with his father, the camera follows him walking by a window, where (profile to the actions he's taken), MacMurray frustratingly has a smoke and grabs his hat while walking towards the door, unable to not think about Stanwyck's Vale. If Sirk was speaking genuinely on his convictions, then his view of people is fundamentally sad (in spite of it being true).
Of course, with his early-theater background, such scene-blocking & dramatization should not particularly come as a surprise. If there is any major take-away I had from watching this film, it's that I miss peak-Douglas Sirk.",5.0

"Really heartbreaking. My favourite Sirk, probably for the cast over everything else. MacMurray and Stanwyck are always perfect at playing a kind of romance that has a pall of doom hanging over it. Bennett is perfect because she at once conveys the monotony that MacMurray has fallen into, but is also far too lovely to her husband to make any thoughts of infidelity an easy option.
Telling it from MacMurray's perspective makes Stanwyck's part of the story even more tragic, as we only get small insights into how she's much more tortured by her lingering passion than MacMurray, but how she's also far more determined to quell and overcome this passion.
Pat Crowley almost looks too much like Joan Bennett here to be playing the girlfriend of her son, but then knowing Sirk there's every chance that could be the point.",5.0

""There’s Always Tomorrow"" is the perfect title for any Douglas Sirk film, I'm surprised Todd Haynes hasn't stole this title already. Fred MacMurray plays Cliff, a happily married man with two girls and an eldest boy. Cliff is a success toy manufacture with an exciting new toy robot about to come out named 'Rex, the Walkie-Talkie Robot Man"". Little does Cliff know that the Walkie-Talkie Robot Man is a metaphor for the kind of boss, father and lover he has become. Enter Norma (played by Barbara Stanwyck), Cliff's old high school flame who hasn't seen Cliff in 20 years. Norma is a successful fashion designer, and Barbara Stanwyck sure does look good throughout the film wearing the clothes she designs. Turns out Norma was in love with Cliff 20 years ago in high school and still is. They meet, plan to meet again and again, and eventually grow fond of one another. Cliff's eldest son becomes suspicious of his fathers time with Norma, and suspects a love affair that will end their family home.

"Saw this with my friends at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on a great 35mm print. A downside of watching too much film in order to educate yourself on the work you do is how you get detached from the magic and get too self-reflexive on the technical aspects. It has been quite a while since I had this kind of immersion to a film, so that’s quite something.
Melodrama, when done right, is the most humanistic genre of media and There’s Always Tomorrow is more than great. Super interesting in terms of content. A humane portrayal of the effects of domestic life on the male figure. A reasonable but distant unconditional love of the business-consumed woman. A curious examination of the nuclear family and the behavior of the teenagers of that period.
Powerful performances from all involved, far from the theatrics that dominated cinema ever since it began. Stanwyck and MacMurray are superb, downplayed and highly emotional. Noir-esque use of lighting which fits the mood. Such an amazing screenplay with lots of memorable dialogue and greatly structured dramaturgy.

"There's been a lot of talk in recent years about how certain old(er) movies have outdated values and sentiments. It's even gone as far as having caution labels come up before the start of a film, warning viewers that what they're about to watch may lack modern sensibilities.
I've often felt that all of the aforementioned worry and concern has gotten out of hand, though in the case of Douglas Sirk's There's Always Tomorrow, I really felt like it was one of those movies that's outdated and clunky.
The film presents issues that are fairly timeless: love, family, feeling valued (or under-valued), strong feelings for someone other than your spouse, infidelity, that sense of your life being caught in a loop of repetitive banality, etc. Unfortunately, I think it was made in the wrong era. That's not the movie's fault but, wow, does the decade it was made in really hamper what it could have been.
If There's Always Tomorrow were made today, it would likely have been so much better, more multi-faceted in its presentation, more nuanced in its presentation, probably nominated for some Oscars. Instead, we're left with it in the 1950s, where things are more simple, and the man of the house should always be shown respect, no matter what he gets up to.
I'm sorry, but the teenage son was right all along. And, by the end, he's left licking his wounds and apologizing. His girlfriend is drawn so simplistically that she, for no reason I could discern other than she's simple and trusting, doesn't believe his suspicions about his father.
As for the other characters: the wife is drawn in such broad 1950s housewife brushstrokes as to be an almost one-dimensional non-entity. The middle child is pre-occupied with boys and talking with her friends about her life. The young daughter is shrill and dramatic. And yet... these are kind of your typical, middle-class young people, right? In today's world they would've been shown some understanding. In this 1950s melodrama, they are given a dressing-down for not paying enough attention to their philandering father.
And, I want to be clear about something: I really like Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. Double Indemnity is one of my favorite movies, and seeing them team up again was one of the reasons I was looking forward to watching this movie. I think they're supposed to be the protagonists here? They are our two main stars, after all. And, unlike Double Indemnity, they're not conspiring to murder someone. But, they are having an affair here, and they gaslight anyone who dares call them on it. Yikes.

what's most interesting about the film on a base level is that it's functionally a women's picture of the era, but centered on a man. sirk's black and white is just as gorgeous and rich as his technicolor, but adopts noirish imagery alongside its noirish casting; there's a recurring motif with stany's character norma that appears almost like a wire cage, these diamond criss-crosses which appear from her door to the walls at her work and even on clothes. like we often see in noirs, the columns holding up railings become jail bars, the home a prison. the film becomes about the imprisonment of the domestic, a narrative concept generally attributed to women, for obvious reasons, or if it is to men, they're often gay and trapped by heteronormativity. i think this film seeks to find a more androgynous, universal key to these limitations, though it certainly is keen on the roles gender and age play into their trappings- the two most prominent toys at his workplace are a walking and talking robot, and baby-dolls, both of which are used very pointedly.
the ending is bad but brilliant. norma's misery on the plane undercuts the shmaltz and sentimentality of cliff's family reconciliation; this is not a happy ending, he's still stuck. it's a fuck you to the hay's code, technically following its conventions and being brazenly unsatisfying for it, and it's the final nail in the condemnation of the culture. he becomes rex the robot, like he's supposed to be. i love sirk so much.",4.0

En cierta forma los seres humanos estamos solos, desamparados, en manos del destino.

Douglas Sirk. Lugano, 1982.
Entraba al Doré escoltado por dos buenos amigos que se sorprendían al decirles que esta era mi película favorita de Sirk. Hasta yo mismo no sabía explicar del todo por qué, como un misterioso secreto entre Sirk y yo. Es un melodrama, sí, pero carece de muchos elementos icónicos del cine del alemán, principalmente el color y el formato scope que tanto resaltaba en sus películas esa sensación que llaman ""bigger than life"", los pequeños dramas amorosos de ricos que en realidad son tan grandes como la vida misma.
El propio Sirk explica que esta es su película más pesimista, que ya es decir. Que es la más pesimista y que, como para mí, esta es una de sus películas predilectas, aunque tampoco da muchos más detalles, consciente de que ese iba a ser nuestro pacto secreto. Pero me veo en la obligación de romperlo con tal de ordenar un poco mis sentimientos e ideas hacia esta película e intentar desentrañar si realmente es tan pesimista como dice. Ruego me perdone Douglas, es por una buena causa.
(R)ejuvenecer: dicen que no son las películas las que cambian con el tiempo, sino que somos nosotros los que cambiamos cada vez que las vemos. En una película con apenas dos personajes más o menos desarrollados, la primera vez me resultaba imposible no identificarme con el personaje de Fred MacMurray, aunque haya un lapso de edad más que evidente. Cliff es un hombre nostálgico por naturaleza, que vive obsesionado con que cualquier tiempo pasado fue mejor y cuyo ideal se materializa en su vida a través de su trabajo, la construcción de juguetes que, de alguna manera, lo mantienen en ese estado de niñez del que nunca ha terminado de salir. Es un niño grande, un poco (y un mucho, me permito esta licencia como sandlerófilo) como Adam Sandler, con un preocupante síndrome de Peter Pan aunque este ni siquiera pueda recurrir a sus amigos o su familia para echar una canita al aire de vez en cuando que le permita seguir sintiéndose en contacto con el mundo y no con sus propios sueños. Unos sueños que terminan de cobrar forma cuando aparece Norma, en la que ve esa vida perfecta que nunca tuvo y la única que le puede hacer huir. Su vía de escape. Su lucha contra un enemigo que se ha apoderado de él y al que es incapaz de hacer frente solo.
(R)utina: el segundo fantasma, tras el miedo a envejecer y dejar atrás la juventud, tiene que ver también con el tiempo pero se manifiesta de una manera mucho más inocua. Desde el primer plano de la película (Una noche soleada en California...) cargado de la ironía que tanto le gustaba, el bueno de Sirk nos dice ""Eh, no siempre hace sol, de hecho el día a día suele ser espantoso para el que no sabe disfrutar de la lluvia"", e introduce una idea presente en su filmografía pero que aquí coge más fuerza que nunca y con la que de nuevo no puedo identificarme más: la rutina da asco. Lejos del orden y cotidianeidad que proclama el american way of life o casi cualquier representación de familia armoniosa, Cliff detesta la rutina que adora su mujer, y ansía escapar, aunque sea durante un fin de semana, de los horarios fijos, los viajes a la fábrica, los periódicos, las compras e incluso sí, de sus hijos, que en gran medida son los culpables de que su mujer ya no le haga tanto caso y de que todos los días se hayan convertido en el de la Marmota (otra película que me fascina y que estoy seguro le hubiera encantado a Sirk). Pero en realidad la rutina no da asco, o no debería, y si lo hace es porque es una rutina mal llevada, en la que uno es profundamente infeliz y no se ve capaz de cambiar(se). La rutina bien llevada, al contrario, es la felicidad, a la que Sirk definía como un pájaro libre, difícil de atrapar, pero que incluso cuando se tiene delante de las narices, uno no es capaz de familiarizarse con él. La propia Norma lo explica en una escena desgarradora: si Cliff renuncia a su rutina, renunciará con ella a todas esas cosas buenas que trae con ella, principalmente ver a sus hijos crecer. Vamos, como le pasaba a Adam Sandler en Click.
(R)ondó: esta es la tercera vez que veo la película, la primera en un cine (espero que no la última) y aunque a cualquier otra persona le resulte más que evidente desde el principio, también es la primera en que soy plenamente consciente de que la auténtica tragedia amorosa (no las personales que sí vive realmente Cliff) es la de Norma, pues está realmente enamorado de Cliff y no de una idea como le sucede a este con ella. Es un amor imposible no porque no sean compatibles, porque él esté casado, porque tenga hijos o porque ella lo quiera demasiado como para hacerle renunciar a su vida. Lo es porque en el fondo Norma sabe que en realidad Cliff no está enamorado de ella, pues ella también es un fantasma, un alma perdida en el tiempo pero con más forma que la nostalgia o la rutina. Y por tanto llegamos al final de la película y, tal y como explica Sirk siempre a través de su famosa estructura de 'rondó', estamos de nuevo en la misma situación. Han pasado muchas cosas y en realidad nada ha cambiado. Todo sigue igual. Cliff tiene su casa, su trabajo (robot mecánico incluido, quizá la metáfora menos acertada o más obvia del bueno de Douglas) y su familia, que sigue siendo igual de perfecta que al principio por más que antes no lo viera. ¿Qué nos queda entonces? En realidad, nada por lo que luchar. No hay grandes gestos románticos ni sacrificios de vida que puedan invertir la situación como en otras películas de Sirk. Nada por lo que luchar porque nada se ha perdido, y lo que Cliff cree que ha perdido, Norma, en realidad nunca lo tuvo. No se puede luchar contra un fantasma, pero ya se sabe el dicho, si no puedes vencer a algo únete a ello, y aquí a Cliff solo le queda hacer las paces consigo mismo, abrazar la rutina de la vida y no mirar por la ventana aquel gran pájaro en el que marcha Norma sino el que tiene dentro, aquel del que hablaba Sirk, el de la felicidad. Con el tiempo se acabará familiarizando y acabará por verlo. Después de todo, al final la película no era tan pesimista como decía Sirk, y realmente sí que siempre hay un mañana. Ya lo decía otro genio, un tal Ferris:

Son dos directores muy distintos pero para mí fue revelador de una manera que sería larga de explicar; quizás ni sabría. Pues ahora, volviendo a ver esta peli (que había visto por primera vez antes de ver nada de Naruse), también me ha permitido verla con otros ojos pensarla como su película más narusiana.

"When there are children in Douglas Sirk movies they're the villains.

In any case, as these children retract their love for their parents in a Lear-y, Ozu-y way and become quasi-authority figures, bizarrely inverted Freudian dramas play out. This is…",4.0

"Nobody makes an entrance like Barbara Stanwyck!
By the time she appears in ""There's Almost Tomorrow,"" the rest of the characters and their lives have been well-established. There's Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray), a husband who feels neglected and overlooked by his beautiful but boring wife (Joan Bennett) in favor of their needy kids (played by William Reynolds, Gigi Perreau, and Judy Nugent).
Therefore, when Norma Miller Vale (Babs) shows up at Cliff's doorstep, we expect the sparks in this ""Double Indemnity"" reunion to fly immediately.
They do but they don't. Both maintain a proper aboveboard friendship free of any improprieties.
When the oldest son ""catches"" them together, he assumes the worst. His girlfriend (Pat Crowley, in a standout role) knows better. I found myself frustrated and irritated by the series of silly sitcom misunderstandings and interruptions that dominate the rest of the film. But I should have realized with masterful director Douglas Sirk at the helm that there's always more than meets the eye.
Sirk is, in fact, exposing the cracks in the facade of the wholesome 1950s family sitcom formula and mentality. ""Leave It to Babs"" this is not.",0.0

"Recently decided that I do actually want to have kids, but whenever I watch a movie about the dark side of domesticity and parenthood I’m just like “hmmm my kids better be much cooler than this.”*
This ends in such a fascinating way - love how this takes on the appearance of a happy ending but is really bittersweet for all parties involved. They’ll all probably be fine in the end, but there’s still tinges of sadness. The whole movie sort of exists in this gray area, and the characters are so well drawn and layered. It’s not so much about characters trying to take down the ideas of what American life is supposed to look like in 1956, but trying to figure out how they can find some level of happiness with the cards they’ve been dealt. 
Every performance is good here. This is maybe the best I’ve seen Stanwyck. The kids can be a bit grating at times, but I do think that’s sort of the point and Sirk utilizes them very well. He’s just the best at this kind of stuff.

"The strength of There's Always Tomorrow is the fact that Douglas Sirk sets up a love triangle in the most achingly stealthy way possible.  In fact labeling it a love triangle almost feels too aggressive for the sensitive way in which he sets up the situation because you understand and empathize with each person.  You understand Cliff's sense of existential crisis as the domesticity of his life is takes a toll on him in middle age because everyone takes him for granted.  He is reliable and sturdy and as such his children just assume he will keep being that way for them and his wife focuses on the kids who need her more.  But the part that holds it together and helps us empathize with Cliff is that while he may get a bit upset when his attempts to have time away with his wife are foiled by her feeling the need to prioritize the children he still takes things ultimately in stride.  Any sort of argument or momentary anger is quickly dissipated because he is a kind person who ultimately puts his family above himself.  Plus Sirk does a good job of getting Marion's point of view across that her work as a mother keeps her so busy all day that she isn't exactly neglectful as much as so preoccupied.  Any sort of element that an outside perspective may seem like taking Cliff for granted is instead from her perspective the result of an intimate comfortability where she knows her husband so completely already.
It would be easy to brandish Norma as a homewrecker but Sirk makes her such an affable and big-hearted person the thought doesn't really enter you mind.  She is a lonely woman who through fate finds herself back home and while trying to relive a bit of an unrequited romance gets more than she bargained for.  And while the math equation of a neglected husband plus lonely single woman who carries an old flame for him plus circumstances having them spend time alone would seem to automatically equal affair, Sirk makes any sort of feelings which develop between them come from a very organic place.  And, most importantly, a deeply human place.  It begins from a totally innocent place of reconnection and reminiscing but because they, in that moment in their lives, are both longing for human connection they eventually begin to find something in each other.  Neither one had an overt intention for it to happen, but they are both human and when put in that scenario respond in a very human way. Sirk perfectly deflates any salaciousness and in fact actively uses the suspicion of it from Cliff's two oldest as a reflection of just how little they think of their father. But given that this is Sirk you know the melodrama was coming and he does lay it on thick during the last act. I think too thick when the music swells to outsized proportions and the characters who felt so earnestly real end up making grand speeches. But the fact that Sirk showed so much restraint for so long is ultimately why I think the film works.
While this might be a modern day perspective talking, I do think Sirk does Norma wrong by so easily dismissing her lot in life. He has Marion voice a fairly patronizing pity for Norma because of an ideology that every woman longs for a domesticated life. And while there is truth to it as it pertains to Norma, Sirk frames it as a universal statement instead of one specific to the character which feels awfully dismissive of Norma as a whole. And at one point Sirk also has Cliff voice a lot of the male mid-life crisis ideology about providing financial support equaling personal entitlement. The character is so much better when Sirk has those types of ideas unspoken because once they are said out-loud it makes the character seem much less dimensional. The performance are all strong though, especially Barbara Stanwyck who imbues Norma with such tenderness. It would be easy for Norma to be the odd person out but Stanwyck is so subtle in her performance you never stop empathizing with her. Fred MacMurray is also able to project a type of overwhelming decency and honesty where despite the appearance of impropriety you don't once believe it is something he had even considered. Joan Bennett has the more thankless part, but she still projects a type of comfort and selflessness with Marion.
But the most important thing that this trio of actors do is make everyone feel like a genuinely good person. No one deserves to have their heart broken, but in this story someone is going away from it with a broken heart. It is unfair, but such is life and love. As always though Sirk gives the film a very stylish sheen. The wonderful framing of the ""walking talking robot man"" in the frame alongside Cliff projects his state of mind better than words could. And Sirk utilizes deep focus in shots either inside or outside looking into the window of the house to show the distance which exists between Cliff and his family along with setting up a visual strategy with a payoff later on. His use of shadow and lighting is quite exquisite and during the argument his son Vinnie has with his girlfriend Ann outside with shadows covering both their faces only heightens the emotional tension of that scene between them and what it means in relation to his relationship to his father. And while I wish Sirk hadn't leaned as heavily into the melodrama at the end, there is no mistaking his wondrous execution of such material knowing where to place the camera and how to light a scene to give it such an emotional punch without calling attention to itself and distracting from the emotion overflowing within the setup of the story.",4.0

The last few seconds seem inconsistent with the narrative and probably exist in their current form to avoid violating the values of 1955, the year this film was released.

"An excellent entry in the subgenre of dramas about people who one day wake up to find that their domestic life suddenly feels like a prison, this nuanced story excels by refusing to cast any of its characters as villains.
When a film works really well, it’s so easy to see how it could have all been rendered simplistic. It would have been so simple to make Stansyck’s Norma a seductress. On the flip side, it would have been so simple to make Bennett’s Marion a shrill shrew, driving Cliff away.
Instead, the film really shows the way that someone in a family can experience a kind of gentle, indirect alienation. It’s not that anyone in the film is overtly mean to Cliff. Rather it’s clear that he simply doesn’t seem to matter to them. When he returns home from work in the opening sequence, everyone else already has plans, and none of them involve Cliff. In his own household, Cliff feels like a third wheel, and it makes it very understandable why he would react with such fervor to someone finally giving him direct attention.
The thing about all of the adults here, and especially Norma and Cliff, is that they’re just so dang nice! Cliff is just a good guy. Norma is also seen to be sensitive and responsive. Beyond just caring about Cliff, Norma is able to see the dynamics within Cliff’s family and respond to all of the members of his family with compassion, even at the potential cost of her own happiness.
While there is obviously sexual attraction between Norma and Cliff, the film is incredibly wise to keep most of the focus on their friendship and eventually their romance. Were the movie to center on physical attraction, this would feel like a cliche story about a man who hits middle age and then feels the need to go out and have an affair. But all Cliff wants is some excitement and to be the priority for once. We might infer that the sex lives of two busy people with three children isn’t exactly on fire, but the problem at the root of Marion and Cliff’s relationship isn’t a lack of sex, it’s a lack of connection and intimacy. There’s a great sequence where Norma has Marion try on a lovely dress that she’s designed, and even says she’ll give it to her for free. Marion ultimately turns down the offer, noting that nothing could make Cliff sexually interested in her after so many years of marriage.
My one struggle with the film was in the framing of Cliff’s exclusion. I found myself questioning the degree to which Cliff himself had participated in it. For example, he seemingly had no idea that his daughter had a dance recital. And when he finds out, he doesn’t express an ounce of interest in it or ask to go along. Too often in marriages, women are expected to be in charge of scheduling and social arrangements, and it feels a little bit like Cliff hasn’t done much to engage with those aspects of his family’s life. It made me a touch less sympathetic because there’s this implicit assumption that Marion is in charge of all the kids’ schedules, but that she should totally rearrange everything when Cliff walks in the door wanting to go to the theater. I think it’s a dated aspect of the film that hasn’t aged too well, though it’s a very minor complaint because the rest of the family dynamics are very well sketched out.
This is a mature drama that tackles the idea of family alienation with nuance and compassion for all of the characters involved.",4.0

Because we only see success in this movie, there’s no reason to doubt the plans the children have for themselves to fail. The sacrifice Stanwyck invokes about MacMurray not being able to see his daughter dance on stage if he leaves his family is real, not just a post hoc justification built out of weakness or fear. The thoughtless they show to their father is built in to the system and will be rewarded with success (and likely later unhappiness) of their own. The unceasing opulence just emphasizes how much everything is on rails, a train that will bring you to your destination but that you can’t hop off, even something as frivolous as a toy.",3.0

Negatives
- The characters kind of bothered me. I just wasn't that interested in their ""dilemma."" Clifford bothered me, it just seemed like he jumped to the conclusion that he needed to be with Norma. However, it is a very interesting situation that I think a lot of people could fall victim too. I just wish that the characters progress.
- The ending bothered me. Clifford doesn't learn to accept his life and move on. The second-to-last shot is him watching longingly at Norma's plane as it flies away. It just bothered me how he ""resigns"" himself to living his normal life instead of 
Specific Scenes
- The kids seeing Clifford and Norma at the beach house
- Norma talking to Clifford when she says she has to leave him.
Conclusion
- A good film with interesting characters and a unique plot. Unfortunately the characters are really annoying. Some really cool ideas here but it's just not my thing.
Takeaways
- You need to be grateful for everything you have

"While it is a film that lends itself to reading through a gendered lens, being about a husband and father who becomes disillusioned with the staid nature of family life and the unyielding standardization of life within the American middle class—themes much more typically applied to onscreen housewives of the era—the film itself is clearly more interested in generational difference and, especially, the pain of growing old within the institutions of family, fatherhood, and American capitalism—all of which is, unfortunately,…",3.0

Prompt #5: Watch a movie that takes place in Los Angeles.
March 2023 Scavenger Hunt: 09/31
Douglas Sirk is one of my five favorite filmmakers of all time. He is a polarizing figure in many film circles as his trademark melodramas often rub people the wrong way. His critics believe his films features trashy storylines, overwrought (emotionally intense) performances and an overreliance on technicolor. Basically, the argument is that his films are ""style over substance."" But if one's ""serious"" about cinema, they know Sirk is one of the most bombastic and influential filmmakers in the history of the medium. His status as an outsider, he migrated from Germany to the U.S. during WWII, allowed him to look at the facades and injustices of postwar American society (particularly on themes such as class, gender and race). From this perspective, Sirk can be thought of as one of cinema's greatest ironists.
Released in-between his masterpieces All That Heaven Allows (1955) and Written on the Wind (1956), There's Always Tomorrow (1956) is a particularly unusual film in Douglas Sirk's output in the mid-to-late 1950s. Filmed in black-and-white, Tomorrow centers on an upper-middle class toy maker who seemingly has the perfect life - a wife, two teenaged children and a house in suburbia. But for all that, he feels lonely and unappreciated by his loved ones. When he meets a former employee and begins to develop romantic feelings for her, things get complicated as his children are increasingly suspicious of their father's ""extramarital affair.""
What separates Tomorrow from most of Sirk's melodramas and the majority released in the 1950s is that these films centered on the experiences of women and particularly those in domestic setting. Tomorrow is a rare film of its era as it portrays the banality of middle-class life in a domestic setting. Here, we see Clifford navigating hopelessly in a world where he leads a miserable existence. He is trapped in a world that values his economic and social standing over his own personal happiness. I found these characters so tragic and hopeless and the sad part is....there's really nothing they can do to make it any better.
Tomorrow is peak Sirkian melodrama and a truly undervalued film in his canon. Thankfully this was streaming on Criterion Channel as it is often hard to find. It's ripe for critical reassessment and deserves to be discussed amongst the best Sirkian melodramas. Highly recommended.",4.5
"america’s gender-swapped brief encounter. i can’t be bothered to read fred macmurray’s despair as real and true. he plans a birthday outing for his wife without her knowledge and then, when the plans are spoiled, somehow never considers going WITH his wife to his daughter’s ballet recital. he seems to totally ignore that his wife’s care for the family is in fact performing a kind of totally alienating work, more alienating than anything precipitating his half-hearted swipe at a midlife crisis. and unlike her housekeeper, she’s not even paid. but she’s so grateful for her beautiful family. after all, what else does a woman have? 
the movie ends with rex the robot walking off the table. that’s canon.",4.0
"So Sirk COULD make a stinker during the 1950s. This one is just so by the books and formulaic which isn’t shocking when we consider it came from some trash novel. The problem is that I don’t feel much of anything for our lead because he sucks ass on some level. This isn’t a woman forced into these awful life places by society—this is a dude so up his own ass he isn’t aware his daughter has a dance recital and WILLING chooses to miss it. Bellyache about your kids growin up and not needing you as much is fine, but this dude just kinda bloooooows. He wants all the attention centered on him and he’s too stupid to recognize that if he actually helped with childcare then maybe he and his wife could get more time together.
Acting is of course fine and so is directing—this one just dies in the story.",1.5
"I, too, would be heartbroken if I couldn't get Barbara Stanwyck but would be okay in the end if I ended up with Joan Bennett",5.0
"Maybe the ultimate dad movie, though not in the way we usually use that phrase. Sirk’s film gives us a sitcom-perfect 50s family and then makes the threat of its dissolution feel apocalyptic, but in a neat twist, it’s not Dad and the other woman who are the problem, but the wife and kids. If it weren’t so compelling, There’s Always Tomorrow might feel like a straw man: “But what about the straight white affluent men?!” There’s a lot of truth here, though, about how a genial provider can be taken for granted. (I felt a stab of guilt.) I doubt Clifford was the only 50s patriarch who felt like all anyone wanted him to be was a robot.",4.0
"This film quite a surprise. You see McMurray and Stanwyck and you think the steaminess of Double indemnity however we get anything but this is Douglas sirk at His Best. Typically he focuses on isolated women craving for attention only to be denied by societal norms and judgmental neighbors here you get responsible father who is struggling to find time to reconnect with his wife only to be continually stymied by the needs of his children. Happenstance reconnection with a former employee Sparks some deeply buried passion in Mc Murray he falls into the trap of believing you must be in love but try as he might it does not go anywhere. Still his children have no problem judging him for his thoughts. Clearly, Douglas cirque does not like children. The world would be a much better place if these three wandered off into the sunset. Incredibly, the happy ending here has McMurray staying with wife Joan Bennet  Who is not a shrew but get s caught up in worrying that she won’t be deemed a good mother if she doesn’t doubt on her children enough. For me the ending almost felt like an episode of the twilight zone. It leaves  you feeling like the characters caught in a nightmare",4.5
"A beautiful, quiet tragedy about roads not taken and coming to terms with regret, made all the more impactful by the casting of Murray and Stanwyck a dozen years after their lustful, murderous pairing in Double Indemnity. As old friends who haven't seen each other in over two decades, the pair have an easy camaraderie that instantly communicates their unspoken history, but memories of their former work together helps feed the fires burning under the surface. 
Props to Joan Bennett for fading into the background as Murray's loving but distracted wife, but still giving the character a dimension that most movies about this subject wouldn't bother with. The ending could have used a few more minutes to breath, but this is just as electric as Sirk's better know Technicolor melodramas of the same period.",4.5
"Well-made melodrama that bitterly exposes the hollowness of the 1950's ideal of the nuclear family. There's a piquant subtext to having Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck as co-stars after the classic ""Double Indemnity"" of eleven years earlier. Everything is very sincere, and yet the layer of irony hovering over it all adds new dimensions to the film. I'm always impressed when a film's theme can double as a portrait of an entire era. ""Maria Braun"" did it for post-war Germany, and perhaps it is one of the many lessons Fassbinder learned from Douglas Sirk. The movie ends (or should have ended) with a classic shot as a dazed MacMurray unconsciously sets a robot toy in action, and the automaton stand-in for the husband grimly marches toward the camera and the end of the table.",4.0
"Not quite ALL that heaven allows.
This is a drama about cheating that bends over backwards, to the point of doing a handstand, to excuse and water down the protagonist’s affair. Stanwyck clearly goes after MacMurray, and he’s 100% down with it (he got those awful Sirkian kids, after all) but in the movie’s eyes he’s one of the good philanderers, everybody else just doesn’t understand him.",0.0

Essentially this is a gender flip of what Sirk had done the previous year with All That Heaven Allows: whereas Heaven was concerned with the class gap between an older woman and a younger man, Tomorrow is concerned more with the assumptions that a middle class white family in America would have in the 1950s when *gasp* a man and a woman become FRIENDS.

"Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck star in a pretty mediocre kind of love story that doesn’t really feel like it should’ve been a movie to begin with. It feels like a filler episode in a TV soap as opposed to something that deserves a cinematic spotlight.
Fred plays a toy maker who reconnects with an old friend, played by Barbara, who’s been pining away for him for years, but Fred is married, and that poses a problem. The ending is supposed to be romantically tragic, but nothing feels solved, or satisfyingly wrapped up.
It’s pretty bland for a Sirk joint, and there just wasn’t enough story here to make this a solid, syrupy weeper. But I sure liked spending time with the characters in this one, even if part of it felt like it could have easily turned into a madcap slapstick comedy of errors.

Recommended.",3.0
"This time Sirk mines the American suburban malaise of the men, taking the melodrama in a thornier and much more devastating direction than I initially expected. The house, as it does in lots of Sirk films, reflects the protagonist’s imprisonment, but here it’s fully a surveillance state: the family members constantly watch each other through windows and around corners, stringing together stories of the others’ lives assuming they see but looking right past each other. Barbara brings the house down in the third act",4.5
"Another wonderful romantic melodrama from the absolute master of the genre, Douglas Sirk. I wish it had been shot in color, but Russell Metty's brilliant cinematography still looks gorgeous in black-and-white. Sirk's melodramas take advantage of the soapy absurdism and artifice associated with the genre, utilizing a very cinematic aesthetic. Regardless of the genre's silly attributes, Sirk's films are also notable for being deeply thoughtful and humanist works. I don't exactly agree with the critics and scholars who consider Sirk's melodramas to be vicious takedowns of the nuclear family and ""suburban imprisonment"". They certainly are subversive, but I think Sirk's goal was to reveal the humanity and complexity of these lives and communities—and not simply to attack traditional values and practices.
What's unique about this film in particular is how it deviates from the other melodramas in regards to its lead character. Sirk's other melodramas almost all focused on female leads, (which prompted many critics at the time to dismiss his work as ""women's pictures""), but this film has a male lead and focuses on the unfulfilled husband. Fred MacMurray's performance is beautiful. He's not simply some old horndog who wants to fuck a younger woman and ignore his family obligations.  Barbara Stanwyck is also perfect. An incredibly nuanced performance, she's not simply a homewrecker bent on stealing back her old flame. They are two lonely humans, middle-aged and unappreciated. They just want to be happy.
Just like in All That Heaven Allows, the young adult and child characters are almost a bit too cartoon-y in their scheming, but even that situation is treated sensitively.
All in all pretty masterful stuff.",4.5
"There's a strong visual motif of people peering through windows in this film. Characters either stare out dreamily imagining what life could be or they see a snapshot of other people's lives and try to judge and create a whole picture off of that, and that shared theme of imagining more than you see is kind of what the whole film is about. The central affair isn't started out of lust, it's a way for both characters to fantasize about what their life could have been. Norma treats her time with Clif as a way to fantasize about what a life of domesticity with an old crush would have been like and Clif uses her to fantasize escaping the domestic life he feels trapped and unappreciated in. Meanwhile his children only catch glimpses of their friendship and assume the worst, and their cruelty and duplicitousness towards him only pushes him closer to Norma. Barbara Stanwyck's Norma is a surprisingly strong, mature, and independent character for a '50s drama and her performance is a highlight. It's a fascinating, complicated drama filled with the humanistic societal critique Sirk is known for and shadowy B&W cinematography that heightens the drama and adds to the themes of duplicitousness, paranoia, and observation. I noticed a lot of similarities with Sirk's ""All That Heaven Allows,"" particularly the bratty children, and watching this made me appreciate it even more for how adeptly he interweaves the social critique with the drama. Sirk continues to be one of my favorite Golden Age directors and this movie proved to be just as good as his Technicolor pictures.",4.0

"Second viewing. My favorite Sirk out of his “big” six (of which it is the least popular), in no small part because its subject—the usual monotonous entrapment of domesticity, but through the crucially unusual prism of the emotional neglection and deprivation of the Nuclear Man who's taken for granted, the lowest on the pecking order of attention (as opposed to the usual ideas of sexual freedom or asphyxiating portrayal of kids)—happens to be one that resonates heavily with me (and with that I mean the unrequited attention and love of a man), for some (not entirely ambiguous) reason or another. Right from the get-go in that elliptical setup, the film stacks a heavy (but plausible and understandable) onslaught of rejection against our protagonist whose own family seems to regard no more than a man of robotic function. Not necessarily not loved, but certainly not affectionally so. Sirk shoots those moments in fittingly shameful fashion, engulfing Clifford by the shadows of his own home. That this in conjunction with the reappearance of an old flame and friend leads to the (eventual) active pursuit of unfaithful avenues seems then an instinctive course for the film. But this is less so The Heart Wanting What It Wants and more so The Heart Wanting What It Lacks, and with desperate eagerness attaching itself to the first organism that provides the chemical in demand. And the film very much calls attention to the shallow nature of the barely come-to-life liaison without cheapening it in any way, for the nucleus of those desires (from both sides) is still legitimate.
Could do without Vinnie’s recital of Norma’s harangue towards him and his sister for Ann as a demonstration of growth, and I do wish that Sirk didn’t feel the need to visually show the plane flying overhead, much less cut into Norma; how wonderful would it not have been to just have Cliff pause the lightning of his cigarette at the sound of the plane? That’s just a small nitpick though, and otherwise it’s the kind of quiet transgression of small social barriers that just rocks my world (as opposed to tediously morally instructive films about Big, Important topics), with just enough ambiguous inconclusiveness to make you uncertain of the glib melioration. Magnificent emotions.",4.5

I don't think it's as good as his best stuff, but a grand time all the same. The ending is fairly remarkable and mature, a far cry from the usual happy endings of the era.",4.0
"Another masterpiece by the great, great Douglas Sirk. When you watch it for the first time, you think it's a very good film about a doomed love story. That's wrong. Sirk's film is so much more. It's a story about the human need to love and be loved, to feel alive, to obtain what you don't have. The perfect family model is deconstructed, only to to be constructed again. Douglas Sirk was not an ethicologist. He just studied human nature and behavior in modern society. And he did that like no other director. ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Imitation of Life"" are his most famous and acclaimed works, but I think ""There's Always Tomorrow"" also ought to be ranked among his best films.",5.0

"My mini Stanwyck film series wraps up (for now) with this 1955 Sirk melodrama about a dissatisfied family man who reconnects with a woman from his past who makes him realize what could have been. It's pure fantasy, wonderful Hollywood romance utterly removed from real life, and I loved it. It can never be! He shouldn't leave his family for her! But she's BARBARA STANWYCK, and she loves him!",4.5
"Excerpt from Sirk on Sirk, a book of conversations with Jon Halliday.
Jon Halliday: Do you want to say anything about There’s Always Tomorrow?
Douglas Sirk: I can't remember it, but I don't have an entirely bad feeling about it. Fred MacMurray was a very good actor, and he was ambiguous in this; a successful man, but a failure in his own house. He has a toy factory, which he cannot break away from, like he can't break away from his past. He is like a naïve American boy who has never grown up. And then Stanwyck comes back from his past but she doesn't find a grown man. She leaves. I think I became the victim of an unfinished thought from Stopover (All I Desire), which I tried to continue, but it didn't work out.
Both MacMurray and Stanwyck were excellent. But I think there was probably a flaw in the casting of the other woman and in the writing. And the other thing was that the picture needed colour, which was planned.",5.0
"“Once upon a time, in sunny California”
Maybe my favorite Sirk so far (though my love for his films has been remarkably consistent). Also marvelous as the tragic finale to the makeshift “Stanwyck/MacMurray in love” trilogy that began with Remember the Night and Double Indemnity.",4.5
"Un des premiers mélodrames de Sirk. Sobre comparé à ses plus connus mais sa griffe caustique est résolument présente. Un mélodrame de Sirk, objet jouissif, c’est un scénario à l’eau de rose assez routinier raconté avec une verve enragée, subversive, voire quasi amorale compte tenu de l’ère atomique dans laquelle ils se passent. Un roman Harlequin avec une trame sonore de Napalm Death.
Comme dans All That Heaven Allows, les tortionnaires du personnage principal (un homme, une exception dans les mélodrames de Sirk) sont ses enfants. Sirk use et abuse d’images de barreaux, écrans décoratifs mi-transparents, impressions d’aquarium, qui évoquent la prison de la famille nucléaire irréprochable dans laquelle ce père se sent enfermé et exploité.
Après, j’ai un malaise à l’avouer, mais je n’arrive pas vraiment à m’intéresser au sort de Fred McMurray et de Barbara Stanwyck comme acteurs. Je conçois que c’est totalement subjectif mais je ne sens pas la chimie, je n’arrive pas à les sentir incarnés dans leur rôle (c’est le cas même pour Double Indemnity, tourné onze ans plus tôt). C’est tout le contraire pour Joan Bennett qui, ici, se voit attribuer un rôle quelque peu ingrat compte tenu de son immense presence. Je n’exclus pas que cette étrange idée de distribution eut été consciente, car justement, son personnage quelque peu léger et laissé pour contre de l’histoire est de loin celui qui apparaît comme le plus vivant du métrage.
Aussi: le linge de Stanwyck est complètement crackpot.",3.5
"Nope. Great performances, but the ""unfaithful men are the real victims because they're driven to seek affection outside the home by their ungrateful wives and children"" sob story doesn't age well.

"THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW (Douglas Sirk, USA, 1956) 8
Sorry, I dont get the ""Sirk as Brecht"" thing; his films (to me anyway) work fine taken straight. There is, at most, one shot here that approaches melodramatic parody (late robot closeup) and one genre-necessitated misstep (son ending). Otherwise, this is simply a superb ""woman's picture"" ... ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS with the sexes reversed (and some minor sex-role-needed tweaks). The use of varied arrangements of ""Blue Moon,"" the shadows surrounding Fred MacMurray, his and Barbara Stanwyck's performances ... awesomely done.",4.0
"Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Joan Bennett star in ""There's Always Tomorrow,"" directed by Douglas Sirk and featuring William Reynolds, Gigi Perreau, Judy Nugent, and Pat Crowley as the young people.
MacMurray is a successful toy developer, Clifford Groves, married to Marion (Bennett), and they have three children (Reynolds, Perreau, and Nugent). Marion is preoccupied with the kids and the household, while MacMurray is longing for some alone time with her and to do something different - take a weekend off, go to the theater -- but something always happens that prevents it.
When Marion can't make a theater performance because of their daughter's dance recital, Cliff stays home alone. A woman who once worked for him, Norma Vale (Stanwyck) comes over to say hello. She's now a successful dress designer in from New York. He takes her to the theater instead, and then she asks to see his office.
When a planned weekend in the desert with Marion doesn't work out because one of the girls breaks her ankle, Marion insists that Clifford go without her and relax. There, he runs into Norma again.
Unfortunately, his son (Reynolds) shows up and thinks Cliff and Norma are involved. He and his friends leave without making their presence known to his dad. Without realizing what's happening, Cliff is falling for Norma; and he doesn't know that she's always been in love with him.
This is a midlife crisis, '50s style, with the underpinning of the grass is always greener. That wasn't the original intention, of course - the original intention of the film is that Norma is lonely and would give up her wonderful career to have a family like Marion and Cliff have.
People still feel this way, but today, it's more because of the road not taken, not so much because of dissatisfaction. Nothing's perfect, as the film shows us. Cliff sees Norma's freedom, the attention she pays him, her interest in his work. He feels in fourth place behind the kids to Marion.
Cliff is sick of being like the robot that is his latest toy. You wind him up, he works, he comes home, he has dinner, he goes to bed. With Norma he sees an opportunity for something different. Youth. To be put first. Endless possibility.
What a lovely movie, and I thought I was sitting down to some second feature. Instead, it has Sirk's magic touch and his sly criticism of the picture-perfect '50s American life.
Frankly, I could have slapped the kids and Marion for not seeing what's in front of their faces, but to be fair, kids are self-involved, and Marion is completely committed to doing what she thinks is important for Cliff and their family.
Wonderful acting, with MacMurray as the frustrated Everyman, Bennett as an attractive, disciplined woman, and Stanwyck is someone who has earned wisdom the hard way, through hard work and disappointment.
Highly recommended.",4.0
"In this adults-only, non-canon theatrical chapter of the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER saga, successful toymaker Ward Cleaver (played by, ironically, MY THREE SONS' Fred McMurray), disenchanted by the lack of romance shown by June Cleaver (DARK SHADOWS' Joan Bennett), falls easy prey to adventurous, bold and ambiguously lesbian career woman Barbara Stanwyck, who issues the most glorious ""you rotten kids"" verbal beatdown to Wally and Beaver ever filmed.
All of which is to say that THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW examines the dark underbelly of 1950's suburban life with intelligence, laser-precision, sympathy and empathy for all characters involved, and, as always, heavy symbolism and melodrama so raw it bleeds to the touch.
Douglas Sirk, you magnificent bastard.",4.5
"81/100
The only Sirk I've seen that fits neatly into his reputation for hiding secret subtextual movies under gaudy melodramas. Volatile undercurrents constantly explode into the surfaces of his other movies in unmissable ways (particularly in his deranged Albert Zugsmith collabos) - conversely, There's Always Tomorrow feels restrained, even polite. You could easily enjoy it as a simple, moving, but polished Brief Encounter riff, without confronting any of the ironies and inversions waiting to be dug up. Perhaps it's the…",4.5

It's fun to see William Reynolds and Gigi Perreau return as more malevolent siblings after their nicer turns in Has Anybody Seen…",4.0
"One of Douglas Sirk's most interesting melodramas opts for a gender reversal of the disaffected, lonely suburban character. Instead of a jaded, neglected housewife, we have Fred MacMurray's sensitive toy manufacturer, who after being pretty much emotionally abandoned by his children and his wife suffers from a midlife crisis and flirts with the idea of throwing it all away for a former flame (Barbara Stanwyck). What really takes this film to the next level is the manner in which Sirk subtly opts to leave so many loose ends flapping around, rather than playing it safe.",4.5

i’m usually a huge douglas sirk fan but I couldn’t get behind this one entirely,2.5
"Amid classic Sirkian symbolism, Barbara Stanwyck ponders whether to save Fred MacMurray from his middle-class suburban hell...tears ensue.",5.0
"Toy manufacturer Clifford Groves' life is much like the walking talking robot he's just created that he hopes will be a big best-seller. Just as the robot goes through the same automaton moves over and over again, Clifford is experiencing the same thing in his life, failing to find the joy in his normal, perhaps slightly boring, predictable marriage to his normal, perhaps slightly boring, predictable wife (Joan Bennett) and their three normal, perhaps slightly boring, predictable children. Fred MacMurray hits all the right notes here as Clifford, a genuinely good-hearted man who just wants a little excitement in his life...which he gets when an old co-worker pops into his world and leads him down a precariously dangerous path should they both agree to travel it.
Unlike one of their previous films together Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck as the other woman isn't purposefully trying to lure Clifford into something he shouldn't do. The roles are almost switched here with MacMurray as the coercer and it's a nice spin especially since I watched the aforementioned Billy Wilder flick right before this one.
While the acting is generally solid -- even Joan Bennett as a housewife right out of Father Knows Best or Leave It to Beaver feels appropriate -- the film isn't exactly exciting or engaging. I give it a little bit of credit for not being as melodramatic as I expected (especially considering this is a Douglas Sirk-directed pic), for focusing on a man's mid-life crisis which seems like an anomaly in films of yesteryear, and for the ambivalent ending that leaves you questioning whether MacMurray's Clifford has found bliss.
Still, this isn't one that I need to return to unless I feel like exploring the oeuvre of MacMurray or Stanwyck again...which I wouldn't necessarily be against as they're two actors of the old Tinseltown era whom I greatly admire.
Side Note: Can I just say that I kind of fell for Pat Crowley as Clifford's son's beleaguered girlfriend? She was absolutely charming and spunky...and her film career didn't take off in the slightest based off her imdb page (although she did work a bit in tv). A little surprised about that only because I found myself taken a bit with her balanced and believable performance amidst the melodrama here.

"There’s always tomorrow is a movie that hits close to home. It’s portrayal of family and the negligence of parents not only from the adolescent children but also towards each other is a powerful one, depicted with complete realism, it’s a film that’s still very relevant in the world today, although with a more balanced position for the husband and wife when it comes to work. Handles every character and their actions with grace and respect, makes every character feel real and caring, with a purpose, very rarely do we get to see a movie where the man is the one that is in need of emotional intimacy, let alone in a movie from the 50’s. I couldn’t help but notice how much this movie and David Lean’s “Brief Encounter” has in common, they almost serve as companion pieces to each other, both movies being about the same loneliness that the characters feel in what would otherwise seem like successful and loving families from the outside, although personally I liked “There’s Always Tomorrow” much more.

"The Sirkian bitch slap that I know and love in full force. This was one of his that I had not seen, and so whilst on a Stanwyck binge watch (which I'm truly living for, right now, I must say) I decided to invest in this title.
This one is a more low key effort, but nevertheless, equally as excoriating as his more lavish works. There is an interesting gender reversal here, with him focusing on the ennui and stultifying effects of suburban conformity on a man instead of a woman. It works brilliantly. MacMurray in the 1950's has the doughy and milquetoast appearance that renders this story and characterisation believable. He's also very moving.
As in other Sirk melodramas, there is the recurring theme of the troublesome, meddling and problematic children in young adulthood who upset the apple cart, and not in pleasing ways. Sirk seems to be saying that children have the ability, once they stop being children and start to become fully formed people, to destabilise and destruct the myths that have been built by the adults that raised them. Joan Bennett is in a rather thankless role, but that appears to be the point. She is fully assimilated into the Stepford clique and will hear no word of dissent about the sameness of life crushing the soul. She sees happiness in routine and predictability. Being able to predict each day as the same day she will live over and over again for eternity is somehow comforting.
Which brings us to Stanwyck. She is the interloper here, and as such is the catalyst for disturbing feelings starting to hum under the surface of MacMurray's tranquil existence. She also has the wisdom to know that the man she has been carrying the torch for, for two decades is no longer the man he was and will only gain moderate joy from a future without the kingdom he has built around him and would resent her in time for tearing him away. This all makes for a sad and rather pathetic bunch of people, accepting their lot and stiff upper lipping it through to the end.
Stanwyck though, looking from this vantage point, 70 odd years in the future, will most likely have the most promising years ahead of her, with the 1960's just round the corner and New York beckoning her back. It probably wasn't seen that way 70 years ago though.
Also, talk about a Sirk kick drop, when she lambasts and chastises his children for being the cause of his misery and actually tells them they should be ashamed of themselves for it, I wanted to applaud. The gaul of Sirk to confront and criticise the sacred family unit, in the guise of a single and independent woman? Brilliant touch. Bravo!
Major!!!",5.0
"Originally published on Cine-File.
Melodrama and nuance aren’t exactly synonymous descriptors. One hears the former with regard to film and assumes magnified scenarios that are intended to elicit a broad range of emotions. Subtlety is nowhere to be found, as is the case with Douglas Sirk’s… well, anything, but here in particular his 1956 film THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW. At least, not upon initial consideration. Beneath the intensified affections in Sirk’s films are certain truths of humanity not always palatable unless expressed so totally. In THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW, adapted from Ursula Parrott’s novel of the same name and produced by Ross Hunter (who also produced the 1934 adaptation directed by Edward Sloman), toy manufacturer Cliff Groves (Fred MacMurray) begins to feel taken for granted by his family; his wife (Fritz Lang femme fatale Joan Bennett) is overly preoccupied with the children, and the children are preoccupied with their own lives, seeing father mostly as a big dollar sign. So when former employee Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), having transformed from a mousy toy designer into a glamorous clothing designer, shows up at his doorstep, Cliff finds wistful respite in catching up with his old friend. One thing leads to another, and his teenage son begins suspecting the two of having an affair. His girlfriend admonishes him for this, with good arguments to support her position. But viewers have been privy to that which has caused the son’s suspicion, romantic feelings obviously having blossomed (at least for Cliff; Norma admits to always having been in love with him) between the two. Meanwhile Cliff’s wife, Marion, doesn’t suspect a thing—but is it because she’s so taken her husband for granted that she’s blind to his emotional indiscretions, or is her trust in him so unwavering that the thought of her husband being any less than the honorable man she married is simply so far-fetched? Is Clifford truly in love with Norma, or is he nostalgic for a time when he had less responsibility? And what is it that Norma wants? Much is made of her being a childless career woman, something everyone, including herself, is convinced has made her life an ultimately unfulfilled one. But perhaps she’s just managed to evade the rut altogether and is lamenting something she doesn't even know would have brought her happiness to begin with, considering Cliff’s emotional infidelity toward his wife, who’s only doing the thing she’s always been expected to do. (He’s a parent, too. Why, then, has all the responsibility for child rearing fallen to Marion, only for him to resent her for it?) Rather despairingly, it would seem THERE’S ALWAYS TOMORROW presents the double-edged sword of both traditional and modern American society, pitting housewife against career woman, man unlikely to find true happiness with either, a conundrum posited by Norma in two separate monologues that express the situation’s inherent contradiction. Sirk had wanted to make the film in color but, when he wasn’t permitted to do so, was still able to have longtime collaborator Russell Metty shoot it. The result is chiaroscuro black-and-white cinematography that underscores the facade of both domestic bliss and romantic fantasy with a noir-esque aesthetic that almost makes the pursuit of happiness feel like a crime. Visual metaphors, such as a toy robot that Cliff’s company is producing—representing the automation with which he’s going through life, as well as how society views him, a machine to be wound up at will—and shadows of rain running down Norma’s cheeks as she stoically comes to terms with reality, complement Sirk’s aims, mimicking one’s overall interpretation of the film as being broad (such visual representation may seem obvious) but even more subversive for being so. This was Sirk’s second film with Stanwyck (the first being ALL I DESIRE from 1953) and Stanwyck’s fourth with MacMurray. Both are excellent, Stanwyck as always and McMurray especially so, communicating the uncertainty that underlies not just the film but domestic relationships as a whole. Nuance is conveyed subtlety in elements such as MacMurray’s performance, but in general it’s an illusory lack thereof that is the ultimate distinction.",0.0

Basically there ended up being two frustrated camps: the “how are you going to treat your dad that way?” camp and the “how are you going to treat your wife that way?” camp.
I bring this up 1) to shout out Dr. Gordon, but also 2) to pay attention to how this film involves and toys with the audience. Melodramas get a bad rap for being obvious and this is overt. However, it’s also quick and nimble. MacMurray’s career as a toy salesman immediately signals the “still a bit more committed to being a boy than man” aspect of him and the comically lonely first glimpse we see of his home life only makes his frustrations with 50s suburban-family manhood more apparent. It’s almost as if all this summons Stanwyck to his door and within 10 or 15 minutes it’s easy as a viewer to rush through the rest of what you think the film is going to be. She liberates him of his loneliness and apron (here, it’s a quick hardly adorned thought compared to Rebel Without a Cause’s fixation on it the previous year) and, when a minor inconvenience prevents Joan Bennett (playing MacMurray’s wife) from taking a weekend trip with him, you expect Stanwyck to again come to the rescue. Only this doesn’t happen quite so maliciously. A bush blocks the camera’s view of the passenger seat when MacMurray pulls up the resort, preparing the viewer for a reveal of Stanwyck that doesn’t come. He arrives alone and any preemptive mutters of “that motherfucker…” will have to wait for another time. He even shoos away a flirting woman at the resort’s bar.
The movie takes things slow and meticulously goes step-by-step through what will obviously (or will it?) become an emotional (if not more) affair. And with each step, I think there’s an implicit question to the audience of “Is this cheating yet?” If the viewer doesn’t want to take up the burden of answering this, then his son (insisting from the get-go that it’s cheating) and the son’s girlfriend (always tempering his accusation and even preemptively forgiving MacMurray) will answer instead. As the movie goes on through these steps, it keeps glancing back, rapidly reframing moments initially perceived to be innocent as guilty and vice versa. These aren’t lectures. The movie doesn’t draw a line in the sand on when MacMurray has sinned. It only puts more eyes on the situation.
Among these eyes are Bennett’s. Rather than leaving her to be a sitting duck, the movie shows her to be, whether or not she knows the full story, very clear-eyed about Stanwyck and herself where MacMurray isn’t. The best movies about cheating — for example, Before Sunset or Moonstruck — are about decisions more than they are about mistakes (there may be a slant to “You’re life isn’t built on nothing” or “You’re gonna miss that plane,” but both focus on what decisions a character is making or is made and, in doing so, reveal their self as marked by those decisions rather than thrown away and remade). Nothing Bennett does is defensive as an attempt to match Stanwyck. She just stays true to herself. After all, that’s the woman MacMurray married.
Baked into all of this is a lot of commentary about the lifestyles available to the characters in the society depicted, which is to say that the film has laid all its cards on the table. Still, it’s a movie that neither embraces regret nor reassurance. Undoubtedly though, it has stirred the pot.",5.0

"Less a melodrama than a harrowing portrait of the supposedly happy nuclear family. We watch as a man’s contentment gradually grows into contempt, with the angels of his life rendered into demons in own his eyes. There is no silver lining here, no honest-too-goodness moment of truth. Even the “moral” of this supposedly moralistic story is placed firmly in its most manipulative sequence, where truisms are aped by a character that doesn’t believe a word of it.
Just a superb movie, with Sirk’s melodramatic cinematic style being utilized - as usual - to uncover the less refined aspects of human nature.",4.5

"A film that starts with the words “Once upon a time in Sunny California…” and then cuts to a woman walking in the pouring rain is a good one to me, no matter what, especially if it's a Stany and Fred reunion.
I don't like Sirk and his melodramas, but I appreciated this film and his more toned down approach to the complexities of the characters' situations and relationship.

"Apesar de Douglas Sirk ser conhecido por filmes ""para mulheres"", cheios de melodrama, focados em temas do quotidiano, familia, amor, papéis de género, distante dos noir típicos da época, aqui, o foco é o homem. Especificamente o homem da familia nuclear, chefe de familia, ""ganha-pão"", soberano, pai.
Cliff vive para trabalhar como criador de brinquedos. Um deles, que servirá como metáfora para o papel de Cliff, é o robô que anda e fala. Cliff sente falta de companhia e ternura quando chega a casa, cansado do trabalho, da rotina, apenas quer estar com a sua familia, principalmente a mulher, e receber algum carinho.
No entanto, a maneira como Douglas Sirk cria personagens faz com que todas as perspectivas sejam válidas e que não existam bons nem maus. Apesar desta necessidade válida de afecto de Cliff, não o vemos a ter uma presença tão ativa como a mãe: não quer ir ao baile da filha, quer viajar quando a mesma fica magoada, entre outras maneiras que neglicência a família em favor do seu egoísmo. O conflito é introduzido pela personagem de Norma, uma volta à juventude de Cliff, onde tudo era mais fácil, sem a familia, sem a pressão toda do trabalho.
Apesar de ter uma narrativa relativamente simples, o filme brilha nas interações das personagens, que são incrivelmente realistas e complexas, cada uma com a sua perspectiva. O único ponto negativo é alguma inflexibilidade e até polaridade dos pontos de vistas, ou 8 ou 80, isto visto principalmente no filho de Cliff e na sua namorada, sendo que um está confiante a 100% que o pai está a trair e a outra o contrário, que ele é absolutamente inocente.",4.0

The 4th and final film collaboration between a couple of my personal favs Barbara stanwyck and Fred macmurry. This is the 3rd out of the 4 that I have now seen.
I hate seeing actors like these get older in films )”: 
Even as these two begin to age, these performances are as strong as ever. The chemistry with these two are unmatched. The emotion just pours onto the screen. It’s truly a joy to watch. 
A complicated tough tale about marriage in the 50s that still can ring very relatable to modern times. The pressure of family, kids work etc weighing on relationships with personal frustration. Sirk’s take on infidelity is an interesting one for sure. 
Movies like this simply wouldn’t be as great and make the charm of the script hit the film the same without actors like stanwyck and macmurry.",4.0

"Bro did you not read the contract about having kids? It’s written in clause one… “Thou shalt occasionally give your entire self to the offspring at the expense of your free time and desires.” It’s also something you should discuss and verbalize with your spouse, not mope and act out by having a fling. 
Needs more ambiguity about the actions of the family, that their orderly selves can be misinterpreted as a cold shoulder. Having Barbara Stanwyck deliver a monologue proselytizing the reverence needed for the loving father is more for the audience than the kids. Should’ve been delivered to Fred MacMurray and let the kids figure it out. The ending is too neat considering the storm that just happened. Old Hollywoob be like that.",2.5
"Would make a great companion piece to the other rekindled or wrong place/wrong time romance films like Brief Encounter, Two Lovers, or Before Sunset (and maybe soon Past Lives!). Sirk's knack for melodrama feels elevated in this one with the father stumbling his way into the unexpected situation, his son so fearful of transgression tearing his home apart (rising trend of the 50s) he almost wills it into existence, and then a successful woman giving a monologue about how as a man being neglected he has a right to leave his children... DIRECTLY TO HIS CHILDREN... Just before blaming them for their father being infatuated with a life outside of them and their mother. Nothing stirs quite over the top like the shot of MacMurray staring out of the rain soaked window with a wind up robot waddling towards the camera, and you know what, I'm fucking here for it. Sirk uses that over the topness to dissect the nuclear home, the burdens and responsibilities and the weight that comes with them, and how it directly affects the lives and choices of the next generation. This was great.",4.5
"A Douglas Sirk melodrama featuring two fantastically realized middle-aged characters, who meet again for the first time in 20 years and offer each other the chance of a new life, to change the choices they made so many years ago. It's a mature, complicated, but ultimately confirming story about love, family, and aging.",4.0
"No es sólo porque se pase la película lloviendo o porque sea en blanco y negro, pero quizás estamos ante el melodrama más oscuro y triste del gran Sirk.
Un hombre de mediana edad atrapado en una familia insatisfactoria, con una mujer sólo pendiente de sus hijos y de su casa, se reencuentra con una vieja amiga de juventud.
Este es el planteamiento. Curioso ya que se plantee desde la posición masculina cuando los cánones del género suelen volcarse en la mirada contraria.
En definitiva Sirk vuelve a desarrollar alguno de sus temas preferidos, el de los hijos que impiden la felicidad de sus padres, el de la renuncia por amor y el de las difíciles ataduras de las convenciones.
Aunque el guión quiera proponer una vuelta de tuerca final conservadora que Sirk parece aceptar, no le impide colarnos un subtexto mucho más amargo y triste: ¿La vida era sólo esto?",4.0

"Short report 
Criterion was spotlighting Joan Bennett which is fine as ahe plays the wife so busy with raising her brood (now teens) that she doesn’t always have time to notice the man who occupies her bedroom. 
It’s the husband who centers the film as a man who built a toy company but is no longer the focus there, as well. 
The perennial dad by the mid-fifties, Fred MacMurray, is restless. 
When A former secretary, Barbara Stanwyck, shows up in town, temptation finds a foothold. 
Direced by Douglas Sirk post-Germany working at Warners and just before he hit his much lauded years at Universal, it has the stylings and melodrama at just the eight heat to cook. 
Barbara is always just right in every role, in this case, showing allure without the menace of her earlier pair up with Fred in Wilder’s Double Indemnity. 
RememberJoan? She’s able to take a less glamorous role and make it count.

"“Blue moon, you saw me standing alone… Without a dream in my heart…”. O imaginário do homem da Greatest Generation, em plena crise de meia idade: Fred MacMurray, o homem-robô que anda e fala, o patriarca-mecânico, sufocado pela rotina anódina do american way-of-life depois de sobreviver à Grande Depressão e à II Guerra Mundial.
(Res)surge então a figura de Barbara Stanwyck, espécie de fantasma deste “Mr.” Muir - penso aqui no devaneio lírico do filme de Mankiewicz, mas também em ‘Double Idemnity’, que uniu Stanwyck e MacMurray pela primeira vez em 1944. Aparição feminina que oferece não só uma tentação sexual (Sirk sutilmente sugere que uma testosterona é reativada: o brinquedo de ferrorama, a cavalgada, o banho de piscina), mas algo além. Uma idealização romântica que é misto de possibilidade de fuga e chamamento do passado, uma espécie de resposta para o eterno “e se?” que aflige a consciência humana e que só o cinema é capaz de oferecer, graças a sua especificidade ontológica.
Como toda fantasia, o revival também é efêmero, idílico demais para resistir às pressões do decoro social norte-americano dos anos 1950.
Aparentemente moralista, a conclusão é, no fundo, um desespero tão silencioso quanto atormentado: o homem-robô volta ao estado operante, sob os aplausos dos demais encarcerados neste regime de superficialidades suburbanas. Trazendo à tona forças recalcadas sob a aparência, CHAMAS QUE NÃO SE APAGAM pode ser visto também como uma síntese do gênero melodrama, que dialoga com obras anteriores (a transparência da janela que aos poucos de revela opaca em ‘Stella Dallas’) e com o próprio oeuvre sirkiano (‘All That Heaven Allows’). 
E mesmo com uma ironia fina, que costura a dramaturgia apesar e por causa dos esquemas narrativos simplificados do roteiro, todo esse devaneio romântico tem muito mais verdade, desejo e crise de consciência do que, por exemplo, o fetiche cosmético que reveste o apontamento da crise de meia idade em ‘Beleza americana’ (por exemplo). 
São ecos desta consciência estrutural do melodrama elaborada por Sirk de maneira quase demiúrgica que ressoam décadas depois, quando Meryl Streep no banco do carona, em meio à chuva, decide se retorna ou não para a ponte de Madison County. O lamento pela necessidade de respeito à instituição familiar (a chuva que banha a janela e é refletida no rosto de Stanwyck - ou de Streep) é quase um suor, fruto do peso de carregar uma responsabilidade moral; a lágrima verdadeira reside na consequência da despedida, ocultada ao amante mas confidenciada a nós. 
O “amanhã” pode ser menos uma esperança do que uma resignação. É mesmo assim, há beleza, há compreensão humana. Há cinema.",5.0

"This month’s edition of “oh shit what’s leaving Criterion this month” was a perfectly fine meditation on sad men. It hasn’t aged particularly well — it’s clearly a story absolutely neutered by the Hays Code — but it’s good some quality performances and a couple of scenes of real pathos. The most interesting character is Anne, the son’s girlfriend who is not only utterly convinced out hero isn’t cheating but is also understanding of why he would, is done a disservice by the “happy” ending. Her incredible speech about how she’s realized her boyfriend is indeed still a boy is a phenomenal moment that gets lost in a sea of “eh.”",3.0
"Sirk gets away from his trademark technicolor aesthetic and shoots this melodrama in crisp black-and-white to portray relationships that are anything but. While the Hays Code dictated an ending where the family stays together, and for this to be portrayed as a mostly positive development, the actual story being told here is a far messier one about alienation and disintegration: alienation within one’s own home; disintegration of a marriage, of a family, of identity. The film offers no easy answers. The marriage portrayed is a genuinely unhealthy and failing one, as supermom Marion, ably played by Joan Bennett, becomes so consumed and subsumed with her children that she refuses to pay the slightest attention to her marriage, even when Fred MacMurray’s tail-spinning protagonist Cliff tries talking to her directly about how he feels about their life together. She simply ignores him and changes the subject, like Laura Linney hawking the latest product on The Truman Show. The story about the husband with the loving perfect family who nevertheless maritally strays has been told a million times. What makes THIS story more interesting is that you can really understand where Cliff is coming from, because his wife, while an amazing mom, is a genuinely disinterested and failing wife. His kids are all at an age where they’re maximally spoiled and self-obsessed — not their fault so much, but they’re definitely more spoiled and ungrateful than the average child of the 1950s (though not unrealistically so). Cliff is miserable, and is tired of being miserable, and he’s already had enough by the time Barbara Stanwyck walks into his life.
It should go without even saying that Barbara Stanwyck, the greatest actress who ever lived, is sensational in this film, as someone whose morals and regrets are at war with her desires practically every second on-screen. And she of course rips my heart out in her final scene.
For me, the real ending isn’t the final 15 seconds where Cliff is back with his family, and the crisis seems to have passed — an ending clearly mandated by the Code. The ending is right before that when he’s staring at the sky watching Stanwyck’s plane fly away, both of them absolutely devastated.

"Gets off to a bit of a slow start due to Sirk playing things unexpectedly straight and Fred MacMurray just not having the kind of tragic core required to make you sympathize with his whole situation. But it gets better and better as it goes and every time Stanwyck gets a monologue she knocks it out of the park*. And Sirk starts throwing in some deliciously bitter compositions (up to and including the final shot). Beautifully moody lighting from the goat Russell Metty, too... not at all what you'd expect, looks like a noir a lot of the time. Really keys into the more earthbound emotional level this is pitched at compared to their Technicolor collaborations. It's good! Just a little stuck on how much better it would be with, say, Henry Fonda in the MacMurray part, even if that kills the meta element of the casting (although in that case I guess you'd be playing off The Lady Eve, so that would still be fun).

Similar to Lean’s BRIEF ENCOUNTER, wherein the mundanity of everyday life is challenged by a new player entering the game, this film flips that general conceit on its head by not being about the locked up housewife, but instead the husband. It’s less about the romance like in the aforementioned Lean, and more about the desire to feel seen at all, which makes the whole thing bleaker and sadder, and it sneakily feels like it never really uplifts at all.

Best scene is Stanwyck laying into MacMurray’s kids when they show up to confront her at her hotel. Didn’t see it coming and Stanwyck nailed the scene and the pointed recriminations hurled at the ungrateful kids.

"No wonder the social paradigms of the 1950s eroded by the 60s, were propped up again by the 80s, and have been eroding again ever since. It seems like we may be in a perpetual circular motion between the imposition of traditional, patriarchal values, that hurt everyone, and the realization that those are merely constructs. However, the problem then becomes an existential one: Without the aforementioned outmoded customs, how can we combat a lonely existence? Is it all just a system of excuses to fill the inevitable void? I’m not sure. Douglas Sirk really was great at presenting the hypocrisies and paradoxes that society imposed upon us, and asks us delicately, yet emotionally, to conjure empathy for his subjects, as they struggle to empathize with each other. There’s Always Tomorrow lacks the emotional intensity and spirituality of All That Heaven Allows, but presents problems that are just as poignant, and still relevant. Barbara Stanwyck never ceases to prove her GOAT status in every picture.",4.5

I wish this were in color like Sirk wanted, but Russell Metty’s cinematography is as beautiful as ever.

"Mid-life crisis melodrama that has some inspired moments. There’s a particular scene that reflects how small the story really is, which bumps this up a notch. 
Fred MacMurray is inspired as the protagonist in a story whose moral is “be nice to dad because he’s not getting sloppy kisses in the back of a Buick anymore.” He has real charisma with Barbara Stanwick, and Joan Bennett plays all the right notes. The kids are cartoon cutouts of 1950s teenagers with the exception of Ann, Pat Crowley as the older son’s beau.
Some sly moments and Rex the Walking Talking Robot Man round this out into a breezy and involving film.",3.5
"Very tepid for a typical Sirk melodrama, although still beautifully composed. The stark shadows of the black and white cinematography remain just as evocative as his lavish Technicolor productions, and while the central performances don’t miss a beat, the overall story lacks bite and aligns, ironically, with the more traditional sense of 1950s values that it supposedly intends to deconstruct. 
There’s Always Tomorrow begins with an overly didactic presentation of the unappreciated patriarch, building its narrative on a bed of contrivances, until a former flame just so happens to weave their way back into his life at just the exact moment he’s experience marital malaise. So much of the script feels constructed to put Fred MacMurray’s character behind the eight-ball at every turn, whether it’s the insistence that his wife and children truly don’t treat him with the appreciation he deserves, or the convenient manner in which his emotional infidelity is framed as a harmless, or even warranted, development. The film insists upon our sympathies so much that it seeks to gloss over the way in which he seems to have no interest in the life of his own young daughter, begrudging the obligation of her ballet recitals and even her physical well-being if it poses an obstacle to his romantic ambitions. 
The film is not so wholly sympathetic that critique cannot be found in his obtuse consideration for his familial obligations, but the main motif of the film insists upon the correctness of the typical family unit at the end of it all, even for Barbara Stanwyck’s character, who pines for the same kind of life MacMurray has carved out for himself in the decades they’ve been apart. The two have terrific chemistry, as past collaborations have already proven, and Sirk knows how to frame their interactions with real romantic panache. It’s a beautiful movie to be sure, but one with shallow themes.
I’m just glad I didn’t lose my sanity with all those god damn leitmotif renditions of “Blue Moon.” Seriously, of all the played-out romantic warhorses you chose this repetitive sop to play as nauseam?",2.5

"Another pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, this time directed by Douglas Sirk. It’s twelve years after Double Indemnity (and sixteen after Remember The Night) so this one is all about the weight of time and lost love. MacMurray’s married to Joan Bennett and has three kids, who he feels take him for granted because he doesn’t get to go on dates with his wife because she’s taking care of her children, etc. Stanwyck shows up on his doorstep decades after he’s last seen her, and while they did not have anything romantic at the time their friendship is quickly rekindled due in part to how he doesn’t really have anyone else to talk to. This is one of those movies that is weird on a certain level because the characters do not have sex with each other. Part of the drama stems from two teenagers suspecting their dad of cheating on their mom. The weirdest part of the movie is that this suspicion becomes a sticking point for the oldest son’s girlfriend, and they reconcile and kiss passionately once he is convinced his dad is not cheating.
Another weird thing about this movie is that MacMurray works at a toy company and there’s a plot line about a toy robot they are trying to get into department stores. In one shot the robot is set in motion and walks along a table to just beyond the sight of the camera, and it feels like it’s meant to be symbolic. Because I just saw M3gan I was also like “toy robots have really come a long way.”",0.0

"Even when robbed of his Technicolor, one of the things that made me fall in love with Douglas Sirk, he still manages to blow me away in every aspect. It’s annoying to hear how underappreciated he was in his time, being treated as merely melodramatic.
Which is flat-out wrong. Sirk is melodramatic, and so much more. Beginning with the line, “Once upon a time, in sunny California…” Sirk conjures up an image of suburbia, placing within it his little player Clifford Groves, a man pleasant enough to hide his deep dissatisfaction from his family. Despite his renown for being a women’s picture director, here Sirk so deeply imagines the discontent of the suburban family, attacking the plasticity of the nuclear family from another angle. A balance of empathy and logic makes the drama more enticing, as Grooves finds himself edging closer and closer to beginning an affair with an old flame and abandoning his family. Sirk doesn’t cast Grooves as a horndog, and Fred MacMurray, who’s amazing, doesn’t play him like one. Grooves isn’t a case of fragile masculinity, but of someone sick of the routine his society demands of him. He is almost too good at being the distant father - he makes good money, is friendly enough, leaves the housework to his wife. He’s doing all he’s been told to do, and he does it with a pleasantness about him.
Which makes his fall (maybe stumble is more accurate) to committing adultery all the more tense. I find the behavior of the family, the energy of the nuclear family coming together and moving apart, absolutely fascinating. Sirk doesn’t only approach each character with empathy, but with a deeper understanding of the logic with which they approach the world. The suburban world Sirk creates only makes so much sense because the characters he places within it do. He puts in the effort into detailing and considering how one member of the family feels and functions, and logically creates the tight web of interfacial connection based off of that. It’s not just surface-level ‘oh this is what older brothers do, oh this is what younger siblings do,’ it’s an intense look at how each character’s individual perspective is performs and thus creates the WASP ideology they adhere to. I just love to sink my teeth into it, it is the greatest thing for me.
I become more convinced of Sirk’s mastery of the form the more I watch. For me, he’s a real auteur, omnipresent in every aspect of the film. Because it’s so clear that the effort to go beyond is there, that he won’t settle for half-assing something. I’m so impressed and in awe and in love, I need more of his films in my life.

"On a recent Big Picture podcast, Adam Nayman said of Steven Spielberg (paraphrasing) that late-career Spielberg movies are almost like two movies at once: what the movie is about and then what the real movie is about. That descriptor would fit Sirk’s brilliant There’s Always Tomorrow perfectly. On its surface, it is a love affair story about an affable executive at a toy manufacturer who falls for a former colleague after reconnecting on a whim. The acting is superb, the visuals are sumptuous (despite the studio forcing Sirk to shoot in black-and-white), and the story just works. 
But then, there’s what the movie is really about, which is its acid-laced takedown of the American nuclear family and traditional family values. The hints and clues range from extremely obvious (like the wind-up talking toy) to extremely subtle (like the giant doorknob on the front door). The values are misaligned and the soil is fertile for a midlife crisis. The deeply ironic ending is simultaneously funny and sad. It’s great. 
The choice of casting MacMurray and Stanwyck and shooting in black-and-white adds extra meta-textual fun for Double Indemnity fans. MacMurray just can’t stay out of trouble when Stanwyck is around! Can’t blame him.",4.0

"A fascinatingly dark view of one man's midlife crisis that, at first, seems to be on his ""side"" (Sirk details the monotony and disappointments MacMurrays Groves feels effectively, without hammering it home), but I think is more cynical than it first appears. For all the minor annoyances that add up to Groves' frustration with life, they stem from love. Joan Bennett, as his wife, is portrayed as perfectly lovely, his kids typical teenagers. It is not a bad life, just a dull one.
The partnering of Stanwyck as the old flame Vale with MacMurray is genius, because their dynamic in Double Indemnity contrasts well here - we are never sure how innocent she is, is Phyllis lurking beneath ready to lure him to depravity? Even her name, a homophone of 'veil', suggests concealment, something hidden but Stanwyck expertly keeps the balance, makes us doubt.
*Mild Spoiler*
The two scenes that's that highlight this cynicism for me are one where Vale chastises a character for doubting Groves intentions & defending his honour, even turning the blame on them... which is immediately followed by a scene of him sneaking up to Vale, intentions entirely dishonourable.
There is no happy ending to this scenario, one way or the other, so the film doesn't offer one, which is cold, but all the more effective",4.0

"Seems like the primary thing keeping this from being mentioned in the same breath as Sirk’s other 50s masterworks is that it’s in black-and-white rather than the Technicolor of his best loved films. That’s unfair, to an extent: lacking color, Sirk is instead able to transform Fred MacMurray’s home into a prison of expressionist shadows and cramped angles. His gift at expressing a character’s inner life through little more than the camera is nearly unparalleled and certainly not dependent on Technicolor. It’s a terrific movie on its own merits. 
That said, however, it’s now 2022 and we’re not watching this in a vacuum. We know how ecstatically beautiful and ravishing Sirk’s color work of the period was, so it’s not unreasonable to wonder what the Technicolor version of this story might have looked like (especially given the obvious similarities between this and his subsequent masterpiece All That Heaven Allows). I think Sirk agreed that there’s a potential missed opportunity in here, since he apparently wanted to shoot the thing in Technicolor but was denied the opportunity. I’m not sure how correct it is to criticize There’s Always Tomorrow for what it isn’t, but I think that’s where we are.",4.0

Sirk is just as melodramatic and golden in black and white. Not sure any other director’s work has gotten me to hate bratty snot nosed children like he has. Vinnie you’re a bastard. Cliff wants to be young and recklessly in love again while Norma wants his settled domestic life. Neither of them can have it.
I can see this as the first leg of a double billing with The Swimmer. More pure and open hearted, but tugs at the same sorta themes of domestic life as a prison and that yearning for being young and wild again. Even the way MacMurray and Lancaster speak when they face reality comes from the same core feeling.",4.5
a wonderful examination on how patriarchy destroys men as well! Sirk太絕了，把男人四十中年危機拍得驚心動魄，Barbara美得像幻覺一樣，她在大雨中突然出現在他苦悶完美的人生，最後他目送她的飛機在青空遠去，重回青春終究只是中年人的一場春夢。女主角痛罵男主角那對子女簡直是高能金句，導演完全借角色道出資本主義對人的異化在美國中產的虛偽身上發揮得淋漓盡致。但同時儘管這部片可以視為不婚不育保平安的最佳例子，Sirk也沒有忽視事業有成的新世代獨立女性也免不了渴望家庭的溫暖，這就是人性啊！結局的諷刺是Sirk一貫的高水準，值得留意的是墨鏡絕對把男主角靠著門看著飛機那個無奈苦悶的神情安排在最後花樣年華的蘇麗珍身上，由此可見Sirk是如此的timeless啊,4.5
"It's a shame the Douglas Sirk's black and white masterpieces There's Always Tomorrow and The Tarnished Angels aren't ever included in the conversation along with his Technicolor spectacles. Even looking at the views in Letterboxd reveals a shocking drop-off from the least-watched of his most popular Technicolor films, Magnificent Obsession, to the most-watched of his black and whites, The Tarnished Angels. Here are Sirk's five most popular films in Letterboxd based on numbers of members who have watched them:
All That Heaven Allows: 35k members viewed
Imitation of Life: 21k members viewed
Written on the Wind: 19k members viewed
Magnificent Obsession: 11k members viewed
The Tarnished Angels: 4.2k members viewed
There's Always Tomorrow: 3.7k members viewed
Magnificent Obsession has been watched by about 3x more members than There's Always Tomorrow and All That Heaven Allows has about 10x as many! That's nuts.
Anyway, There's Always Tomorrow is maybe the most restrained mid-life crisis film I've ever seen. Rather than starting with betrayal or anything else in the melodramatic mode, it goes straight for loneliness and the frustration of a marital relationship that is dissolving under the pressure of there simply not being enough time in the day rather than any sort of faded love, friendship, or respect for one another. It's also gorgeously shot with long takes and beautifully staged camera movements that require all of the film's actors (even the young ones) to follow complex blocking patterns. There was one particular shot that made my jaw drop where the camera started on the father inside the house before backing out through a window and then landed on a new composition where two teenaged lovebirds were framed within a circular cutout in garden lattice.
This is also the third pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray (the other two being Double Indemnity and Remember the Night), and all three are great films.
In a weird coincidence, this film also featured a reference to An American Tragedy, which I just happened to watch yesterday (well the reference is to the novel, but same diff). Crazy.",4.5

- Douglas Sirk
Superbe. Et terrifiant. Bien que l'âtre du feu dans la maison des Grove soit toujours allumé et que chaque détail du décor renforce l'image d'une résidence de banlieue ""normale"", elle est encombrée d'ombres, d'espaces exigus, de cadres dans des cadres, de vitres et de miroirs, et de regroupements de meubles qui suggèrent à la fois le cercle familial et la séparation des corps en espaces légèrement compartimentés. Cet espace intérieur est suffisamment vaste pour permettre aux personnages de s'y déplacer relativement librement , et aux enfants systématiquement méprisables d'échapper à leur père et de l'espionner, mais pas trop pour que ces personnages ne puissent pas constamment imposer leur présence dominatrice dans toute la maison.
Ceci est mis en évidence dans la première scène se déroulant dans la maison des Groves. Cliff (Fred MacMurray) rentre du bureau, excité par la soirée qu'il a prévue pour l'anniversaire de sa femme. Tout ce qui suit immédiatement illustre son rôle circonscrit au sein de la famille et de l'espace domestique : son fils lui demande impoliment de se taire, sa fille aînée bavarde sur ses ""problèmes émotionnels"" et lui demande ensuite de l'argent, sa femme lui donne une bise sur la joue, dit une platitude impersonnelle sur les fleurs qu'il lui a apportées et s'exclame qu'il est impossible qu'ils passent la soirée ensemble. Cette scène discrètement élaborée est brillamment chorégraphiée, déplaçant tous les personnages dans l'espace domestique puis hors de celui-ci en cinq minutes environ, laissant Cliff enfiler un tablier et manger son dîner seul. Toute l’ambivalence de la vie domestique est résumée dans cette scène. Cadre rassurant de la dynamique familiale au sein du foyer et meme temps lieu de parfaite deshumanisation.
C'est un peu plus tard que Norma (Barbara Stanwyck) se présente à la porte, figure du passé, dont il se souvient à peine mais qui est suffisamment puissante pour représenter tout ce qu'il a perdu. Sa réaction en découvrant cette maison indique également sa propre nostalgie, mais de nombreux détails de mise en scène suggèrent que quelque chose ne va pas dans ce ""tableau"". Elle observe notamment une photo de famille encadrée, dont la composition parfaite de la mère, du fils, des filles et du père absent donne froid dans le dos.
Comme dans de nombreux films de Sirk, les enfants apparaissent comme les plus grandes forces de contrôle social au sein de la famille. Comme dans All that Heaven Allows, le fils devient l'incarnation de ce conservatisme, apparaissant à la fois dans sa tenue et dans son comportement (son expression grave, sa posture exagérément droite, sa moralité méfiante) comme la plus grande menace et le plus grand censeur de la position de Cliff dans la famille.
J'aurais presque preferé que le film se termine sur la scène qui voit Norma sortir définitivement de la vie de Cliff avec ce plan de Rex, le robot ""walkie-talkie"" fabriqué par Cliff, double parfait de cet ""homme mécanique"" manipulable à l'infini et qui ne pourra échapper à sa mise en tombeau.",0.0
"Along with Picnic, Umbrella Entertainment included this in the form of a joint release. (It doesn't separately exist on Blu-ray.) Like most twofers, they both make thematic sense in exploring how repression can occur in an otherwise dutiful nuclear family. If I prefer Sirk's film, it's because of how poignant the conceptual gender-reversed boldness does become. Fred MacMurray plays an honest, caring patriarch who feels neglected by his wife and three kids (e.g. usually a role that's reserved for a housewife), pulverized by each plan to take his family on a trip which they cancel at the last minute. Work life (as a toy manufacturer) and home life (as a longing father) reveals just how routine it is to get away. Unable to do so, Cliff goes solitary, opening up a jolted satisfaction for himself.
In comes Barbara Stanwyck as a former co-worker who ignites a happier spark. The chemistry between Cliff and Norma is beautifully platonic (at least for a while), deepened by a secret love that she's had for two decades, while his friendliness doesn't even hint at adultery. Before queried by Vinnie's suspicions when they're spotted at a Palm Valley resort, Cliff is genuine enough to be truthful that a business meeting got cancelled and he spent the time with Norma instead. Compelling drama gets predicted on Vinnie and Ann's testier relationship (for she's a girlfriend who's entirely on his father's side), and while the frequent coincidence of Vinnie's timing can be ludicrous (either at Norma's bungalow or during a phone call), the ultimate endgame is more than worth it.
Very few folks are gonna regard Sirk as a subtle filmmaker. For the most part, though, such explicitness is visually profound (e.g. Cliff's toy robot is meant to represent his mechanical movements through life), expressed in the wrenching penultimate scene as it waddles into the foreground and he gazes wistfully from the background. I didn't need any of that suggested through dialogue (or diligently telling Norma of his humdrum existence), since they do appear like belabored footnotes. Still, any isolated image of Cliff eating dinner alone or desperately offering the theater tickets he bought for Marion (which were meant for her birthday, but Frankie's ballerina plans intervened!) convey a more potent touch.
Prior to this, I'd seen three of Sirk's Hollywood melodramas (All That Heaven Allows, Written on the Wind and Imitation of Life) which used Technicolor to lush effect. In monochrome, this film is no less stylish (Stanwyck's left-side is heightened from a rain-pattered window) and the shadowed work on MacMurray is a searing motif of his abandonment. (Kicking off with some lovable slyness was great, too, ""Once upon a time, in sunny California..."", followed by the pouring rain outside Groves' Toy Manufacturing store.) On a final note, ""Blue Moon"" hasn't sounded this sad before, expressing the unfulfilled rift between a lonely, careerist divorcée and a man who's genetic reunion may have greater value. Achieving so much in just 84 minutes makes it even more impressive.",4.0

"After cringing through two Sirk melodramas previously, I wasn't exactly thrilled to throw this on, especially how others comment on the similarities to the others. However, this one felt so much softer than the others, more about finding purpose than a simple intra-class love story.
The other family members are also a bit less over-the-top selfish here. The wife is cold and distant but more of a desensitized realist who unquestioningly accepts the world as it is. Vinnie is a little extra, but you can still see his motivations unlike the children in All That Heaven Allows.
The robot wind-up toy is the perfect metaphor for the time period, and yet the modern viewer likely feels the same way. The television set filling the void was the only really redeeming scene in ATHA, but this metaphor is even more poignant and far more timeless.",3.5

Loved this even though I didn’t like Fred MacMurray’s Cliff all that much. For a guy who is a toymaker, he seems like the most joyless person ever. Truly a robot. Dude needs to get his shit together. He’s so unhappy because no one is paying attention to him. Then someone he hasn’t thought about in 20 years shows up at his door and he’s ready to throw it all away. Even though he didn’t even care about her when he knew her all those years ago. And being with her ultimately won’t make him happy. One way for him to not feel so sad: Go to your daughter’s ballet recital! He comes home pissed that his daughter has a dance recital so he decides to just stay home and have dinner by himself. My man, watching your kids excel at something is one of the best feelings in the world. Some of my happiest memories are at my son’s baseball games or daughter’s soccer game.",4.5

My first Douglas Sirk film. A careful, compelling and subversive portrayal of a man’s growing disillusionment with suburban family life in 1950s America. Right from the get go the irony is apparent, with the humorous title card reading “Once upon a time, in sunny California” before cutting to a rainy LA. Powerful use of symbolism through framing, weather and objects to echo the feelings of entrapment. The photography has a noir feel to it. The performances are outstanding, Barbara Stanwyck in particular. Her speeches in the film’s final act to the children and Clifford are so nuanced and sensitively delivered.

"Applying All That Heaven Allows-type melodrama on a male lead makes for an interesting change of viewpoint, but Sirk's storytelling and direction remain superlative all the same, with wrenching performances from both Stanwyck and MacMurray. Main plot drivers being just the lead's two kids creates some unpredictable friction this time out, and turns pointed -- especially when placed alongside ATHA the same year -- when they wholly apply pressure only on Stanwyck. And Sirk refusing to budge on having the suffocation of traditional family life clear up, even by the end, provides some lingering sting to the last scene as well.",4.0

"First Sirk movie I've seen. Have seen a few MacMurray movies recently and my esteem for his acting keeps going up. He and Stanwyck have great chemistry. There's Always Tomorrow features complex roles for all three leads, MacMurray, Stanwyck and Bennett.
All three characters are just trying to live their best life and do the best they can. MacMurray is no cheating cad, but he longs for the life he and his wife had pre-children. Bennett as the wife feels fulfilled as a mother and doesn't quite hear her husband's pleas for time together. Stanwyck admires and envies the life and family MacMurray and Bennet have built and has no ""plans"" to break it up.
Well done by everyone. Great casting of Reynolds as MacMurray and Bennett's son whos tone of voice screams obnoxiousness.

Despite pulling away the technicolor gloss from Sirk's typically vibrant palette, this movie still manages to be beautifully designed. The costumes are so stunning, trading out vibrant primary colors for patterns.
My issue with this movie is that unlike Sirk's other movies, this really feels like it crumbles under the weight of the melodrama. There are some ridiculous plot threads here, such as a son and daughter investigating whether their dad is having an affair, but never really making any conclusions and popping up every once in a while to go ""see! Look what he's doing!""
The melodrama just becomes overbearing in all honesty. It's just too much.
Admittedly, the ending is pretty great, and I do like the idea of swapping out the typical plot of the unhappy domestic wife, for an unhappy domestic husband, ultimately in the end, the conclusion is pretty powerful in that there's no happy ending. There's no romantic gesture to sweep him away, but instead, just the realization that he'll have to resign himself to live the same way that he has been for years.",2.5

"This is actually a remake. In 1934 universal international pictures produced the same exact story with frank Morgan, vinnie barns and some Wilson lady. The story is based on the world famous Ursula parrot novel, jk, bout the famous part. Catherine Ursula toll had a lot of her books turned into movies, 9 actually. Her first novel, ex wife, became MGMs 1930 hit, the divorcee.
Fred and barb only made 4 movies together sadly, not cause she’s so great with Fred or anything, theres 10 other actors I’d rather see her with, just sadly cause barb should be in everything! This was Their last pairing, with double indemnity being the middle pair.
Universal international pictures by sirk. And since this is a 50s Doug sirk, it’s therefore a melodrama (unless it’s his fun comedy weekend with father, cute fun movie def worth watching). Lotta directors loved sirk, Todd Haynes I guess does, whoever that is, more importantly Rainer Werner fassbinder loved Doug, thanks Doug for influencing the best German director that ever lived/a man who is in the running for the GOAT. The trailer for this movie promised an impassioned drama. We’ll see.
Lordy Fred is so damn goofy.
I’m with ya Fred tho u don’t know it yet, I’m taking Barbie over 1956 Joan any day. Almost 15 in and He knows it now! She’s got a goofy ass 50s women’s hAt on, I love the hats designers had women wearing back in the day.
That show they were at seems awful, I’d wanna miss the rest too.
Pat crowley is beautiful.
Fred’s just goofy man. He’s literally talking to barb telling her he’s in love and he might as well be his double indemnity character there’s no difference.
Lol Fred’s character must be the slowest moving man on the face of the earth.. can he not run or even slowly jog ?
In the soft ending of the 1934 version where vinnie barns helps frank Morgan see what a nice family he has and how much they need him, Doug left it much more open ended. In the final scene where Fred and Joan are walking arm in arm, with the kids watching from the stairs. Doug sirk said he wanted the stair bannister bars to make it look like the kids were watching “imprisoned animals in a zoo”.
I think this is actually way up there with dougs best melodramas. I really like this one because it’s so restrained. It’s hardly soapy at all, the climax is the most soapy part, the rest is kinda just slowly meandering to it. And the ending is WAY better than the original. In this case it works out for the kids but we’re left not so sure about Fred and Joan, Fred’s gonna have to deal with his impure thoughts and idk I get the feeling Fred is such a weak lil bitch he’s not gonna be able to get over his desperate need to feel young and get his rocks off with another woman. That’s why the endings good, cause I get to decide, If dougs not gonna decide for me I’m more than happy to decide myself. I really think this is as good as any Doug sirk melodrama, the only thing it’s missing is his beautiful color work, Lordy can u imagine how good this woulda been if it was technicolor???? The toys and barbs clothes she designs (narratively)... ugh . Even tho melodramas aren’t my thing, they have to be when it’s Doug presenting em, 3.5 stars would be pretty generous in most circumstances but as far as knowing what this is and what it could have Been, 3.5 is actually low. 79/100 not to mention the length is perfect, there’s not a second wasted and it’s not a second too long, movies like this should be no more than 100 minutes, Doug did great at fitting this in 85 minutes, completely worth the time.

All those kids were assholes from the start, the wife was a materialistic shrew and the youngest daughter was such a crybaby I wish she broke her neck instead of spraining her ankle. The symbolism was so overt I had to laugh. Who takes a family portrait WITHOUT the father? Why are all the characters in cages or behind bars? I mean, I know why, but it’s EVERYWHERE. I must have bitched to myself for 40% of the running time at least. At least the son’s girlfriend was normal.
After meeting his terrible family, you’d have to be a villain yourself if you aren’t rooting for Fred MacMurray in this. His chemistry with Stanwyck was perfect. Both were hot, lustful people looking for a connection, even if they tried hard to ignore their true intentions it came through in their scenes together. You want them to be happy, but because this is Sirk you already know how it ends. Stanwyck’s speech directed at the naive, tiresome son who suspects the worst was a perfect takedown, and her reaction, while a bit overdone, still feels real in a movie where nothing else is. The bleak ending, just as overdone as the rest of the movie, tries really hard to point out that the family will never work as a loving unit. They’ll try to love their father, but that part of him is dead forever. He can only act the part now. And to make it more obvious, he’s a toymaker. Why didn’t they just call this, “A Doll’s House but a man & somehow sadder” instead?
Way too melodramatic even for me, but Sirk’s bravery in sticking to the unhappy ending makes this worthwhile. Well that, and how shitty his kids are. Veda Pierce got competition.",3.5
This absolutely wrecked me. Sirk was such a master and it was a fitting end to the Stanwyck/MacMurray onscreen pairing. Such an iconic partnership.,5.0
"Finally, a weepy for daddy!

"Marking Stanwyck and MacMurray’s fourth and final collaboration together as well as their best after Double Indemnity, There’s Always Tomorrow is precisely the melodramatic beauty that director Douglas Sirk excelled in. MacMurray stars as a toy manufacturer that becomes disillusioned with his neglectful wife and children when a former employee comes back into his life.
Complex, tragic and heart wrenching, There’s Always Tomorrow, set consistently to the backdrop of the achingly precise melody of “Blue Moon”, dazzles with Sirk’s stellar direction and the on-screen chemistry of its stars whose underrated partnership deserves far more appreciation for their work here alone.",4.5
Good Douglas Sirk melodrama with Fred MacMurray trapped in suburban hell while pining for an impossible life with Barbara Stanwyck.,3.0
"Nice little film with a less tidy ending than the 1934 original. I grew up on MY THREE SONS and have always been a Fred MacMurray fan. He teams up with Barbara Stanwyck for the first time since the classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Joan Bennett adds to the stellar cast. I remember reading an article on Errol Morris, the 'Godfather of Docs' and he had this film listed in his top ten favorite films.
I was amused how MacMurray's character Clifford kept referring about heading into Los Angeles. The Groves reside in Pasadena and in the 50s there had to of been at least a couple of miles of country between Pasadena and Los Angeles. The film's director Douglas Sirk wanted to shoot in color, but Universal Studios refused. He did get his Cinematographer though, Russell Metty, who would go on to win an Oscar for SPARTACUS, ironically in color-- 35mm Super Technirama 70 before being blown up to 70mm.
An enjoyable watch that did get a little soapy at times, but was saved by three true movie stars with acting chops all in their prime.",3.5

You get the sense that every choice near the end is about pragmatism instead of romance in a way that makes this melodrama feel so lived in and real. MacMurray and Stanwyck have the chemistry to make you mourn their lost love as well. Probably need to see it a second time to anoint it to top-tier Sirk (something felt a bit slight about it all, to me anyways) but it's a wonderful film.",3.5

"A movie that is perfectly of it’s post-war Pasadena setting. Fred MacMurray stars as a successful toy-maker and family man as he navigates a mid-life malaise, feeling unmoored in the midst of his busy family. By chance, he encounters a former co-worker (Barbara Stanwyck) with whom he innocently resumes a friendship. 
His meddling children misconstrue a few overseen moments, thus uncovering the film’s most compelling tension - between an imagined affair and the very real longing of this middle-aged would-be couple.
The plot pulls at this tension in just the right intervals, but it does snag along the way. The beleaguered Fred MacMurry character could certainly stand to participate more actively in the family life from which he feels estranged. And his prim wife is left devoid of any personality beyond maternal instinct. (There are at least a few plot points where the entire drama could have been diffused if she would have given him a blowie, maybe?) Their marriage does seem genuinely shallow, although the ending brushes this aside.
Barbara Stanwyck is the most interesting and complex character, not to mention the funnest. It’s easy to believe her as the one-that-got-away who breathes some life into the man in the grey flannel suit - even as she copes with her own sense of loss and regret. 
In conclusion, my deep love for Barbara Stanwyck abides.",3.0
"Douglas Sirk has a remarkable way of transforming the emotions on screen into the emotional response of the audience. When Cliff is frustrated, I'm frustrated, and it's really very powerful. This is perhaps the only film I have seen that sensitively deals with a man being dissatisfied with his familial relationships and marriage - usually that plot is reserved for women - and it is particuarly interesting as he rarely steps over the line of decency. Very proficiently done. However, not meaning to sound contradictory, this film is interesting and enjoyable, but nothing remarkable.",3.0

"Even without the luscious strings of Skinner or the exuberant colours of Sirk’s past films, There’s Always Tomorrow stands as one of his most expressive. It plays a little like an inversed Brief Encounter, both in plot and in tone. Where Lean’s film was imbued with a certain impossible innocence, Sirk’s is marked by its wants and desires, suspicions and mistruths. Walls constantly enclose, and a melancholy rain pelts the windows. One shot positions father parallel to son, one outside and the other in, a grim omen. Another, one of Sirk’s very best, has Stanwyck peer distantly from her apartment, out onto the rainy city. The drizzling water is projected on her tearless face through the windowpane, her stoicism betrayed. To the right of frame her reflection looks directly to camera, completely submerged. To compile all such markers of Sirk’s virtuosity would be a sizable, but ultimately redundant task. It’s in seeing, hearing, feeling them come together that his mastery truly lies.",4.0

Too often I've popped in a Sirk movie blindly and, uh, it's not a melodrama, but this is definitely the Ross Hunter-produced real thing. It doesn't really reach the hysterical heights of the Technicolor soaps, mainly because this is a man's story and men and boring. Masculine black-and-white suits it, I suppose. Fred's character doesn't seem any happier at the end of the flick, so one supposes he continues his emotional slide until he reaches SECONDS (1966) territory.

"An immaculate film - my favourite Douglas Sirk film thus far, of the 5 or so I've seen.",4.5
"I’m going to go ahead and become the worst person on this site by coining the term ‘Sirkie', which is a movie (directed by guess) that hits all the notes of middle-class despair and aching regret within ninety compact minutes and which leaves every character in almost exactly the same position they were in before the movie began, but with their understanding of their situation re-lensed just enough so that both their anguish and their appreciation for the possible lives that they will not live is felt on a far deeper level. The camera angles are high, the emotion is deeply felt, the beats feel earned. Scenes glide by, covering a passionate base with an exterior of pleasing blandness, and no single sequence stretches beyond three or four minutes. An uncharitable viewer might say that it flirts with feeling routine, as if there were a rough structure with a sign attached reading “Insert Quietly Shattering Pathos Here”. But that would ignore the genuine emotion of Bernard C. Schoenfield’s screenplay (taken from Ursula Parrott’s novel, which was previously adapted for the screen in 1934), and of course, Sirk’s tonal precision. The movie, unlike his more esteemed classics, is shot in black and white, and while he still ensures a pretty mise-en-scene and the proper violin flourishes from Heinz Roemheld and Herman Stein, it’s definitely less flamboyant than usual (though the vaguely plotted Latino dance show that Norma and Cliff attend upon first reuniting brings a bit of unvarnished verve).
So while there’s a sense of déja vu in the pas de deux, the movie isn’t phoned in - - reined in, perhaps. But that doesn’t seem right either - so many of Sirk’s great movies are about how comfortable people rein in their emotions so as to avoid being socially castigated, and who as a result resign themselves to lives of pleasant conformity. Perhaps the proper term is closed in. The movie, as I’ve said already, moves with impressive efficiency (Norma and Cliff keep running into each other and instantly deciding to spend the day together, their reflexive social politeness practically greasing the wheels of their quasi-affair). It only has a few scenes of outright emotional anguish - - and most of them are actually from Cliff, who is here the prototypical Jane Wyman figure, quietly rebelling against and ultimately bound by the expectations of family (children, especially) and a vague, mechanical sense of duty (a metaphor about a “walking, talking” robot that he’s working on at his toy factory is appropriately overemphasized). The low-level despair of MacMurray’s Cliff and Stanwyck’s Norma still feels absolutely right, even when over-articulated by the script. The children are brats, of course - - and in this one they’re quite intrusive brats, with the eldest, Vinnie (William Reynolds, hawt), suspecting his father of an affair that his father can only at this point faintly imagine for himself. Indeed, so determined is Vinnie and, to a lesser extent, Ellen (Gigi Perreau), that they confront Stanwyck’s Norma in her hotel room, at which point she comes tantalizingly close to transforming into an avenging angel, threatening to take Cliff away from his ungrateful, inattentive children and into her life of childless, professional New York living.
It’s an especially thrilling moment from Stanwyck who previous to this scene has shown Norma at her most passionately enraged when wrongfully accused by Cliff of having lied about an appointment. For much of the movie she moves cautiously, occasionally allowing Cliff to see her vulnerability while maintaining that urbane mask of intelligence and warmth that always makes her supremely watchable. She’s so charismatic and confident that you hope Schoenfield doesn’t believe Cliff’s wife Marion’s (Joan Bennett)’s assertion that Norma is lonely, and that she probably wishes she could live a life of suburban motherhood. The number of times Norma herself expresses some kind of stylishly masked regret about having built a life away from family might suggest that he does believe it, but I think it’s more to do with the basic social conflict that roots a lot of Sirkian stuff - the choice between adhering to the status quo or distancing yourself from it is, in this world, a decisive one.
On another note, Schoenfield’s script is filled with dialogue that either reflects a very specific era of 1950’s youth-talk, or is just terrible at imagining how teenagers converse. “Isn’t that just ATOMIC?” the glued-to-her-rotary Ellen screams at her friend over the line at one point as they trade gossip. Also some amazing pseudo-Freudian babble between husband and wife: ""You’re stiff as a board!” “I’m not stiff at all!” “Well you’ll be stiff in the morning. Let’s run you a hot bath.” “But I don’t want a hot bath!” etc., as the children look on with doubt and judgement.",0.0

Obscure Film #5 (LB Users: 116)
I still feel covered with a slight ooze of sap after the last Douglas Sirk melodrama that I viewed, Magnificent Obsession. Fortunately, There’s Always Tomorrow still hits the melodramatic notes without dripping with excessive sappiness. It also helps when you have the same two leads from Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I was glad to see that Sirk did not overplay the sentimentality between Stanwyck and MacMurray, but also brought into play the dynamics of the other family members that are the catalyst for the story line.
MacMurray plays Clifford Groves, a toy manufacturer who feels taken for granted by his wife and kids. They’re busy with their various outside interests with no quality time with dear old Dad. He’s only there to generate a paycheck that allows them to pursue their activities. Sparks fly when former employee Norma Vale (Stanwyck) comes into town for business. After becoming reacquainted, Cliff finds that Norma sparks a zest for life that he wished that he had with his own family.
While out-of-town on business, Cliff runs into Norma again after his prospective client backs out of their scheduled meeting. Both of them make use of this opportunity to catch up and rediscover one another. Cliff’s son Vincent, arrives with friends at the same resort where the couple are staying and notices the two of them enjoying one another’s company. He automatically suspects infidelity, but does not confront his father. Vincent’s girlfriend, Ann, is not convinced that his father is being unfaithful, but he is able to persuade his sister Ellen of his suspicious.
When Norma is invited over to dinner, Vincent and Ellen give Norma the cold shoulder, but Ann is the only one who knows the true reason behind their rude behavior. The one character who drove me absolutely nuts is Cliff’s wife, Marion (Joan Bennett), who was easily dismissive of her husband’s cries for intimacy, yet she is also the character I felt the most sorry for since she resigned herself to her life of benign domesticity.
I dreaded the anticipation that led to the climatic confrontation in Norma ‘s hotel room between her and the two older children, Vincent and Ellen. In grand Barbara Stanwyck style, she put the children in their place, pointing out to them how unhappy their father was and how they contributed to his current state. I’m not going to give away how the story ended, but I will say that I’m a little ambivalent about it. Was it the right way to end for Norma and Cliff? For the family?",3.5

"For my interpretation of this, im going to say that i believe Cliff was going through a mid-life crisis already but he is also feeling extremely neglected by his family.
Cliff is stuck in the sameness of everyday, domestic life with a family but instead of a motorcycle and a younger model, he actually wants to make a change with his family included. Only, his family is obviously preoccupied with themselves and their daily lives. His asshole kids suddenly decide that they need to get involved when they discover Cliff's reacquaintance with an old employee. You can see that the re-emerged person from his past excites Cliff and takes him away from the mundane everyday and he is happier for it. Theres nothing even remotely risque about the way he interacts with Norma and he even keeps a steady flow in mentioning his wife and children. His children however, just believe Norma is a homewrecker and suddenly Cliff is the enemy.
What i like is that Sirk doesnt just thrust anyone into the enemy position and he doesnt make the picture just about infidelity. Theres such a good set-up in Cliff being a hardworking family man that is not intentionally neglected by his wife and family; but he presents a situation where we also know that there are feelings of isolation involved. Nothing is done out of revenge or resentment and so it makes for a more pleasant situation when turning to a difficult topic like this.

The focus on Vinny and Ann was unexpected and an interesting secondary angle to the Norma and Cliff’s relationship. Rarely is a story between adults shown through the eyes of teenagers in Old Hollywood. Barbara Stanwyck carries this movie, as she does nearly everything she’s in.

"The fourth and final film to pair Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray—I had no idea these two made all these films together! MacMurray plays a fairly happy married toy manufacturer who is starting to grow disillusioned with his neglectful wife and self-centered children when, all of a sudden, Stanwyck, a former employee (and former potential flame), comes back into his life. Directed by the master of melodrama, Douglas Sirk, There's Always Tomorrow comes somewhat later in his career but feels rooted in his film noir days, the cinematography by the great Russell Metty (Ride the Pink Horse, Touch of Evil, The Misfits) certainly helps. Sirk is the perfect director to capture the chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray. They feel far more destined for each other than in Remember the Night and more legitimately hot for each other than in Double Indemnity. What could be saccharine schmaltz rises to the level of Brief Encounter in terms of a domestic drama in which ""the right thing"" must be done and passions tamped down, but not without a scathing speech from Stanwyck about how unfair it all is. It's fascinating (and great!) how shitty the kids are depicted in this movie. The very concept of ""the teenager"" was only about seven years old when this picture was made, and we're already getting films that explore what a drag the extension of adolescence is on a marriage!

"""Whad'ya know, Long pants at last.""
Without a doubt a deeply ""Sirk""-ian film, and in all honesty - probably my favorite of his pictures seen to date.
Middle-age is one hell of a chapter if you have been blessed to get there. Some dreams have been fulfilled, others have not. This film gives a small insight into one dream lived, another longed for from two adult perspectives. What I really appreciate about this film is that it tells a story ultimately centered on a man longing for connection, shared love and emotional purpose. One thing I have observed over and over again over the decades is men long for connection just as much if not more so than women. Many men long to be genuinely heard, loved and understood. I have seen the look of deflation when that longing goes unfulfilled. I have seen the look when they feel that have genuinely shared a moment with another and the gratitude and subsequent soul flowering from it. We are living in a very strange time where we have many supposedly advocating for equality, but what has really bubbled to the fore is a lot of bias, bigotry and misandry towards men. Watching this film reinforced why I genuinely value and appreciate my social and platonic relationships with the men in my life. They are a gift to the world that are taken very much for granted by many who project their own neurosis on them. Just like many of us find the children and circumstances in the better known ""All That Heaven Allows"" maddeningly infuriating, it is easy to be irritated by the children and wife here, too. Barbara Stanwyck's scolding is pitch-perfect. And as the gatekeepers of the time would never allow a family to be fractured, we see the two emotionally bonded part ways. However, in our heart of hearts we all know a great love is gone. Love comes in many guises, it is not always sexual. But the ones that linger the deepest are the ones from the heart. Some in our modern times call that ""emotional cheating"". How dare you connect with someone other than me, so many demand. I personally view connection as exactly that - connection. It's the choices that follow that reveal ones true character and whether it is steeped in loyalty or disloyalty, not the mere connection between two souls. Honestly, I want to give this 5 stars but I'll give 4.5 but you know what, let's go 5 anyway because it's my review and I can. 5 stars.

Stanwyck enters the picture almost as a ghost of the past, completely out of the blue, and ends it in tears, flying away from her idealized lover. Her performance is a wonderful mixture of her own sensibility and that of a Sirkian wistfulness.

"- love this pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray, and not just because it’s a rare story about an age-appropriate middle aged couple from classic Hollywood. They’re both victims of lifeless domesticity, or the expectation of it. The conflict within Cliff is uneasy and you empathize with him even as he has this emotional affair.

At the center of that brilliance is Barbara Stanwyck's character, whose role as the potential ""other woman"" cracks the ideological premises of infidelity, spousal neglect, the male midlife crisis, and familial/romantic love. The best scene is when Clifford Groves's (Fred MacMurray) children, thinking they have the moral high ground, confront her in the hotel room. She turns the tables on them by complicating their dogmatic moral positions, with this incredible bit of dialogue: ""[Romantic] love is a very reckless thing. Maybe it isn't even a good thing. When you're young and in love, nothing matters except your own satisfaction. The tragic thing about growing older is that you can't be quite as reckless anymore . . . I guess that's the hardest job to learn in the whole world . . . how to give love and expect nothing in return.""",5.0

"Over a decade since their iconic pairing in Billy Wilder’s classic noir Double Indemnity, with a few collabs in between, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck star opposite each other in this lovers reacquainted melodrama from Douglas Sirk. MacMurray makes a vulnerable turn as a toy maker who feels used and under appreciated by both his wife and children thus seeking happiness elsewhere, which comes in the form of an old lover played by Stanwyck. It leads to a messy sequence of events once his kids start to suspect something is adrift. The first of Sirk’s black and white films I’ve seen, it visually has a noir like quality to it that underpins the longing, desires and disappointments that spiral out of this domestic melodrama. Not quite top tier Sirk for me, but just as emotionally engaging and socially dissecting of 50s American middle class life as his two masterworks I’ve seen, All That Heaven Allows and Written On the Wind.
Ps Considering they were both working at their creative peaks around the same time, I wonder if anyone has compared and contrasted both Sirk and Yasujiro Ozu takes on making films about family and class dynamics, the former in the US and the latter in Japan. One overtly emotional, the other incredibly observed and understated.",4.0

"I've now watched all 4 pairings of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, and this is by far the most frustrating. Their chemistry sizzles as usual, but they're stuck in the 1950's, where Fred can make all the speeches he wants about being an automaton, stuck in a rut, but the end of the movie must find him still content with that rut, and Barbara crying on a plane, flying back to her lonely career woman life.
Douglas Sirk tells the story, but his cinematography undercuts the moral, so that you suspect Sirk is also rooting for a sequel in which Fred gets on his own plane to New York and upends his stolid existence.",3.5
Douglas Sirk réussit encore une fois à mettre la famille au cœur du récit par le personnage de Clifford esseulé et peu aimé en tant que père de famille.

"Mari d’une épouse dévouée, père de trois enfants prometteurs, Cliff est aussi le patron d’une florissante fabrique de jouets. À première vue, c’est un homme comblé. Il suffira qu’une revenante, Norma, franchisse le seuil de son foyer, pour que lui explose à la figure tout ce qu’il a bâti : l’égoïsme de sa progéniture et la dissolution de son couple dans sa vie de famille. La monotonie de son existence mécanique lui devient alors insupportable…
D’emblée Douglas Sirk affiche son ironie : au carton d’ouverture, « Il était une fois sous le soleil de Californie », succède un plan extérieur truffé de parapluies. Ironique, le titre l’est aussi. Loin d’être un film optimiste sur les nouveaux départs, Demain est un autre jour livre une vision acérée et relativement désespérée sur notre tendance à l’auto-aliénation. Une absence de clairvoyance, des mauvais choix, une certaine paresse existentielle et le tour est joué !
Il y a dans cette charge contre la famille une modernité et une radicalité étonnantes. C’est avec un plaisir sadique que Sirk règle son compte aux enfants de Cliff (surtout au fils), ces vampires de l’amour moralisateurs et sentencieux. Surtout, le cinéaste donne le beau rôle aux personnages féminins, qu’il s’agisse de la petite amie du fils, de l’épouse maligne sous ses airs inoffensifs, et bien sûr, de Norma. Terriblement seule mais indépendante et lucide, généreuse et amoureuse. Sacrificielle certes, mais à la fin, c’est bien elle et sa hauteur de vue que l’on envie, non pas « le beau couple » que Cliff et sa femme forment aux yeux de leur petite dernière.",4.0
"Until There’s Not: Douglas Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow, by Chris Forrester
In the midst of the exceptional run of films Douglas Sirk directed in the 1950s, and nestled directly between two of his most celebrated technical masterworks, All That Heaven Allows (1955) and Written on the Wind (1956), is a film much smaller but no less powerful than the beautifully crafted melodramas he became known for — There’s Always Tomorrow (1956), a quietly devastating portrait of the prison of domesticity. As is typical of Sirk, There’s Always Tomorrow blends heart-rending familial melodrama with incisive social critique, here a searing look at the American nuclear family unit and its stripping away of its constituents’ agency and individualistic desires.
In the film, Fred MacMurray plays opposite Barbara Stanwyck (a reunion of the iconic pair 12 years after their unforgettable joint turn in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity) as Clifford Groves, a Pasadena toymaker and family man reunited with a former colleague, Norma Miller, whom he has not seen in 20 years. Fortuitously, or perhaps not, the pair’s meeting comes in the midst of a dismaying night for Groves — he’s procured tickets to take his wife to the theater for her birthday, but the obligation of family has called her away (she must take their daughter to a dance recital) and he finds himself alone. The introduction of Miller, who soon explains that she’s a divorced dress designer in town to speak at a conference in the nearby Palm Valley, is both romantic and threatening, at once an almost fantasy-like escape for Groves from the downtrodden nature of his family life and an intrusion into its sanctity.

"Grand film sur la monotonie de la vie de famille, sur une passion impossible, avec une critique de la société américaine. Comme d’habitude, le tout s’accompagne des terribles déchirements internes grâce à Barbara Stanwyck qui joue merveilleusement bien, qui révèle la complexité de nos vies, dans lesquelles on ne choisit pas toujours entre le bien et le mal, mais parfois entre le bien et le bien. Rien n’est manichéen, personne n’est mauvais, ni la mère aveuglée et absente pour son mari, ni le père abandonné qui tente de s’émanciper, ni Norma Miller amoureuse sacrifiée. Une happy end assez terrible qui donne raison aux gens qui veulent tuer toute leur famille a cause de la platitude de la vie de famille.",3.5

"What I love so much about Sirk’s films is how much respect is given to the portrayal of the female characters. Even in a case of mistaken infidelity, the wife is portrayed as a responsible mother and never as a nag, and the other woman is someone who has ambitions and feelings of her own that the narrative doesn’t demonize her for. The exception being for any of the teenage/young adult female characters who are being brought up in the stuck-up culture of the early 1950s, but here the judgments of these younger girls is more of a reflection of how much society has forced these expectations of rigid civility.
Something I’m mad about in this film is the addition of Pat Crowley’s character, the girlfriend of MacMurray’s asshole son. I think the addition of a young person who’s very understanding and sympathetic to Stanwyck’s other woman character is an excellent narrative decision to demonstrate that the type of judgmental behavior that young adults in Sirk’s films exhibit is something that is done deliberately, and though a lot of Sirk’s films have that “fuck them kids” energy it’s still realistic for some of them to question/defy societal expectations and sympathize with women who are at risk of ostracism for expressing their individuality. 
Also love that Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray did 3 films together and all of them are absolute bangers! Their chemistry is off the charts whether they’re unwittingly falling in love with each other or committing murder, and I really like that their dynamic was able to remain mostly organic without their studio(s) overblowing any publicity on them.",4.5
"Seeing the early part and later part of a multiple decade career side-by-side is particularly illuminating of someone’s talents to adapt, shift, and keep what works. Stanwyck’s best years were behind her at this point but she still turns in a thoroughly emotional and wizened performance, as expected from a master and a true star in the cinema firmament.",4.5

Tout le film est passé un peu comme une souffrance pour moi, dans le sens où d'une part je comprends ce personnage qui pense être là pour sa famille (et qui au sens des années 50 est vraiment là pour sa famille), mais qui n'est pas rassasié par la vie de famille et souhaite vivre quelque chose de plus, quelque chose en commun avec sa femme. Mais d'autre part, j'ai été dérangé par le choix qu'il fait pour vivre cette expérience, qui au final est le même que celui que des millions d'hommes ont fait : l'adultère. L'excuse qui lui est donnée ? La routine d'une vie de famille est une prison. Je rageais tranquillement devant ma télé en subissant cette morale quand subitement, au dernier plan, la morale m'a semblée être inversée.
Et si tout le film était tendu vers l'idée qu'effectivement, le mariage est une prison ?
Deux scènes m'ont guidé sur ce chemin : d'abord celle du balcon après le dîner où Cliff s'apprête à rappeler Norma et où Marion n'écoute absolument pas ses revendications, aussi puériles soient-elles, et bien sûr la dernière scène et cet échange quand Clif dit à Marion ""you know me better than I know myself"". Les enfants, qui tout au long du film ont été les moralistes, qui les regardent et Ellen qui dit à son frère et sa sœur ""they make a wonderful couple"". Quand on sait que Cliff a le cœur brisé de voir Norma s'éloigner... J'ai repensé au film entier, à l'apparition de Barbara Stanwyck en pure Deus Ex Machina, son irruption magique dans la vie huilée de Cliff et les cicatrices qu'elle y laisse à jamais...
Dans le monde très policé de Sirk, qui s'est employé à montrer et dénoncer toute sa carrière l'enfermement des femmes dans les années 50, je ne peux pas croire que ces deux échanges soient innocents.
Pour moi, il renverse la table, passe de l'autre côté du miroir et montre comment certaines femmes embrassent pleinement ce mode de vie et comment elles maintiennent le status quo, quitte à y sacrifier le bonheur de leur compagnon.

"""Time stood still...""
""I feel sorry for her.""
""Don't take my father from me!""
There is something in the way dialogue is smoothly indiscreet here, that makes impossible for the public not to be engaged with all the characters.
I do not know why this was not shot in colour, can only take a guess, but unlike ""All that Heaven Allows"" for example there is no room for a foray into romantic wilderness. We get a systematic visual idea, that gets repeated over and over, parallel lines everywhere...the stairs, the candles at dinner, the two pillars at the doorway hall where a weary MacMurray thinks, even Stanwyck's door number 618 (man 1 woman) seems to confirm the impossibility.
The scenes' punctuations may seem a bit too much: the musical cue with MacMurray at the window while the camera is next to the toy robot, the two leads resting after swimming, or the rain in the window reflected in Stanwyck's face. All needed for perhaps ""love is a reckless thing"".
What amazes in such a small film (barely 80 minutes) is how much time we spend with the children, guessing if they are right or wrong on what will come next. Are we old, are we young? Makes one think on what is the nature of age.
There is always tomorrow, no time for yesterday alas! When we lose someone to time, to a job opportunity, to another place, the moment is lost. Stanwyck's character row with the children points how the present is always undeserving, see how the pillar between them vanishes throughout the scene, add to this the constant mirrors on the wall, on the table (when MacMurray gets the photo)...Sirk sees life as an hyperbola, not like a circle.

"Toy designer Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray) is firmly encased in a middle-aged rut, the confines of which he doesn’t fully realize until the surprise return of an old co-worker friend, Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), sparks memories of his youth… and more?
Nicely crafted melodrama, but unusually focused on a man. The buildup is nice... at the beginning, we see Groves enduring the small disappointments of life, his wife (Joan Bennett) and children too busy for him. He doesn't really realize how sad he is, until Vale's appearance. Gradually, what starts as just catching up with an old friend becomes more, as his unhappy family life pushes him further. And Vale is dealing with her own unhappiness (poignantly understated in a simple scene with a photo). ""Blue Moon"" is a frequently used song, and it is very effective at setting the mood.
The ending is emotionally devastating, for both Groves and Vale (without fail, Stanwyck always rips my heart out in these tear-jerkers). I've read that Sirk originally wanted an ending with a little more finality to it, but the ending here, though conventional on the surface, is also (to my interpretation) ambiguous enough to be quite crushing in its open-endedness.

Ursula Parrott Double Feature
In 35mm
Followed by THE DIVORCEE (1930)
Feeling neglected by his wife and stifled by his crowded house with five grown children, businessman Joseph White (Frank Morgan) reconnects with a former secretary, Alice Vail (Binnie Barnes), who has moved to Europe and become a successful businesswoman. Reunited by chance, the smitten Joseph is now tempted to pursue an affair with Alice. Less well-known than Douglas Sirk's 1956 adaptation of the same Ursula Parrott novel, starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, this 1934 gem features beautiful and moving performances from leads Morgan and Barnes, as well as Lois Wilson (MISS LULU BETT) as Joseph's wife Sophie. Look for a young, pre-stardom Robert Taylor (who was married to Stanwyck from 1939 to 1952) as the eldest and most petulant of the White children.

Ursula Parrott (1899–1957) was a prolific author, Hollywood screenwriter and headline-grabber during her colorful, unconventional life, which also included piloting for the Civilian Air Corps during World War II, co-founding a weekly rural Connecticut newspaper, four marriages and a fortune won and lost. During her lifetime, Parrott saw nine of her novels and stories — famous for their frank attitude toward sex, marriage and divorce and attentive to women's working lives in Depression-era New York City — adapted into Hollywood films, with a 10th following her death in 1957.
This year, McNally Editions will republish the most celebrated of Parrott's 20 bestsellers, the 1929 novel ""Ex-Wife,"" the basis for the 1930 film THE DIVORCEE, for which Norma Shearer won the Oscar® for Best Actress.
Marsha Gordon's critical biography ""Becoming the Ex-Wife: The Unconventional Life and Forgotten Writings of Ursula Parrott"" will be released this month by the University of California Press. Copies of her book will be available on site for sale and signing.",0.0

My friend calls it “the perfect 90 minutes.”  I call it my favorite pairing of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.  (And Double Indemnity is one of my favorite films).  Sirk’s mise en scene is exquisite here. And the awful children rival All That Heaven Allows,4.5
"This movie feels like the male counterpart to Lean’s “Brief Encounter”. Sirk delves into the husband’s psyche. The husband, who is a good man, boss , and father, wants to rekindle the passion he initially had with his wife. But the wife is busy being a good mother and caring wife. It reminds me of “Before Sunset”, when Jesse appears to feel the same way, and Celine brings him back to reality by saying his wife must look after the little one, and if that initial passion was sustained, we’d all have heart attacks!
Sirk presents a husband who, I think is going through something very common. Like the “seven year itch”. The process of falling in love is like two atoms smashing together; an awesome amount of energy is released, it’s fun, it’s exciting. But things begin to stabilize; life stabilizes, too. The wife in Sirk’s film knows what her husband is thinking before he thinks it. We trade that exciting flash of energy for a comfortable, slow burning predictability.
This film is about the husband’s yearning for that white hot atomic collision. But fortunately, for his sake, Stanwyck is there to see the larger picture - to be to him what Celine was to Jesse.",4.0
"Douglas Sirk cambia su habitual registro de melodramas sobre amas de casa en entornos de clase media, tornando su mirada hacia el marido, en este caso un fabricante de juguetes desdeñado por su mujer e hijos, que encuentra en un viejo amor el aprecio que tanto busca.
Precisamente, es en el simbolismo del robot que la compañía del protagonista ha construido, donde está la clave temática de la historia, con un hombre cuya existencia se encuentra vacía, marcada por la…",3.5
"Sirk’s greatness is readily evident most especially in his mise en scene and this film is no exception with the depth of field and angle choices he uses at the start with the various toys manufactured by MacMurray’s company; really strong stuff
Certainly an explosive reunion given the events that transpired between these two 11 years earlier
At 4 minutes with Reynolds foreground left and MacMurray background right as the latter walks into the house; Reynolds kind of a dick to his father
MacMurray is really good here masking his depression in front of the family with his overtures to them to hang out this fine night; and Stanwyck always proved herself to be the master of gesture and expression with the moment she comes onto the screen being perhaps the firmest demonstration of that
At 14 minutes the dark silhouettes of MacMurray and Stanwyck coming up to the door of his office is a great visual
The toys are even funnier to me because they make me think of that one toy Monica Vitti’s son had in Red Desert that Antonioni made a big show of
I think the problem with Sirk’s BW films is that his direction overall is just much more static and uninvolved than his color films; the style of expressing emotion (the catching up scenes with Stanwyck and MacMurray and every scene with the children debating over their father especially) and character motivations identify this very clearly as a Sirk film but still when you compare this to something like Imitation or Life or Written on the Wind he made in the same year… not quite as good
At times he really allows himself to let loose with his frame composition… no, that one at 39 minutes with Stanwyck behind the hatched door didn’t last
Again, the trouble with the adult or near-adult children narrative from All That Heaven Allows; solid, very good even but not quite on that level here
At 52 minutes the high angle of MacMurray and Bennett in bed with the ceiling lamp in the foreground is a fine frame; I just wish Sirk would hold frames he has like this for longer
At 73 minutes after the spectacular confrontation scene with Stanwyck and Reynolds in her apartment we get that visual of the rain running down the window projected on Stanwyck’s face… makes me think of a scene with a waterfall in Fantastic Mr. Fox
At 74 minutes just a brief moment with MacMurray’s toy robot foreground left as he and Stanwyck are background right still by a rain-soaked window; the robot could be better as a metaphor for MacMurray himself if it weren’t for the fact that Sirk directly tells us this through exposition
Stanwyck really the only sympathetic character here probably besides Crowley
The “They make a handsome couple, don’t they?” line is a strong one to end on
Recommend; I think it’s stronger than The Tarnished Angels",3.5

It’s a mature adult script perhaps to a fault, could have used a little more juice to keep it jumping, but that not the story he wanted to tell.",3.5
"i appreciated this more the second time, though i think the plot’s overreliance on nakedly contrived dramatic developments ultimately keeps it at more of a distance from me. what really struck me this time, in addition to its obvious pained tragedy of the decent patriarch or the understated tragedy of the career woman, is the articulation of the toxic desires of children. all that heaven allows draws this out in more heightened tones but here, the main conflict stems from…",4.0

There's Always Tomorrow is another nice slice of classic Douglas Sirk - from the instant irony of a rainy day after the opening title 'Once upon a time, in sunny California...' I was hooked from beginning to end, and there are many other ironies that constantly weave through the film's narrative. Once again Sirk proves himself to be an absolute master of melodrama, with its timeless messages and representations of women that barely come off as dated. The plot itself often falls into slight contrivances even if they're soon shifted in more satisfying directions, and there were one or two brief moments that I couldn't help but laugh at, but to me that's part of the fun of melodramas. I enjoyed its classical cinematography, played straight performances and classy dialogue which has plenty of secrets to hide. The emotional moments are mostly successful and I could definitely picture people weeping at this back in the '50s, and there's quite a bit to unpack which I admire greatly about Sirk - There's Always Tomorrow is both heartwarmingly enjoyable and depressingly honest, as any good melodrama should be.

"Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray star in this film made 12 years after their iconic roles in Double Indemnity. This one is a melodrama, not a noir, and their characters are quite different than in the earlier film. Both seem significantly older; Stanwyck has grey in her hair (maybe a coloring choice for this role) and MacMurray looks like a guy who drinks too much at the golf club, comes home and is in bed by 9:30.
MacMurray is a middle aged, suburban dad, married to Joan Bennett. They have three kids. He is getting frustrated at how the children dominate his marriage and he never gets any time alone with his wife. One day, out of the blue, a former employee of his, played by Barbara Stanwyck, comes for a visit. She's a fashion designer who is in town on business, and decided to look him up. It is clear to the audience, but not to MacMurray (at least at first) that she always had a crush on him, and that her visit is meant in part to see what kind of life she might have had if only things had worked out differently. Because his wife is constantly finding reasons not to be with him, MacMurray starts spending time with Stanwyck and starts to realize how empty his life has been.
The film is directed by Douglas Sirk. Although it has some classic Sirk reflective surfaces, and some great costumes, at times it lacks the high polish (and color cinematography) of his later work in the 50s.
Mild spoilers:
I think this had real potential. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck are excellent. You can feel MacMurray's desperation pouring out of his sad eyes. Stanwyck has some great moments, particularly in the later scenes. Unfortunately, there is a too much time spent with an college-aged son (played by William Reynolds) who finds out about his father and leaps to some unjustified (at least at that point) conclusions and spends the movie being angry and obnoxious.",3.5
"Interesting artifact from the 1950s. Not my favorite of these Douglas Sirk melodramas. Like all of them it's critical of 1950s American culture and how it's very oppressive and stultifying, but this time it's shown through the father of a family what we would recognize today as a very cliché mid life crisis wherein he is feeling like his family doesn't care about him and resenting them because he doesn't get to do anything exciting ever. Today we would say this guy is being selfish, but I guess in 1956 that narrative was not as common, so the movie has kind of a different take on it which is ""he's not totally wrong, and you see where he's coming from, but it's still probably best not to have an affair with Barbara Stanwyck if you've been married 20 years and have three kids.""",3.5

There's Always Tomorrow was directed Douglas Sirk and stars Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. They both put in some good work, as does the rest of the cast. The story is pretty good and the film is only 84 minutes, so it's a pretty easy viewing. I liked it.

"Sirk is the master of encouraging a deeper understanding of the people we supposedly know well. Never encountered a filmmaker who makes me think this much about my family/home life. The film often feels like an extensive search for the cathartic understanding glimpsed at the end of Brief Encounter, with an evolving, discordant family dynamic presenting a constant obstacle to that desire. This can be seen in Sirk's wonderfully astute (and infuriating) rendering of teenage arrogance and the almost malicious attitudes that Bennett takes on with her trademark sublimating.

I don't buy the reading of this where Fred MacMurray's character as deeply sympathetic, but no one here is faultless either, they're all human... Barbara Standwyck's Norma telling off his kids also seems totally out of line, blaming children for the state of their parents marriage is pretty funny from today's perspective but is also an interesting window into a different way of seeing the family unit.
Beautiful black and white photography, wonderful performances by all the adult actors, especially Joan Bennett's supporting role is wonderfully nuanced. There's so much depth to be mined here in the simple realism of the story — it is full of details but not fussed over. Just opening on ""once upon a time in sunny california"" curtain up on heavy rainfall, delightful and immediately tells you there's literally trouble in paradise. Rex the Robot marches on...",0.0
"Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray reunited and again find themselves in a doomed entanglement. Whereas Double Indemnity saw McMurray too stupid to see past the tip of his own erection but confident in what he wants, There’s Always Tomorrow is a portrait of uncertainty. His yearning for Stanwyck is vague and is as much a desire for her as the chance at a different life. I think you can read this is a conservative premise (put-up on suit-and-tie who’s overlooked by the people around him) meeting a radical solution (break up the family unit) before it confronts the impossibility of that option. At the same time, Sirk is just too smart to fit neatly into those ideological boxes.
Michael Mann has these great endings where you have to wonder what the characters are gonna do after they survived a bank robbery or terrors of Vincent Collateral.

"2023 Watchlist Challenge: January on the Criterion Channel
Once upon a time in sunny California . . .
Douglas Sirk is a master in a lot of ways, but perhaps he's best at telling stories about people caught in a kind of prison, a tightly-bound suburban hell that stops you in your tracks from grabbing on to a life so desperately desired. The tension he weaves is sumptuous; the stakes are so high but everyone involved keeps a straight face despite screaming inside.
The reunion here of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck adds another layer to this little story. By conjuring memories of Double Indemnity Sirk manages to slip in an air of danger, maybe not in the murderous sense a la Wilder, but a very real feeling that someone is going to have their heart broken and badly. The magic of this is that it could be any single one of the principal characters: the husband, the wife, the other woman, and the children are all level players in this scheme of the heart, and the ball could drop at any second for any of them. He's a master storyteller, and truly one of my favorite directors. I was already on a path that would lead through some DVR recordings straight into his remake of Imitation of Life, but the Criterion Channel is spotlighting this and three other rarely screened films from his catalog next month, so I'll be diving headfirst into them all then.
Excited to start this year's watchlist challenge with a bang! At present I have well over 400 films marked on my watchlist since I started using Letterboxd. A lot of them I don't remember marking, or why they're there at all, so I thought it'd be fun to grab one off TCM and the Criterion Channel—my main sources for new-to-me films—as they show up each month. A little surprise, blast-from-the-past to introduce me to new stuff. Off to a really good start!",4.5

"If you are reading this review and you are not familiar with Douglas Sirk, I would suggest you drop everything and watch Written on the Wind and Imitation of Life. Two of my favorite movies of all time.
I am admittedly a major Sirk stan but there are movies of his I have never liked all that much. In fact I think All That Heaven Allows is pretty overrated. This is a super lean and straightforward melodrama that has all the best hallmarks of one of the Great Masters. The story is told with such ease and confidence that I was immediately engrossed. It has this element of post war male neuroticism that was really striking. The fact that the movie ends up being a major showcase for Stanwyck was an unexpected bonus. Her monologues are so incredibly well done. She's really one of the best to ever do it. Also appreciated the general idea of female wisdom in contrast to male insecurity. But not in a uniform way so it doesn't feel like a stacked deck. Really well drawn characters generally speaking.
I mean you look at the blocking and the shot selection and you wonder if anyone will ever be as good at this as DS. Guy was just on another level.
There's a shot of a toy robot in this movie that's like one of the funniest things of all time in that kind of Sirkian-but-it-also-works-on-a-dramatic-level way that rivals Dorothy Malone and the oil derrick in Written on the Wind. Other Sirkheads know what I mean.",4.5

"No one understood family dynamics quite like Douglas Sirk.
He just nails every single aspect of it and in such a modern and fresh way, he really was just a complete master.
This is such an important and essential film about a subject that is so rare in films - the father that is unappreciated by his whole family but yet tries so much, and the urge to get free and happy at the same time as keeping and sustaining a family.
And yet this film is so much more than that: everyone gets its share of importance: the ex colleague, the son, the daughters, the wife...everyone participates and every string feels genuine and nailed on, and all of this in less than 90 minutes. It’s just mind blowing to me how this work is so rich in such a short amount of time.
I missed watching Sirk’s movies so much, his films just move me and connect with me in a way that no other director does honestly.",4.5
"um melodrama muito tocante sobre um homem que se sente invisível dentro de casa, negligenciado pela esposa e filhos e se apaixona por uma mulher do passado. ainda bem que o douglas sirk era um diretor muito sensível e só escrevia tramas complexas, então a história não seguiu um caminho machista ou tentou justificar traição, culpar a família ou coisas do tipo. o cliff vê na norma o reflexo do passado dele, o tempo perdido, uma época de muitas aventuras, desejos… um enredo delicado assim como as histórias femininas do diretor.

The children are perhaps a bit simplistic and broadly defined, though the ideas are interesting. Suspicion and mistrust all appear naive in the midst of genuine innocence. Although the black-and-white isn't as exciting or vibrant as his colour films, the cinematography is still excellent. Great dramatic use of shadows and contrasts. One of the things that set Sirk's films apart is the sympathy he has for his female characters, which always makes them feel more well-rounded than other films of the time.",3.5

"If there's a missing link in Douglas Sirk's filmography that's not actually missing, just underseen, it's There's Always Tomorrow. ""Missing link"" implies a chronological pivot point that divides everything on either side of it on the timeline, but Sirk had already made Magnificent Obsession and All That Heaven Allows, two of his signature melodramas, by the time this film debuted in January of 1956. Here, I mean ""missing link"" in a tonal sense, as it seems to be the closest thing he gave us that balances the noirs he nailed in the 1940s and the melodramas that became his legacy.
The first ingredient is a pair: twelve years after sharing the screen in Bill Wilder's own perfect noir, Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck (not seen on a trolly here, but you know she rode it at one point) and Fred MacMurray are back with sexual tension. This time, MacMurray's Clifford is the married one and Stanwyck's Norma is the tempting extramarital figure on the periphery. But rather than there being a nefarious plan to murder Clifford's wife Marion (Joan Bennett), there is only the ennui of home life driving them apart.
Plenty of regular old dramas and melodramas have affairs or potential affairs as plot points, but how many have a grown child (William Reynolds as Vinnie) investigating its veracity like a private eye? There's an intrigue built around the will-they-won't-they between Norma and Clifford because there's essentially a tail on the case, and that tail is Clifford's son who is hell-bent on exposing his father to his family. This is perhaps the only other nod to noir on Sirk's part, as most of the rest of the film is his trusty melodrama.
And in this subgenre, he does what he always does, which is foreground the woman. Most films, even today, in which a married man has wandering eyes and lips, the woman is framed as the temptress or some heartless, selfish party. Here, Norma has a better head on her shoulders than dumb-dumb Clifford. Later in the film, when perceptions are succumbing to truth, Norma puts herself on the line to vouch for Clifford, saying that he is unappreciated and unseen in his own home.
Her small rant falls on deaf ears: ours, to be exact. Clifford's character is written as if he's oblivious to the chemistry and mutual appreciation between him and Norma until suddenly he isn't, or at least he decides to care that quickly. Norma is sane, fully aware of her feelings, and fully aware of consequences as the do or would result from actions. Her full-throated defense of Clifford's fragile emotional state gives him way too much credit, although it doesn't seem the film feels the same. Either way, Norma looks benevolent as ever. In a film rife with text and subtext about whether or not women can or should ""have it all,"" we walk away with the most important impression: that Norma has decency, and that's what counts.",0.0
"Meet my new toy robot, Rex. He represents the emotional prison I live in.",4.0
"Maybe noteworthy/progressive for it's time, but fairly rote melodrama looking at it 60+ years later. But it is well executed and MacMurray shines while carrying the film with the right emotional balance. Stanwyck (as always) makes the most out of a character that feels underwritten and could easily be rote in a lesser actor's hands. So, a decent, but probably forgettable, film.

Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck have been getting grief over their appearances ever since 1944 (the eternal refrain being, essentially, that neither of them are hot enough to be worth committing murder for). It goes without saying that they’re both a good deal frumpier in this movie than they were in Double Indemnity. The whole movie’s a bit frumpy, by Sirk’s standards. But that’s kind of what makes it so devastating.",3.5
"Routine family melodrama elevated by interesting performances by MacMurray and Stanwyck and dramatic cinematography—but weighed down by poor or incomplete characterizations of several critical characters, particularly the two suspicious kids.

For a much better film about a man who feels ignored by his family and brings in an outsider woman to shake things up, see “Fifth Avenue Girl” starring Ginger Rogers and Walter Connolly. The situations differ somewhat as does the attitude, but there they make a unique classic.",2.0
Devastating!,4.0
"More than a decade after Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are back at it, plotting a partnership that’s built on illusions of escape. In this 1956 meeting, the setting shifts to suburban Los Angeles and to a MacMurray who is less bothered by work than by the constraints that family life and marriage have put upon him. As in the earlier film, Stanwyck provides a glimpse of something different. But, here, Douglas Sirk’s melodrama replaces noir, and the danger of the murder plot shifts to the risk of familial betrayal. 
A toy manufacturer, Cliff Groves (MacMurray) is feeling more like his latest toy, Rex, the walkie-talkie robot—going through the motions, programmed to please others. Sirk ratchets up the tension as Groves takes awkward steps to assert his freedom, and, soon, the Groves children begin to assume the worst. The late confrontation between the kids and Stanwyck is a highlight, although Sirk seems to pull some punches, leaving things in a queasy state of “settled” instead of letting the fireworks fly.",4.0

"""Waiting is part of being in love""
Constant shots of faces shrouded in shadow emphasize the chthonic mutterings, gossip, secrets, plots of a once forgotten romance being remembered again. Barbara Stanwyck is of course fabulous as the sensible, reluctant femme fatale Ms. Norma Vale. A handsomely severe New York City woman who flies in and causes havoc. Fred Macmurray's son Vinny is an annoying little twat/boner killer who meddles in his father's affairs too much and clearly thinks daddy is an adulterous nightmare. Has a weasly little crew cut to top it off. The scene when Stanwyck is confronted by Vinny is amazing: all the energy and emotional dynamics of this relationship are poured out and we feel the height of what's termed melodrama. When the rainwater pours down inverted panes of glass on Cliff's window and out of Norma's eyes--gah! This is what movies are all about. Life, and how a pure and happy ending is more often than not a pipedream, even in the movies. We're usually, in the end, forced to compromise. But damn does this tear out your heart by the end!",5.0

"It was alright.
The only issue I had with this film is it gave too little to work with when it came to the progression of Mr. Groves's feelings. The presentation and selection of the events in his life seemed sequential. It felt like I given a distinct structure to base Mr. Grove's later actions on. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think what (the film everyone compares this to) All That Heaven Allows really excelled in was giving me, the audience more scenes that could be interpreted in different ways and a greater level of character introspection through body language and its ""life event selection.""

"kind of the bizarre ""don't take your dad for granted"" flip side of the All That Heaven Allows coin. Weird to see the Double Indemnity duo playing in something far less cynical and slick. MacMurray is a bit miscast - he doesn't read as sweet or put-upon in the way the character needs. Spencer Tracy or Jimmy Stewart come to mind. Stanwyck, on the other hand, is flawless. The scenes at the play (where she not so indirectly asks Cliff to take her to hotel room vavavoom) and in said hotel room with Cliff's kids are the highlights",3.5
"My second Sirk after All That Heaven allows. That one swept me up in the melodrama more than this one did for whatever reason. I'm partial to Fred MacMurray as a general rule from growing up watching My Three Sons and The Shaggy Dog, and later loving him in his serious movie work in The Apartment and others. And I liked Stanwyck a lot in Ball of Fire & Double Indemnity. It's definitely covering interesting ground for 1955 so I'm reticent…",3.5
"Douglas Sirk's Age of Innocence. And a believable inspiration for Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime.""
Love that Sirk gives us two iconic femmes fatale representing two lives MacMurray could live. Cliff has taken the one more traveled by, as it turns out, and Norma (like Countess Olenska) is wise enough to know that there's no way MacMurray would be happy if they actually ran off together.
Maybe it's the lack of Technicolor, and maybe it's just that there are only so many melodrama masterpieces one director can make, but this never reaches the heights of All that Heaven Allows or Written on the Wind — the emotional fallout from the climactic decisions doesn't sing out the way they do in those other films. William Reynolds as the son who fears his comfortable boat being rocked is not as great here as he is in Heaven.
But — no shade on Hudson or Wyatt — it's nice to see Sirk working with a different set of three great actors in the leads. (And it was jarring to realize that I'm older than all of them here.)

"i've been thinking a lot since watching it about the power of sirk's imitation of life, and specifically armond white's review of that movie, where (in so many words) white attests to the films power as a film on its own genre terms, not as an ironically composed intellectual exercise. i think this actually helps articulate something that ive had some trouble with when going through sirk's films—ive been reading all sorts of takes on these melodramas with the idea being that their greatness emerges once viewed in a sort of brechtian, discursive lens. i think this is 100% true, as sirk is clearly a genius and displays as accomplished a filmmaking sense as hollywood has likely ever known, but what's been hanging me up has been the couching of this praise in a seeming disregard of the surface-level, emotional pleasures of these movies. yes, all that heaven allows and written on the wind are tremendous films that can be read as critiques of american society, but their surface pleasures, superficial as they are, are so tremendously powerful that they should be lauded, as difficult as that may be to do with how ephemeral something like an emotional response can be qualified. the single-minded over-intellectualized approach to these movies feels almost like an inversion of the contemporary reaction they garnered at release—from kitschy, overly sentimental housewife trash to subtly genius and ironic works of stylized critique, we can't ever acknowledge the validity of the emotional responses they elicit. it's given me a bit of a disconnect when reading all this writing about sirk, because i agree with the assessment of his talents, but the primary connection ive had with his work thus far has been at an emotional level, where the characters and feelings move me to a profound degree. that his work allows itself to be appreciated at both the visceral, emotional level and the intellectual level is i think a key aspect of sirk’s genius.
this is a long-winded lead in to me saying that there's always tomorrow is another notch on sirk's idiosyncratic belt: a biting look into upper class domestic life disguising itself, convincingly, in the terms of hollywood melodrama, though from a male perspective this time (the ending is maybe the most nakedly false happy ending of a hollywood movie ive ever seen). anticipates all that heaven allows and, in its elided, unconsummated romance, in the mood for love further down the line",4.0

"This one was actually quite interesting.
In one corner we have Cliff, a middle-aged good-natured man who seems to have it all - a successful business he actually loves (toys!), a beautiful wife and 3 beautiful, if a bit too spoiled and opinionated, teenage kids in a beautiful house. What he doesn't like is that he's looked at by them all as a provider of money and wealth first and a person second (if at all).
In another corner there's his old friend from work Norma, who once escaped to New York due to her unrequitted love for him. She's a fashion designer, extremely good at what she does, smart and strong-minded - but unhappy in her personal life.
In a third corner there's Cliff's wife Marion. Marion is a good wife and mother, she's always on top of things and knows her husband better than he knows himself.
Every one of them is right and wrong at something.
Clifford is right that he's unhappy with his family treatment. Life doesn't end at 40-something. But he's wrong at wanting to turn back time, wanting Norma to leave her life for him. He has a family and responsibilities, he can't just ran away with a woman from his younger years (that he didn't even notice much when he was young) and become 23 again. And Norma's right, Clifford doesn't love her, he loves his wife - it's just being with Norma reminded him how fun it was when you don't have family and kids and can do as you please.
Marion is right at not being foolish, jealous. She rans the family smoothly. But she's wrong at, well, her vision of how a woman should live her life (but it's the 50s!). In one scene she says she pities Norma — yes, she's successul but women don't want success, they want a house full of kids and a husband. (And the movie seems to support this idea by showing Norma indeed being unhappy.) She has a clear idea about a woman of her status and feels well, mature at her age (which is about 40). So she rejects a dress designed by Norma calling it too youthful for her, laughs at Norma's suggestion that Clifford will ""rave"" about the dress - these unmarried women don't know husbands don't rave about anything. (What do they do then? Frown or nod?) She's married to a sucessful man, has enough money for everything and it makes her feel she has the right to judge (and pity) women who don't have that — even if they have something else.
And Norma, I guess, is only wrong at wanting to see her old flame 20 years past. It's pretty obvious that wouldn't do her any good and would only bring more heartache (which it did).

"This was a standard Sirk melodrama where Fred MacMurrray gets to play the role he plays most of the time, a dude that has a comfortable life filled with that mid-life monotony that comes crumbling down at the first hint of a life outside of it.

She's a strong figure with some inward longing that she never lets boil up entirely above the surface but moves through her life with confidence and determination.
Like other Sirk dramas, the men are all angling towards something or slightly confused by what's actually going on. The women are trying their best to make them realize what's really happening, but just enough to allow the men to save face, until they finally have to beat it over their heads in a severe manner before they destroy everything and everyone around them. After a somewhat routine and slow build, Stanwyck drives it home in a couple of dramatic scenes.

"Barbara Stanwyck and Douglas Sirk. My favorite actress and one of my fave directors. Melodramas never had it better. And as added bonuses we get the star reteamed with the always reliable Fred MacMurray and Joan Bennett. The story itself is a bit of a trifle and doesn't rate as high as other spectacular Sirk efforts. Also, with black & white we don't get that lush '50s technicolor his films are so famous for. But there's so much good here why waste the effort on the bad?
MacMurray is a husband and father whose ""picket fence"" life has stagnated. Stanwyck is an old employee who briefly dated him twenty years ago. She turns back up just when he is searching for a better life. But his kids stumble upon the flirtation and they have ideas that things have progressed beyond that. When they do, the pair have a choice to make.
As a man in a nearly 20-year relationship, I can certainly relate, though I'm not ready to take that kind of action. But things do get unbearably samey after a while and it's only natural to look back on moments in life when our paths could have diverged and imagine what those alternate realities might have been. Barbara Stanwyck provides an enchanting what-if, but in the end, it comes back to the responsibilities he has committed to. It's ultimately a very sad tale, as most Sirk movies are. And the ending has us imagining that what-if right along with him.",3.5

Douglas Sirk’s domestic melodrama doesn’t just subvert the traditional concept of the classic suburban family, it eviscerates it. MacMurray is brilliant as the Everyman rendered impotent by the American dream. Stanwyck, too, is excellent. Her chemistry with MacMurray is always wonderful anyway, and she suits this role perfectly; blending an alluring maturity with a resigned sadness.
One small gripe... It should have ended exactly where Sirk had originally intended. Not that this diminishes the power of the film. Sirk was a true master and There’s Always Tomorrow stands firmly amongst his very best work.

"A reasonably well-done melodrama about a successful toy company owner and married man (Fred MacMurray) who grows weary of his family taking him for granted. A previous employee (Barbara Stanwyck) reenters his life and they quickly rekindle their friendship and start down the road to a romance. Will he he stay with his unappreciative wife (Joan Bennet) or run off with the new lady in his life. The plot is a bit too pat at times, but MacMurray and Stanwyck do a good job with the material.
Generally well-acted, though the kids acting leaves a bit to be desired. Early role for Pat Crowley as the son's love interest.",3.5
"Unrelentingly melodramatic without a shade of nuance, though the scene with Stanwyck and the son and daughter is a standout confrontation. Watching Bennett play a 50’s Stepford Wife is a painful reminder of the period; the recurring metaphorical image of the wind-up talking robot toy made by MacMurray’s company is hardly subtle. On paper the story is a staunch defender of faithfulness, but as filmed by Sirk it is saying something else entirely.",3.5

"Fred MacMurray's busy, bored domestic-sitcom family man is in the throes of midlife crisis when old flame Barbara Stanwyck turns up on his doorstep after 20 years. What initially seems like their Before Sunset (their scenes together are massively elevated by knowledge of their previous onscreen history) gets first disrupted by MacMurray's pouty asshole son, who walks in at all the worst moments and jumps to all the wrong conclusions (that his suspicions are wrong but his fears aren't unfounded - nothing illicit is actually going on, but MacMurray does have newly-awakened feelings for Stanwyck - scarcely make his scenes any less enervating to watch), then extinguished by life itself and its reminder that some things are just too late. The result is an odd beast, a film that arrives at nuanced, resigned truths via contrived Idiot Plotting and stiff lessons-learned dialogue, and consequently feels more compelling in hindsight than when you're watching it, although every intimate moment between the two leads - or even something as simple as Stanwyck standing in front of a window at night, reflected in a glass that's wet from the rain outside - is invaluable in the moment.",0.0

"Kinda strange to see a Sirk film without that eye-popping Technicolor, but this is actually one of my favourites from him so far....it's a bit more restrained, but it still expertly tugs at the heartstrings, and I was really invested in the story from start to finish. MacMurray is heartbreaking, Stanwyck is always great, and it explores most of Sirk's usual themes in a really compelling way (it's interesting to see this kind of domestic melodrama from the man's point of view). Excellent stuff, and all wrapped up in a tight 80 minutes.",4.5
"Most of the characters are simultaneously blameless and difficult to defend—the only person I genuinely dislike is Vinnie.  The affair is pretty odd.  I want to hate Cliff, but he seems so thoroughly reinvigorated that you don’t want to keep him down either.  But again, it’s an ugly situation, just one that seems almost unavoidable with the arrangement between Cliff and Marion in terms of work.  They don’t do anything together and it only resembles a marriage in terms of work, not their relationship.  If Cliff ever seems unreasonable in his plans with the family, he also seems sympathetic in how basic his desires are (the guy just wants to spend a weekend with his wife, but a twisted ankle is all it takes to shut that down).  Broadly, the characters’ actions are understandable, just often frustrating because of their effects on others.",3.5

Like damn when Barbara Stanwyck read those kids I was like she is spilling the tea. Now Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray were both great here as expected, they certainly were a great movie couple.

"84/100 (A-)
I take back what I said about Sirk only having one great film - this is wonderfully touching and sweet, a thoroughly-grown up romance in which every adult character comes across likable and smart.
MacMurray and Stanwyck are outstanding, creating a moving portrait of lonely people eager for more from life. While the film lacks the usual gorgeous technicolour, it still looks great thanks to Sirk's expert use of the camera.
Only downsides are the performances of William Reynolds, which never convinces, and the rather rushed ending, which wants to be melancholic but just feels a bit unsatisfying. Otherwise, this is one of Sirk's most romantic and heartbreaking.",4.0
great film on male toxicity,0.0
"Sirk's male melodrama is an exquisite, thunderously emotional, and psychologically acute study of the trap of conformity and suburban normativity roars with all the pain and passion of his great melodramas as the focus turns from the repressed, unhappy housewife to the equally anguished, emotionally suffocated working husband who feels his happiness being drained from him by the constant needs and strains of his family. The film, though, is never one-sided in its sympathy, making clear the ways Bennett's character is also trapped in the cycle of service, yet unaware of it, as well as the deleterious effects of MacMurray's search for happiness on his family, inviting us to sympathize with MacMurray's burden without excusing him of the responsibilities his decisions have saddled him with. The morality of the conflict between happiness, selfish fulfillment and responsibility is intractably tangled and the bitterly ambiguous ending leaves a chilling, desolate air of irresolvement.
Sirk and cinematographer Metty bring to bear an expressive visual aesthetic that fashions bold visual metaphors for the film's themes in the layered compositions that stage scenes with Sirk's trademark style, scenes in the home shot through foreground obstacles that suggest MacMurray's confinement, the shadows that linger in corners of rooms, and the toys scattered about his workshop reflecting his stunted search for happiness as well as his warmth, an aesthetic that reaches its peak in the scene of MacMurray staring forlornly out the window of his workshop as the robot towers in the foreground.",4.5
"Discovering: Douglas Sirk #5
Really excellent melodrama from Sirk. It reminded me greatly of Before Sunset, if Celine had gone to America and run into Jesse. (meaning that Jesse's family would have been present and a more palpable wedge between them) I really want to see this again as I feel I could love it even more on a second viewing. Also, seems like my favourite flavour of Douglas Sirk is Barbara Stanwyck in Black & White. She's a genius.",4.5
I'm constantly amazed by the depth of Sirk's emotional analysis.,4.5
"I'm not always convinced by the setup here -- the way that Barbara Stanwyck's character just re-enters the life of Fred MacMurray at a convenient time for the narrative -- but to criticise it for that seems beside the point, when it's a relatively sensitive portrayal of an all-too-familiar subject (a man cheating on his wife). It levels critiques at a certain 50s way of domestic conformity, in ways that are subtler than many other filmmakers would do, and don't exonerate the man, allowing him to be both dutiful and supportive of his family, and yet feel a little unloved. And once again, in a Sirk film, the children are the ones who come across as the most judgmental (oh, the youth of today).",3.5
Had to watch it again because I loved it so much last time round - Fred MacMurray really is superb in this. As is Barbara Stanwyck and Sirk can block a scene better than anyone. Just brilliant.,5.0
"Children are the worst seems to be one of Sirk's auteurist signatures.
Though one may occasionally miss the extravagance of his color films here, Sirk sure knows how to use black and white too. Like his more famous ones, this is both a beautiful and sad film. If it's not quite up there with his best, it's only because that's such a high bar to clear. Sirk directs the hell out of this story, whether through the elegant blocking of the film's opening, the use of shadows when Vinnie and Anne have their dramatic conversation in the garden or the reflection of the pouring rain from the window on Norma's face. It's great to see Stanwyck and MacMurray re-united and the former eventually brings her true A-game. Given the constraints of the era, you know how it has to end, but this is where Sirk's brilliance really shows in how he milks the tragedy of that outcome to maximum effect. The children once again function as the ""villians"" of the story and if the final shot, the three kids looking at their parents through supporting bars (framed like prison bars, as if they are the true enforcers and prison guards of suburban uniformity), isn't some absolutely clear cut symbolism, then I don't understand movies I guess.",4.0
Super. I want to try and watch it again before it leaves MUBI because I know that there are incredibly rich details going on in the cinematography and direction that I’ve missed on this first time round. Hopefully a fuller review will follow at that point.,4.5
"Douglas Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow opens with a ‘Welcome to Sunny California’ sign amid pouring rain. It then steps into a toy-making workshop, a place you might naively assume to be a wonderland of fun and joy. And yet the man who runs and owns it, Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray), is a deeply dissatisfied fellow about to face a mid-life crisis. Just little foretastes of the irony that runs through this film — by the time it’s over we’ll know what a bitter pill its title is too.
We might raise an eyebrow now at the fact that a white middle-aged male is shown as the victim of this factory-line living that was 1950s suburbia, knowing in reality that it was far more likely to be women who felt trapped by its domesticity and African-Americans who were prevented by the suburban real estate mogul William Levitt from buying his houses. But this is tempered by the fact Sirk dealt with the issues of gender and race in other films. In There’s Always Tomorrow his egalitarian streak shows that even if you’re white and male you still can fall victim to the system, and the film works particularly because of MacMurray’s performance as a rather sweet and thoughtful man. (How different both he and Stanwyck are from their iconic duo a decade earlier in Double Indemnity and what a great bit of meta-casting.)
As for Sirk, for all the irony, he really makes us feel and believe these people’s lives, their regrets, their paths taken and not taken. Their lives are mapped across a constellation of conflicting wants and needs — in the end they get neither what they think they want nor what they truly need. And yet life must go on — this film is perhaps the closest Sirk gets to Ozu or Naruse, but still with all his trademark expressionistic lack of restraint and biting visual symbolism.

"There's Always Tomorrow begins with a title card that reads, ""Once upon a time in California..."" and ends with what could be as far from a fairy-tale ending as possible. It's a film about the nuclear family coming apart—the husband wants his old flame; the mother is only interested in herself; the younger daughter cares about her dancing career; the older daughter has ""emotional problems"" to deal with (these are literally her words, because this is Sirk's on-the-nose universe); the son is invested mostly in his girlfriend. Nobody cares about each other, and almost everyone is unhappy. So much for '50s idealism.
Yes, this movie is pessimistic, subversive, and whatever else Sirk's melodramas tend to be, but I love how hopeful There's Always Tomorrow comes out in the end. Its final 10 minutes are a reminder that happiness is temporary—which also, on the other hand, means that sadness is, too.",4.5
"A toy company executive falls back in love with his old flame when his family starts taking him for granted. There's enough pulp and melodrama to deck the halls here, but Sirk never quite takes advantage of it and goes for a more straightforward picture. It lacks what makes ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Written on the Wind"" so explosive and sexy. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray somehow lost the chemistry they so frequently had in the 1930s and never come off as a convincing couple in love. If their relationship were as strong as MacMurray's relationship with his family was weak, we'd be fully revved and ready to go. It's sad seeing Sirk at anything less than good.
Joan Bennett tries a bit too hard all film long because she knows she's not a part of the central couple. She tries to do what she did with Fritz Lang in the '40s, but it comes off the wrong way. MacMurray is dull as dishwater, and Stanwyck plays the role far too seriously for the melodrama to settle in.
And it's not right to discredit a Sirk film because of its lack of his signature Technicolor mastery - both ""Thunder on the Hill"" and ""All I Desire"" are good movies from him in black-and-white.
""There's Always Tomorrow"" fails to arouse and excite. It has all the right ingredients, but nobody ever capitalizes on them.",2.5
"MacMurray and Stanwyck made four films together
Remember the Night
Double Indemnity
This
The Moonlighter
From TCM
Most melodramas of the 1950s, including those made by the master of the genre, Douglas Sirk, address the experience of women: They suffer at the hands of men, their children, fate. But Sirk's 1956 There's Always Tomorrow is that rare melodrama that focuses on the world of men, specifically the plight of Fred MacMurray's Clifford Groves, a dutiful husband and family man. The film begins with a title card reading ""Once upon a time, in sunny California."" But the opening shot shows people hustling through torrential rains on their way to work, wielding their umbrellas like shields, a clear visual metaphor for the ways life doesn't always meet our expectations.
And then we meet Clifford. He runs a thriving Southern California toy company, treating his employees fairly and with respect -- he's the prototypical decent guy, the kind of ""good man"" any woman would feel lucky to find. But when he goes home at night, his wife, Marion (Joan Bennett), barely has time for him, she's so caught up in the lives of their three children - they rule the household with their petty needs and demands. It's her birthday, and he's purchased tickets to a show, hoping the two of them might spend a rare evening alone together. But she waves him away -- their younger daughter has an all-important dance recital that night - and so Clifford retreats to the kitchen, where he sits alone, eating a meal the maid has prepared for him.
The doorbell rings: Enter Barbara Stanwyck's Norma Vale, one of Clifford's former employees. She's now a successful clothing designer in New York, but she's come to California on business. She remembers Clifford fondly - perhaps more than fondly - and just wants to say hello. Clifford is energized by this bright, vital woman who, unlike his wife, clearly takes an interest in him. The unhappy husband - like the unhappy wife in so many other melodramas -- begins to wonder: Might this new person bring him happiness?
Plenty of films noir and '50s westerns examine the pressures and insecurities suffered by men in postwar America. But There's Always Tomorrow used melodrama to explore that experience. Sirk apparently recognized that it wasn't just women who worked hard to keep the families of 1950s America secure and well-fed. The German-born director, who had fled his home country for the United States in the late 1930s, was enough of an outsider to see this particular problem clearly. There's Always Tomorrow was based on a novel written by Ursula Parrott; an earlier film version, from 1934, starred Frank Morgan and Binnie Barnes. But Sirk, with the help of his superb cinematographer Russell Metty, adapted the problems of the lead character to the current times. The picture bears many of Sirk's stylistic trademarks, including shots framed through stair banisters or slatted partitions, to reinforce the idea that the characters are prisoners of the lives they've created for themselves.
But there's more to There's Always Tomorrow than those easily recognizable Sirk visuals. The picture is emotionally rich and ultimately devastating; melodrama, when done right as it is here, is anything but heavy-handed. And yet Sirk himself seems to have underestimated the film. In Sirk on Sirk,> he told Jon Halliday that MacMurray's character ""...is like a nave American boy who never grows up. And then Stanwyck comes back from his past. But she doesn't find a grown man. She leaves."" But as Christopher Sharrett points out in an essay on There's Always Tomorrow in Cineaste magazine, ""Sirk must have misremembered the film, since his prcis hardly speaks to its central themes, which, together with his usual craftsmanship, makes it one of his greatest, most fully-realized accomplishments. It has little to do with infantile regression-unless we look at the portrayal of children and the family. It is more accurately termed Sirk's most biting portrayal of suburban family life in the Fifties.""
Sharrett is right in his assessment of the movie's subtler qualities. Fortunately, in another interview, with Michael Stern, Sirk expanded on his reading of the film: ""I think [There's Always Tomorrow] is a very sad picture because here is the American man dominated not by his wife so much as by the rules of society. She is as miserable as he, only she doesn't even know it! He can't escape. He can't make up his mind. He is the American man remaining a child. He is a producer of toys; still playing with toys. Then, his youth comes back. Knocks right on his door. And at the end, of course, he walks to the window and there is the plane flying away. It is his youth, his happiness.""
It's telling that Clifford's one chance at happiness should be played by Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck and MacMurray were one of cinema's inspired pairings, complementing each other perfectly in Double Indemnity (1944) and Remember the Night (1940), as well as There's Always Tomorrow. Here, Stanwyck's matter-of-factness as a businesswoman is balanced by her clear affection for her former boss; she even has romantic feelings for him, though she's not sure that she should act upon them. MacMurray's Clifford, on the other hand, is more malleable: If Stanwyck's Norma were to initiate an affair, he'd go with it - he yearns for attention and affection, and she seems poised to give it to him. Still, he feels more comfortable fulfilling his duty as a good husband. He tries to tell his wife all about his platonic friendship with Norma, to make it clear he has nothing to hide. He's weaker than Norma is, but he's also more susceptible to heartbreak and disappointment, as the picture's ending - seemingly ambiguous but wrenching -- makes clear.
Sirk had actually planned another ending for There's Always Tomorrow: He wanted to show one of the toys manufactured by Clifford's company, a mechanical robot, walking toward the camera until it falls off a table. ""The camera pans down, whoom! And there's the robot, on the floor, spinning, rmmm, rhmm, rhhmm ... rhhmmm, slowly spinning to a halt,"" Sirk explained to Stern. ""The End. That is complete hopelessness. This toy is all the poor man has invented in his life. It is a symbol of himself, an automaton, broken."" The ending Sirk ultimately chose is more subtle, and better for it. But it's a melodramatic conclusion, not a tragic one, and Sirk understood the difference - even as he understood how to satisfy an audience. As he said to Stern, ""In tragedy the life always ends. By being dead, the hero is at the same time rescued from life's troubles. In melodrama, he lives on - in an unhappy happy end.""

"Two versions of this story were filmed: one before WWII (1934) and this one, after (1956), by Douglas Sirk, king of postwar angst. This is the basic plot of the latter:
Fred MacMurray: ""I am a fine, upstanding, and benignly pleasant breadwinner!""
Wife: ""Cool, love you, super busy running your household and raising your children.""
Kids: ""Sup dad, we're busy with all sorts of school and extracurriculars because it's the fifties and we're under enormous pressure to be successful while conforming to your generation's incredibly rigid behavioral standards.""
MacMurray: ""WAAHHH NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO ME OR APPRECIATING ME WAHHH, WHAT VALUE HAVE I AS A MAN IF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN ARE NOT WORSHIPING ME AT MY FEET 24/7""
Barbara Stanwyck: ""HELLO LOVER""
The ensuing plot is surprisingly chaste and dismal. Lots of MacMurray and Stanwyck saying ""But I love you!"" ""But we mustn't!"" Lots of kids judging their dad for GASP! speaking with a woman he isn't married to! (It often feels like kids judging their parents is an essential element of almost every Sirk movie.) Everyone comes out kind of cheap and ugly at the end. It's one of Sirk's typically unflinching look at marriage and masculinity in the fifties, but boy doesn't it make you glad it's NOT the fifties anymore.",2.5

"Another outstanding Sirk melodrama that captures male middle-aged ennui and the neglect that can creep into long marriages. Barbara Stanwyck is superb as the woman who's loved MacMurray's character for years but knows her happiness means tearing a family apart. MacMurray also delivers a strong performance. But it's Sirk, aided as usual by exceptional cinematographer Russell Metty, who brings the material to life by transcending soap opera to poke holes in the popular image of a successful upper middle class family.",4.0

Its weird watching a movie where even if it was made just a few decades earlier, Norma (Barbara Stanwyck) and Cliff's (Fred MacMurray) 'affair' would have been consummated and though it seems like it might go that way, it comes to a very bittersweet turn. She comes back into his life when he needs somebody to appreciate him and give him what he wants emotional (not physically, which was what I assumed) but when she has, they are both grown adults. They get swept up a bit in remembering old times but they come to the conclusion that being together is not possible, no matter what their feelings are towards each other.",3.5
