Opens with the view through a one-way mirror, which turns out to reflect the film's very structure. As a young man I was enthralled by the way Egoyan withholds information, encouraging you to make assumptions that turn out to be significantly less twisted than what's actually going on; arguably no other movie has woven so many arresting, initially inexplicable strands into such a richly satisfying narrative tapestry. But that sort of gamesmanship, however brilliant, doesn't explain the full-body chill I still get from the final shot, 18 years and at least five viewings later. ""You have to ask yourself: What brought the person to this place?"" And while we eventually find out all about Francis, what gives Exotica its unique power is Christina's all-but-unacknowledged role in their symbiotic relationship, the entirety of which is implied by her slow, reluctant walk up to the path to her house in the closing flashback. Only cinema can create an effect like this—any attempt to put the shot's troubling implication into words would render it instantly banal. (I suspect Egoyan put a lot of work into finding just the right house; something about the way it's framed by those two trees creates the impression of No Escape.) And then there's the whole denial-codified-by-demented-ritual aspect, which speaks directly to my nervous system for reasons I'm frankly too scared to investigate. And Mychael Danna's astonishing score, with its discomfiting mixture of familiar and foreign instrumentation and rhythms. And Bruce Greenwood investing a seemingly unplayable cipher of a character with heartbreaking spasms of raw emotion. Shout-out to Sarossy, keepin' it unreal. There might be four or five movies I love more than this one. There might be fewer.",5.0
"somebody on here dinged this as a ""tv detective"" story instead of i guess pure uncut glorious art-house cinema or whatever but i think the stuff that keeps it from being totally pretentious or oblique is what i love about it. thoughtful, delicate, kinda like a canadian almodovar, with as much to say about the transactional nature of relationships as fassbinder or eyes wide shut but with empathy & curiosity instead of nihilist resignation or camp horror. in a dumber movie bruce greenwood's character would become a bronson type vigilante instead of turning inward - its an emotional terrain i cant remember seeing a movie confront before. i know a couple other egoyans but tell me where to find more stuff like this!!",5.0
"indescribable, a tale constructed solely by emotions and empathy, everyone is connected by tragedy, by the terrors of the past and the despairs of the present. exotica is a place of entertainment, not healing according to the owner but this is the only place everyone here has, to escape, to find connection, to try and achieve a form of therapy. and by the end, i was left in a state of profound sadness with tears in my eyes and all down my face. a film of such power that all i could do when the credits rolled was take the disc out, put the dvd back on my shelf, put my headphones on and sob for 10 minutes straight. and as i write this little thing now, i picture the images in my mind and see the pain conveyed and all i can do is try not to let my tears hit the keyboard. utter perfection.",5.0

"Movies about the transactional nature of sex are a dime a dozen, but I've never seen one home in on the way that it is used not for capitalist subsistence but emotional survival. Though it unfurls as something of a puzzle that slowly connects each character (and this is about as great a ""network narrative"" as you're likely to see), it really takes its power from how deftly it shows the bitter irony that only human social life in which everyone is more intimately connected than they could possibly fathom could produce such loneliness. There are so many ways this movie could have taken a direction that would result in something still good but more recognizable and digestible, but instead Egoyan and his actors keep deepening the ambiguities and troubling implications of codependent need even as relationships become more defined. That final shot, at once tender and utterly horrifying, snaps Francis and Christina's bond into focus even as it leaves you wondering anew just how much each is using the other to survive, is one of the greatest, saddest things I've ever seen.",5.0

"This is everything I wanted Crash (1996) to be. Egoyan attempts Cronenberg and excels with his unique psychological stamp. It is not the director's masterpiece, but the specially crafted environment engulfing the darkest and equally complex spheres of human impulses is intoxicating, especially the dissonance achieved between the darkness of it all and the insightful poetry of the soul. Sublimely filmed with a masterful cinematography and very few cuts, Exotica takes a deep dive into the irrational side of human beings while following the director's patterns: vicious cycles, intended repetition, and juxtapositions between past and present, the former to shine a brighter light to the latter. Obsession, dependency and the psychological trauma of disguising the past with the present as if it still was is ultimately haunting. Magnificent finale.

"Was charged recently with putting a list together of the all-time great Canadian films and I put this on it completely based on memory. A revisit has been gnawing at me ever since so I thought it was finally time to make use of that new Criterion Blu-ray (that I had to import from the US due to it ironically being unavailable here), and am happy to report that the new restoration looked as mesmerizing as I hoped it would. Maybe I’m a sucker for the Toronto location but genuinely think this is one of the most beautiful movies ever. 
The anti-erotic, arthouse fantasy atmosphere of this has always drawn loose comparisons to Cronenberg and Lynch but I think mostly due to how genuinely strange and unquantifiable it is. There is something truly unique and radical in how it creates this completely artificial, transactional space of a lush, ambient, ""foreign"" sex club where real feelings of pain, loss, longing, and obsession take the shape of a dreamlike incestuous exorcism; a perverted form of healing via the intimate, fetishistic recreations and rituals of a deeply troubled father desperate to return to a home that no longer exists.
Egoyan's choice to keep this narrative about the bizarre co-dependencies and messy embraces that form around tragedy almost entirely fractured, ambiguous, and elliptical right up until the final frame (structuring the film, in his words, like a striptease) is both deliberately frustrating/anti-climactic and far more rewarding than if it were told straightforward. The way repetition and cross-cutting are deployed is nothing short of entrancing (the way certain framing/camera movement is recreated as much as the situations themselves!), developing a contradictory environment of repression and affection in tandem with one another, and it has one of the best uses of a recontextualizing, ""twist"" flashback maybe ever. ""You have to ask yourself... What brought the person to this point, what was seen in his face, his manner, that channeled him here?""
Been racking my brain trying to think of a movie moment more Canadian than the one in this of Bruce Greenwood's CRA auditor watching a Toronto strip club routine set to Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows"" and MC'd by Elias Koteas (Don McKellar sneaks in there too). Also, just one of the best scores?",5.0

"“I’ve had too many special things taken away.”
Trauma is annular. Once the brain experiences a shock so prodigious, it is permanently altered in how it operates. Where there was once a way to escape from the pain of life, there is now an enclosed ellipse that manifests responses to this pain in a way that is unique for everybody, and someone who hasn’t experience it cannot possibly fathom its depths. One individual may externalize their trauma, expressing it openly, while another may retreat from the torment that plagues every moment of their life via a carefully constructed fantasy.
Animals who have lost their offspring will often take under their wing the young of another who either died, or were themselves not fit to care for their own progeny. Exotica explores two key themes: trauma manifestation and bonding, and human beings in a most primal, instinctual state, frequently as a result of this very trauma one or more people have suffered—sometimes connected, sometimes not. It seems Egoyan is attempting to portray us as the complex and “exotic” creatures that we are (exotic in a more literal sense i.e. out of the ordinary). If this is true, then the most exotic human beings are those who have experienced the most awful things and are now forced to continue on living with them. You could almost see it (continuing with the “exotic” ideology) as the distinct color pattern of a rare bird or the distinctive qualities of their eggs. The two main ideas unpacked in the film are, in actuality, one interconnected, universal concept: when a person undergoes a traumatic event, it is something that not only makes them totally unique, but can bring them together with others in ways that may seem off to people who don’t understand, but are the only rational solution to those who relate.
Each character in the film has to deal with their own emotional baggage stemming from either an isolated incident or a collectively traumatic occurrence, and we see how—depending upon how these things affected them—they respond either internally or externally, by themselves or as a group. Egoyan masterfully withholds from us, allowing us to come to initial conclusions as to what may be going on between these people for a majority of the runtime. There are sinister implications laden throughout that seem to be purposefully placed for the viewer to cast their own aspersions about what these people may or may not be up to. As the story unfolds, we see how wrong we have been, and how there’s no way to imagine what is really going on here, because the only way one would know for sure is to have experienced these exact same events themselves. To be shown this cinematically is nothing short of earth-shattering, and a damn fine example of transgression with a purpose. Even in the final moments, Egoyan exercises restraint, making the implications of Christina’s past and the final shot all the more harrowing.
Exotica deals in circles: the circle of life, that of trauma and, on a technical level, narrative. If an idea or preconception is natural, then the next logical step is to shatter it; to completely break away from expectations—the same way trauma shatters the mind and breaks one away from life as they knew it, changing their perceptions and experience of reality entirely from then on.",5.0
"For a movie submerged in 90s softcore porn Cinemax vibes I was very pleasantly surprised by how warm and empathetic this ended up being. Early on we’re in a Leonard Cohen strip club and a horny guy with rancid, almost evil vibes is narrating as the last holdouts of The Wet Look rub their necks. His sleepy, brooding performance is the dark id hiding behind every guy who ever told you that you in particular would love Burning Man. But then in the next scene he’s getting chewed out by his boss for creeping out the customers. Okay great. That’s a rhythm I can jam on.
There’s a lot here to chew on about ritual, grief, artificiality, and lust. I don’t want to spoil it for you, due to my benevolence. It’s not really a “spoiler” movie so much as it is “a movie that changes scenes’ contexts as it unwinds.” I guess what I liked about it is how strange and sweet those new contexts often were.",0.0
"There is an ethereal beauty to this movie that is hard to describe. Every line, every movement has an otherworldly mystique to it that feels so much like a dream, even though nothing fantastical or supernatural ever happens. 
How can a movie centered around a strip club be this pure? Egoyan masterfully subverts our worst expectations in a way that made me feel guilty about my own mindset; maybe our misanthropic assumptions about each other aren't always warranted. Maybe there is hope for the human condition after all. We are all broken, complex. We all need each other for something and, paradoxically, our motivations can be simultaneously self-serving and altruistic.
Simply put, this is an immaculate work of cinematic art that always keeps me entranced from start to finish and leaves me heartbroken in the best way possible.",5.0
"A narrative striptease; in no rush does the seductive exterior peel its layers away to reveal a void of heartbreak and sadness. Wounds of the past far too deep to ever heal; the type that keeps one up at night and would undoubtedly flash before one's eyes in their last moments.
Grieving life's debris in a labyrinthine construct of lust with one, and hanging on to the illusion of normalcy through the other. A suffocating existence of incessant regret, denial, longing and agony as a result of being forcibly chosen as fate's experimental subject on the fragility of human lives and families alike.
The possibility of a warm embrace still exists in this personal hell on Earth despite the multitude of destructive routes at one's disposal. Not knowing every person inside and out doesn't deny a person of acknowledging that others have their own baggage; their way of dealing with it is what makes the difference. Transactional relationships as equal parts therapy and necessity.",4.5

I spent a few hours of my Monday at the Jewish Museum on 5th Ave and East 92nd St in Manhattan, where there is currently a Jonas Mekas exhibit running through June. I don't know if the noisy room filled with clips from As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty (2000) and A Letter from Greenpoint (2004) was necessarily the best introduction to his pioneering avant-garde work - although I really should learn more since I've enjoyed my experiences over the years at Mekas's arthouse cinema, Anthology Film Archives, and also because my great-uncle Jerome Raphel, who was a member of the Living Theatre, co-starred in two productions directed by Jonas' brother Adolfas, Hallelujah the Hills (1963) and The Double-Barrelled Detective Story (1965) - but I was particularly intrigued by the glass case filled with photographs and poetry-filled diaries, all hauled in trunks by Jonas and Adolfas when they emigrated from Lithuania to America during World War II.
And so, as I spent time thinking about time itself and memory, I turned to Criterion Channel to revisit Exotica. Like so many films by Atom Egoyan, it filters emotion through loss and voyeurism. Acts of looking, acts of remembering. The thin line between pleasure and grief. Haunted by death; hungry for means to create new life (in a womb, in an incubator); surrounded by illusions of continuing life (the club's flora and fauna, the babysitting job that didn't end when it should have); want and need intertwined. Each person here is sewn to another through the thread of a damaged relationship. So many of them are searching for a connection that no longer exists or hoping to create a new one, pretending to ignore reality so that they won't have to acknowledge agonies that lurk beneath the surface. Desire may seem like something hidden, but it doesn't stay that way for long.
Weaving back and forth from past to present, piecing together the story that brings these characters to their crossed paths, Exotica grows even more powerful with additional viewings. The same is true of Egoyan's The Adjuster as well, which Susan Shipton also edited. She's been the director's secret weapon for over three decades, skillfully assembling narratives that never seem to take an easy route.

"Atom Egoyan's wonderful Exotica is a wondrous picture of tragedy and its effect upon the human soul, a particular area of emotion that Egoyan has managed to best capture on the screen as proven in The Sweet Hereafter. While it's unfortunate to see that considering how great his films have been in his early days he has taken quite a nosedive in quality ever since the 2000's, a film that is sure to define him at his most accomplished is none other than Exotica. Egoyan, being one of the most fascinating figures in Canadian filmmaking alongside David Cronenberg, has made what arguably could be the greatest film to come out of Canada.
From the first few minutes we get a jazzy note that sets the mood that will haunt all of Exotica, working together with the camera movement in order to form the hypnotizing atmosphere that ultimately forms such an amazing film. It's amazing how much Egoyan is establishing through even the smallest occurrences on the screen, which can fly past the viewer on a single viewing, yet what's still happening contains quite an aura that draws its viewers much closer to the mystery presented at the very core of Exotica. By the time everything ties all together in its conclusion, the wonders that have been left behind by Exotica become all the more clear.
Egoyan creates a puzzle through the focus on what takes place over at the titular Exotica strip club by means of interconnected storylines, all of which feature characters encountering emotional trauma in their lives. Bruce Greenwood plays a depressed man, Francis, who frequents the area after the loss of his daughter. At the club, he always pays to watch Mia Kirshner's Christina dance for him in a schoolgirl's outfit, much to the jealousy of the club's MC, Eric, also troubled with a relationship with the owner of the club, Zoe. All of these stories are introduced at a distance, but Egoyan weaves their troubles more to form a connection through their past experiences and watching the pieces being put together, the core of Exotica is exposed and suddenly a more heartbreaking narrative comes about.
The whole time, Atom Egoyan refuses to spoonfeed his audiences with the mystery that is present in Exotica which makes it as haunting as it is hypnotic. His direction goes ahead and works to create a unique experiment with the narrative structure presenting a unique aura that only grows to capture its viewers more. From the final moments of Exotica, the mystery soon becomes clear and then we are left to ponder about how the journey would weave all these characters to the one spot that links everything together, for we understand what runs within the minds of our leads, especially the troubled Francis.
No matter where you look around while Exotica plays on the screen, so much is given that presents wonder on every aspect. Whether it range from the emotionally packed performances of the cast down to the mystery at its core, the seamless experimentation with storytelling, down to the hypnotic vibe created by the score, seeing it all working together results in a marvel. There may be more which I might have possibly missed out on, because I'm not so sure how to go on about Exotica without the feeling I've understated the beauty it has left behind. From the very impact of that final shot alone, there's no doubt in me saying that this is easily one of the very best films of the 90's, together with Atom Egoyan's crowning achievement as a filmmaker. It's saddening to see how big of a nosedive his career had taken ever since the 2000's have come along, when we reflect upon what he's left in this gem.",5.0
"Grief is something that everyone processes in different ways. This allows for many kinds of stories to exist on this subject - each dealing with this concept differently. Which is honestly really great and important. However, that does make it harder to connect with some stories if you don’t vibe with that particular way that grief is explored. And that was my case with Exotica.
I can certainly see the appeal. But honestly, for me personally, I find that making a story about a father grieving over a lost daughter into an erotic thriller just doesn’t sit right with me. That dance sequence to the song Everybody Knows honestly just made me uncomfortable because the whole “sexy schoolgirl” act in general makes me uncomfortable. Especially in the context of a man grieving a child - it came across as creepy - his entire character came across as creepy and that’s when I lose interest.
Especially because Christina was barely a character outside of this context. She’s young, pretty, and I quote “jail bait” who exists for Francis to use to work through his problems. And frankly, I just didn’t care. My dude, just go to therapy instead of the strip club for fuck’s sake.",2.0
"A man goes to a strip club every night and a young woman dances for him. ""Exotica"" was marketed as an erotic thriller at its time, but that doesn't do it justice. It‘s rather a work that represents a mixture of experimental setup and psychological drama, darkly luminous, enigmatic and deeply sad.
I get it, but I don‘t love it.",3.0
"Exotica. 1994. Directed by Atom Egoyan. 
Atom Egoyan’s Exotica (1994) is the epitome of a great Canadian neo-noir. Egoyan is a highly accomplished Armenian director from the Toronto New Wave who were influenced by David Cronenberg. In addition, Egoyan’s wife Arsinee Khanjian is often cast in his films. She had a memorable cameo in Irma Vep (1996). Exotica is a prime example of Egoyan non-linear screenplays. In our opinion, a non-linear narrative is far more interesting in most cases due to its slow burn reveal of the main thesis question at hand. Egoyan relied on Paul Sarossy’s cinematography which is dialed into perfection to reveal the inner shots of a dynamically large strip club, suburban neighborhoods, and Toronto. Egoyan films give us the satisfaction of putting together and completing a one thousand plus jig saw puzzle. We had seen Chloe (2009) with Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried, and Liam Neeson and its adapted screenplay was not as engaging as Exotica. 
Bruce Greenwood (Francis) portrays a tax auditor who is deeply troubled by his past. Don Mckellar (Thomas) is running a pet shop that smuggles exotic eggs for thousands of dollars. McKellar also had an entertaining role in David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future (2022) as Wippet. Arsinee Khangian (Zoe) portrays the sexy seven months pregnant in real life Exotica strip club owner. Her current boyfriend Elias Koteas (Eric) functions as the club DJ. Bruce Greenwood frequents Exotica to find some relief from his depression. Each time he visits he only sees one performer named Christina played by Mia Kirshner. As Francis’s life begins to unravel more and more, he relies on Christina and his brother’s daughter Tracey portrayed by Sarah Polley. 
Egoyan’s puzzle pieces are revealed as the film advances. We are shown flashbacks of Francis’s life and Erics life. As the character study is unveiled in the sex drenched world of Exotica, Bruce Greenwood’s major depression and maniacal behavior is explained. Exotica’s purpose in a metropolis is carefully examined and revealed to be a place where the truly troubled go for a type of self medication. Grief is a factor that many struggle with for the remainder of their lives and Francis definitely will. When Egoyan drops the big information bomb after the audience has traveled on the director’s road to revelation, it is quite the gut punch. Even though we were gasping for a bit of air, we were enamored by Egoyan’s storytelling method. A little Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows” takes the sting out of the plot twists as his deep soothing voice sings of death, isolation, loss, and romance. 
Hitchcock, Truffaut, and many other neo-noir, suspense, thriller genres only dream of combining the exotic with a carefully told tale of interracial despair and greif. Exotica won Cannes’s FIPRESCI Prize and eight Genie Awards. Mia Kirshner went on to star in The L Word and replicated her dance from Exotica in an even more revealing scene that we are very fond of. Nevertheless, we love Exotica from start to finish and highly recommend Egoyan’s non-linear story telling mastery of human behavior through a strip club.

"1st Atom Egoyan
Exquisitely structured, this. The obvious and vulgar comparison is a striptease, gradually revealing intimacies until you're left with the nakedness of the situation. But it also works as an antidote to a Comedy of Menace, where repetitions are piled up on top of each other to engender understanding instead of inspiring discomfort behind laughter. Bafflement at the strangeness of behaviours and the stilted quality of speech melts away as we understand the dependency wrapped up in their recurrence. That frustration at sameness is productive, offering a way out of pain. People are stuck in an uncomfortable stasis because any other option feels too painful to consider; the arc of Exotica is learning the courage to break crippling routine formed by grief. Some people speak the truth because they want to. Some speak it because they can't say anything else. Exotica is about the latter.",4.5
"In 1995, my parents gave me a subscription to Entertainment Weekly from one of those middle school magazine fundraisers and I became obsessed with reading about films that never played in my town but would eventually find themselves at my local video store. My parents took advantage of this obsession by also putting me in charge of renting weekly movies, even the one's that I couldn't watch due to my age, because I was the most informed through reading what was supposed to be good. Each Thursday, I'd peddle off to the video store and check out one movie for myself and two for my parents, if I was lucky they'd let me watch one that they'd seen and deemed okay for me. This was all a type of transaction and transactions are incredibly important to Exotica, but I'll get to that in a little bit. First, and this is also important to the layers of Exotica, I have a confession.
I remember reading so much praise for Exotica but the cover art allured me in a shameful manner that I didn't want to take home to my parents (not pictured on Letterboxd, but this one). It got good reviews, but what would it say of me to bring home this stripper movie to my parents? After passing it so many times at the video store, with the school girl outfit, the spotlight, the declaration ""powerfully seductive!"" my mind just put it on a shelf of being smut. Watching it now, after years of reading about it, that tie of the shirt isn't even done in the movie. And now, it feels like Harvey Weinstein (whose Miramax released it stateside) had a photo shoot to sell it as being steamier than it actually is. And now, its two youngest stars, Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley, have both accused Weinstein of undesired advances when they were young.
This movie was youthfully loaded for me going into it and the Kirshner and Polley's additives of undesired advances from Weinstein pretty soon after this movie came out (a movie that Miramax used the surface of ""jailbait"" as a selling point) added an extra wrinkle, but I'm happy to report that there's nothing skeezy about Atom Egoyan's film. I'm currently in the midst of an Egoyan reclamation project, whose experimental 90s Canadian films were sullied by their American box art, when I was a pre-teen, and Exotica is the most rewarding in that regard.
Firstly, the opening pan of exotic plants set to Mychael Danna's evocative score—while letters slowly emerge on the screen seemingly from the subconscious—is a beautiful tone-setter. Having recently watched The Adjuster I know that Egoyan loves puzzles and withholding information so that you start with judgements and then begin to lose them once you know more about the origins of behavioral rituals that we are seeing long after they've already consumed the person. Well, in Exotica, those habitual rituals that have long been set are explored via Francis (Bruce Greenwood), Eric (Elias Koteas) and Zoe (Arsinee Khanijan); the adults. And the new rituals are thrust upon a teenager, Tracey (Polley), a young woman, Christina (Kirshner), and a man, Thomas (Don McKellar), whose exotic pet store job (taking over from his deceased father) has seemingly encased him his childish state; these are the children or those who will remain childish if they allow the desires of those who have power over them (the dead and the living). Of course, Francis, Eric, and Zoe, were all children before and have advanced to various stages of adulthood: the parental shadow, the one in stasis, the one who lost everything; one had a child of his one, one is currently pregnant, and the other has not made that adult connection because his most formative relationship appears to be with someone far younger than him.
Eric, Zoe, and Catherine all work at a fancy ""gentleman's club""; where the gentleman pay for $5 dances and sit paralyzed, viewing a naked woman in front of them, unable to touch or be touched. Eric is the MC and as a big fan of Koteas in Crash it's nice to see him get creepy with a microphone again. Zoe runs Exotica and she and Eric closely observe all the clients and dancers through interrogation glass sheets that view every corner of the building. Their interest in observing isn't for erotic kicks but to see what kind of connections are being made between the dancer and the client. Francis has a peculiar connection with Catherine, who dances in a school girl outfit; Francis' face shows grief on the outside which peeks Eric's interest but what he can't hear is him saying to Catherine on repeat ""who would ever want to hurt you?"" When Francis leaves the club he drives home Tracey, a babysitter who has no baby to sit, whom Francis continues to pay to recreate the fantasy that his child still exists. Eric and Catherine met a few years prior while on a search party for Francis' daughter.
That set-up is a familiar hyperlink scenario of how all the characters are connected through one father's immense grief and carefully constructed escapist fantasy of paying a visiting his ""daughter"" at a strip club, protecting her from the rest of the room with his time and money, and then taking his babysitter home. What makes Exotica more interesting is the side story of Thomas who smuggles exotic animal eggs into his pet shop to sell at immense profit to rare collectors. Thomas' pet shop looks similar to Exotica without striving to convince the clients that they're there for an experience worthy of their status. There's no pretense. There are green ferns to give the deception of a jungle, but you go there to purchase an animal or animal supplies and leave. At Exotica you take your emotional baggage in with you, spend money for a temporary escape, and then leave with more baggage because the transaction isn't as simple as going into a pet shop because it plays with emotions, manipulations, desires, and a whole stew of human feelings.
Thomas' shop was his father's. His own contribution seems to be bringing in the extra-exotic and illegal, but that item isn't shown as being for sale up front, it is for sale beneath the surface, much like what Zoe and Eric like to observe from behind the glass. Thomas exists outside of the fantasy rituals of Exotica. We know nothing of his routines until he learns of a trick in a cab: He can get himself into the company of others by attending the ballet with two tickets and finding a man out front who's attempting to buy one and then Thomas gets to watch for the signs to see whether or not that man is moved by the performance and if that movement might be into his arms.
Thomas' connection to the story is because Francis is auditing him. Similar to The Adjuster, Exotica is most fascinated by the types of transactions we make, what we expect from those transactions, and how they never seem to even out; in Exotica, Francis is able to construct a false reality by paying money for the time of young women. Eric reduces Catherine's earning potential when he is jealous. Thomas feels guilt in taking money for ballet tickets when he only desires company. Using money distances ourselves from our desires but when we purchase interactions that we desire our emotions get thrown off in a way that trains us that the only way we can get what we want is via substitutions and payments for those substitutions.
And unlike The Adjuster, which is so go-for-broke nihilistic, Exotica has a certain warmness on the edges to it that it never feels too harsh to watch. Partially, that is because The Adjuster deals in extreme disconnect, whereas Exotica is attempting to connect characters who watch more than they partake, but connection feels within their reach. The Adjuster is academic filmmaking and Exotica lifts similar storytelling techniques but tells it from the heart rather than the head.",4.5
"[Originally written in spring 1995 as a sort of ""audition"" for New York Press, back before I'd even launched my rinky-dink website. They didn't hire me, but this isn't terrible for a first stab at proper reviewing. Please note that my opinion of the film, while always high, has since skyrocketed—the review below reads as impressed with reservations, whereas now Exotica is one of my five favorite films of all time. Wouldn't emphasize the narrative gamesmanship so strongly today.]
__________________________________________________________
I once took a screenwriting course with an instructor who believed that a scenarist's job is to lead the audience carefully by the hand, as if a motion picture were a minefield. Usually low-key and agreeable, he would begin sputtering and turning red after just a few pages of one of my scripts; invariably, he would eventually turn to me and protest, ""You can't do that—you're gonna confuse the audience."" My invariable reply—""I want to confuse the audience""—only made him angrier. On one occasion, when he was berating me for writing a dream sequence which I'd neglected to helpfully preface with a scene of the character in bed to signify dream, he proclaimed with authority: ""People go to the movies to be entertained and to learn something about themselves. They do not go to the movies to be confused.""
I got a B in that class; I can only imagine what grade he might have given Atom Egoyan, whose latest film, Exotica, is a brilliant exercise in the art of withholding information. Though the film is nominally concerned with the same themes which appear throughout Egoyan's oeuvre—voyeurism, loss, emotional numbness—its primary concern is confounding the viewer. His modus operandi here, similar to that of his previous films but more so, is a refreshing antidote to the sledgehammer technique currently favored by Hollywood studios; where they tell you everything three times, to be certain it sinks into even the thickest multiplex skull, Egoyan parcels out only a third of the details necessary to make sense of the film's early, ostensibly expository scenes. Additional clues are gradually revealed as the film progresses, and only in the final scene do all of the story's elements finally snap into place.
A good thing, too, because the plot Egoyan has constructed for this puzzle is so patently ludicrous that it would probably implode if told simply and straightforwardly. Since the film's chief pleasure, for me, was in attempting to divine the nature of the characters' relationships and determine the meaning of apparently random bits of narrative and just generally figure out what the hell was going on, I am loathe to reveal too much of the story. Exotica will be most effective for a tabula rasa audience. (The blanker the better—those lured by Miramax's misleading ad campaign, with its emphasis on the eponymous strip club and its promise of an ""erotic thriller,"" will likely find themselves neither aroused nor thrilled.) The film's protagonist is Francis, played with alarming sincerity and depth of feeling by Bruce Greenwood. A tax auditor by day (Egoyan's own audit was reportedly the initial inspiration for the movie), Francis is first seen at night, at his usual table in the creepily lush and sterile club Exotica, where a beautiful young woman (Mia Kirshner), dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl, performs a private and curiously asexual dance. She bares her breasts for him and presses her cheek to his, moving against him sinuously; he stares at her with an anguished expression and asks, repeatedly and hoarsely, ""How could anybody want to hurt you?"" Both of them are watched intently by Exotica's aggressively condescending master of ceremonies, Eric (Elias Koteas, who also played the title role in Egoyan's The Adjuster), who has both a bird's-eye view of the proceedings from his perch above the dance floor and a close-up view from behind the club's numerous two-way mirrors. Exotica's other principal, a painfully shy pet-shop owner named Thomas (Don McKellar), is introduced when Canadian customs officials inspect him via another two-way mirror; on the way home from the airport, he receives two free tickets to the ballet in lieu of cab fare when he agrees to share a taxi, and he subsequently spends much of the film returning to the ballet in an attempt to pick up men by offering them a free ""extra ticket."" What's going on here? Well, that's for Egoyan to know, and you to find out.
One brief scene summarizes Exotica's pleasures and frustrations. Immediately following the first scene at the club, we see Francis driving; in the passenger's seat is a blond teenage girl (Sarah Polley, the little girl from Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen). It's still dark, and Francis is dressed as he was in Exotica—it is clearly later or earlier that same night. They chat innocuously for a moment, then Francis drops her off at her home. As Egoyan cuts to the next scene, your brain is still attempting to process the little information it's just been given. Who was that girl? What's her relationship to Francis? What happened during the ellipse that bridged the scene in Exotica and this scene in the car? Did this scene take place before the club scene? Was this girl at the club? Is she one of the dancers? At that age? What gives? All of these questions could have been answered with just one or two brief lines of dialogue, but Egoyan intentionally omits them—and if he hadn't, frankly, the scene would be banal. Almost every scene in the picture operates on this level, especially early on, and each new revelation, however small, produces an audible murmur from the audience, as they connect it with what they've seen previously: ""Oh, that's what was going on there."" Depending on your inclination for intellectual puzzles, this will either thrill you (yeah, okay, that's what Miramax meant, right) or irritate the hell out of you; judging from the grumbling I heard as I exited the theater, there were many more of the irritated than the thrilled at the screening I attended.
Exotica certainly isn't devoid of ideas. Like Peter Weir's little-seen and underrated Fearless, it examines the aftermath of tragedy and the ways in which we attempt to cope with inexpressible grief (none of these characters has Koteas' adjuster to take care of them). Also, while the cinema has recently been inundated with self-deluding characters, Francis is a rarity: a man who's gone to enormous lengths to create an intricate fantasy world for himself, but who at the same time has remained fully cognizant of what he's done, and, on some level at least, of how bizarre it must seem to others. Ultimately, though, the film's form is more impressive than its content; it will appeal only to people who enjoy movies that fuck with their heads. It's the best film I've seen so far this year (not that January through March is generally a cornucopia of cinematic riches), but if you don't go to the movies to be confused, perhaps you'd best take my recommendation with a grain of salt.",0.0

"With Exotica, Atom Egoyan has crafted one of the most hypnotizing, tragic, and empathetic films I've had the pleasure of viewing. Despite being mislabeled an erotic drama, Exotica is actually an exploration of human emotion through interconnectivity. The film moves about at a slow pace and requires a bit of patience, as characters are introduced with mysterious and unknown motivations. Structuring the film like a puzzle (where the pieces slowly fall into place) works wonders and keeps the viewers assuming things about these people, which makes for a very mentally stimulating viewing experience. The structure is also not used as a cheap tactic, and the connections between the characters never feel out of place or contrived, which is an issue with many of these types of ensemble dramas.
Exotica is a tragedy of circumstance that covers themes such as loss, rituals, and connection. It is a film about people trying to overcome paralyzingly grief, brought on by tragic circumstances, and also how the ripple effect of a single event can change multiple lives forever. The titular Exotica strip club is the focal point where all of these characters (lead by tragedy) converge. The dimly-lit club setting, evokes a very somber tone and the symbolic use of color, one-way mirrors, and parrots will leave you wanting to view the film multiple times in order to pick up on every last detail.
It's hard for me to express what makes this film such an intoxicating viewing experience, but it's simply impossible for me not to be mesmerized by the melancholic, haunting, dream-like atmosphere that is present from the spellbinding opening shot, to the absolutely haunting final shot.

"The women of the gentlemen’s club put us in a trance but it is director Atom Eyogan performing the real strip tease, eloquently shifting character arcs, shedding themes of grief, and listening to our common connections of insular pain.
We enter “Exotica” as a wandering eye, slow and reluctant, witnessing other patrons while listening to the deep hum of Leonard Cohen. The pull is magnetic. Here is where people spill their secrets, confide their souls, or get lost—maybe they are already lost—attempting to regain solid ground. Eyogan convinces us to pull up a chair and leave a little of ourselves behind.
Christina teases as Eyogan does, and eventually departs from her friend and pseudo father-figure, with a long walk to her separated world. Her desire for connection is the same as Eric, is the same as Thomas, and is the same as Francis. Their convergence is upon the place of food and drink—the dingy bar—as the playwrights of old once encased in gold with Harvey and The Iceman Cometh. Shared grief, transforms mildly into hope, sometimes that ever-escapable thing…
This is what she dreams of when she walks on home, and when she violently breaks away from the touch of her ex. While Christina never actually removes a piece of clothing during any of her dances, Eyogan removes article by article, to finally leave the narrative and characters naked by the end.",5.0
"100-word review: Francis, who lost his wife and daughter, relieves his pains at the Exotica strip club where he obsesses over young dancer Christina to the annoyance of her former lover and the club's DJ Eric. Thomas, a mysterious pet shop owner who's being audited by Francis becomes involved. Exotica is a complex picture with a remarkably intricate, ever-thickening plot, which works solely thanks to the excellent writing and structuring by Atom Egoyan by virtue of which it doesn't have to rely on much exposition. It flows, aided by an almost continuous, always on-point, fluctuating soundtrack. This isn't watched enough.

"Despondency eclipses in ruins of lust. A gesture withering, a parlance to time gone by, a malevolence dances on the mind as a martyr for grief.

A clandestine repression, spoken in a maelstrom language of the past, annihilating to the prosper of the future; a promiscuous rapture within an inertia of liminal existence. A vehement love, not for passion neither desire, yet for memory. A memory of such tragedy that permeates in condition, the remnants of lucid innocence.",5.0

Exotica is Mike D'Angelo's fourth favorite movie, and one of five films that have received his 100/100 rating, so I thought to check it out. I won't give it a perfect rating, but I still enjoyed this movie.
This movie is unique because it feels like you're watching an arthouse version of a soap opera. Plot threads that would be present in Days Of Our Lives or a Mexican telenovela have become enhanced under the direction of Atom Egoyan. The subdued acting is really good in this as well.",3.5

"Atom Egoyan weaves together Lynchian vibes and Kubrickian finesse in his lurid tumble into the Toronto Strip Club Scene. Exotica is a delicately told story, one where after you finish you sit there picking up the pieces of these fragile relationships hidden under a nightclub scene of lust, love, loss and tenderness. There are scenes in Exotica that almost descend from heaven, a magnetic factor to the film, drawing me in.

"Just for a moment, I beg you, make me forget the past. Make me think it was all a dream, and now I’m awake. Make me feel as if I’m not alone, as if this life isn’t empty. This damned existence has cursed me to continue to live, my heart to beat, my lungs to breathe. I don’t want it. I’m lost, unable to die and incapable of living. This unescapable limbo, where every day is the same, where time seems to have lost meaning, where I float alone, where I long to stay, that I wish I longed to escape.
Don’t be fooled by Exotica’s appearance. The premise, the setting, everything plays to make it pass as one of the many psychological, erotic thrillers that saturated the market in the 90’s. Director Egoyan dives into that atmosphere, that overplayed premise and turns it into a melancholic neo-noir, that delves deep into grief and loneliness, exploring it through the lens of characters as complex as humans, flawed as they can get, they all long for a life that wasn’t given to them, for a way to escape the aching loneliness that plagues human existence.

"Hauntingly perfect. Third viewing, and it only gets better. With every new watch I feel myself seeing more of the mastery Egoyan has on display, that I don't think is absurdly brazen to compare to Kubrick. He doesn't have the same visual flair as The Master™, but he has the pure sense of cinematic construction, and how we relate to what's on that silver screen. As an audience we get to view everything from the comfort of disconnection, and that's precisely how Egoyan decides to approach his masterfully complex web of tragedy. Everything is about grief, pain, and the memories too painful to face, and how everyone is both connected in it, and completely ignoring it. Once we establish our world and characters, we must then confront all of it, until only the people trapped in this cycle together can free themselves, to whatever degree that may mean.
I always find myself caring about scripts first and foremost, and Egoyan has crafted what might be the greatest screenplay ever. It balances self-reflection, a large web of characters, who are both fully formed and still developing, while slowly revealing information like a puzzle, incorporating frank and confronting emotions/dialogues, a wealth of subtext, and a grandiose treatise on why we exist, and how we manage pain. It’s like glancing at the sublime, all the way down to it’s unforgettable final scene that leaves so many things undefined, it’s uncomfortable to sit with. Watching how every single moment comes back in some echo, and how this inexplicable connection is exploited, is never not fascinating, and the utilization of one character who we never learn anything about is nothing short of genius (forcing myself to question what this character ""gets out of this"", was bone-chilling (of course in conjunction with it's ending))
This isn’t a movie for everyone, and yet, to try and sell it more will only dampen the effect it has, so I must say you have to experience it yourself. Maybe I find it hitting too close to home in my ability to thwart my own confrontation of failures, and follies, but I think this is material (if you allow yourself to slip into it’s stream) anyone could relate to; both incredibly specific, and eerily universal. Plus it has a stripping scene to one of Leonard Cohen’s best songs, so like, what do you want from movies if it isn’t that?
Pure cinematic construction at it’s finest hour.",5.0

“Where is your mind?”",5.0
"Structured as a striptease, Exotica is a slow reveal, pulling away at the disguises and bandages we use to hide our painful secrets and vices. Exotica teases at the fabric, loosening the straps, and releasing the tension. And the more it explores, the more it finds, like the auditor sleepwalking through his job, becoming aware of irregularities, realising they’re endemic. 
Atom Egoyan imagines a fantasy world where ballet and strip joints co-exist in the nexus of forbidden desire. But this is just the outer layer. What lies buried beneath is grief, unresolved and superseded by complicit deception. Grief becomes the gateway to transgressions. These spin outward from a single horrific act, with everyone caught by its repercussions. Grief and trauma soaking deep into the psyche, seeping out through every subsequent thought and action.
Egoyan cheats like every good performer - the way he accentuates the seduction through music and lighting, and via the sinuous structure of his show. Leonard Cohen’s music knows you are hiding things, and Mychael Danna’s Indian inflected score seduces and calms like a Cobra to the flute. The music sings of danger and paranoia, and yet it still lulls you under its spell.
Exotica presents characters who struggle to communicate. What passes as awkward conversations carries the threat of something far more sinister, with double meanings and suggestions of ulterior motives. As the film‘s characters are undressed, we gradually discover these are just broken people, damaged and rejoined in common tragedy, unable to heal; finding, instead, ways to maintain the illusion of health, by buying and selling emotions under the cover of fantasy.

"Atom Egoyan unpacks the surveillance lens and aims toward collective detachment and a mosaic of unfulfilling and often futile attempts of connection in ""Exotica"", a psychological case study about the human occurrence where the cleansing process regarding a past tragedy ranges from seeking solace through emotional dependency to unconsciously resort to fixation to ease the pain.
Egoyan excels with his usual use of labyrinthine structures and withholding of information, but ""Exotica's"" greatest feat is how unearths its titular exoticism through the conventionally exotic, only to reveal that the legitimately exotic was among us all along and, worst of all, taken for granted.
""I mean, just because they're exotic doesn't mean they can't endure extremes. It is, after all, a jungle out there, isn't it?""",5.0
"Intoxicating and sultry atmosphere. Reminded me so much of David Lynch is how you’re lured into its trance yet feel ever so slightly disturbed by it. I’m a sucker for a killer set/location. The club Exotica is spectacular. There’s strong writing of course, but without that location the movie doesn’t work. It’s such an interesting contrast to have the story take primarily at this exotic strip club in that connection is such a huge part of the story. Strip clubs only offer some fleeting semblance of connection, but for some that’s enough. The story’s layers peel back like the best bloomin’ onion you can buy. What starts off as this enchanting noirish seductive mystery becomes something unbelievably tragic. Abstract and so very exotic.

"All I'm saying is that nobody asked you if you wanted to be brought into this world, you just did. So the question is now that you're in this world: who's asking you to stay?
A tragedy of epic, yet intimate proportions with a narrative so labyrinthine that it rivals Hitchcock's best. I only discovered this absolute gem of a film this past July, but in the three (yes, three - I promise I'm not insane) ensuing viewings, Egoyan's masterpiece of sad and sorry emotions has only risen in my estimation.
In its final moments, Exotica's utterly spellbinding score dissolves into a Hindu prayer, 'Om shanti, shanti, shantihi...' as though the picture prays for the safety and satisfaction of its principal players. Just when we finally understand all the tragic events that have transpired, in other words, ""what has led a person to this place,"" we are presented with yet another mystery: Christina's profound sorrow. This sorrow precedes her tutee's death. It's deep and mournful. She looks at Francis, bids him farewell, and makes the achingly long trek up her front walkway. She lingers on the porch as if to try one last time to communicate her pain to him. And then she enters the black abyss of her home. Then, Egoyan cuts to black, as though the entire screen shares the pain of that home.
This is one of the most profoundly tragic films ever made. It's a potent example of the dictum: less is more; for Egoyan's film's potency lies entirely in how little it gives us while still giving us all we need to know. Like Paris, Texas, it's a film of heartbreak and loneliness. It's a film of sorrow and pain. It's a masterpiece. And it's my third favorite film of all time. Exotica is one of the 50 5/5s I've given.",5.0
"The Criterion Challenge 2022: Round 2
A place of grief, tragedy, and trauma, one wherein everyone is connected by their disconnection. Atom Egoyan's career breakthrough, not only marketed as an erotic thriller but in many ways stylised like one, Exotica remains a landmark of Toronto New Wave. Emotionally and psychologically intricate, glacially revealing the tormented histories of each character through an interwoven tapestry. Nuanced and profound in its empathy and compassion for the wounded, unraveling its labyrinthine narrative like a seductive striptease from club Exotica itself and imbuing it with a hauntingly hypnotic air of linked dissonance. Cathartic in the most ineffable of ways.",5.0
"The best movie ever made about strip clubs, those who work at strip clubs, and those who frequent strip clubs, even though it’s not really about that at all. Atom Egoyan's film of weird obsessions is the definition of spellbinding cinema. Trancelike. A1 example of how you reveal information to an audience and keep mystery of character motivations up your sleeve until the exact right moment to play. And, and it's a big AND, when those mysteries are revealed, they actually work, big time, and flat knock you out.
Unreal performance by 90s freaky boy all-star Elias Koteas - honestly a miracle that a performance this tender and volatile could exist. The ultimate narrator of not only the Gentlemen's Club, but the film and in turn, us, the viewer. This has been one of my favorite old dusty DVD's for years, but the new Criterion blu is impeccable. I don't know if I can call it underrated anymore since they put it out, but it's still definitely underseen.",5.0
"A unique film that plays by it's own rules, and it's hard to not adore that. Whether it's the uncompromising camera moves, the lack of information given for an extended period of time, the bombastically personal yet forthright performances, the odd choices in music that is almost never erotic (aside from good ol' Leonard), editing that is seamless by weaving memories and reality; it's a fascinating picture I already can't wait to revisit. I'm [almost] positive this will be more rewarding on a re-watch, yet, Egoyan knows that films can exist on many layers, and doesn't do anything to damper the initial viewing of his emotionally driven puzzle. I wasn't aptly prepared when I saw The Sweet Hereafter, but now I'm ready to dive deep.
I have recently been fascinated with many subjects tackled here, both in the art I'm trying to create, and the art I'm consuming. The idea of this being all about trauma and how we deal (rather, don't deal) with it, isn't even clear until about halfway through, if not further. Egoyan never treats the audience like it's watching a movie, instead, he's dropping you into a pivotal moment in these people's lives, and the importance of this time isn't revealed until it's already happening. We really only learn a lot about Francis, but through Francis, we learn about our whole slew of character's because, it's a small world after all, and traumatic events always effects many individuals. Christine is the object of desire, and it may be so because she remains so mysterious throughout the entirety of the film.
The film occasionally borders on overt sentimentality, or going too deep into a noir-ish plot line, and sometimes even tipping toward TV movie quality, yet Egoyan always exert a control, and manages instead to stay on the positive side of all these divided lines. The story just breathes and unloads information as if it was nothing new to these completely fleshed out and lived in characters. It has a dreamy, quality that is perfect to emphasize the memory hook of this visual medium. Egoyan understands that film's magical quality is in it's ability to bend time, and he uses every moment to drive-home this beauty. But I must say, the script comes first and foremost in the most awe-inspiring aspects of this always engaging drama about human nature.
That ending will haunt me forever. Without hyperbole, I was in complete disbelief for at least the last five minutes (outside the club til the credits), just in that this is where the movie was always building to, and it felt painfully obvious as it was happening, yet during the journey, I was just a fly on the wall, watching people's lives unfold. The ensemble drama is one of the trickiest sub genres to do efficiently, and Egoyan clearly understood the pure essence of what makes these so appealing.

"Acho que junto com ""Mulholland Drive"" e ""Showgirls"", é dos maiores filmes sobre sedução, sobre a natureza sedutora da imagem. A própria maneira como o Egoyan vai adiando o significado de tudo, vai demorando pra contextualizar cada personagem, diz muito sobre essa abordagem puramente icônica, essa abordagem da imagem pela imagem, da percepção pela percepção. É um filme altamente cognitivo nesse sentido, coisa que ele tenta repetir depois, esse drama que se funda quase que unicamente numa dinâmica de associação de sensações, mas que nunca se compara com o que é realizado aqui. Até porque o drama aqui não é só artifício, como acontece mais tarde, não está ali apenas pra ser pano de fundo sensorial, ele de fato viabiliza narrativamente uma relação encantatória com o mundo.",4.5

"Atom Egoyan's Exotica might seem, on the surface, to be about lust and sex, but nothing could be further from the truth—those aspects are no more than polish over its central themes of grief and isolation. It follows grieving bank auditor Francis Brown, played with quiet intensity by Bruce Greenwood. He seeks emotional comfort from Christina (Mia Kirsher), a flamboyant, almost-snarling sadist dancer at a Toronto strip club which stirs the resentment of Eric (Elias Koteas), her ex-boyfriend and DJ. While the filmmaker is a little too self-conscious in pushing his pretensions too far, it's also strangely captivating and even affecting in places. The inclusion of Leonard Cohen on the soundtrack is furthermore significant to its credit.",3.5

"Perfect movie gets a perfect new restoration from the good people at Criterion, and one that vastly improves upon the initial Canadian Blu-Ray release at that.
But I think what makes Exotica such a perfect movie stems not only from how it portrays the downtown lifestyle in Toronto, but how it doesn't merely see the eroticism of a strip club as merely titillating for the viewer but as a place where people can openly show themselves to be very vulnerable. Whether it be the dancers who striptease for the viewers, or those who pay to watch their favourite dancers, there's always at least one story to come about just from the film's setting and it's also how the greatest tragedies within come about.
Atom Egoyan has never made a better film than this, for it's a film that draws you in the first frame but the more you sit with it, you're finding yourself within a position akin to Bruce Greenwood's Francis as you're continuously watching Mia Kirshner's Christina do her schoolgirl routine in front of you - and when the pieces come together, it all clicks too perfectly.",5.0
"An acquired taste of film. Filled with outré narrative elements and ambiguous , yet mysterious tones. It definitely isn’t for everyone. But it wasn’t what I expected. It’s very ‘seductive’ and I feel as if I’m beating the dead horse with that, but it isn’t as raunchy as it comes across. There’s a deeper layer underneath the exotic world that’s filled with dispiritedness and a melancholic history, within these characters backgrounds. Nothing really comes together until the very last scene; but it’s pretty convincing in the conclusion. For an hour and 40 minutes or so, it felt a bit short. Not sure why, I felt like it could’ve been even more twisted and go into the background of our main characters more. Their ‘hurt’ and their self pity , as a deeper narrative element for the rest of the film. The hidden facts leave this mysterious tone , that fits perfectly with the club that most of the film takes place in. I think it’s something thats so close to being a masterpiece with a little more darkness put into it , and the chance to see that on the big screen. I wasn’t sure how to feel in the end, sad? Angry?  
All I know is it was an enjoyable film, but there’s much to ponder on. The soundtrack is super neat as well.",5.0

"(If anyone would like to know - I'm currently doing research for my next video, which is about films about stripping - hopefully that explains the rampant reviews)
This is a gorgeous film. Egoyan's insistence on slowly unfolding the plot, like a striptease, demonstrates his trust in the audience. He's completely unafraid of making you dislike his film for a little bit. By the midpoint, having no idea what was going on between our protagonist, the schoolgirl-costumed stripper, and the young girl he drives home each night - I was starting to think it might take a bit of a perverse route. But as the layers of the plot begin to shed in the final act, you start putting the pieces of the puzzle together and realize that this is a study of pain and human co-dependence.
Unlike the rest of the films on my list, Egoyan is the only director who seems to understand the emotionality of stripping AND the artistry behind it. He casts an empathetic look on strippers, strip club owners, the DJs, as well as the patrons. Every single character has moments of beauty and moments of darkness. This is a deeply human movie - and I'm proud that it's Canadian :) I'm interested to hear other people's takes on it - so go watch!",5.0

Question…why is EXOTICA so rarely seen on anyone's ""Top 10 Movies of 1994"" list? Kicking myself for not catching this one earlier, had no idea what I was missing. Disguised and advertised as a seedy sexploitation thriller, the level of depth it contains is almost staggeringly unexpected.
The storytelling is brilliant in its ability to make each character seem shady and dubious, only to slowly reveal their vulnerabilities and emotional crutches, transforming our view of them from suspicious to sympathetic. There's a constant theme of systematic rituals, exchanges, and coping mechanisms, all entwining a group of individuals who begin the film with seemingly no reason to ever really know one another.
The thesis of EXOTICA is neutralizing life's losses by substitution. Emotionally, these characters have something taken away from them; whether it be a wife, a child, a girlfriend, a childhood, or an exotic bird's egg, these losses are responsible for creating holes that need to be filled. We find ways to patch these holes by filling it with the illusion of what was once there.
Cristina replaces Francis's daughter, and simultaneously, he proves to be the father figure she's presumably never had. Francis's niece, Tracey, ""babysits"" his empty house, both replacing Cristina's previous role as the babysitter, and keeping alive the memory of his late daughter. Eric settles as a strip club DJ job in lieu of working in the radio business; he views Cristina from afar in his booth and up close through two-way glass to assuage the fact he was unable to maintain his relationship with her.

Meanwhile, Francis is sent to audit Thomas's unscrupulous business practices, but promises to look the other way if he'll help him bridge the recently formed gap with Christina—a gap thanks to Eric's jealousy driven abutting.
Then again, I wonder if Eric's motives were entirely manifested from envy, or if he actually intended to ""heal"" both Christina and Francis, realizing that their simple methods of coping were blooming into unhealthy obsessions. Just a crazy movie that's so, so much more intricate than it appears on the surface but never settles for cheap or unearned thrills. Plus, the music is absolutely righteous.",4.0
"""You have to ask yourself what brought the person to this point. What was seen in his face, his manner, that channeled him here? You have to convince yourself that this person has something hidden that you have to find. Check his bags. But it's his face, his gestures that you're really watching.""
When you get out of bed in the morning, you have no idea what the world is going to hit you with. Existence is a neverending enigma. Which is to say that other people are a neverending enigma - whether they're strangers to you or your closest friend.
Or your self.
Exotica inserts you into its world with the same lack of ceremony as any given day in your life. There's no instruction manual to a place, a person, a time. Stuff just happens and some of that stuff happens because you make it happen. Some stuff happens as a reaction to you. Some stuff hits you out of nowhere, and you're just the poor random slob who happened to get in its way at the exact moment it was streaking through reality.
You know that satisfying click when something slots into place? Exotica was the decisive connection into the art of Egoyan for me. If you find comfort in categorisation (and who doesn't from time to time?), it's best to think of Egoyan's films as mysteries. But the mysteries are the characters rather than the plot - or at least, the plot only coheres as a consequence of the characters, and who they really are, and what has really happened to them before we stumbled into the narrative.
It doesn't feel much like Egoyan is helping us find our way through Exotica at all for the first half hour but, eventually, you realise there is an oblique navigational force guiding us dimly towards some revelatory event. The Gauguin decor of the club and the sexual theatre in media res is an erotic thriller veneer, but Exotica is about the tectonic emotional currents which flow within and beneath all eroticism.
The resolution of this narrative mirrors the coming to terms of any given day in your life. By the end of it, things are just as fucked up as you feared they were as you came to foggy consciousness at the dawning of the day. Maybe they're even more tragic than that. And yet somehow that's OK. And when I say it's OK, I mean it's all you got. The world is as existentially terrifying as you thought, but your existence is affirmed.

"“Your dad told me about you not wanting to babysit anymore.” “There’s no baby to sit.” Surely among the most stunningly assembled films ever made; a dense, seductively withholding tapestry of misplaced desires, open wounds, private rituals, and borrowed roles, its initial act’s polyphonic inscrutability transforming into something emotionally overwhelming the more clear the rules of each player’s game become. “Everybody knows,” Cohen sings during Christina’s dance, even though we all go about telling ourselves the lies that help us live; the way each of Egoyan’s shattered characters knows how flimsy their little game is, how far they are from ever really being able to get whatever it is they want, and yet how helpless they are to keep on tricking themselves that what they’re doing might help enough. “We’re here to entertain,” Zoe tries to explain to Francis, “not to heal. There are other places for that.” But not even she, from her panopticonic space of all-seeing power, knows all the sad, strange ways everyone in her orbit is bound to one another; money circulating between hands like some omnipresent reminder of the ways they wish they could touch one another more meaningfully but don’t know how. “When your image of yourself is so fragile,” Egoyan explained in an interview, “part of what you think you don’t have in your own identity comes from what someone else projects back to you.” Ghosts of unbroken selves, the taste of satisfied emotional cravings, losses that at least for a moment feel like they never happened; what even a handsome young stranger’s shared armrest during a ballet performance, or a bit of misplaced paternal affection, can give that no amount of therapy could find. “Do you ever feel like you need a friend?” “Yeah, sometimes.”",5.0

"A man so distraught he frequents a strip club so he can wallow in both pleasure and self-punishment. A strip club that is kinky but not too kinky. Bruce Greenwood is the customer, he once had a wife and daughter but is now lost in a vortex of self-loathing. Mia Kirshner is the brunette stripper of estimable intelligence and self-amused tease. On a perch is Elias Koteas overlooking everybody as the club’s deejay, he seemed to have once had a nice relationship with the stripper. And there are other characters played by Don McKellar, Sarah Polley, Victor Garber. This is a hyperlink movie, one where writer-director Atom Egoyan deliberately uses the whole running time to disperse scant clues from these peoples’ past tragedies, guilt complexes, connections, and we see at the end how they are all caught to one another in a web.
I saw this 1995 film a long time ago and rated it much higher than I am now. Exotica is still very much worth watching, but it’s something of a ruse to make us believe that it is leading to a place far more provocative than it actually does.

"A deeply affecting, singularly introspective journey through trauma/loss/grief bolstered by Egoyan's masterful dose of misdirection put forth by the titular decaying gentleman's club. What was once a nigh-majestic inner city staple has been relegated to an almost sanitized version of its former self: a place of refuge for these three dejected individuals with both a shared past and inability to press on due to their mysterious codependent behaviors. The beauty's in the details and this plays everything very close to its chest, allowing us to witness these people as they are despite their muddied intentions and feeding us vital exposition piecemeal to maintain an air of mystery that devastatingly unfolds when the timing's just right. One of the absolute best explorations of theme and looming catharsis I'd slept on for far too long.",5.0

melding grief to an erotic mystery subdued by haunting voyeurism and inward-folding emotional damage conjures and interesting, alluring atmosphere, patched together by desire for the pleasure of escapism and tragedy-traversing above all-else, and exploring the exoticism of illusory life that can and will mask the harshness of proposed reality. deeply emotional, Exotica’s pensive demeanor is excellently depicted, executed, and amplified by Egoyan’s ever-thickening plot structure, entwining familiarity and unfamiliarity together as one with more emphasis on character and less on exposition, unfolding naturally with delicacy and precision, and subverting fallacious assumptions for a binding experience worth letting the heart take a few punches for.

"(I guess I never really write review-type reviews, so here’s a rare one from me on Exotica, posted earlier today via instagram, ft. some choice stills from the film)
My movie of the year isn’t a movie from this year, but one from 1994…discovered while I was laid up with health problems last spring via Criterion Channel. 
A film that is primarily about grief and loss, but one that also says so much about patriarchal values, cultural appropriation, abuse, and other american demons, without ever explicitly mentioning any of those themes. 
On the surface, at first glance (and certainly in terms of how it was blindly marketed in the states by m*ramax), it’s the story of a strip club - its owner, its master of ceremonies, and its featured “schoolgirl” stripper; a tax auditor; and a pet shop owner. But all of these characters are orbiting a powerful reckoning with the sudden loss of two Black women - mother and daughter - and the shattered lives left behind. Again, it says so much without saying much at all. 
Atom Egoyan’s incredible work as director and screenwriter are accentuated by brilliant, achingly wounded performances from the whole cast, but especially Mia Kirshner, Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, and Egoyan’s partner Arsinée Khanjian. The incredible score from Mychael Danna - featuring such evocative use of the duduk (from Egoyan & Khanjian’s native Armenia) - works perfectly on both an obvious mood music level for a movie called “Exotica” and a deeper subtextual level as a commentary on the “culture vulture” collecting of western (white) colonialism, which reached its peak zenith in the ~listening to Enya, let’s save the rainforest~ early 90s yuppie prosperity boom during which the film was released. 
And just when you think it can’t get any more powerful, the film closes with a haunting parting scene, featuring the absolute BEST EVER cinematic performance from a cat. 
It’s now one of my all-time top ten favorite films (likely to jump into my letterboxd top four before the year is over) and watching it made me a lifelong Atom Egoyan fan. Still streaming on Criterion if you haven’t seen it. Exotica. 🌴",5.0
"I feel good tonight. 
In a way that isn’t willfully dismissive of the problems of my life, which is usually what it takes for me to feel good these days. Biting into the first of two hickory burgers at the Apple Pan. Thumbing through racks of clearance CDs to find that Veruca Salt album that keeps eluding me. Lost in the moment of pure songwriting inspiration. Rushing down a highway with my phone on video record, and something like Kiss It Better or willow playing loud. Finding out that too cute girl in Canada actually thinks I’m cute too, and flirting all night long until dawn. 
No, this is different. I feel my problems right here with me. They’re not going anywhere tonight, but I feel good.

Do I search for you in places you’ve been, that you may never be again. 
Do I write about you and think about you and
      vaguely        talk about you in public.
Do I long for your fingers.
Why do I seek you out? Still, even now? 
Even after you destroyed me? Left, then punished me for missing you? Loved, but lied, then went silent? 
Why do I seek you out? 
Because my blood is still hot and screaming for you?
Like bad cgi volcano lava (not in this movie)
Like the banshee shriek of a just-revealed witch (not in this movie) 
Like a half-empty sex club       where       all who are there are meant to be there

In the prism of the child she represents: her two “protectors” are no longer there to help, so she’s defenseless against being touched.

Which relates back to the child in her, who can’t simply say, “no”.

"You will keep seeing her every time you close your eyes, but you will never be allowed to touch her again. Not a matter of seduction, but of love and inexhaustible pain, for some things will never come back to the material world, so they can only exist in your mind, immaterially, distant but unbearably felt. The images will keep coming, forever, but the feeling of having their warmth clashing against your skin won't, neither her breath on your neck, her eyes won't be but a reflection of yours. On a lighter approach it could be analyzed as a treaty on cartesian scepticism, or perhaps a metalinguistic commentary on the nature of the media, simultaneously alluring and violently painful, both being inevitably present, but for me it's about trauma, frustration and everlasting love. What it means to miss someone.",4.0
"There was something that I remembered after a long time since I watched Exotica. It was one of the first movies I had watched that left me speechless in every manner. The story told by Atom Egoyan about these group of people who have nothing in common but they are brought together by a connection through a past that have left them scarred in a way.
In its non linear structure of storytelling, Atom Egoyan smoothly reels you with smooth jazz playing in background. We enter a strip club called Exotica, where Francis is a regular visitor for Christina, an exotic dancer dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, give him a private dance. Christina's ex boyfriend Eric watches them everyday with jealousy inspiring within him.
Each story plays out in its form with each character grieving something of their own. Exotica plays a tune that becomes more atmospheric in nature. You don't know how it is all going to play out in the end. It is devastating to watch when it all starts to piece in together.
Francis's past comes to known which has left him with a scar of losses that he had to endure. There is nothing really left for him as he asks his brothers daughter to babysit when there no one to babysit for. He is trying to heal in his own way, his time spent with Christina in the club is part of a dependency they both have for each other.
Atom Egoyan's beauty in telling this story that makes its way through a tragedy that brings in every character together. The presence he resonates through each character that leaves you with an lasting impression for them. It is one of those feeling that it pains you yet you want to feel it inside of you.
Bruce Greenwood's performance as Francis pours in something more soulful in its own tragic way. He is grieving for his loved ones. His moments with Christina reveal more to what it was from the first impression. His desperation that comes in after he is thrown out of the club brings in a deal with Thomas who has his own desires and hidden parts to overcome.
Mia Kirshner as Christina brings in a performance that has its own mystery. She brings in both a sensitive and sensual side to her.
Exotica is a tale that takes its time to reveal what it wants to say and it isn't until the end you are brought in to see. It is one of those movie that leaves you with an lasting impression. It deals with its own desires, tragedy and life. It is sensual at times and yet it makes you pause for a beat when it ends with a streaming silence.
Exotica is Atom Egoyan's masterpiece that makes the storytelling so exquisite to watch on the screen. It bring in a melancholy through its characters which incredibly performed by everyone. It is a beauty in its own desired telling.",5.0
"Egoyan's peculiar way of crafting dramas is truly unparalleled. He has this incredibly weird approach as he imbues the story with an immense sense of psychology and deep pain as everyone has secrets, everyone has scars and most of all everyone has a turmoil inside which doesn't allow them to be at peace.
In this one he sets the story at a strip club with a rich cast of characters ranging from the owner, to the DJ, to the dancer, to the customer. Everyone has something going on, everyone has a connection to each other and everyone has their pain. What's fascinating is that usually stories about obsession are judgmental, you can truly feel how the film views a characters obsession and looks down on it, but not in here. In here the obsession is desperation and most of all it's co-dependent, not one-sided.
The film doesn't wish to pass judgment on Francis which is what virtually every single other one of its kind would gladly do. Instead his desperation is sought to be understood as the film is seemingly more than anything interested in how sex, pain, desperation and connection intertwine.
Easily an all time great film, I would probably put this in my top 20 if I were to able to ever settle on one. The score is mesmerizing as it creates this almost hypnotic feeling to the film, but what really shines through is the script, the performances and what strict control Egoyan has in every scene. He let's things play out with patience and restraint as interactions develop and emotion grows until it eventually reaches a pulsating extent.
Another film which proves to be incredibly rewarding to sit on and think about, especially if one enjoys reading essays and reviews about it. There's a lot going on in here and I'm definitely marking this one down to be rewatched in a year.",5.0
"Watching such an amazing Canadian film like this makes me so proud. We Canadians do not have enough good content out there and it makes me sad.

"The tension here in the way this uses the knowingly false constraints of hip post-Twin Peaks 90’s deadpan semi-surrealist arthouse drama (or, in this case, the knowingly false walls of a strip club) as a pressure cooker for authentic undiluted Toronto freak shit makes for one of the most potently fucked vibes I’ve ever seen. I think Egoyan overplays his hand once or twice to the point that it starts to border on parody (parroty?), but it’s also probably the most a movie has legitimately upset me in years (nearly had me throwing up by the end), which counts for a lot! Gotta be the least erotic thriller of all time - ostensibly a movie about tax fraud!",4.5

"for three days this film stayed in my mind. all it took was three days, and one rewatch, but I now understand that this is a masterpiece. and I truly want to kick myself for my foolish interpretation of the ending in my previous review. with the other Egoyan films i've watched since, they were both technically-brilliant but they were missing something. not to mention, it felt like they could've gone further with their ideas at times. with Exotica, everything clicks and then some. not one second is wasted, the technique Egoyan utilises shows strong sense of storytelling prowess, and every single emotion and idea hits hard.
the transactional nature of relationships, how people use each other to find something they've either lost, never had, or are looking for. this is, of course, displayed most prominently in the titular strip club. Francis uses both Christina and Tracy as surrogate daughters. Christina uses Francis (and maybe even Eric, in a more disturbing way) as a father figure. Eric and Zoe use Christina for, well...you get the idea (though I'm still a bit confused as to why Zoe makes out with Christina in that one scene). for being a film that deals with eroticism and aesthetics, it's decidedly unsexy. and that, I imagine, is by design. the sleaziness of the strip club ($5 table dances?) is compounded by Elias Koteas's portrayal of Eric, injecting his loser, slimy personality in every line and movement. the character of Thomas has also improved for me on this second watch, as I was a bit unsure of how the film managed to fit him into the overall story at first. on this watch it's clear that he's 100% necessary, and adds to the intrigue and uneasiness created.
as with everything and everyone else here, we're not entirely sure what to make of him initially. Thomas gives off an odd, sorta criminal type of vibe which is again compounded by the additional information that he is a smuggler (he really gives me Darren Criss playing Andrew Cunanan type of energy). and this is one of the many aspects of intrigue that results from Egoyan's storytelling and filmmaking techniques. information is withheld, until it isn't. images mean something, until they mean something else. there's a few standout examples I'd like to discuss, all of which involving one of the story's minor characters: Tracy (Sarah Polley).
1. her introduction. she's in a car with Francis, a much older man. think of where she lives: above a restaurant, in a clearly Black part of town. a muscular Black man walks up towards the car, rap is blaring in the b.g., but he doesn't stop at the car. he just walks by. Francis seems uneasy. we as the audience are uneasy too, but only by the seediness of an older man being in a car with a teenage girl (then again, some watching this scene might be afraid of the Black guy too given the racist stereotypes associated with everything going on here). at first, it would seem that Tracy is a prostitute, and Francis (who we just saw exit the strip club after receiving a dance from Christina) is her client. things get even weirder when it becomes clear that he knows her father, and that the father is aware of their arrangement. it becomes clear later on that Tracy is Francis's niece, and Francis has her housesit for him while he frequents Exotica every night. which brings us to...
2. the scenes involving his brother, and Tracy's father, Harold. there's clearly something that has strained their relationship, but we're not sure. Tracy comes into the picture, and the unease grows...and then later on we learn that Harold was possibly carrying on an affair with Francis's deceased wife. do we believe it? well, context clues. Francis's deceased wife was Black, and they had a mixed-race daughter. what shirts is Harold wearing in each of the two scenes he's in? a Bob Marley shirt, and an anti-apartheid shirt. where does Harold live? in a Black area. seems logical that this affair probably did occur, and maybe Lisa wasn't even Francis's daughter. are we sure? Harold does mention to Tracy that Francis tells himself what he wants to believe....we're not sure what to believe, aren't we?
3. the final scene in which Tracy appears, she genuinely cares about Francis and his state of mind. she knows he's lying to himself, she knows he's in denial, but still goes along with everything. which leads to...
the only people who seem to genuinely care, at first, are the younger ones. Tracy of course, but also Christina. she knows Francis (which we learn in that stunner of an ending) and knows what he seeks out of her. she's seeking something out of him too, but what? it's implied by the ending, and what she says about her own parents, but it's never explicitly told. and i'm thankful for this, because Exotica's greatest attribute is that it's honest about humanity. mainly, what humanity chooses to conceal. it deals with lost people seeking something out of each other. people who have become lost due to grief, or uncertainty about their place in life. even by the end, they might start to recognise this; think Eric and Francis embracing over the ghosts of the past. this is a film that hides details, conceals vital information, because that's how people really are. you don't feel as though you've learned every single thing about these people, nor do you even believe what you've learned about them because who knows if it's true or not. it feels true, it might be mostly true, but is it completely?
films like Exotica are the best part about being a cinephile. you never know what you're gonna get each time you watch a movie, and you may even stumble upon a new way of storytelling that you'd never even considered. choosing to tell a story by NOT providing information, or misleading you by utilising preconceived notions only to flip it all on its head, is just brilliant. that it all manages to come together in the end, culminating in a wave of emotions, makes it all worthwhile.",5.0
"Egoyan picking up and running with the themes of previous films, further plumbing the depths of loss, longing, and interconnection. The narrative is as intricately woven as the atmosphere and editing are seductive and entrancing, and I love how slowly and steadily Egoyan suffuses things with an almost Cronenbergian unease, as if it were being tangibly pumped out and into the Exotica's steamy, jungle-like interior with each pounding of the music's bass. Just slightly, perfectly surreal with the confounding sense of place and details like the ballet being a blatantly obvious cruising spot, all the better to emphasize just how strange it might feel to engage with the world after a traumatic loss has knocked you off your balance.",5.0

"Steve's Priority Watchlist Project
Exotica is only my second Atom Egoyan film, which I put down to the dreadful experience I had with the only other one I'd seen, Calendar, several years ago.
Even so, Exotica's been on my radar for so long that I should have watched it before I'd seen anything else by him anyway. I remember Empire talking a lot about it around its release but I also don't remember it ever having a run on Sky Movies, which I would at least have recorded it off and probably never watched it.
It took me a while to get in to. There's a mighty juggling of characters almost right from the off from Egoyan, not to mention the startlingly no-nonsense performance from Mia Kirshner. Normally I'd start to get impatient when any film is presenting several different subplots and relationships and not making any real attempt to link them together.
It wasn't that I gave Exotica a pass on that front, more that it always felt like Egoyan had everything under control here. This is a supremely self-assured piece of filmmaking. A director who has fully formed ideas about everyone and their situations here, backed by a cast fully invested in their roles and, especially so in Kirshner's case, never taking a backward step in their commitment.
A processing of the complexity of the grieving process and the relationships you come to rely on to help you through and maybe one day emerge on the other side, Exotica hasn't got nearly as much on its mind as I thought early on. I say that in a praising way though, as Egoyan pulls together the threads near the end very well for an interesting and plausible ending.
Perhaps the most impressive side to Exotica is that despite the very downbeat nature to so much of what we see here is how gentle and strangely sweet this is in places. Perhaps even in a challenging way. Almost all of it is impressive though, so there's also that.",4.0
"Sometimes he has to wait for her, and sometimes she's waiting for him, to protect him. She's his angel.
There's a moment in Paris, Texas where Harry Dean Stanton's character - Travis - sits longingly beside a pane of one-way glass. The pain, desire, and eventual catharsis that result from his conversation with Jane is perhaps the most beautiful scene I've ever seen in cinema. It's full of regrets - would have saids and should have dones - and desire; desire to make it right, desire to make another understand, desire to simply exist in another person's presence even if just for a short while.
I couldn't get this feeling out of my chest while watching Exotica. Not the would have saids and should have dones. No. Just the aching pain and need to rectify a life in shambles. It's a need for life to go back to the way things were. And, it is through the ways that the main character - Francis - desperately attempts to reshape this fallen sandcastle that Exotica reveals its greatest triumphs. This, like Paris, Texas, is a film that starts with anonymity only to reveal genuine intimacy. It's a film where emotions mournfully waft between lonely people longing while looking in each other's eyes for things to go back to the way they once were. It's also a film where comfort comes in the strangest forms and the need for feeling overrides reason.
Like Paris, Texas, I have a feeling Exotica will only prove more impressive on re-watches. But, for now, Exotica is a 4.5/5.",4.5
"Now watching it a second time, it becomes so much clearer how expertly Egoyan distributes drips of information solely through form. Practically every detail given here is told through the language of filmmaking, and any viewer has to be attune to these methods to really get the full impact of Exotica. I know I wasn’t when I first watched this about three years ago and appreciated its mood more than I necessarily enjoyed the film. This time around, now much more familiar with Egoyan’s inimitable craft, it’s incredible how tightly put together this whole experience is. Now knowing who these characters are, where they’ve been and where they will go, it’s fascinating how Egoyan initially presents them as different—often more sinister—people, before deftly changing our perspective of them. We think to head down one path, and he gently guides us down a different one. What’s even more impressive is that he never veers from this method at any point. Even the incredible ending only works if you’ve been on the same wavelength as the film. Watching it the first time, it felt so horrifically sinister but I remember sort of panicking that I’d missed something important. But when you watch the film again, you realise nothing is ever explicitly stated. It’s all in the pores of the face, the cracks in the walls, and Egoyan is just there to be conductor to our own personal orchestra. We take the notes wherever we choose, but he’s always in control.",4.0
"1st rewatch --- Exotica has been my favorite movie discovery of last year. The movie's imagery, music, and tone haven't escaped my mind since I initially watched it. Emma's recent review reminded me how badly I needed to rewatch it. I'm glad I did. Because I liked it even more this time.
Geoff Brown from The Times described the film as ""Sexy, funny, mesmerising"". While I fully agree with ""mesmerising"" I can not agree with the other descriptions to a full extent. Even though the movie is mostly set in a stip-club it isn't very titillating. The circumstances surrounding the characters are too dark, depressing, and sad.
There are certainly some funny lines in the film. Especially during the scenes that deal with the character Thomas. But for the most part, the movie is very cold. Everybody feels lonely and stuck in their current state of being.
The scenes on the field are intercut with the main-narrative with such precision that they archive the optimal effect. Brilliant.
Highly recommended.",5.0
"A group of people splintered by tragedy swirl around one another, trying and failing to reconnect. But are they really trying, or are they using one another to try and return to an earlier, simpler self, to imagine a happier version of their present instead of dealing with the one they have? Everyone is a stand-in for someone else, a substitute for who, or what, they're missing; Tracey recreates Francis' routine with Christina, in the process acting like a proxy for his daughter, Thomas becomes a person for Christina to talk to, a willing ear that isn't just interested in controlling her body, Zoe's ownership of the club makes her a surrogate for her own mother, as she lives out a dream that isn't her own but that gives her an excuse to not think about what she actually wants, Christina's unattainability gives Eric something to focus on other than his own inertia, and everyone plays some part in Francis' play version of reality, one where his home isn't just an empty reminder of all he's lost. Yet none of the puzzle pieces fit quite right; Tracey is weirded out by her uncle, Thomas only listens to Christina to try and escape his own legal trouble, Zoe is ambivalent about the club, Christina wants nothing to do with Eric, and Francis never outruns his all-consuming emptiness; the self-centered projections we put on others are dead ends, poor replacements for real connection. No wonder they're all drawn to a strip club, the ultimate half-baked reproduction, the sex drive reduced to an an emotionless call and response, a material exchange where there should be a flame. ""Don't you think you deserve to do something to feel like someone special?"", Eric asks the club's customers, implying, of course, that they aren't special now, and that only that fragment that's just out of reach (a dance, a touch, a smile) can fulfill them. If only it were that simple; if only that intangible something really could be bought. Even if it could, though, another person could never perfectly fill the holes within us, just as a video tape of a lost loved one will never bring them back, no matter how many times we watch it. Grief delayed only grows, and the future will never fulfill our deepest fantasies; it always becomes the present before it can.",4.0

Words that I could put on here would not be enough to describe the impact I felt from Exotica. I had finished watching it less than twenty minutes ago, and I want the effect that the movie left me with to last just a bit longer. Although I'm sharing a link to one of Roger Ebert's ""Great Movies"" reviews as I usually do, I had yet to read either that review or the one he did upon his first viewing of the same film. I want time with my own thoughts on this one, yet I am compelled to share my immediate reaction. At the risk of hyping it up too much for anyone who hasn't seen Exotica, I must express from my mind and gut that I had stumbled upon a bona-fide great movie. From its opening credits, I picked up that this is a measuredly paced movie. It watches carefully, and it asks us to do the same.

Yesterday, I had my first viewing of a very different kind of mystery-drama by the name of Identity, a 2003 picture directed by James Mangold. I enjoyed it for what it is: a Hollywood thriller. It had atmosphere, some spooks, and a twist that was a surprise to me yet admittedly more unintentionally humorous than haunting in the case of that movie. Exotica is something deeper, more grounded, and heartbreaking. We as observers are tasked by this movie to observe the human subjects as they yearn, or grieve, or hurt, or comfort. I can imagine some viewers being turned off by the pacing, how it would seem to be taking so long to get going. Much talking takes place, but so much more is left being unsaid for so long. Everything comes together soon enough yet late in the narrative, and it works wonders here. The film has a profound emotional impact which left me blinking with tears before the end credits came. After I have enough time to sit with my feelings for Exotica, I want to read about it, watch the features on the Criterion Channel, read plenty of insightful reviews, and finally watch the whole thing again with the knowledge I have about its deep secrets from the heart.",4.5
"Exotica is one of the most mesmerizing and hypnotizing psychosexual thrillers I have ever seen. Booming 90s club music plays in a dimly and mysterious strip club, disjointed flashbacks provide all the context we need while withdrawning the audience from knowing too much, and characters deeply longing for the almost taboo are what’s in place here and I am so shocked how much I loved this. So much is said about love beyond what is at the surface level and I think while much of the film was in an erotic location, there was a deep kind of love that was much different than that or romantic love and that is all I will say. Please watch this!",5.0
"At the very start, in a scene that’s narratively innocuous but thematically potent, we are told to study faces, to look at body language. That’s how to read a person, that’s how to know what they are hiding. The rest of the film presents people to us as they are, not introduced for the purposes of a narrative but part way through their own narrative arcs. Everything is mystery but all feels very real. 
The film deftly overlaps perspectives, three really (arguably four), until they all come together. It sounds contrived but it feels natural and effortless, a motivated confluence that is never overly convenient. It’s aided by the confident filmmaking, a film defined by overlapping editing as sound bleeds from one scene to the next and even the soundtrack meshes together as a cohesive piece. Disparate movements with overlapping instrumentation. A persistent leering rhythm that fuses it all together, pushing the idea of some sinister or seedy connection. 
It’s an uncanny feeling. The characters are secretive but not necessarily withholding. Some are perhaps too open, it is just that we find out pasts naturally. It all fits together and the context unveils itself when it needs to. Information clarifies what came before and shapes what is to come; the film has a sense of perpetual motion, even when it goes into the past it it feels like it’s in a tragic, fated sequence. Fated is the right word, though this is a portrait of late 20th century society — a critical one tied up with fin de siecle angst and uncertainty — it feels classical, like Greek tragedy. A biting and overtly filmic language with the confident heft of literature. A bit Ballardian, a touch of McEwan. 
All orbits around a strip club, presenting sexualisation as a nexus point in a sexualised society. As so much is about repressed emotion and carrying on in silence, this space of the strip club becomes a space of masculine emotional expression. The film presents this gender coded inability to seek real help or open up, and how places that shouldn’t play this role end up as therapeutic outlets. It is a spiral of unhealthy behaviours and loaded encounters. It’s paralleled with unspoken hookups at the opera, tying ‘high’ culture to ‘low’ culture and presenting a broad tapestry of repression.
We do build to revelation but it doesn’t feel like the point. More is left unsaid and implied, a cathartic end but with more to happen for all our players. It is more that the pieces have come together and the theme of spectatorship is over. We’ve watched faces enough, divined body language enough, we’ve speculated as to what is going on enough. The film stops and the narrative with it but lives continue. This is but a short period in which so few reveal so much. There is depth and pain everywhere, it may start in the face but observation can only lead us to knowledge. This lengthens process where we spend time, that can lead to understanding.",5.0
"4K restoration
Most of this movie is very vague, to a point where it creates an aura of mystery that surrounds the titular strip club. But even with the setting of the movie, Exotica does not particularly feel erotic - instead it seems like Egoyan is taking the seedy nature of this setting and making it almost a home for lost souls. All this is evident by the way that its characters interact with one another, going from their own dependencies to the personal tragedies that they encounter in their own life.
But the way every piece of this puzzle comes together, especially in its ending, unveils another layer of tragedy. The least that can be said, is that its final revelations only recontextualize everything in the past, only invoking something much sadder. One of the greatest films of the 1990's.

"Watching this felt like peeling an onion by hand.. I found myself getting weepier at the growing stench of every icky unfolding layer. 
Much like Claire Denis, I love how Egoyan’s style of storytelling often presents you with a simple mystery; the way two people might dissapointingly gaze at one another from across the room of a sad strip club, then set the trickle of information itself to one impossibly glacial striptease. It’s no mistake our main protagonist is an accountant conducting an audit.. In fact, much of the film’s catharsis comes solely from clarifying whatever awful hunch it’s getting at through a few simple lines of exposition. Almost like jotting names down in a form..
I’m so glad the final mystery is left unpeeled.. Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know, the truth taunts you from a closed door down an impossibly long front lawn.",4.5

"Exotica, directed by Atom Egoyan, is a stylish, cryptic, and intriguing film where nothing is what it seems. Right off the bat the movie seems as if it is an erotically charged thriller, yet it is anything but that. The characters in this film use sexuality to mask deep pain, trauma and hurt. It is difficult at first determining how the characters know each other or are related. The film gradually reveals its secrets until the final epiphany at the end which packs an emotional wallop. This movie is brilliantly atmospheric and uses bold colors such as green, red, and blue to set the tone of the movie. This is definitely a film I want to revisit in the future as I suspect it will offer up more rewards upon multiple viewings.",4.0
"Edit: This movie impacted me so deeply that I have returned here to give it 5 stars, which for me is quite a big deal. I'm going to rewrite my rating criteria as a response to this occurrence (which I have not felt compelled to do since I established my guidelines / terms back in 2013), so, I do not say it lightly: Exotica is one of the rarest of films that quite literally Changes Things.
---
“To know more is to forgive more.”
I have been waiting to see Exotica for years. Since I started reading Ebert reviews religiously back in 2013, I kept a film diary of his Great Movies list & was determined to see them all eventually (as I am sure is a common cinephile pursuit), but Exotica always stood out on the list. Then I couldn’t find it anywhere, never had. Not available to rent, not on any platform, couldn’t even locate it to buy it. And so, years went by, and I’d remember the title randomly, and wonder: Will I ever watch it? An odd occurrence, really, because I knew nothing about it other than the name and its place in Ebert’s canon.
Then, I needed a copy of The Firemen’s Ball, and E suggested Criterion’s channel. And there it was. I subscribed immediately—for Exotica. I felt hesitant, suddenly, like now I could see it, but should I? It’s covered in strange memories & an unusual magnetism that I wasn’t certain I wanted to unravel. But of course ... it’s just a movie. Silly to put it off now when, well, there it is. Waiting.
Exotica is the first movie I’ve ever seen that I immediately wanted to start over as soon as it ended. The final moment gently forces you to rethink every impression that preceded it, and I felt acutely stunned at how successfully it accomplishes reflection. No doubt in my mind that a second viewing would be like watching a totally different film altogether, yet still within the same walls. Deeply intricate. A slow burn whose heat sets the entire house on fire the second the credits roll.
I read both of Ebert’s reviews afterwards, and he ended the later one with the quotation I included here. To know more is to forgive more. Exotica embodies this truth with such palpable nuance and potency that it left me nearly speechless. I think all my words are somewhere far from me now, slip, slip, slipped away. Out of reach.",5.0
"Not the erotic thriller you might be expecting, but rather an exploration of broken people living a disconnected existence, all within the confines and proximity of a strip club. If Exotica had jokes, I’d be tempted to call it Bojack Personman. It’s the type of film that purposely never lets you in, and yet remains a soothing exposure of our own vulnerabilities. Getting to know someone without really knowing them, as the film might say.
Other than vague strokes of nonlinearity and an uncomfortable atmosphere, I’m not convinced that this deserves the labeling of Lynchian. David Lynch  and Atom Egoyan (yes, that’s really the name of the director of Exotica) have such a unique vision while, granted, exploring similar themes that I feel it’s a disservice to lump them together as though their eccentrities stem from the same well of crazy. It’s like calling anything with a tentacle Lovecraftian. It’s an oversimplification of what’s really happening.
No offense intended to any friends who called this Lynchian. 😅",4.0
"Exotica may first come across as an erotic thriller, but soon shows itself to tread similar waters as late Kubrick and Lynch by mixing sexual obsession with loss, abuse, and the pursuit of human connection, all through its oneric lens. Reality is filtered through its sultry aesthetic, that until the final scene takes a significant turn, as the film delivers an emotional gut punch that recontextualizes everything I thought I knew and was there in front of me all along.
Plot twists were becoming a popular narrative tool in the 1990's and 2000's, but seldom succeeded. Where films like The Usual Suspects fell short thematically, Exotica delivers, as it properly integrates such a rhetorical tool to reinforce the weight of its ideas.",4.5
"The film begins with entrancing music and green credit text atop slowly panning foliage. This same entrancing score and luscious greens flow throughout the runtime. Hearing this unique style of score reminds me of something that David Lynch said about how the music and sound design is even more important to establish the mood. The wrong music can kill a scene or an entire movie. The score in Exotica is exotic, like a journey of mystery and meditation. I had to get the soundtrack immediately after watching. There's even a chilling moment when a character plays an instrument that fits with the score.
When mystery comes to mind, I don't think of anything like this, perhaps because few mysteries like this exist. I typically think of someone solving a mystery. Instead this is a mystery that unfolds with no detective or sleuth. The lives of all these people are somehow mysteriously intertwined and all involve a strip club called Exotica. For many people like me, strip clubs are a sort of mysterious place. What the hell exactly goes on in there? Besides the obvious. There's a lot more that goes on, and each character has different reasons for either working there or going there regularly. Men typically go there to watch women, the women who work there watch how the men react, but others watch everyone. Just remember, someone's always watching.
Exotic birds, exotic dancers, exotic baby grand piano. There's one mystery of how everything comes together but each character also has their own mystery. Whatever impression you think when you think how strip clubs are depicted in films, think again. You will get none of that, but you will find one of the most profound, mysterious, and sentimental stories of a lifetime. The story is also structured in such a satisfying way that unravels each and every little mystery with perfection.

"The film opens with a view through a one-way mirror, a shot which seems to perfectly encapsulate it's elliptical, illusive structure.
Egoyan's Exotica moves like music, cutting between multiple narratives, characters and moods with a sense of dreamlike clarity. Every action, every encounter begins as a mystery, and yet as Egoyan slowly chips away at his lonely, broken characters, we see the film's multiple threads converge and reveal themselves as one sad, tangled web of damaged people, trapped by their mutual co-dependence. It's a balancing act which Egoyan somehow pulls off; kind of crazy to see how far he seems to have fallen.
And man, that final shot is special and haunting in a way only cinema can evoke. One of the best films of the 90's.",0.0

"With its setting and mood, Atom Egoyan´s “Exotica” has the appearance of a sleazy 90s erotic thriller but if you look deeper, you see that any eroticism in this film is drenched in melancholy and instead of sleaze you get a profound contemplation on the human experience. It´s a hypnotic, tender, and subtly heart-wrenching drama consisting of multiple character studies of complex, tortured souls, who are all linked together in ways that are only slowly revealed. The film is a labyrinthian mystery mood piece that has some dreamlike Lynchian vibes without ever crossing the line to fully weird and surreal. The plot is cryptic but grounded in reality and it´s very rewarding how everything comes together in the end. Bruce Greenwood and Mia Kirshner both deliver vulnerable, layered, and affecting performances. So much is said between their characters without words, their sexually charged interactions being a coping mechanism to deal with grief, guilt, loneliness, and pain. It´s a charade with the purpose of healing together. A deep sadness permeates the film but also a deep kindness. “Exotica” is a movie about human connection and its impact in many different forms. A mesmerizing, empathetic, and bittersweet gem of Canadian cinema.",4.0

Film Recommendation #47 – from Lexi Amoriello
AVN Award winner for ""Best Alternative Adult Film"" and nominee for ""Best All-Girl Sex Scene"" – yes, really – Atom Egoyan's Exotica is of course much more than boobies and strippers, but I like those things so thank you for the recommendation, Lexi.
It's also a strange and thrilling film, with something of a beguiling narrative a la David Lynch, but with a vibe of its own, a dreamlike psychological ride of obsession and mania in a slow-burn of desire and loss.
At the high-end Toronto strip club called Exotica run by owner Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), DJ Eric (Elias Koteas) introduces the lovely ladies who dance for their clients and fans. A particular star named Christina (Mia Kirshner) wows the crowd with a ""schoolgirl"" routine, and regular customer Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood) receives private sessions. The tax auditor soon has a directive to audit an exotic pet store owned by Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), whose financial records have proved curious and worth investigating.
But this soft-spoken government employee harbors deep trauma and emotional pain, with the strip club visits just one outlet for them. Another is a close relationship with Harold's (Victor Garber) teenage daughter Tracey (Sarah Polley), peculiar as the man has no children and actually pays the girl to ""babysit"" while he's out of the home. She sits and plays his piano, then is driven home. It's just one of several strained relationships here, built from and defined by grief, obsession, detachment, and fear.
I'm glad I went into this completely blind, but that summary isn't much of a spoiler, so no worries. Egoyan built his suspenseful mystery like a striptease, with layers peeled off tantalizingly and with a precise manner and order, though not always how you expect them to be. Rest assured, as more is revealed, it's all a means to an end, a therapeutic process of mitigating suppression.
Some characters are first made to be manipulative but come to be seen as merely wounded. Others are seemingly empathic but soon are found to be treacherous. Exotica, like the best Lynch films, invites multiple watches to see where those changes occur and how you didn't notice them the first time. Something of a hyperlink movie, though not as abstract or purposefully mysterious as some of the more notable examples of that sub-genre, this instead doesn't aim for tricks or shocking twists but interconnectedness and mutual emotion. Brief flashbacks begin to unearth what might be at play, but it doesn't become clear until the unforgettable finale.
Hurt people hurt people, and underneath that hurt is a desire to heal but reluctance to come to terms with what it means. So, they wear veneers and put up facades, and despite being close in proximity they're actually quite distant, yet also desperately co-dependent. The brilliant score from Mychael Danna at times seems to be the only thing keeping them together.
The juggling of characters and timelines can be tricky, and not for everyone – especially those with little patience – but I was entranced by the drama and pulsing moments when the masks are torn off, even just a little. Mesmerizing stuff. One of the best films about loneliness I've seen.
You can always confide in me. At least, that's what I always told myself.

Did the commentary track with Atom & the brilliant composer Mychael Danna, whose score for this film I’ve decided is my favorite score of all time! Just wanna note three things:
- Atom: “[The characters] know what has happened to them, but they haven’t fully absorbed the levels at which that’s, you know, affected them.”
- Mychael spends the commentary trolling Atom for the film’s many appearances of parrots and interrupts their otherwise deep conversation about loss and desire and trauma to say, “parrot” every time a parrot appears onscreen.

"✨ 201. review ✨

Exotica is a strip club in Atom Egoyan's first, more popular feature. But what happens in the heated, lush, imaginary space of Exotica, between the jungle painted on the wall and some stunted ficus and plastic shells, has little to do with eroticism in the usual sense. Or does it? We see a lap dance to a song of Leonard Cohen (!) that is supposed to be erotic, in which the man is obviously traumatised, psychotic, and the woman is emotionally involved. Where is the eroticism? Where is the sex?
When the demigod MC of the grove of profane nymphs and semi-excited men, hardly bucolic, in a soothing voice demands payment from the participants of this strange seance, the purpose of the gathering is to repair and rebuild the men's self-confidence. The owner of the bar, Zoe, makes a sharp distinction between this and healing. Oh yes, men's self-confidence problems can be cured by the support of women or a little sexual titillation, but where there is healing, there are also illness, trauma and untreatable complications. And they are, despite all the precautions taken by Zoe and the mellifluous, magical, but wickedly petty MC. The jungle of Exotica is in fact the Midsummer Night's Dream, where a few people are connected by substitutions and exchanges, and where everyone is hiding something. Because eroticism, as I understand it, differs from pornography precisely in that it is a mystery of concealment and substitution that manifests itself on a thousand surfaces without the need for a body. In this sense, the film is erotic because it is about people's desire for each other, but this desire is never directed at the right object. Christine is only a substitute for the object of desire for Francis, as is his brother's daughter, and the substitutions are paid for by the exchange that triggers the real contact. Yet somehow no one questions the appropriateness of substituting a woman dressed as a schoolgirl for one's dead daughter. The final scene of the film is a flashback that explains the strange relationship between Francis and Christine: but it does not explain why the relationship is so strange. The film is all about transference, substitution, secrecy and concealment, which contrasts strangely with the nudity. As the story of our heroes comes together at the end of the film, we can sit back in the cinema and relax. Indeed, the disturbing questions come after: does trauma really empower pedophile fantasies? We see that in his gentle, suffering woundedness he will stop at nothing to force the release of desire: he blackmails, he holds a gun, he could kill. So why do we think he is traumatised, why do we think his grief is transparent? But it is not the question of guilt that is most exciting. In a garden of carnivorous plants and exotic birds, the petals of innocence are slowly touching down. Throughout, the film is almost charmingly, amusingly harmless, laced with a subtle, jarring irony that makes its serious themes all the more unsettling: for if at the beginning of the film we thought we knew what eroticism was, looking at Francis we no longer do.",4.5
"Quintessential Canadian cinema; but that wouldn't be enough to talk about everything that Atom Egoyan does so well with Exotica let alone why that also makes it his best film.
Even amidst the seemingly sleazy setting, Egoyan still brings you into a world shrouded in mystery from the way he captures what it's like to be inside the Exotica strip club. Yet it also opens the door for something far more intimate, and deeply tragic - creating a more deeply layered and empathetic masterpiece underneath.
Given the film's setting, there's so little actual eroticism actually being felt on the screen, rather instead the film's seductive nature unveils something incredibly tense. As the small links between each character comes into play, brought together by the circumstances that surround the titular strip club, it only further emphasizes a grave sense of loneliness and despair. It's so incredibly delicate, but seeing how everything comes together just makes the mystery all the more rewarding.
I feel like I'd be repeating myself if I were to say this movie is perfect, but that's just about what it is.",5.0
"Everything isn't what it seems (what can we really tell by looking?) yet motives need no explanation because it is all there. Egoyan has complete control over the film that lingers through couple environments and dozen states of minds. How desperate it starts to feel when we realize that we cannot really touch - we try to search for meaning, for comfort but we cannot really touch or embrace it. Something slips through our hands all the time - yes, just when we are about to reach it.",4.5
"Psychoanalysis, from the layperson's perspective, can probably be broken down into two key elements composing human existence: frailty and perversion. It is these two duelling extremes that feed one another, subsequently lashing out as both the cause and the remedy for all that ails us below the surface; it's the softness of the flesh that drives us (mad) deep beneath its contours. It is therefore only the most incisively perverted filmmakers who can unleash the base mixture of allure and horror that shivers through our bones, but Atom Egoyan, at his best, understands that this distorted purity is at its most effective when presented with a semblance of forlorn distance.
Part of that probably stems from the director's own semi-eroticized proclivity for puzzle-box film structure, but Exotica stands out as the peak of Egoyan's power precisely because that fractured style mirrors the exact sort of personal cracks framed within those narrative pieces. Like The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica mines its quiet aching from a tragedy that shatters a community; only here, the community in question, hardly as overt in its connection, finds itself tighter-knit than ever through the shared pull of the human body. Bodies as mysteries, bodies as answers, bodies as placeholders for what's been lost.
With such a distilled mastery of his melancholic tone, Egoyan sees atmosphere as a distraction—a ruse to keep us from confronting that which sends us drowning in the haze of smoke, whiskey and erotic club music. But Exotica, ever aware of the sham, still finds in its ghostly ambience the space to guide us closer to the desired zone at the crux of the human experience; tragedy begets tragedy, just as carnal longing begets carnal longing. In only one of the many, many Canadian elements comprising Exotica, Atom Egoyan frames his central object of lust around the fuming vocals of Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows."" Everybody knows; everybody knows exactly what the body gives, and what it takes. They can't express it in their own words, but they know...",4.5

"I went into this film knowing almost nothing about it other than it got positive reviews. So I watched it and I didn't exactly know how to feel about what I just saw. For a large portion of it's runtime I felt Exotica was an emotionally detached experience. Though something hit me and after it was over I already wanted to see it again.
Exotica follows four seemingly unrelated storylines: a man sitting alone at a table in a strip club, another man smuggling exotic parrot eggs into the country (Exotica takes place in and around Toronto), two apparent strangers walking in a field of green, and a young girl who plays a flute in an empty house.
Director Atom Egoyan begins with these vastly different puzzle pieces then slowly, inexorably brings them together. The plot is an example of elliptical storytelling in that it moves in a purposeful ever-circling way to slowly reveal the connections between the worlds of each character. There is enough misdirection to keep the viewer wary of their perceptions.
Exotica is first and foremost a director's film and Adam Egoyan's directing is amazing. A director is responsible for both casting and for directing their cast. For Exotica, Egoyan adds so much subtlety and depth to his actors performances. There are many stylish and beautiful camera shots throughout but Egoyan chooses to keep his characters at a distance. The off kilter atmosphere, restrained acting, minimal tight shots, and frequent plot misdirection keeps the viewer from bonding or strongly identifying with the characters.
The main themes explored in Exotica are that of loss (Of loved ones, innocence, youth, opportunities) and trying to connect in a very insular and ultimately unfulfilling way (the grieving father Francis who pays a young girl to babysit his empty house so that he can have the illusion his daughter is still around)
There are also many reoccuring images and symbols that reinforce the emotional isolation of the characters. The use of secret surveillance by two-way mirrors serves both as an invisible yet uncrossable boundary between people who would otherwise be very close to one another and as a way for the characters to make private judgments of those who are being unwittingly observed.
For most of its duration, Exotica presents a primary mystery as a puzzle to be solved, then has one of the main characters, Francis, explain the mystery towards the end; but the questions remain. Do we trust that explanation? Are things that simple? Did Egoyan really want the end to tie up the knots tightly and leave no ambiguity? Despite the revelations I still found the film to be deeply ambiguous and disturbing.
At it's heart, Exotica is a tragedy of circumstances. Or better yet, a collision of tragedies of circumstances. Indeed, the film isn't so much about tragedy as it is about those who survive tragedy and the toll a single event can exact for the rest of the lives of those who survive. The setting Exotica, the gentleman's club, serves merely as a focal point where all these individual tragedies radiate to.
The music by Michael Danna sets the film's tone dark, mysterious, deceptively simple but savvier than it lets on. Also worthy of note is the music in the club itself, a blend of American house funk and Middle Eastern tones, warbled in Arabic. There's memorable usage of the Leonard Cohen song Everybody Knows during one of the dance sequences.
In conclusion, Exotica is a thought provoking examination of grief, regret and lack of connection. The poster and title may give people the impression that this is an erotic thriller in the vain of Basic Instinct though this couldn't be farther from the truth. Exotica is a film that respects it's audiences intelligence and demands repeated viewings. One of the most underappreciated film's of the 1990's and an exceptional example of hyperlink cinema.",5.0

Second viewing, up from 79. Hasn't been that long since I last saw this, and even in that relatively short amount of time, I forgot how finely woven the narrative textile really is. It feels like, by the time the final shot traverses, nearly everyone is somehow connected—physically, emotionally, or otherwise—with the real magic being the way in which Egoyan disseminates these couplings slowly, piece by piece, first revealing a previously unknown person (or persons) without any indication of who they are or how they ""fit in"" right away, causing (or, possibly, allowing) our own imagination to begin splicing various arrays of potential parallels between them. The truth is often much less salacious and infinitely more arresting than we tend to think, and maybe that's EXOTICA's greatest strength (aside from its wonderfully piecemeal structure): it's far from the ""exotic thriller"" that it's misleadingly billed as. If anything, it's an Emotional Supernova; an almost secular meditation on the strange ways in which we sometimes seek to remedy loss via substitution by proxy and self-soothing rituals (as unconventional as they may seem) as well as the lengths others will go to commiserate and aide in our personal debasement of this damage. My main reservation lies in the acting—not one character in particular, but there are occasional lugs in quality that vary from person to person along the way, which may (or may not) stifle the thrust of the film's most tender moments (cf. the ""main"" flashback in Egoyan's THE SWEET HEREAFTER, which guts me like a fish thanks to Ian Holm's flawless delivery). Fortunately, however, no less than a majority of EXOTICA's power resides in the script itself and the dexterous way in which it's unraveled, turning over the stones of our expectations, one by one, until our aversion, skepticism, and wariness have all but turned into pity, compassion, and benevolence. Loss is unpredictable; the way we choose to cope with this bereavement perhaps even more so. Hard to think of a film that disentangles these primitive mysteries as engrossingly as this.",4.5

Exotica has all ingredients that make a good movie for me,Awesome characters, perfectly fitting actors that play them well. Great music and a stunning atmosphere.And amazing story that moves you and keeps you interested till the end. This film clearly shows how difficult relations between people are. it seems that between the characters lies a karmic connection, and finally nothing is accidental. Everything is inextricably intertwined like a jigsaw puzzle. Emotions range from comprehensive to threatening, the erotic to the obsessive, from light to darkness. Exotica is wonderful because it refuses to condemn or judge. There is no moral resolution, there is only life. Rotten and stuck in a maze the characters deal with their loss but never stop living. It's not so heartwarming,just true. And that is truly wonderful.

"A peculiar movie with a tempting atmosphere that is mysterious and dripping with psychological torments and emotional torture. . .and not only for its characters! The visuals and the sound of it are as exotic as its title suggests, making for a tour the force in visual and auditory immersion. The story is slow, yet always intriguing. The puzzle unfolds piece by piece untill it burns down its last pieces. It's endlessly fascinating to see how it builds up to its last piece, but even more fascinating is the suggestion of what that burnt piece could be. This is gripping stuff, very surreal, utterly sensual and beautifully tragic, too, but there are parts that are left unsatisfying and incomplete. But the weird thing is: I'm completely satisfied with that!",4.0

"Rég láttam ennyire slowburner filmet, majdnem nyolcvan percet kell várni, mire kezd összeállni a sztori, cserébe viszont az utolsó felvonásra puhára vagy főzve a sok megtört lelkű magányos torontói között. Évfordulós vetítés volt, ott volt Atom Egoyan és utána mesélt is erről a lassú tűzről, hogy ő gyakran konkrétan az előkészületek alatt talál rá a filmre, itt is sokat írt hozzá, komplett szálakat változtatott és ezért nem tudna ma már ilyet filmet csinálni, anno ugyanis annyi volt a deal a producerrel, csinálj bármit, csak menjen Cannes-ba, mert ott akarták promotálni a produkciós céget, ma meg például streamingre dolgozni tök más, mondott is egy szót, nem hallottam még, pedig tök logikus: stickability. Avagy a streaming cégek ezt nézik, ragad-e majd a néző a képernyő elé, amihez óramű pontosságú forgatókönyvet kérnek, amit aztán jól telepakolnak javaslatokkal. Erről nem sokat beszélnek, pedig ez is fontos fejlemény, moziban talán még mindig lehet slowburn, kevesen mennek ki, nagyobb a türelem, a streamnél viszont azonnal elkapcsolnak még az ínyencek is, ha lassabban épül valami. Hát igen, bár ugye manapság egyre többen pofáznak meg mobiloznak a moziban, szóval valszeg maradnak ezek a rezervátum művészmozik az efféle filmeknek, de ez is valami. Mondott még egy érdekeset amúgy, digitálisról vetítették a Criterion felújítását, ami szerinte azért csalás picit, mert analóg filmen a fekete az fényhiány és nem kikevert fekete fény, szóval digitális kópiáról több látszik a filmből, mint amit ő anno szeretett volna mutatni. A másik, nagyon izgalmas megfejtése, hogy analóg filmszalagnál ugye perforáció van a kockák között, vagyis tulajdonképp egy stroboszkópos teremben ülsz, ahol sötétség és világos váltakozik, amit tudatosan ugyan nem fogsz fel, de tök más energiája lesz tőle a moziteremnek. Talán ez a jelenség az, amit én anyagszerűségnek szoktam hívni, avagy analóg filmről van súlya, anyaga a vetítésnek. A fentiekből persze nyilván kiderül, velünk nézte Egoyan is a filmet, a stáblista után láthatóan elérzékenyülve jött ki a vászonhoz, mert egyrészt full teltház volt egy mizerábilis esős-ködös kedd estén, másrészt az elmondása szerint régen látta az Exoticát, úgyhogy gyorsan azzal kezdte, ne is kérjük, ő biztosan nem fogja elemezni a filmet, mert a neten olvasott már mindenféle analízist például arról, mit jelképeznek a papagájok a cselekményben, amikkel ő anno persze egyáltalán nem akart semmit, szóval meghagyja mindenkinek az elemzés örömét. Helyette viszont elmesélte, mennyire kiakadt anno, hogy pont a francia forgalmazóknak nem kellett a film (pedig van benne kukkolás, cicik), meg hogy a tiltakozása ellenére Weinstein, vagy ahogy ő hivatkozott rá, ""a producer, aki most börtönben ül"", mindenáron erotikus thrilleres előzetes vágatott hozzá (""ha nem engeded, egyenesen videóra megy""), amibe a Miramax marketingesei pisztolylövést is tettek (a filmben nem dördül pisztoly - újabb érv, miért nem érdemes előzeteseket nézni). Weinstein érve viszont elég jó volt, avagy a filmedet a trailertől függetlenül megnézik a rajongóid, ha viszont ezzel a reklámmal beviszunk másokat is, akiknek a nyolcvan százaléka anyázni fog, még mindig maradt húsz százalék, aki új rajongód lehet. A legnagyobb sztorija amúgy az volt, mikor kezdő filmes korában Wim Wenders nyert valami díjat és támogatásként neki adta az ezzel járó csekket, de Egoyan végül nem tudta beváltani, mert ugye Wim Wenders nevére szólt és ez a csekk nemhogy megvan, de meg fogja mutatni a Criterion klozetban. A legviccesebb amúgy, hogy ezeket mind-mind nézői kérdésekre mondta, vagyis a dolog úgy nézett ki, valaki kérdezett valamit, ő meg a válasz helyett a semmiből előhúzta ezeket a sztorikat. Régen voltam ennyire jó és értelmes film utáni kérdezz-feleleken, mert nemcsak sokat tett hozzá a látottakhoz, de pont olyan volt maga Egoyan is, mint ez a filmje. Ilyen szép lassan kacskaringózva kibomló, kimondottan izgalmas élmény.",4.0
"I hadn't seen this since the 1990s. I'm so glad that I revisited it. Having watched THE BLACK DAHLIA recently and generally arrived at the conclusion that the beautiful Mia Kirshner is the best part of that film, it seemed reasonable to check out this early film in her career. Honestly, this is the film that made Kirshner a successful working actress. However, it's a shame that she never really got propelled into stardom. She's so good. So good.
EXOTICA was one of the mid-90s films, though, that helped launch the more recognizable careers of Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, Sarah Polley, and Victor Garber. Anchored by strong performances, wonderful production design, and a dreaminess to the film's overall aesthetic, Atom Egoyan weaves a story seemingly around dreams, desires, motivations. It's such a captivating drama with different lives intersecting in unusual but somewhat casual ways, the allure and dreaminess provide a dreamy tone. However, in a beautiful twisty thematic reveal, Egoyan shows that his film is not forward-moving as it seems. It isn't so much about dreams and desires looking ahead--it's about the melancholy dreaminess of reflection, regret, and memory.

"In this movie. In this movie there's a strip club. In this strip club is a bathroom. And if you go to the bathroom, the club DJ will wait for you to go into the stall, lock the door, and then proceed to talk to you about their past lovers or try to convince you to touch one of the dancers all the while sporting a very strange and fake accent. This happens two different times to two different people in this movie, and it's maybe the 4th weirdest thing about this DJ.
A strange, difficult, and unilaterally unique intertwining of some really sad and painful journeys. Finding each other. Pushing each other away. Looks great. Love the score. I enjoyed the way the story unfolds. I really liked the intensity Bruce Greenwood has here and the performances overall are all solid, but I felt very disassociated from it, very far away, and I just didn't really connect with it at all, even when all the dots started connecting. Not for me!

"Nothing I’d seen from Atom Egoyan had prepared me for Exotica. No other of his films have hit me on such a visceral level - not even The Sweet Hereafter, which, considering how bereft of flaws that film is, says a great deal about this one. Both are films you encounter all too rarely as a cinephile, films that combine a range of ingredients in such a richly satisfying balance that you simultaneously treasure the works for their uniqueness and mourn the fact that so few other filmmakers have the talent to pull off something on this level.
Like many of the director’s films, Exotica handles several major characters, people whose connections with one another emerge gradually over the course of the film. Of these people we first meet Thomas (Don McKellar), who is introduced as he goes through customs at an airport. Soon afterwards, we see that he has several eggs strapped to his waist; we assume that he has smuggled them in. Thomas is given free tickets to the ballet, where he picks up a man under the pretext of scalping the tickets. We observe him repeat this strange ritual over the following few nights. Following on from our introduction to Thomas (via one of the most subtly symbolic shots in the film), Christina (Mia Kirshner) enters the picture. She works, as we are about to discover, as a dancer at a strip club called Exotica, where she dresses as a schoolgirl and performs a peculiar routine set to Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows”.
The club is owned by the heavily pregnant Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), who employs as a DJ the somewhat slimy Eric (Elias Koteas). Eric's schtick, we gather, involves delivering insinuating monologues about the dancers, but when it comes to Christina his words, and the accompanying glares he throws her way, have a ring of jealousy to them. The ostensible cause of his jealousy is Francis (Bruce Greenwood), one of the customers to whom Christina is shown giving a personalised table-dance. It’s clear from the first time we see him that Francis has more on his mind than sex, but what exactly we don't know. Later, Francis drops a teenager named Tracey (Sarah Polley) at her home, paying her for services rendered. In the brief conversation that passes between them it is indicated that they've known each other for some time, though the precise nature of their relationship isn't made expressly clear.
There's very little about the plot that can be detailed without veering drastically into spoiler territory, but what I've written here should give you some sense of how the film operates. As I've said before, exposition is not a word that appears to exist in Egoyan's vocabulary. Information is presented in a trickle, meaning that we the audience are kept on our toes, unaware of the significance of a certain event until later in the film and constantly asking questions about the information we have. Why is Eric so obsessed with Christina? Is that lust in Francis's eyes or another kind of obsession? Is Tracy a prostitute? What motivates Thomas to use the exact same ploy to pick up men night after night? In a sense, Exotica is a story told backwards, starting with confusing fragments and steadily revealing more of itself until we have a complete picture - or at least as complete a picture as we can hope to get. At the end of the film, we're caught between pondering the troubling overtones of that picture, a picture that raises as many questions as it answers, and marvelling at the sheer finesse with which Egoyan has assembled his narrative.
What's even more impressive is that the writer-director isn't content merely to weave a complicated narrative riddle for us to solve. Exotica is a film about pain and loneliness, and the behavioral patterns we adopt in order to help us cope with these feelings. It goes deeper, revealing how such patterns rob human relationships of their authenticity, turning them into transactions both financial and emotional. Many of Egoyan's films involve repeated rituals that only make sense to the people who perform them: in The Adjuster, for instance, a film censor secretly tapes the content she's paid to sanitise and then shows the footage to her housebound sister. What makes Exotica different in its treatment of this motif is the way it shuns the clinical detachment of Egoyan's previous work, viewing these characters and their attendant issues with a clear-eyed empathy and respect that keeps their mysteries intact as much as it endeavours to lay them bare. Though it doesn't try and pretend that any of these characters are anything but flawed, it ultimately grants them a right to their secrets, suggesting that the human condition is as unknowable as it is pitiful.
The cast features many Egoyan regulars: Khanjian, Koteas, Greenwood, Polley and McKellar have all collaborated with the director on multiple occasions, as has David Hemblen, who appears briefly at the beginning. (Maury Chaykin even has a tiny cameo.) Kirshner and Victor Garber are the only members of the main cast who, as far as I know, have only worked with him once. All of them are brilliant - I’d single out Greenwood, whose flickering facial spasms hint at the emotional turmoil bubbling beneath the surface - but credit should go to the intricate, loaded screenplay, which supplies the actors with these multifaceted characters to unpack. In addition to being a triumph of storytelling, Exotica is a masterclass in atmosphere. Paul Sarossy’s camera moves with a slow, sinuous grace, and the strip club scenes, lit in dark blue, evoke melancholia and detachment instead of the humid eroticism we might expect to find in such a setting. Mychael Danna’s score, eerie yet alluring (in a word, exotic), is the icing on the cake.
I know it’s reductive, but I can’t help comparing and contrasting this film with The Sweet Hereafter. The two films share a sort of elemental mysteriousness that can’t fully be put into words, and they both address themes of lost innocence, healing and dysfunctional responses to tragedy. And yet they somehow feel as if they were directed by two different people. The Sweet Hereafter, though not without its chronological idisoyncrasies, is more accessible and naturalistic, less winding and oblique, than the director's previous work, and it derives its devastating emotional impact as it unfolds. Exotica constantly twists and confounds; it waits until the end for everything to be revealed, and the surprise of the final epiphany puts you in such a daze that it’s only while thinking it over afterwards that you begin to absorb its, and the whole film's, full effect. If I had to simplify it, I’d say that whereas The Sweet Hereafter tears your heart out, Exotica splits your head open.
But once again, this isn't to say Exotica works purely as an exercise in baffling and disorientating the viewer. After the smoke and haze have cleared, you’re left with a piercingly mournful view of a group of people trapped by emotions we - and perhaps even they - don't know the full extent of. I suspect that I’m going to be haunted by that closing scene for a while to come. Magnificent, spellbinding stuff.

"There's a unique pleasure in discovering a movie that challenges you to reevaluate the way you watch and understand movies as a whole. For me, Exotica is one such film. It's not that Egoyan's film is all that difficult to understand - in fact, there's a satisfying simplicity with which the narrative clicks together in the third act that complements the mystery that defines so much of the movie. Instead, what's so intriguing about Exotica is the manner in which simple facts are excised from the narrative in order to place greater focus and attention on the character's routines. From these routines—an auditor's frequenting of a strip club and the dancer that repeatedly performs for him, a teenager babysitting a childless home, an emcee lording over his ex-girlfriend, a lonely store owner picking up strangers to accompany him to the ballet—Egoyan crafts situations and dynamics ripe for false assumptions and negative stigmas. Those assumptions, ones that the movie coaxes the audience to make, govern the film just as much, if not more than the ""truth"". After all, the very first lines of the movie are an instruction:
""You have to ask yourself what brought the person to this point. What was seen in his face, his manner, that channeled him here. You have to convince yourself that this person has something hidden that you have to find.""
As the audience falls into this trap, Exotica works to emphasize how those very guesses and assumptions also exist within the film itself, exercising their own impact on the characters and changing the way they operate. This characteristic helps us to understand not just what the movie is about, but how it's meant to be watched. It's no coincidence how often two-way mirrors appear throughout the film; Exotica is watching us as much as we are watching it and that makes it a very compelling little flick.",0.0

"As with the Oscar-nominated The Sweet Hereafter, the key to Exotica is the screenplay's meticulous structure. An exotic pet shop, a strip club called Exotica, and between the two of them, a single man and a long list of compulsions—his and everyone else's. He's a professional and a family man, one with sad eyes and a soft demeanor. His past is the key that unlocks everything, but the event itself seems to have fractured time. And now that it's broken, the camera glides through lush corridors flanked by one-way mirrors or fish tanks full of lime green water. Both the cinematography and narrative are disembodied, and we observe the story only one layer at a time, from the outside to the inside, from the present backward.
It feels like the prompt was to explore a single story answering a single question—why does a man, this one or anyone, in a sexually repressed society spend their nights paying for sexuality and not intercourse? From that starting point, Egoyan torques your expectations and challenges your initial perceptions, while continuously filling in the gaps. Each scene and image is recontextualized based on what information has been disseminated. It's a study in how we react to these locations and interpret their symbols before exploring how the characters wound up here and what they all mean to one another. Given my love for the follow-up and the enthusiastic reception, I found this just a little ""underwhelming,"" but I am really looking forward to letting it marinate awhile and revisiting this puzzle to see how the full context mutates the experience.

"a world with the withheld unknown where we strive for erudition; does nothing truly happen in a vacuum? exotica trivalizes our discomforted selves' endeavor to decipher the undecipherable, meanwhile strenously concealing of key information thorough. off-putting as it might seem, this strategy functions as a mirrorball, repeatedly making estimations based on our lateral thinking and ending in assumptions so frustrating many might get to see the improbability of what the film has in the bag for later. a story so lacking in contextual complexity and nonetheless i found myself anxiously nail-biting as things went down until realization hit. egoyan played with my self-esteem oh so many times, leading to my being in absolute awe for his work.
alas i am not able to further explain what it is in the film, soundly excruciating and cathartic for one and nonetheless the cause of my numbness during the first half. but it is one that will cause many to call it quits, despite its risk being where the true magic is found. the set up of the tone adds to the mirror | puzzle structure in its detached, even fantastical worldbuilding - death presented oh with such grace and power upon otherwise isolated characters. mystique and allure, enhanced to before unseen levels of extremity to present themes of our attentuon such as the figure of sex and the psyche.
the setting is notably relevant to put forward the beforehand mentioned; what place to represent better sinfulness than a strip club? and, what irony to accompany better than the one and only rule forbidding touching the exotic dancers? in this instance the sexualization of the female body suggests how our devoted innocence is inherently owned by the thief of our virginity - our first carnal inamorato. furthermore, there is a series of psychological occurences shown throughout referencing the role of the paternal figure in this loss of virginity. according to freud and the oedipal complex all small boys select their mother as their primary object of desire, a trope which egoyan 180s on to depict an intensely similar yet somehow reversed, passionate tale of family.
i wish i could place my finger on what or where the film clicked for me, how it picked up after i kept thinking how pointlessly unintense everything seemed. upon reflection, this seems like quite a reasonable complaint. i am ravished to experience this on a revisit though, and put the pieces together. to me, every small detail now seems essential and spine-tingling drama, every small detail reinforces the critique and the realness corruption of it all. truly enrapturing.
in conclusion yeah, it is 100% not what i was expecting it to be, instead it's so far one of the best surprises of the year for me film-wise. the design of the shadows, the riveting atmosphere and deconstruction of a town are all incredibly put-together as one making for an intriguing thriller and a perverse novella. it all lies beneath the doors of the club.

In defining, they always left something out.” Trying to capture the essence of such an atmospheric trance is like remembering a dream hours after you’ve had it: all that remains is the melancholy and the hope that lingered before being destroyed.",5.0

Do you know that idea you occasionally have which is to see a certain movie for the first time again? I do and don't want that with Exotica. The sudden emotional impact really caught me by surprise the first time. However, this second watch has me picking up many details involving the characters and the connections these people have with each other. There are even moments or just little things that I had forgotten until right before they happen despite being so present during the first time as much as this second time (For example, one kiss between two members of the same sex early in the movie). While the surprise has come and gone, there is so much mystery left to consider and possibly more to be noticed. I might not even realize or figure certain things out without discussing it with other people who had seen this film. (Something about me: I'm generally an external processor.) So what thoughts to close this post out? 1) Mychael Danna's score is haunting me. 2) Despite seeing Bruce Greenwood in eleven movies for much of my life, I'm now realizing how underrated he is!

As many others have pointed to, this film is elliptical in structure, and, beyond all else, that's why I love the film so deeply. The narrative progression is, to say the least, absolutely revelatory. It's not linear, and instead moves along as it sees fit; it drags in characters one at a time, each complicating the others and further muddying the water. It's not a discovery, but a series of them that puts everything into focus. It's a film of obfuscation, but not for the sake of itself; each question brought up is left to stew until we're finally given the answers that are always worse than we could have been imagined. The weight of it comes from that structure(small pieces put into place instead of a single reveal) -- each revelation is more crushing than the last as the tapestry of trauma is woven in front of our eyes. And yet, that's not even the reason I'm so enamored by the structure. This film consumes itself, collapses on itself, acting as a prison for the characters. There isn't any escape; they're forever trapped within the confines of the film as a further expression of the depths of their trauma. The opening shot is of a one-way mirror; we see in, but they will never see out.",4.5
"Atom Egoyan may not be my guy. Whether it be Exotica today or The Sweet Hereafter many years ago, his coldly elliptical approach leaves me stuck at arm’s length from the emotions of the piece. I feel the same way about plenty of Cronenberg films, so I buy that comparison completely.",2.5

"Sedative and esoteric movements delineating visual patterns with inscrutable slowness, kinetic articulations conjuring mysticism with patient camera displacements that shift from explicit persuasions to imperceptible delicacy; this is the language of Exotica's elegiac decadence, a place where the sorrowful and dense effects of tragedies are sublimated into lascivious temptations. In the erotic atmosphere of this puzzling opus directed and written by Atom Egoyan, ambiguity governs the ethereal longings of its characters as well as the experimental methods of its storytelling, yielding a film with a sensory emphasis that unflinchingly seeks cathartic empathy not in the total comprehension of its mystery but in the alienation of it. Subtly, Egoyan's confusing writing expresses much and pronounces a series of complexities that enrich the film to extraordinary levels, although we do not notice or understand it with legibility precisely because of the premeditated secrecy that is imposed on the literary development of the script. Being an elaborately cryptic content, its strange jargon when adapted to cinematic singularity makes something special and strikingly genuine, chilling in many ways, effectively poignant in many others as well, but overall, the perennially overlapping architecture with divergent temporalities formulates with exhaustive precision a concept that is easily understandable within the inherently indecipherable harmonizing unworldly sensations that this film originates in us.
Primarily, we have as an eye-catcher the sybaritic but ordinary lust of the libidinous dances in a nightclub that bears the same name as the title of this film, then we have two men obsessed with the same woman and finally the ancillary individuals surrounding these characters and accentuating their confessions. Superficially, working with these generic elements in a plot could be seen as a softcore thriller with the idioms of nineties cinema, however structurally, it is antithetical to the conventions. Exotica is a film where the acts of eroticism are so asymmetric and profoundly allegorical that it suppresses any trace of crude pornography.
Atom Egoyan dissects alienation and the human condition with powerful juxtapositions that carry monumental importance. Orchestrating an abstruse symbology along with a somewhat Byzantine narrative system and making it gracefully meaningful and forcefully revelatory is already a triumph in itself, yet giving it the nuanced capacity to be an inexhaustible film with each viewing is what leads it to position itself at the altar of the most intricate masterpieces ever made. It is not that the enigma of its puzzle is solved in the magnificent conclusion of this film as many believe, for in reality the mystery is not the tragedy per se, much less what its origins were, but rather the overwhelmingly burdensome existentialism left to the protagonists of this tragedy is what gives it a superlative superiority to its metaphorical ambivalences. The latter is never resolved, nor is it ever attempted to be resolved; the catharsis that the filmmakers seek and solidly evoke in the denouement is nothing more than an instrument to further densify what was already arcane. Exotica develops elliptically in a story that intertwines the lives of different people but does not lead them to the same destination, the suffering and invasive depression of each of the characters who battle with their inner demons is externalized in unique modalities, practically a distinguishing detail that contrasts the ways they cope with their afflictions. They are all united by tragedy, yet the effects it has on them are colossally different for each. Obsession, aggressiveness, calmness and submission, but not strictly attitudes that are distributed among them, rather they are conflated, showing some more pronounced than others.
For better or worse, writing, exposing, theorizing or simply commenting on this film has been for me a demanding exercise in not spilling anything argumentatively important that would ruin the experience for those who have not yet tasted the heady pleasure of watching this film. Even to develop a common, concise synopsis I feel would threaten to diminish the raw emotional and intellectual shock the film leaves on you. Exotica is dizzyingly narrated and artfully filmed with such fastidious finesse that it is like entering an unparalleled trance, where you enter an absorbing void that progressively fills that void with substantial issues that generate a resonant and haunting effect, the echo of cinema.
“All I'm saying is nobody asked if you wanted to be brought into the world, you just ended up getting here. So the question is, now that you're here who's asking you to stay?”
This bit of dialogue is more than a philosophical concern, it is probably the dialogue that supports the convoluted thesis of the film. Each character is like an errant soul wandering the world trying to cope with their existence, or seeking an answer to their existence so that they can continue to live with their wounds but not be killed by them. The peculiar but pitch-perfect performances monumentalize the film's sense of tragedy, characterizations that deliver a plethora of emotions and communicate in unison their torrid existentialist problems. Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner and Elias Koteas, are the protagonists who represent the essential in the evolution of the drama, the other secondary characters only reinforce the cathartic thesis. The three portray characters that are comprised on distinctive layers, Kirshner's effusive sensuality connects with the other two characters, however one of them has a symbiotic relationship with her and the other does not, there is a debate between the luxurious but dark surface of the aesthetics of the film with the depth of the passions that manifest themselves in belligerent and vengeful behaviors that then fulfill their dramatic function with the purposes of the film. All three have a past, evidently the plot opts for a kind of storytelling in medias res, i.e. we meet the characters in their alienated reality of the present and not the past, the diffuse past is only introduced as oneiric inserts that will later take shape. The most brilliant thing about these performances is how they capture the sinuous structure of the film only with the constructive emphasis of following a routine, in which they repeat the same gestures but each time with greater intuition and ultimately with formidable veracity.
Entering Exotica is easy, leaving is also very easy, but staying is the hard part. And what I mean by staying is basically to go deeper into it. There are few films that deftly use its semiotics to magnify its message; Paul Sarossy's miraculous cinematography creates some of the most fabulous and some of my favorite imagery of nineties cinema, meticulously materialized and loaded with uniform textures that facilitate the vocalization and characterization of the performances. I would never dare to give univocity to the specifics in this intoxicating masterpiece, it is multi-interpretative and dynamically complex. The cyclical lives of the characters in Exotica tell you that being alive is a torturous tragedy, but oh what a beautiful tragedy it is to be alive!",5.0
"I definitely picked up on some Lost Highway (1997) and Chinatown (1974) vibes. So many great scenes, each presented within a pleasantly weird atmosphere that feels hypnotic. It’s always interesting discovering these unique psych-thriller’s as they feel extremely specific to the early 1990’s pre-dvd days. And even though the soundtrack works out exceedingly well (“everybody knows”), a slightly heavier more industrial sound, aka early instrumental Reznor would of been a nice matchup alongside Cohen.
I’m betting if actress Mia Kirshner was unable to star, the producers probably had Chloë Sevigny on speed dial..

Also it’s a Canadian film, so bonus points for that!🇨🇦

"Mesmerising tale of grief and longing. Exotica is shrouded by mystery. Mystery which cloaks more grief. The interconnected sadness of the characters culminates in a hauntingly smart and complex tale about the need for human connections to overcome pain. Atom Egoyan's direction in this film is absolutely wonderful. 
Recommended by George.",3.5
"After initially presenting itself as an atmospheric and steamy erotic thriller, Exotica gradually reveals itself to the audience, like pieces of a mosaic slowing being assembled, as a tragic psychological character study of human connection and loneliness, sprung from the creative genius of director Atom Egoyan.
The laconic camerawork and deliberate pacing along with the sensual score and seedy locations creates a moody, noir-ish setting. The lighting really stood out to me, the smoke filled rooms illuminated by shafts of light and vehicle headlights hitting the walls and ceilings as they drive past outside.
The way the story hooks you from the opening camera pan and gradually unfolds is masterful, leading up to a completely unexpected and devastating finale of shared grief, the underlying connection between the central characters. This is one to watch again as it will no doubt improve every time, one reviewer likens it to Paris, Texas in the way it examines pain and human isolation through a slowly unfolding narrative, a comparison I can certainly see.",4.5

1994 Ranked
Haunting and bewitching, Atom Egoyan’s Exotica is a film like few others. It introduces many threads that later connect themselves into a remarkably moving portrayal of grief and the secrets lying within a person’s face. The opening scene as a customs officer stares through a two-way mirror at a suspected smuggler and is told to look into his face to figure out what he may be hiding sets the tone. While that smuggler, Thomas (Don McKellar), has a role to play in the film, the focus is often on Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood). A dispassionate, distant, and morose tax auditor, Francis spends every evening at Exotica, a strip club. Each night, the creepy MC, Eric (Elias Koteas), luridly introduces Chrissy (Mia Kirshner), always dressed as a schoolgirl. Eric’s “imagination” and clearly perverse inclinations infuse his description, while Chrissy brushes it off and heads off, as she always does, for a private dance with Francis. Sometimes he watches, usually he does not. Instead, they merely exist in the same space and, almost through osmosis, connect.
Francis is a broken man. One does not need the middle of the film explanation as to why to figure out that quality about him. His niece Tracey (Sarah Polley) is brought over to his home daily in order to “babysit” or practice piano when he has no baby to sit. His brother Harold (Victor Garber) seems aware of some favor he is doing his brother. Mystifying flashbacks to Eric walking with Christina and talking in an open field as well as Thomas’ nightly excursions to the ballet and increasing comfort in his sexuality occur parallel to this character study of Francis. They all link up in the climax, cementing this as not just Francis’ story. He provides one of the dominant moods and themes of the film, but together, these figures speak something far greater. In his desire to explore strip clubs, those who work there, and those patronize them, Egoyan naturally introduces sex but the film is so cold and unflashy as to remove much of the inherent sexiness of the setting. In its place is an overwhelming feeling of isolation, loss, and hurt. These are broken people, either sexually repressed (Thomas), searching for a purpose (Christina), grieving (Francis), or aimless (Eric). Their interactions are sometimes antagonistic, but the truth remains that they are bonded in their feelings of isolation and sorrow.
Egoyan’s restrained and thoughtful direction keeps all of these stories floating along, never giving away all of their mystery until it is the right time. By then, the film feels akin to a gut punch. The lingering feeling of tragedy that has spurred these characters onto their almost mystical paths combines into a fury of emotion. It is such a wonder to behold, a film with an atmosphere so deeply felt that it is hard to not feel bewitched by the proceedings. The routine and repetition of the club, the awkward encounters and sad realities of Francis’ life, and the battle over sexuality that everyone faces, all playing out in an almost nightmarish fashion. Egoyan does well to capture a drifting feeling to it with these lost characters seeming to float from moment to moment, trying to keep their heads above water but often failing. They are on the brink of something, fighting for their sense of normalcy and never quite able to attain that feeling which has been denied to them by life events.
In this regard, the acting is consistently phenomenal. Whether restrained or not, the cast capture such rich emotion. Bruce Greenwood is notably restrained here for much of the film, having an easy and earnest demeanor about him that clues everyone into knowing he is no threat. He is just a man beaten down by life, clinging to vitality or old memories and trying to keep moving ahead. The deep sorrow in his eyes, pain in trying to coming to terms with what has happened to him, and seeming reluctance to live again outside of this spiral prove so heartbreaking. He is almost like a zombie, just trudging along and going through the motions. Mia Kirshner’s a bit less restrained, but nonetheless a powerhouse of emotion. Her attack on Eric and the ensuing quarrel is perhaps the greatest burst of emotion in the film, never theatrical yet so powerful in capturing how she feels so trapped by him and his perverse “imagination” about her. Kirshner’s skill in laying the subtle seeds of pain that make up Christina’s past contribute nicely to her overall character arc, capturing so much yearning for human connection that she finds in few, perhaps only Francis and Thomas. Her flashback scene at the end is a great representation of this skill, an aimless look, and a compliment over how she likes the love somebody else expresses for their child in the way they talk about them. Just the delivery and the look in her eyes say so much about how she is treated at home, a perfect setup for adult pain she has throughout the rest of the film. Elias Koteas is impressive as well, playing the perv but a sad one at that with a deep pain behind his eyes. The clues as to why come later, but his possessive nature and lurid descriptions as the women get on the stage set the tone for the atmosphere of the club and the role imagination plays in the overall film.
If nothing else, Exotica is a fantastic representation of Egoyan’s control over mood and atmosphere. A muted, often blue, black, and gray color palette blended with a subtly eerie score hauntingly playing in the background perfectly capture the somber, mystical mood Egoyan attempts to build. Adding in the performances and unique narrative structure, Exotica becomes an incredibly well-rounded and rewarding journey into the lives of a few connected and somber figures trying to find themselves in the Toronto strip club world. Though set in a conventionally sexy and lurid world - and Exotica is sexy - Egoyan’s focus is not on sex, but rather on the people who live in this world and it yields fantastic results.",4.0
"This film was introduced to me as an 'erotic thriller'. Holy hell this is not an erotic thriller, it's all the domestic collapse and tragedy of American Beauty but weirder and darker. Psychological and sexually charged doesn't mean erotic, and this film proves it.
Exotica doesn't treat sex like a thrill or a passion, it treats it like an emotional crutch. Every character is missing something from their lives, whether they never had it, slowly watched it fade away, or saw it torn from their hearts, and in response they congregate in this seedy strip club in Toronto; there this ""secret world"" as the film calls it is to some a way of life, to everyone vaguely ritualistic. There's this great atmosphere that the film gives off, both emotionally intense and reeling, that makes it clear that the characters are really just flailing in response to scenarios that they have no control over and have suffered through. At the same time, it's got a very David Lynch inventiveness to some of the story beats - including Don McKellar as a pet shop owner under audit that operates a smuggling ring for hyacinth macaw eggs - though I suppose each of those details could fall under the broader definition of the title's 'exotica'. Props for sidestepping a conventional structure to give some meat to the characters before letting the exposition filter in, challenging assumptions about motivation and purpose.
It's really not as much of a thriller as it is a suburban sadness piece, but Atom Egoyan (as director, writer, and producer) does an excellent job of redefining sexuality as a means of crude escapism rather than the commodified version you might see as part of a commercial for body spray.",3.5
"This film is more than I expected it to be, I originally thought it would be a standard crime thriller but it turned out to be something different, more akin to a surrealist thriller like Lost Highway. Exotica is a strange film and everyone in it are strange folk as well, the atmosphere is eerie and the music choices are perfect for a film like this. I'm surprised that this film isn't popular! I recommend giving it a look if anyone is a fan of strange crime thrillers.",4.5

"Everybody knows...
Atom Egoyan's international breakthrough is a marvelous picture of isolation, fractured relationships, and unresolved trauma. It unfurls slowly and masterfully, wisely leaving details at the periphery murky, even by the time the final credits roll.
I won't provide a mini synopsis as I usually do both because part of the joy of Egoyan's best picture comes from piecing the mystery together, slowly, yourself and because precisely what happens isn't why you should watch this film.
It should be watched for its precise and naked honesty about intimacy and the strange ways shared pain manifests. It should be watched for its beautifully evocative, grimy palette that, while totally grounded, creates an air of intrigue and mysticism. The images elevate the drama and the narrative construction as the smoky bowels of this Toronto strip club gradually thin to reveal hidden layers of connection and pain.
This is Egoyan's best and, in truth, one of the best pictures of its kind. All its elements - script, performances, production design, score, and cinematography - work in concert to closely examine the emotional lives of its principal players. Their histories reveal a story that examines how we rely on one another to deal with our pain and how, often, we don't.
Exotica remains a 5/5, my favorite of Egoyan's filmmography, and one of my favorite movies of all time.",5.0
"I can thank EXOTICA for introducing me to three things:
   
* The music of Leonard Cohen, particularly “Everybody Knows.”  (Yes, I came rather late to the party.)   Around the same time that I saw this, I met a young woman who was working her way through college as an exotic dancer.  She told me that EXOTICA had caused her to adopt a different Leonard Cohen song (“The Future”) for her performance number.  I wish I’d seen it. 
   
* That filmmakers like Atom Egoyan exist.  Friends tell me that the quality of his films vary wildly (which doesn’t surprise me) ... and that I must see THE SWEET HEREAFTER.
   
* If you really know what you’re doing ... and if you are very, very careful ... it is possible to “break the spine” of a traditional screenplay structure and still make a film that can captivate an audience.
   
EXOTICA breaks so many rules.  Now, it would have been easy to lose the audience as it tries to decipher what seemingly unrelated characters have to do with one another.  But, Egoyan does three things that hold attention:
  
* Very early on, he sets a major scene in an exotic dance club called “Exotica.”  It features various lovely young women in various states of undress working for “tips” at the customer tables, and a dancer onstage who gyrates to the music and the commentary from the DJ announcer promising “an introduction to their mysterious world for only $5.00.”  Nudity that is not distasteful usually keeps people watching.
   
* As characters are introduced, the Viewer sees them in various unexplained and unusual relationships with others. Immediately, the mind tries to “fill in the gaps” as to what the characters are after.  Then, there is a compulsion to watch to see if the guess is correct.  (It probably isn’t.)
   
* For the remainder of the movie, more and more clarity emerges about each of the characters and their motivations.  It is a little like peeling an onion to expose a new layer ... and what is uncovered may bring a tear to the eye.  This slow, continual revelation gives EXOTICA its power.
   
It is so very tempting to relate some of the discoveries to show how brilliantly this movie is constructed.  However, I’m of the opinion that almost everything is a Spoiler when revelation becomes the forward momentum that takes the Viewer to the next aspect of the show.  And the process never stops, even to the final revelation that blew me away.
   
Wonderful performances are everywhere, even in minor characters.  Still, the core actors are fascinating: Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner, Don McKellar, Elias Koteas, Arsinee Khanjian, Victor Garber and Sarah Polley.  Each one is so memorable ... and saying much more about any of them would take away a few surprises.
   
EXOTICA is a movie that’s a great deal of fun to watch with someone who has never seen it before (and you can notice the eyes widening).  Some of the best film discussions I’ve had came from this show.  Yet, even when you have seen the show before, there is a special joy in watching how these relationships are interconnected (and how your knowledge provides a new interpretation to both the dialogue and the silences).  
   
My recommendation is to enter EXOTICA for the first time with as little information about the movie as is possible.  Just let the unusual storytelling technique unfold before you, and savor the experience like a fine wine.",5.0
"My second Atom Egoyan film. This film was rather amazing, despite myself not being too into its first act. The film has a lot to steup with its characters which feels initially generic and disconnected. I love how this film is comprised of many long and complicated purposeful uninterupted shots. I adore how the characters are interlinked and how the final scene changes the viewer’s perspective on some characters. The dialogue is often philosophical and every character was memorable. The score annoyed me a bit at first but I loved it by the end (the field flashback track near the end of the first act is amazing especially). This will go up on rewatch because I love it the more I think about it.",4.0

"“Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose”

Lives criss-crossing, squirming without direction in a humid jungle of discomfort, desperate for someone to come along and alleviate the pain, until the realization hits that there can be no better place in this world than the limbo of desire. It’s just as well. The choice is an illusion.
Exotica strung me along, dangling something in front of me that I couldn’t place, just out of reach. Minutes in, my mind had already fallen victim to the trap. I’d become mesmerized by that rosy object on the ground, laid there to ensure that I couldn’t dispel my own anticipation with a grasp on a bigger picture. I became convinced that I liked the adrenaline-fueled tunnel-vision down there in the hazy thick of it all. There was no choice but to stay in that unbearable position until I obtained what I was after. But by the time I realized that the rosy object was my own imminent catharsis, it was too late to evade the real pain as it crashed down around me.
Either on purpose or by accident, Exotica is first the contradiction then the justification of empathy and the greater human experience. A reminder of our capacity.
I hope I’ve eluded to a strong recommendation.

"Has an overall Lynch-ian* effect, but exudes an overwhelming 90's-ness that Lynch never did. Perhaps the only time I'll ever use the phrase ""seedy pet store"" as a descriptor. Any club where the strippers dance to Leonard Cohen is both pure fantasy and the utopian ideal.

"Everybody knows.
Hope is born in the oddest places, but so too are doubt, insecurity, and denial. My parents met at a club much like Exotica. My mother was, for a brief period, an exotic dancer — we laugh about it today in the hilarious way that people revert to laughter when the pain of their past choices is obscured by a wiser embarrassment, the passage of time, and a better life of sobriety — and my father a persistent partier, perpetually stuck in his daze of gluttonous youth, overzealous in seeking pleasures removed from the reality of his abusive upbringing. That’s where they met. Two very troubled people, hollowed out by mistreatment and isolation, seeking refuge on a pleasure island. How can hope be born out of a pornographic fantasy, where the feelings are so much to bear that they must be hidden in a crude fog? Well, in this instance, these two lost souls connected, plucked one another out of their respective lives of quiet desperation, and had me. And now here I am, what they both consider, or in my father’s case considered, the hope of their lives, the hope that their child can move forward without the torment of what they had experienced at the hands of their own parents, the hope that life can be better. Hope is born in the oddest places.
The center stage of Atom Egoyan’s work here is a fantasy realm of laisser-faire indulgence — EXOTICA — where status in the sexual hierarchy is devoid of effort as long as you have the right amount of cash. But it’s only that, a fantasy. You can look, but don’t touch. Everybody knows it’s not real, everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody knows that the boat is leaking. We participate anyway, we cross our fingers, we listen to the captain’s lies. But what if it’s really real for some people? For some people, it’s all too real. The symbol of the tartan skirt is clear enough. “Her special innocence, her sweet fragrance, fresh flowers, light as a spring rain, oh my god.” Where? On the stage, dancing with her tits out? Where? Senselessly dead in the field of tragedy, a random victim of arbitrary murder? We all come to worship the tartan skirt. The religious ecstasy of Leonard Cohen and schoolgirl knee-high socks. Christina. The former student, the sad babysitter. Christina. Christ. On the stage, sacrificing herself for her pseudo-father, sacrificing herself for you. The DJ leers in jealous rage. The matriarch, swollen with a child of the future, like a smuggled egg through customs, leers at the leering. The tax man cometh. His favorite drink, his favorite table, his favorite dancer — his favorite fantasy. That baby is still alive. That darling is still alive. That brother isn’t a traitorous lecher. Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? Oh. It is a gun. But the bullets don’t have to fly. The gun can be melted down with a hug, a discovery. “I know everything about you. I found her.” We share the misery. Everybody knows. 
Bring those hairy palms together, gentlemen, you’re witnessing a healing, the birth of hope. Hope, in the oddest of places.",4.5

"1994 Ranking 
Atom Egoyan, Bruce Greenwood and grief. Name a more iconic trio.
Very impressed at how this basically pulls the rug from underneath you with its lurid, sensual concept of intertwined lives in the titular strip club which acts as a mask to cover pain and trauma that gradually unravels. Egoyan's recurring themes in both this and The Sweet Hereafter are fascinating particularly the whole idea of finding replacement vessels as outlets for one's losses, and the editing and stitching together of the storylines is a knockout. Even though I will admit the central Greenwood and Mia Kirshner (with this and The Black Dahlia got to say, what talent) strand was the most intriguing to me, the film would not work with the other stories stitched together within it.
Give me a week or so to properly formulate my thoughts on it as it is dense and so much of the film is about looking beyond the surface, which is definitely an intriguing approach for a film I exprted, to put it bluntly, more skin-surface level.",4.0
"Writer and director Atom Egoyan crafts a hypnotic film where the story is slowly revealed and characters connected in ways that you never see coming. The final scene gives the viewer the last piece of the puzzle and the are left putting everything together and ruminating on what came before. The slightly off-beat and darkness of the strip club that is featured in many scenes is intriguing and makes you wonder what is really going with not only the workers, but also the customers.

"A film about tearing down the walls of the labyrinth that is each person and understanding them and their pain and longing. A film about the necessity of empathising with people, all these broken people. There’s something really beautiful in how the story unfolds. In many ways, it feels the way Leonard Cohen songs feel—a desperate longing for intimacy, a sensuality that isn’t sexualized (at least, not in the way we’d expect), and a wound that roots itself deeper and deeper the more you listen to it.
And yet, it’s an empathy reserved for men. It’s men’s fears and men’s solitude and men’s desires that are unveiled in subtle and affecting ways. And it’s particularly ungenerous with Christina, the only central character who is a sex worker. She remains the only one who isn’t allowed to voice her pain, her desires, her longing. The others, and especially the men, do. But she is never given the opportunity. And while ambiguity is as necessary as empathy to this story, it’d be nice to feel that she’s as important in her own story as the men are in theirs.
But Mia Kirshner is magnetic. She melts and pours herself into the mold of her characters. She is completely raw in her emotions, and everything she feels is so sincere, so true. She is such an underrated actress (and this isn’t just the Jenny Schecter apologist in me speaking). We, as a world, and cinema, as an industry, have failed her. She has been given so few opportunities despite her talent, despite how much she has to offer. I think it’s because she’s scary; she lacks inhibition, she isn’t afraid of being ugly—I’m not speaking physically, she’s so beautiful that she couldn’t be ugly even if she tried, but I mean in her actions, in her gestures, in her personality. She is at once enticing and off-putting. But that’s what makes her so great.",3.5
"not entirely sure why I gave this a 4.5 on first watch. clearly some of it just went over my head. this time it clicked, and it really fucking did, got to me in such a way that I’m not certain I can articulate with words right now, but I can attempt to.
this is one of the most deeply profound stories I have seen in my lifetime. it’s told with such subtlety too. every line of dialogue is written so perfectly as if not to give away too much, but also get the point across that I can infer exactly what is being said. each and every one of these characters has a depth and purpose. Francis is a broken man, at a point in his life where he simply isn’t sure of anything anymore. he cannot accept that his daughter is gone, so he pays his niece to sit in his house and play the piano as if to make himself believe that things are just the way they were. Christina tells him in a flashback that he “sounds so excited” when he talks about his daughter. she recognizes his compassion just from having a simple, “small-talk” conversation with him in the car. you can see how happy he once was when he was a normal family man and how he physically and emotionally deteriorated after the tragedy. this is about how people relate to each other, and how these relationships culminate in an unsatisfactory manner for those involved. it explores nearly every aspect of life, loss, and feeling. Yes, the words memory and feeling come to mind immediately. The Exotica club is so quiet, so mysterious, so haunting. every time the DJ spoke into the mic it was as if I was listening to God himself. Elias Koteas has a very distinct voice, and his words only add to the sexual energy already present in the club. I would always be clamoring to hear everything he had to say. those conversations in the bathroom when he stands outside the stall and speaks to Francis, and then later Thomas, god those are so fucking amazing. the highlight for me is definitely when he finally tells Christina the truth. that’s when everything erupts, as Koteas and Kirshner’s powerhouse performances radiate. that entire final act is absolutely devastating. gonna stick with me for awhile. 
this is so so so wonderful. I’m blown away. I need sleep but I cannot stop thinking about this. one of the most evocative, beautiful pieces of art I’ve ever seen. about halfway through I started to get chills. chills because I realized this film was going to destroy me. and that it certainly did. I have nothing more to say. just experience this for yourself. it’s a privilege.

"Elif Batuman's New Yorker article “Japan’s Rent-a-Family Industry”— about a Japanese company that supposedly hires out actors to act like friends or family of clients— ends with the author back at her hotel, getting a massage and reflecting on her subjects. She’s suddenly struck with appreciation for the masseuse:
“I felt full of love and gratitude, and thought about how the fact that I was paying her, which could have felt uncomfortable, was instead a source of joy and relief, because it meant that I didn’t have to think about anything at all. I could just relax. It felt like unconditional love—the kind you don’t get, or ask for, from people in your life, because they have needs, too, and you always have to take turns. […] I’d started off assuming that the rental schema somehow undercut the idea of unconditional love. Now I found myself wondering whether it was even possible to get unconditional love without paying.”
She then shares what a psychology professor told her:
“He said that he thought rental relatives were, in an unschooled way, fulfilling some of the functions of group-therapy techniques such as psychodrama, in which patients act out and improvise one another’s past situations or mental processes. Dramatic reënactments can help people in a way that talking with them can’t, because even when we are unable to tell someone what our problem is—because it’s too terrible to say, or because we don’t have the right words, or because we don’t know what it is—we can still act it out with another person.”

Based on its title and (a superficial reading of its) content, the Canadian film Exotica was marketed south of the border as an erotic thriller, but as with most marketing that's deeply misleading. This movie isn't a thriller, but rather a deeply moving study or portrait of multiple characters. And while it is erotic, it's only incidentally so. What I mean by that is that due to the setting around which the story orbits, a lap dancing club, and the profession of one of the major characters, a stripper, there is a palpable sensuality to it. But that's not the point, the point is the people and their complex inter-relationships. It's also a strange variety of strip club that has more of a Parisian cafe-circa-the-1920s vibe about it, with its palm fronds, mirrors, and old world luxury trappings, and the dancers undress to Leonard Cohen songs not Motley Crüe or something even trashier. However we learn from Zoe, the owner, that there is a deeper philosophy behind the place than mere titillation, it represents more than simply a method to seperate city workers from their wages via the medium of tits. Rather, it's an urban oasis that serves a distinctive clientele, offering something like therapy only cheaper, and company but without obligation. A tropical and neon refuge away from a grey and concrete world.
We have multiple portals into this world, and as stated above Exotica is about a unique series of relationships that unfold before the viewer. And with each new connection new facets of a character are also opened up. Then, every time you think you might have something figured out, the screenplay elegantly sidesteps the obvious and offers up something more interesting and more profound than what the most cliched story beat would have been, what a generic movie would have gone for every time. While the city goes unnamed it's obviously Toronto, but a warmer place than its colder, more Cronenbergian version I'm used to. Indeed, it was strange seeing Elias Koteas here, still with his Casey Jones haircut from the shithouse third Ninja Turtles movie, just a couple of years before he co-starred in DC's incredible 1996 landmark, Crash. Bruce Greenwood might mostly pop up in supporting roles in Hollywood, often playing the US president, but he's great here, as is 15 year old Sarah Polley, but she was always a natural. I hadn't seen Mia Kirshner in anything but she was great, as was director and part time actor Don McKellar. I'm deliberately not discussing the story here as I want others to experience this totally fresh as I did. Exotica was another one of those movies I'd added to my watchlist after seeing others talk up, and I too now wish to add my voice to that chorus.",4.0
"— There's this feeling I get sometimes, you know?
— What sort of feeling?
— That I wasn't ever meant to be satisfied.
— Satisfied with what?
— With a lot of things. It seems to me, that every time I'm about to get a hold of something or someone, they're just bound to slip away,
— Maybe you want it to slip away.
This had a tremendous advance reputation thanks to Mike D'Angelo — as fellow D'Angelo fan Amy Hensarling noted in her recent podcast (more of a Chautauqua, really) on the movie, when a critic with a very discriminating palate whom you hugely admire loves a movie, you tend to sit up and take notice. And then the reason I saw it at this particular time was because Amy did her podcast, and I wanted to listen to it, and of course I had to see the movie before listening to it. So I was super hyped for the movie, and my hand was also forced — not the best circumstances. On the other hand, getting to watch the movie and then listen to the podcast was a terrific one-two punch. The high rating is for the combined experience.
Watching Exotica for the first time reminded me of watching Hartley's Trust for the first time. Both movies falls into a slightly dreamlike state between the fantastical and the realistic. The stories seem to be meant at face value, but at the same time they feel very crafted, you can hear in the rhythms of the dialogue how carefully written they are, there's an elusive but strong extra dash of artifice. Since the movies hinge on your taking the characters to heart, and not seeing them as allegorical pawns in the director's dreamspace chessboard, it's a tricky balance to strike. The difference in enjoyment for me between Trust and Exotica hinges on a hairsbreadth distinction in tone management. Hartley, for me, had the edge in terms of irony, humor and warmth. By contrast, Egoyan's film seemed a little more arch and had just a bit of impassivity to it. As a result, the story (which is delightfully crucial) had a whiff of contrivance.
Everything hinges on how much you get out of the ingenuity of its construction. I liked the movie to a limited degree on first watch, with my amateur understanding of the story it was actually telling. After listening to Amy and benefitting from her interpretive moves as a fan of the film, I could see right away that it would be enriched on a second watch. What I want to note here and remember is the peculiar arc which I followed in regard to the Exotica itself. When the movie began, I found it a dreary and slightly confounding place. The lifelessness of the men sitting there, looking at the women, was depressing and reminded me of the rare times I've been in strip clubs (at off hours) and sensed the miasma of shame hanging over the place. As I got caught up in Francis's situation, I came to appreciate the Exotica. That was about Francis — I felt like I could relate to what he was pursuing there — and it was also about the club itself. A kind of clearinghouse for fantasies of transcending your own misery and distress seemed enviable. Francis wasn't pursuing his goal in a way that seemed particularly healthy, but I felt it was good that he had a place to pursue it. There was no other setting in the film that seemed to offer any hope for moving forward. When Francis lost his precarious balance and couldn't return to his ritual again, I felt for him and was intensely furious at Eric for messing everything up for Francis. At that point I was like, ""This is a very frustrating movie."" I vaguely understood that the movie itself was drawing out other nuances in its last act, but I don't think I'll fully appreciate them until later.
What's darkly hilarious is that the whole experience is folded on top of itself. Movies are the club I go to, looking for that private dance, a dance which promises a magic connection that will make it possible to go on. Trashy or sublime, or both, there's something there, a hidden sweetness. There's a quest for satisfaction and also a secret desire to be stymied in that quest in the hopes that I might leave the club, stop repeating the quest endlessly, and start the real journey out of the past and into a more expansive present. Watching Exotica was one of those times when I grab for the brass ring and when it's over, my hands feel empty... and yet somehow there's more to the story than that. Maybe I wanted it to slip away.",4.0

"“You have to ask yourself what brought the person to this point.”
For a long while, Exotica seems to be about this question, posed at the very beginning to someone we don’t even realize will later become a (very minor) character. That sideways approach is what makes this film so seductive on first viewing, with its layered structure and slow-drip reveals persisting all the way to the chilling final shot. But its method turns out to be far more ambitious; with the picture filled in, the mystery is not what is happening but how deeply these characters truly figure in each other’s lives. Consider the last scene, which reveals little new on the surface (we already knew about the babysitting connection), but suggests psychological depths too oblique to put into words. In fact, all the answers we eventually get are both more mundane and more complex than they first appear. The film's heightened, beguiling remove masks unbearably raw emotions, the form reflecting how the characters manage their lives around unfathomable pain.
Writer/director Atom Egoyan finds a perfect metaphor in Exotica the strip club, where no one is allowed to touch but for the right price you can watch all you want. The thing is, to watch is not passive; Francis ultimately can’t observe Christina without assuming his own roles for her and her DJ ex alike, and all the one-way mirrors only mask the depths— both known and unknown— of everyone’s interconnectedness. And not in a facile “butterfly effect” kind of way (this isn’t Crash), but in terms of said roles we all play for each other, whether or not money changes hands. (“Don’t you get it? You soothed me.”) Otherwise, the script is surprisingly funny as well as slyly constructed; colorful threads like Thomas’ egg-smuggling only seem tangential plot-wise, but they add texture and key details to the thematic structure.
The greatness, however, comes from the gaps that are purposefully left. And the biggest gap is Christina, a potential cipher or plot device who becomes the aching heart of the film. The devastating ending occurs earliest chronologically, but her presence ends up re-focusing the narrative on a purely instinctual level. In his retrospective review, Ebert concludes that Egoyan knows “to know more is to forgive more”; Exotica makes that idea a visceral experience, while the ending suggests that no matter how much you know, there will always be more. Whatever it is that Francis does or did for Christina, we know by now that understanding is just an extra scene or two away. Why should knowing preclude forgiveness?

"With a few very funny glaring exceptions (ok I’m really just talking about the Cohen needledrop - a great bit, but decidedly “a bit” in ways that don’t do the overwhelming tone any favors, and the explicit callback to it in the movie’s present tense inciting incident renders it even sillier), just about every choice in this movie is as thoughtfully modulated as they come - an amusing irony in a movie about people this badly adjusted! Well, it’s mostly just the one guy, and he’s definitely one of the most transparently “we invented a cartoonishly fucked up dude to investigate the interiority of” characters ever written, but if you’re going to investigate the interiority of a fucked up dude you made up you could do a lot worse - probably couldn’t do better, in fact - than Greenwood’s performance. Similarly, I’m sympathetic to arguments that this is both too oblique and too obvious in the way it doles out information, but I have truly never seen anything split that difference so effectively - Luke (whose excited live reactions to this movie in the group chat spurred me to revisit it when I got home from band practice) mentioned Too Late, which is a good call, but even that’s a fundamentally different beast (Too Late’s director would know a thing or two about those!). This is an oddly specific point of comparison (that I eventually realized when thinking it over was explicitly describing Ursula K. LeGuin’s Always Coming Home lmao), but the way this paces out its narrative beats feels akin to an established author discovering epistolary fiction (which Exotica isn’t remotely - although, actually, considering the intrusion of private home video footage… hmm…) and committing to it so hard that they end up alienating all but the freaks who their grand experiment ends up meaning the world to. This movie doesn’t mean the world to me, and I’m ultimately not entirely convinced it means much of anything, but it’s a phenomenally potent object that hits like little else!

"This played out much differently than I had expected, and to say too much might spoil the beauty in how each layer of information stitches together the relationships that initially seem random, and only tangentially connected. Many have connected the setting of Exotica a ""gentleman's club"" of the same name, to how initial mysteries are stripped away, just as the performers in this very unique and genteel club remove layer after layer, finally revealing themselves. I think I saw it as just the opposite, and with every revelation about these seemingly unconnected characters, they become more fully drawn, and we understand the whole of each one, and their connections to each other. What we initially see is the raw structure, but as every layer of the story is added, we finally understand the heartbreaking truth of their intimate need for each other.
There's nothing clever, or engineered in all of this, and Egoyan isn't guilty of style over substance here. What initially seems to be arbitrary, slowly takes shape as each unusual pattern begins to be woven into the whole quilt. Probably because I've seen these mysteries wrapped inside of further mysteries films become a lure for explosive revelations or actions, I found myself imagining it heading down a predictable (but twisty) path, and I'm pleased to report that I was way off base.
Maybe, when I watch it again, I can figure out what Thomas, the ballet tickets, and the customs inspector have to do with this, but it was my first time seeing this, and I'm guessing that's a mystery that might reveal itself after another exposure.",4.5
It is a jungle out there. We are all voyeurs. The history of cinema is voyeurism. Egoyan’s best and quintessential. It perfectly captures all of his preoccupations perfectly. The weight of trauma is the heaviest. “We all don’t have the luxury of deciding what to do with our lives” is one of my favorite lines.,5.0
"This movie hits differently at 40 than at 20. The final scene will be forever burned into my memory. Addiction, trauma, how we deal with trauma, bad choices, good choices, and everything in between. I was blessed to have not really experienced trauma when I first watched this film. In the 20 years since , I've dealt with severe trauma. Some of my own doing. Some not. Either way, how does one continue on living? I'm still working on that. Which in a way is a victory.

A film about contrasts—seeing, watching others, perceiving them in the way you want, letting their existence soothe, giving you the unattainable, letting them take you out of yourself, bringing you into a different time, letting you pretend; allowing you to become another, letting you live a dream—if only for a moment.
Really just a film about finding comfort in others and the sharing in pain.

I didn't remember until partly into Exotica that this was one of those films that was on the IFC roster in the late nineties, and that I had caught the last half hour of it, accidentally, late one night. What I was surprised to find out as it progressed tonight, was an overwhelming feeling of gratefulness that this film (and its devastating sense of unrequited longing) exists.
An immensely rewarding experience.

"Exotica is an erotic thriller set in an strip club in Toronto, Canada, and deals with a strong cast of characters who are all dealing with their own emotional issues.  
While Exotica is seductive and titillating, its true strength relies in the strength of its analysis into human emotions and the struggle of loss.

"Truly a perfect film. Every single thing is a trick mirror— you expect one thing, often something sinister, and come out w something just so profoundly sad. Many objects have fake versions (ie a fake parrot and real parrot, real plants and fake plants) to the point where you’re unsure of what’s the expectation and what’s the reality. Elias Koteas is absolutely perfect and unfortunately, just like me for real (born on March 11). Absolutely brilliant film!",5.0
"The way depression, trauma, obsession, and loneliness is depicted in Exotica is enthralling, because we're used to movies of those themes to be more uplifting. This is not.
This film portrays deplorable actions, brought on by suffering from a cast of characters that are oddly intertwined with one another.
This felt influenced by David Lynch works. It's not at all raunchy, the ambiance felt even quiet and tasteful. The way this was structured in terms of how the layers were slowly peeled I thought was magnificent.
NOTE: I swear, Mia Kirshner bore a striking resemblance to Ana de Armas.

"First off, shoutout to emma for inspiring tonight’s Egoyan double feature.
Alright, this fucked me up. Won’t be able to organize my thoughts too well, but: 
There is just a lot - A LOT - to say about the music and how it so perfectly coaxes out the film’s musings on colonialism. ‘94 would’ve been a little late in the game for a film to offer commentary on the late 80s/early 90s Sting/Paul Simon/Enigma-led New Age/World Music trend - a trend fueled by wealthy white north american yuppies whose reaganism had reignited their colonizer impulse to ~collect exotic things~ - but no matter, I’ve only seen Cheryl Dunye in Watermelon Woman and Spike Lee in Jungle Fever nail it better, and that’s incredible company for Atom to be in. Consider just the minor character of Harold alone - who may or may not have pursued an affair with a Black woman because of his own colonizer impulse; who wears a Bob Marley tshirt and keeps a parrot on his shoulder; who lives in an obvious slum for reasons passing white yuppie understanding. Did his colonialist desire mirror the desire of whomever murdered Francis’ daughter? Is his relegation to a wheelchair as a form of cultural othering punishment an idea that feels chillingly familiar to me as the child of a paraplegic baby boomer yuppie who also bought those same Anita Baker cds and ordered that same Indigenous pottery from World Bazaar? And this is before even beginning to talk about the pet store and the strip club and the subtext (ok, text) of commodification inherent in those settings and plot threads. 
Also Frank if you see this, I love that the tease in your review about one character’s background being necessarily unclear for most of the film actually had me looking in an entirely different direction. And the fact that I didn’t even notice how little I knew about another character ended up playing completely into the film’s eventual empathy for that character.
Some may watch this movie and not find a way in to relating - I think, on the surface, the seediness could prompt some to keep it at a distance.
But I watched this and thought about all of us. As individuals, and as a species. I think it’s needless to say - we definitely aren’t in the clean-shaven Bruce Greenwood/Mia Kirschner with braces part of our story anymore. Not by a long shot. We’re all well past that now. We’re in Exotica.

"Strong performances, a depth of emotion, and intelligent directing from Atom Egoyan make this Canadian “erotic thriller” quite a contrast to the big American film set in a strip club the following year, Showgirls, and I mean that in a good way. The way the story is pieced together is a gradual reveal, intriguing at each step of the way, and the theme of grieving becomes more powerful than anything else. Egoyan establishes the fact that were at a strip club, but he doesn’t beat us over the head with gratuitous nudity. There is a melancholy atmosphere achieved through moody cinematography, helped by the use of the Leonard Cohen song “Everybody Knows,” which fit perfectly.
I didn’t quite connect with it on the same level as others did, however. The main issue for me was in the father (Bruce Greenwood) becoming mesmerized by a stripper with a “schoolgirl” routine (Mia Kirshner) after his daughter had died. There is a reason for it that we eventually see, but it didn’t ring true, and aside from that, ew. I just couldn’t imagine a distraught father turning to this as his outlet, and in any event, connecting this kind of grief with that kind of eroticism seemed odd/disturbing to me.
More realistic was the relationship the man has with his niece (15 year old Sarah Polley), and how the reality behind that was slowly filled in was brilliant. The way the pet shop owner/smuggler (Don McKellar) was eventually connected was also very well done, and there are some interesting parallels in what that character gets up to (e.g. secret desires, the ballet instead of the strip club). All in all this is one where I liked the artistry in the weaving process more than the completed whole. Worth checking out though.",3.5

"A Cronenbergian battle between isolation and contact, loneliness and empathy played against a backdrop of perverse Canadian modernity.

One I look forward to returning to.",4.0
A true work of art in erotica 🤨,5.0
"Yeah, this film is quite something. I think definitely Egoyan’s best work. What’s fascinating about it is that it rather ingeniously makes you question how we view relationships and really if we are honest about relationships we have to admit that all of them in a way are self serving, all in a way serve a similar emotional purpose and it’s the morality we have about what each things “means” that makes them different. So we place different value and meaning on them truly based on those ground. It’s a cynical work, at first glance, but if you sit with it for a while you realize it’s actually advocating for a better understanding of relationships that makes the transactional nature of them less negative. 
It’s really a strong pic, and makes you remember how good the mid 90’s were in being honest about this civilization of humanity we have built.",4.5

"This is one of Canada's finest films and Atom Egoyan's magnum opus. Exotica lives deep in the seedy underbelly of the titillating mid-90s. Egoyan's film isn't the sleaze of Show Girls but a deeply humanistic film that sinks deep into your soul.
Set in a non-linear structure that focuses on various character all connected to a club called Exotica. We don't understand what connects them until Egoyan reveals more during the film. This is a film about the mundanity of life and how we are creatures of habit. Egoyan focuses on our deep moral and emotional issues and on a human level we connect.

"A heart-wrenching, cathartic, elegiac masterpiece.
The following was originally published in The Indiependent.
The pleasure and pain of a striptease is structured around the anticipation of a reveal.
Item by item, the dancer sheds their clothing until their body is bare: a vulnerable corporeality that titilates and disarms the watcher. Exotica, Atom Egoyan’s 1995 masterpiece, structures itself as such, gently unveiling more and more of its storyline slowly and teasingly. As each layer is delicately shed, we only become more involved and emotional; when we get the full reveal, literally and metaphorically, we’re awash with an intense feeling of catharsis.
Similar to the way Magnolia or even Love Actually give us snippets of an ensemble cast, in Exotica, we aren’t sure how the group of disparate characters are connected. Eschewing the traditional three-part structure to film writing, Egoyan gradually allows us more clarity as the film goes on, like a camera imperceptibly going into focus. Each character has something to hide that they must gradually reveal to the audience, including how their secret relates to one another. Thomas is a pet shop owner who imports the eggs of exotic birds in an undercover operation worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Francis is the depressed tax auditor hired to uncover his operation. He visits exotic dancer Christina every other day at the strip club she works at. She wars with her ex-lover Eric, the club’s emcee, who taunts her at every opportunity. He has impregnated the club’s owner Zoe (meaning ‘life’ in Greek), who, like Thomas, I suppose, is metaphorically incubating an egg of her own. And so the circle of life continues. These are tales of people desperately in need of love and care, or they will splatter.
Despite its marketing as such, as an erotic thriller, Exotica is not particularly erotic and hardly thrilling. There are no sex scenes, a distinct lack of lust and no crime that is actually followed through with. The tone is more elegiac and contemplative, a philosophical mystery of sorts. Many who love the genre for its femme fatales and trench-coated cops may have been let down by this quietly heartwrenching film about the manifestation of grief. It’s about looking, too, but it would be too simple and trite to call Exotica a film about voyeurism simply because of its setting in a strip club. The space is structured like a panopticon—a circular prison with cells arranged around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be watched. The club’s two-way mirrors force characters to confront both the way that they see themselves and the way that they are perceived by others.
With the plot’s aforementioned secretive nature being part and parcel of the film’s structure, the use of the song “Everybody Knows” is somewhat ironic. Leonard Cohen’s sexy, gravelly baritone repeats those two words over and over as Christina does her Catholic schoolgirl dance routine, gyrating as he sings: “Everybody knows that it’s now or never / Everybody knows that it’s me or you / And everybody knows that you live forever / When you’ve done a line or two.” Later on, Eric schemes to have Francis barred from the stripclub by encouraging him to touch Christina, which is against the club rules. “She’s into touching,” he lies. “Everybody knows.”
In a column instalment last month, I discussed how William Friedkin’s Jade made lazy, offensive links to Asian culture that only served to fetishize women and made no efforts to engage with the imagery being deployed. Egyptian-born Egoyan plays on the imagery of bathhouses and gilded furniture, with the interiors of Exotica serving to directly critique this kind of Orientalism that has long been associated with sex work. “Just because they’re exotic,” Francis says in reference to Thomas’ birds, “doesn’t mean they can’t endure extremes.” The natural (lush ferns and greenery) and the synthetic (elaborate paintings, stark lighting) clash headily, and the opening suggests as such. A slowly tracking camera films the club’s foliage, dry ice and spotlight, as Mychael Danna’s haunting score – which draws inspiration from Middle Eastern and Indian music, and was recorded in Bombay – kicks in. We eventually happen upon two security guards gazing through a window at Thomas with the opening line: “You have to ask yourself, what brought the person to this point?” Something that, evidently, becomes the eternal question of the entire film.
The questionable opulence of this seedy location bolsters the film’s religious imagery, with the club acting as an ersatz Garden of Eden (one of Danna’s tracks is entitled “Snake Dance”). The use of the colour green is imperative in understanding Exotica’s visual language, representing the fine line between nature and artifice in yet another ploy to make us question what we think we know. While Eric can conjure up bravado in his position as emcee, clad in his parrot-green work shirt, preening high above the punters like some kind of deity in his DJ booth, back at his apartment we see that his life is void of colour: barely a step above a prison cell with stained white walls, a mattress and a cluster of empty bottles.
In the time ‘before’ the plot’s yet-unknown tragedy, the colour green features in luscious fields and family photographs. Post-tragedy, green appears to crudely light up murky fish tanks, neon lights in seedy clubs and is painted on dirty toilet cubicles that entrap characters at their most vulnerable. One relationship that is interesting to examine is that between Francis and Christina; it’s originally assumed that Francis is lusting after the dancer, who he pays for private dances – until we learn that she is his “angel” who he feels he must “protect,” for reasons that become clearer as the film progresses. The angelic imagery (her oversized white shirt, unbuttoned and flowing by her sides, function as wings) only bolsters the film’s religious symbolism, but also makes sense considering its philosophical tone.
In this hinterland of lost souls and grief, only the most grandiose metaphor makes sense to explore the characters’ pain. It’s in direct contradiction to the world portrayed on a surface level; porny schoolgirl fantasies and confusing role-play fall away to reveal fantasies of the asexual kind, fantasies rooted in psychological pain in order to mask tragedies. Exotica is a prime example of the ‘show, don’t tell’ form of filmmaking that entrusts the viewer to seek details and meaning—a true masterpiece of the 1990s and standout in the erotic thriller canon.",5.0

"Exotica is the sort of non-linear film that purposefully keeps much of its information jumbled and hidden from its audience. We aren't given much context for who exactly these characters are, and their relationships/dynamics with one another are initially vague. It's not even entirely clear what's brought them to this point, and as a result it may not make total sense at first, but if you stick with the film, and let the puzzle pieces fall into place, you'll find yourself face to face with an interesting examination of trauma/grief, and the lengths some go to get past it.
Our story bounces back and forth between Thomas (McKellar), an exotic pet shop owner, and a lonely auditor named Francis (Greenwood), who regularly frequents the film's titular strip club: Exotica. It's there that Francis has developed a strange fixation with one of the club's most popular dancers: Christina (Kirshner), a young woman most known for her racy schoolgirl dance routine. It's an odd relationship that the two form, as Francis has seemingly become dependent on the brief, almost therapeautic interactions he has with Christina.
In spite of its setting, Exotica is not trying to be a sexy stripper film. There are seductive dance scenes, sure- but there's a subdued air of sadness that lingers over several of the characters; one that seems to have brought them all together. Club Exotica just so happens to be their latest stop.
One of my favorite things about Exotica, is its soundtrack, which I have been repeatedly listening to since I first watched the film. The score, which is composed by Mychael Danna, is so diverse and vibrant, feauturing an Indian-inspired soundscape that gives the club sequences a unique, almost mystical feel.
It's the damndest thing. I wasn't too crazy about Exotica when I initially finished watching it (its style and fragmented story structure left me a bit cold), but I haven't been able to stop thinking about the film. Having now seen it in its entirety, I'm actually looking forward to giving it a rewatch. I'm curious to see what other things I'll pick up on the second time around, now that I have the whole picture.",3.5
"I was grateful, when we came to this film from Canadian writer/director Atom Egoyan for our Tuesday movie night, that I had watched his previous film Calendar (1993) the night before because Egoyan, in an interview on the Criterion DVD extras, linked the films, because they share similar structures, and because watching/gaze is a fundamental guide to unpacking the storylines in the films. 
What makes Exotica such a remarkable movie experience is the gradually dawning realisation about what links these characters together and, in that context, almost any synopsis is going to rob you of some of that pleasure, so I will provide a brief introduction to the characters and then urge you to check out the film for yourself.  
Zoe (Egoyan’s wife, Arsinée Khanjian) manages Exotica, a jungle-themed strip club in Toronto, that she inherited from her father.  She is (very) pregnant with the baby of the club’s DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas), although they are not a couple and seem not even romantically involved.  Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood), a tax accountant with Revenue Canada, is a regular at the club (several nights a week) where he books a table dance each night with one of the strippers, Christina (Mia Kirschner) whose act involves stripping from a schoolgirl uniform to Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows”.  Eric and Christina used to be a couple and his jealousy towards Francis is palpable.
Francis has no children but pays Tracey (Sarah Polley), the teenage daughter of his paraplegic brother, Harold (Victor Garber), to “babysit” his daughter, Lisa, who had been kidnapped and murdered shortly before the car accident that killed his wife and led to his brother being confined to a wheelchair.  We also see Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), a gay man who runs an exotic pet store, when Francis is sent to audit his books.  Thomas has a major undeclared income stream from smuggling eggs of the rare hyacinth macaw into Canada.  
As we experience a discontinuous narrative involving these characters, gaze becomes critical to keeping track of developments and time shifts.  In Calendar, gaze was important.  The photographer (played by Egoyan) is looking at Armenian churches and framing them for the photographs he is taking for his commission to generate a calendar.  He is also watching the growing relationship between his wife (Arsinée Khanjian) and their driver/guide (Ashot Adamyan), both directly and through the viewfinder in his video camera.  It is these videotapes that he uses to generate the scenario that he watches a string of women from an escort agency reenact.
In Exotica, the act of looking takes on an added dimension.  In the strip club, the punters watch the strippers and are watched, in turn, by the club’s bouncers whose job includes enforcing the club’s “no touching” rule.  Eric watches Christina and Francis from his DJ booth and Zoe, aware of Eric’s jealousy, watches him and also watches what is happening in the club through one way mirrors in her office.  Harold is being watched by a customs officer (David Hemblen) who has observed him through a one way mirror in the arrivals hall at the airport when he was smuggling in several macaw eggs and has had him under surveillance ever since.  And most tellingly, Tracey observes her father and her uncle and seems the most grounded character in the film, even though she is a teenager.
As these characters interact, the story touches on identity and alienation, guilt and remorse, dysfunctional people and dysfunctional relationships and sex as a commodity or a resource of power.  Cinematographer Paul Sarossy lights and shoots the club scenes in a way that amplifies the exotic decor - the club is very much a place where Francis and the other punters enter into a fantasy world in which they can (for $5 a song), shut out the real world.
The striptease metaphor is upfront and, initially, it seemed as though each plot point, as it landed, was peeling away another layer on the path to exposing what links these characters together.  But as that central story began to tentatively emerge, it seemed to me that what Egoyan was doing was not so much peeling away the layers as collapsing them into the core event that ties these characters together and the ongoing trauma and grief that flows from it.
Egoyan gets great performances from all his cast but the standouts for me are Greenwood and Polley.  Francis might look like a boring tax accountant who tries to bury his grief about his murdered daughter by paying his niece to “babysit” her and paying a stripper in a school uniform to keep picking the scab off that particular sore (much as the photographer had done with the escorts in Calendar).  But under that boring exterior is a painful history that drives his current behaviour and emotional state and Greenwood is very subtle in giving us hints about that history.  At another level, the audience’s gaze is also important.  You need to pay attention as Egoyan, and Mychael Danna’s superb score, do not telegraph that another significant piece of information is about to land.  
Polley is my MVP and her performance is remarkable from a 15 year old.  In a conversation with Egoyan recorded for the Criterion release, she says that her experiences as a child actor had soured her approach to acting and she had decided to quit permanently once her contract had expired for the TV series Road to Avonlea (1990-96).  However, a relation of hers was working with Egoyan on casting the film and they were having trouble finding someone young enough to play Tracey but emotionally mature enough to carry her story arc.  Polley read the screenplay over Christmas, because it was lying around, and then lobbied her relative and Egoyan to get the role.  While the film picked up a swag of awards, including the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes 1994, I was surprised that her performance was not nominated.
The two disc DVD release from Criterion is packed with extras: an audio commentary by Egoyan and composer Mychael Danna; Calendar and three short films, Peep Show (1981), En Passant (1991) and Artaud Double Bill (2007), a short film made for the Cannes 60th anniversary; the fascinating Egoyan/Polley conversation; the audio file from the Cannes 1994 media conference for the film; and an excellent essay by Jason Wood in the enclosed booklet.",5.0
"EXOTICA is hypnotic as the story is seductively and slowly revealed over the run time. The characters are connected in ways that you won't expect. And it's not until the final scene that the full picture is finally revealed to the audience. Someone going into this for their first viewing will benefit by not knowing much about it.
This was my second viewing and again, I was mesmerized and fully absorbed into the story. As I knew the overall story this time, I was able to appreciate this film on another level. This is such an intricately crafted piece of filmmaking from director Atom Egoyan. I truly wish films like this were still being made today.",4.5
"Most times I can get down with movies like this that exist exclusively as a weird, obscure late-night vibe. This one didn't quite capture me. Just felt like a not-as-good Blue Velvet at times. Elias Koteas is a solid actor though.",3.0
"The shot that lingers most from Egoyan’s mysterious, sprawling film is of a grassy hill. Idyllic, lonely, the image just hangs there until some distant movement stirs and rises, a sparse line of people walking from the other side. They’re searching for a missing person who wouldn’t be in the grass if still alive. And that’s how the characters, their connections, and core motivations are all revealed: slowly, delicately, toward something much darker than expected. 
The central relationship (the psychic and emotional center, though basically a subplot) is an audacious feat of imagination and insight: intergenerational, sexual, symbiotic, marked by profound intimacy and empathy, maybe therapeutic or maybe very, very fucked up. It’s unlike any I can recall in fiction, and its believability alone is an achievement, particularly given that some questions are left unanswered; they’re explicitly asked, but of course the characters would find something ineffable in their bond. 
Much credit to Mia Kirshner. She rages in her scenes with Koteas and seems possessed by compassion with Greenwood. And possessed seems like the right word, the way it all but consumes her character, Christina. She has a fearlessness in being open to others, any vulnerability made possible by her sense of self. Kirshner would’ve been 18 during shooting. 
Fourteen-year-old Sarah Polley plays a precocious teenager, and yes, that still counts as acting. Mychael Danna’s score, with oud and shehnai out front, suits both the dark themes and the tacky strip-club setting. Then there’s that bitter Leonard Cohen song: In context, it’s improbable, almost comic if it wasn’t also perverse and bracing — it’s Egoyan’s brilliance here in a nutshell.",5.0
"The first hour of this was special, you enter a world with mysterious atmosphere and meet a bunch of weird characters. I'm being a bit harsh because I liked the beginning so much, but I think this just explained too much by the end.

"Shades of Jim Jarmusch and Wong Kar-wai in this meditative tale of grief, bereavement and a strip club with a theme. Shot and set in Toronto, this is another one of those quintessential Canadian movies that raised the profile of Canadian cinema worldwide. I had previously only seen a couple of movies from director Atom Egoyan and enjoyed them both (The Sweet Hereafter is particularly touching), and after I got recommended this as another solid entry for Canadian best movies, I had to check it out.
I really enjoyed its almost aimless-at-first narrative structure before the pieces are revealed. It feels very vignette-y, and that is almost by design, until a lot of things start to overlap as the movie continues.
An auditor who frequents a strip club but doesn't seem to get any carnal pleasure out of it. Melancholy never looked more desolate than in the stooped shoulders and bearded face of Bruce Greenwood.
An exotic animals shopkeeper who also smuggles species across borders, and goes on sojourns at the ballet looking for companionship.
A stripper with a heart of a gold, a clichéd and hackneyed #womenwrittenbyman character, but given a lot of depth by Mia Kirshner who spends considerable amount writhing to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows.
A precocious teenage girl, played by the precocious Sarah Polley (another seminal Canadian director - I'm really sorry I couldn't attend a Q&A with her that was held 10 days ago in Toronto, here's hoping there's always next time!).
A strip club emcee who is as creepy as that sounds. Elias Koteas doesn't have a lot of problem bringing in the creep factor.
All these souls collide in a mellow tale of moving on, finding comfort after tragedy, and forging connections in a world where the body is cheap, but the heart is priceless. Good stuff from Egoyan, and full marks again for using Toronto as Toronto.",3.5
Exotica blew me away! This is my favorite kind of movie so I might be a little biased. But wow! Atom Egoyan weaves together a beautifully crafted and unique puzzle. A complex character study with all the allure of a sexy thriller. The film nails the mysterious nature of human emotions by revealing the characters slowly and allowing the audience to piece it all together.,5.0

"Criterion Spine #1150
Mini Collab with Nick Langdon. Check out his review here. When I saw Exotica on his watchlist I knew it was time to give this movie with such an alluring name and poster a whirl. I have seen the film everywhere on Letterboxd since Criterion added it to its collection in 2022. Criterion's branding is likely giving the film more recognition, and they deserve a round of applause. The film is mesmerizing. A young, brooding Bruce Greenwood. Victor Garber in a Bob Marley shirt. Impeccable set design. Stripping to Leonard Cohen. Can it get more Canadian?
I don't have much to say from a critical lens at this point because I am so struck by the film's vibe. The score has been on my mind all day. I listened to Mychael Danna's work on the way to and from work today. Those scenes in the Exotica itself are so well lit, so well executed. Mia Kirshner is enchanting. Elias Koteas and Don McKellar execute their supporting roles perfectly. This could likely be a five star movie for me down the line, but for I now I want to let it continue to marinate in my mind.

"One of my favourite things in film is an authentically seedy bar/club with a slightly tragic atmosphere and whose patrons have the air of guilt-ridden partners; essentially quite pathetic people just about surviving on shit, warm beers and soundtracked by music that veers dangerously close to being that truly shameful thing - jazz.
Exotica absolutely nails it and throws in a deliciously slowly revealing story of unimaginable grief to occupy that most sordid of place. It's a very horny, booze-soaked late-night questionable indulgence of a movie, so if nothing else it's at least highly relatable to those of a certain persuasion.",4.0

"Second viewing. A lot of my friends on here adore this movie to bits and seeing movies that people I know recommend has become so much more important to me than seeing ones recommended by some critic ill never meet or some ""best of all time"" list that exists for clicks. Maybe this has set me up with some high expectations and hype...both things that ive really tried to fight and resist feeling over the years, always seeking a clean and open viewing experience.
BUT
idk I do love it, lol its silly for me to feel like I should apologize for a positive 4 star review lol I think its a wonderful hypnotic film that sticks with you of course of course it is. Perhaps what keeps me from joining the ""Exotica is a 5 star movie"" club is my relationship to plot, scripting, and twists and how they so often are not the thing that makes a film experience trip into the sublime/divine for me. I appreciate the intricate MASTERFUL way this guy unravels his complex yarn, and really do appreciate its rewatch value for that fact (I look forward to exploring it in the future again). Twists and turns are exciting to me, unfortunately they dont seem to thrill me to the extent that they thrill certain viewers, which is probably why I only watch movies and am more or less allergic to most dramatic TV shows even if they are well made and suck me in from time to time (only for an episode or 4). Script technique and dramatic arch's are important to me (spillin the tea, he said she said, oh i see what ya did there stuff) but what resonates most is always (surprise surprise for sloth) the unspoken aspect, the aesthetics. What I love is the ghostly late night out FEELING that this strange world evokes, the feeling that you have crossed into some kind of ""other place.""
Why parrots? Why the jungle? Why ballet? Why Exotica...the name which recalls a time in the past where white upper middle class folks put out tiki torches and danced to the ""foreign sounds"" of Les Baxter and the like? There are plenty of answers that one could speculate on that would make good answers and good discussion in a reading/film group (ritualistic repetition of the verbal and physical kinks, wants and preferences we have ""dont say master, say daddy"" ""dont say vagina, dont say pussy"" ""wear the top hat this time, you know i like it better when you wear the top hat"" ((lol sry))... the exotic world of the fantasies we all reach for but are impossible and in the reaching for create a strange NEW thing etc.). Run wild with it all. Mostly I dont care too much. It works and it evokes and I love that fantasy world of this club and its mysterious history.
The dreaminess does filter into the reality, and the way the characters interact, which is usually something I kind of adore, but here, the sort of stilted, unreal, Lynch quality some of the conversations take on (mostly between Christina and the pregnant lady own...idk movie people names) feels...well, stilted and weird...like sometimes Christina is a bad actress and I kept wondering if she was whenever it came to certain scenes...physical acting and her presence in the movie is enchanting. Also I know the opening line with the cops giving the thesis of the movie is a hypnotizing note for those who are initiated but to me it just seems like second rate Lynch.
I really do love how this movie explores the deeper world that is behind sexual gratification and kink. Sex as gateway. Certain physical behavior, the use of certain ""magic"" words, playing a part, these all point to many things that are non sexual, in fact innocuous in some cases. There are things we want, ways we want to feel, dreams we want to inhabit that are impossible, but something like intimacy can be a way in, or at least a way of getting a bit of what you've always wanted even if it is only for an hour or so with relative stranger. It can be a beautiful thing, but it can be a vulnerable, even dangerous place to try to find, but even a peak at heaven is more often than not, worth the trouble.

"So rarely do we view the erotic as anything more than a means to a orgasm, a surface thrill to prompt drool and ejaculate. With Exotica, Egoyan opens up the full spectrum of emotions that can tie into eroticism, creating a heightened reality where sex is felt most through its after effects. Each strand of the narrative centres sexual encounters as a framework to understand human connection, rather than just physical fraternising. It’s a means to grieve, a means to forget, a means to construct the self. All of that adds up to very thoughtful and intellectually engaged melodrama, and one that earns its emotional impacts.",4.0

"""It's like a dream"" is a phrase that I use probably too much when I write about films. Wild surreal fantasies involving impossible feats or creatures, hazy cinematography, and Lynch type doppelgangers naturally call this phrase into ones mind, but Exotica, for me at least, strikes me as dream like in a more authentic way. While I do have the insane Stan Brakhage style trip dreams from time to time, most of my memorable dreams feel like this. Exotica is played straight with few over the top cinematic flourishes, and similarly with dreams, its individual plot points don't seem all that strange until they start to stack up and escalate, or until after it is all over that one slowly realizes with every little factoid just how strange and farfetched it all truly was...how bizarre, almost humorous it was that you traversed it all with minimal doubts about its strangeness. The same can be said for infatuation, and fascination, two words that are melted down and used as the raw material that keeps Exotica together. When you are lost in obsession you can suddenly wake up and look back at what you've done to get to where you are with a scratch of the head, as if it had happened to someone else...the things you had entertained...the things you had said yes to ...the things you should or shouldn't have ever said yes to.
MUSICAL INTERLUDE FOR THIS REVIEW: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebLJy_8bvi4&list=PLyw5JONFDXk8mQqqL3kzAuSMyS0gGNazG
EXOTICA! The trend of exotica or tiki or whatever you want to call it began in the 50s when soldiers returned to boring suburbs with their wartime memories of being stationed on faraway islands. Half remembered, hazy, probably drunk, memories were translated into middle American backyard parties that by the mid sixties were already being deemed, tacky and even problematic. Regardless, exotica has always been a fascination for me. Its a type of music as well as a vibe, a Frankenstein's monster of borrowed ideas and cultural sounds, sights and outfits that attempt to replicate the made up idea of ""the exotic."" An attempt to replicate something alien, and foreign by using the familiar. A paradox, an impossibility. Just like trying to force someone to love you, like trying to bring someone back from the dead...
Is any of this making sense/cohering nicely at the end of all this? Idk probably not...this is a hard movie to talk about. I dont want to try and trivialize or tarnish its beauty and mystery with a lot of genre diagnosing, metaphore-splaining or cross examinations of its unique and intricate plot map. Dreams, love, sex, infatuation, obsession, hallucination. Words can overflow over these subjects but rarely ever do them justice. They are things that must be experienced...just like this movie (which I am very eager to return to).

I could’ve watched them for hours and hours. Also because Egoyan never goes where he thinks he’s going. It’s one of the rare stories during which pretty much anything could happen— no matter how preposterous— and I’d have accepted it. I also adore whatever journey Koteas is in. He’s so deeply fascinating here. To top it all off, Mychael Danna delivers what has immediately become one of my all time favorite scores.",4.5

Egoman treats his characters with such empathy in how their parts play out in the movie, I was just wanting a bigger and better “aha!” moment at the end.",3.5

Ok, I can see why people got behind this and while it strings you along with the story, by the end I wasn’t in it.

Fell flat on a few levels especially with Koteas who was just useless. Kirshner was the only good actor in the lot with her mystery and allure. 
Score, wow. Mychael Danna’s score really was… something else. In some places it sounded like a Muslimgauze record played at half speed or maybe Enigma doing a collaboration with Dead Can Dance? It was the only thing I probably left with that was kinda cool.

I remember Exotica being heavily marketed as art house cool. Appropriately it played the upscale Lumiere on St Martin’s Lane, London. That cinema is now a neon-lit gym. 
Perhaps that sums up the dead-end of watching/flexing/transacting in this otherwise false trichotomy where The Garden of Eden is the Exotica strip club which is somehow the human condition. Give me a break.
With the club emcee a whispering serpent (cue snake-charming musical motif) and kicking-out-then-hugging Jophiel, forbidden fruit in the form of the look-don’t-touch lap dancers and the unsubtle flora motifs staged like a neon Henri Roseau (more accurately an unpicking of the quiet misery of Edward Hopper) this is bogus stuff indeed.
Simplistic metaphors are one thing, but here they’re so arid in assembly as to be painfully hidebound - strippers as gazed-upon caged animals and very etcetera. I don’t think these characters have visited Life, let alone Exotica.

I’d have to watch this like ten more times in my life to get it. maybe some of those times will be this year, who’s to say; can easily picture myself bumping this up to a 5 next time. there’s about four or five other filmmakers whom this style reminded me of, and yet this feels wholly singular to Egoyan (I can’t wait to check out the rest of his films).

The greatest achievement of this film is how composed and calm it remains on the external level, despite gradually hinting more and more at a subterranean ugliness. That the film never goes where one expects it to, and manages slickly to convey through a longing glance, a particular intonation, or a perfectly timed pause, what lesser filmmakers would spell out directly, is a testament to Egoyan's mastery, and the assured performances of a brilliant ensemble cast.

"Shoutout to the god Frank Ritz for plugging this film first and foremost.
One of the first Canadian films I've ever seen that shares a remarkably Canadian sensibility, the idea even in these sprawling metropolitan landscapes, everyone is intertwined, all families know each other, and news travels fast and hits close to home. The finale here hits quite different in light of recent events in Portapique, where even this small, shithole podunk village had tragedy that ran directly back to my backyard.
Shares the same sort of hypnogogia of Eyes Wide Shut, the use of repetition creating this bizarre sense of a recurring nightmare you can't quite shake, the same images creating a greater sense of unease with more exposure. Combining that with a commendable expositional restraint, providing context three scenes later than any other film would have, letting the mind run wild with possible solutions, all of them just a hair less unsettling than the truth.
In terms of the actual plot here, it does border a bit on being completely implausible from an American sensibility, but in a country where a lot more gets around and even more goes unspoken, rings remarkably true.

"the readymade and reverse-engineered puzzlebox picture is very seldom pleasurable, but koteas puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in my life here. he is horrid, a walking sleaze-artifact, mannerisms wetly slipping out of his mouth in cryptic tongues. beyond him: still pretty into egoyan's ellipsis-abundant structure, just don't know that it works terribly well when projected onto a narrative so clearly begging for a, well, less temporally punctuated format.

"Ah I have really missed Atom Egoyan movies. It may be time to touch base once again. Not as heart-rending as The Sweet Hereafter, but like a warm up to that one. Seeing those old 20s and 2 dollar bills being thrown around in a strip club really sent me back.",5.0
"Quintessentially Canadian, watched on National Canadian Film Day (by accident, but more likely the unknown forces in life pulled us towards making that choice). Leave it to Atom to grand slam this slow burn that deals with loneliness, depression, grief and how a single event can tie the lives of so many together. Revenge best served with an emotionally charged hug, rather than a bang.
The Criterion looks absolutely gorgeous, letting us drink up all of the greenery from the club to the uncleaned tanks in the pet store. The music, the tone, the time jumping, all works in synch to drip-release what you need to know when you need to know it .

EXOTICA — Atom Egoyan's lush and affecting sixth feature — deals with loneliness, tragedy, sadness, survival, despair, forgiveness, passion and perversions. The cast is a veritable who's who of Canadian acting greats, too. The motif of touching vs. watching perfectly mirrors the emotional arc of the film. One of the most achingly tragic films I've ever seen.",3.5
"Exotica is one of the most polarizing films I’ve seen in quite a while. On one hand, it’s a seductively beautiful and taboo examination of a vine of intertwined characters who all share a collective trauma. This alone forms the blueprint for a riveting psychological masterpiece, but on the other hand, I had some serious trouble getting myself to immerse into this spiraling labyrinth, not because of any structural issues but my sole concern lays solely on the characters and dialogue. I, personally, could not muster up the empathy or even enough disdain to really care about any of the main focal points of the film. It is a character driven film, with characters motives being the catalyst for this unwinding mystery, but when the stage you’ve set focuses on three extremely sketchy, alienated characters that I could never see myself actually encountering in real life, it is very very difficult to call this a masterpiece of social & psychological brilliance. Exotica is a brilliant film, it is undoubtedly gorgeously shot and has an undeniable sexy aura, but some of the ugliness that seeps through feels a bit too alien and disingenuous to me. This one DEFINITELY deserves a rewatch down the road, I could rate this anywhere between 2.5 and 4.5 and I think I’d be confident, so for now I’m just leaving it right in the middle. What a film…",3.5

"Holy shit. So much to say about this, so little brain power at the moment to say it. The nature of sex here perceived less as capitalistic sustenance and power dynamics, and more of emotional survival, whilst also weaving this reflection of sex through scrutiny of the transactional nature of relationships; never resigning to nihilism or horror, but searching for empathy and a sense of emotional balance and acceptance, perhaps best found through the catharsis of the truth, some of which lies latent inward. Thoughtfully planted and emotionally precise — many times it’s pure genius.",4.5
Easily the sexiest movie ever made that features an audit in its plot.,4.0
"Kind of speechless right now, but I’m going to try and put what I thought of this film in words.
Exotica is more concerned with what isn’t said than what is. There are concealed clues behind bathroom stalls and airport security mirrors that propel the narrative forward. In that way, Egoyan places the audience firmly in the role of detective, author, and protagonist, using what he scatters around the film as leads which write the characters. It’s our job to connect the dots between these clues, and it’s an absolutely twisted delight.
The film is interactive in that way, stringing along the audience in a non-mystery with a totally mysterious tone. Even more than making the viewers detectives, Egoyan begs viewers to scrape into our own personal traumas and relate to his troubled characters.
That made no sense but neither did the film, at least not completely. Loved it.",5.0
"Una película siglos en mi watchlist (principalmente porque Mike D’Angelo la ama) y el anuncio de Criterion fue el empujoncito que necesitaba
Atom Egoyan reúne a un super cast de actores canadienses en un strip club salido de disneylandia circa 1990 y los pone a tristear intensamente. Funciona porque está estructurada como un muy bien planteado misterio, lleno de hilos que no tienes idea cómo se van a juntar. Al final, cuando lo hacen, te vuela la cabeza un poco y te rompe el corazón un tanto.
Sí me encantó, pero todo lo que me encantó de ella siento que está en The Sweet Hereafter y allá funciona mejor.",4.5
"Good god, this was heavy. “Exotica” had been on and off my radar ever since I watched “Remember” last year, starring the late Christopher Plummer in a twisted revenge fantasy as a Holocaust survivor with dementia tracking down the Nazi who murdered his family. That one was intense as well, and also did a terrific job unpeeling its character and their motivations until you just felt unsettled and hollowed out. “Exotica” similarly keeps much of the important information close to its chest at first, and we aren’t quite sure how these characters overlap with each other beyond just the obvious interactions on screen. Initially, it’s more than just a little unnerving and creepy. Francis, a tax auditor played by an uncharacteristically disheveled Bruce Greenwood, visits the high-end Exotica strip club every other night for a private dance with the star of the establishment Christina, who has specialized in a sexy schoolgirl routine. He always gets up in the middle of her dance to visit the bathroom, where he is clearly in distress and trying to gather his wits. Their relationship seems remarkably unsexy given the location. One of the pleasures of Egoyan’s work is his confidence in not having to explain himself for a long time. He leaves it to us to figure it out, while guiding us along the way and gently nudging us towards the answers that eludes some of these characters.
Egoyan’s primary aim here isn’t about the eroticism, although when your main setting is a strip club that prides itself on its atmosphere, you are responsible for making your viewers share in that, even from the comfortable distance of their couches. And thanks to some A+ music choices, including the gravelly voice of Canadian superstar Leonard Cohen, and a pulsating score amplified by Elias Koteas’s sulky, if slightly bored voice, you have yourself a place that not necessarily oozes sex, but certainly triggers the sort of high you might get from satisfying other addictions. To be clear, this isn’t “Hustlers”, set in the steamy, sweaty strip clubs where horny Wall Street dudes get off. The Exotica is a tasteful establishment, where the dancers provide patrons with images to go along with their daydreaming. Mia Kirshner gives off exactly that vibe here. She does the job because she knows she’s good at it and it gets her the kind of admiration she has never received in life before. Even if that means having to deal with a jealous prick like Eric on a daily basis.
We also follow Thomas, a pet store owner who is involved in the illegal smuggling of birds and becomes the target of a tax audit conducted by Francis. It takes a while before he comes entangled in the overall story, but beforehand, he goes to the ballet a few times to pick up guys. Egoyan cleverly reshuffles the players on his board without forcing the issue. Francis did his homework and learned everything he needs to about Thomas long before he walked into the store to conduct an audit. He had the leverage all along and was simply waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of it. Those are the pleasures of a clever script that feels comfortable withholding information from characters and viewers without worrying that they might get lost somewhere on the journey. “Exotica” doesn’t shock like other erotic thrillers. It can even feel a bit anti-climactic if you are expecting an explosive payoff like Egoyan delivered in “Remember”. But while we do get some answers to a few of the lingering questions that weren’t addressed beforehand, it’s primarily a reaffirmation that grief doesn’t simply disappear into thin air but sticks around for everyone involved long after the actual tragedy itself.",4.0
"Seductive, captivating, layered and haunting, Exotica is an aesthetically and narratively rich erotic drama with formal flair and command in Atom Egoyan's direction, engaging characters and stellar performances from especially Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kershner and Elias Koteas.",4.5
"Exotica adalah salah satu film keputusasaan yang paling krusial yang pernah aku tonton. Keputusasaannya sendiri terletak di kejelasan ceritanya, keberanian konsepnya, dan kedalaman empatinya. Mempertemukan seks dan kematian, di mana di tengah-tengahnya ada hubungan complicated yang mengeksplorasi eksistensi kehidupan yang rapuh yang semuanya dibentuk oleh masa lalu. Sebuah film introspektif yang sangat influental tentang trauma, kehilangan, dan duka. Di balik kesensualitasan dan konsep keren eksotis dan metropolitannya, Exotica sebenarnya adalah film yang secara ekstrim adalah sebuah film empatetik. Tentang bagaimana seseorang menghadapi duka dari kehilangan dan bagaimana karakter-karakternya membebaskan diri dari kesalahan.
This film created many threads in the beginning, and then those threads are twisted together, concluding that each character in this film has connections and some kind of empathetic relationships to each other, which is psychologically intertwined. In defiance of sexy, the film is rather a meditation on grief, trauma, past, death, and the toxicity that follows.",5.0

"Exotica (1994), directed by Atom Egoyan is a film that conjured many thoughts and emotions and it’s really hard to express specifically what makes it so great. 
Bruce Greenwood plays Fran brown, a tax auditor who is investigating a pet store owner  called Thomas (Don Mckellar) and his business. At the same time, Fran regularly frequents a Toronto strip club called Exotica. He always asks for Christina (Mia Kirshner). The two of them seem to have a connection. The DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas) is jealous.
From the very beginning, the audience are exposed to these lives with little knowledge of what it all symbolises, however, it’s all brilliantly resolved by the end. 
Exotica is hypnotic, unique, hard to comprehend, spellbinding, and sensual, that offers natural, nuanced performances from all those involved. Egoyan is a director in complete control, displaying confident, subtle skill in captivating the audience. The film also has a great conclusion that completely caught  me off guard. 
Also, “Everybody Knows”, by Leonard Cohen is a fantastic song and is perfect for the movie (It’s perfect for a 2020 soundtrack).
This was a fantastic recommendation by a fellow Letterboxer. I’ve given it four stars but I have a feeling i’ll rate it higher after a rewatch.

“Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich

Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose
Everybody knows
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Oh, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
When you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows
And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows
And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart

Before it blows

"So taken with this unassuming little masterpiece, a deceptively simple puzzle box film which gradually arranges itself with a seemingly effortless grace. The many pieces of Exotica that come together are drip-fed as minor revelations throughout but feel increasingly riveting nonetheless, as Egoyan draws us further into his tangled web of troubled characters and deepens our understanding of their lives. Who are these people? How did they end up here? Past and present are entwined as one flowing body until the full image is finally formed in the end, contextualizing the entire film but also piling on its thickest layer of emotional complexity in a way which forces us to play the whole thing back in our heads in order to reckon with its implications.
Already dying to revisit this. If beautifully arranged piecemeal narratives like this is the signature of Atom Egoyan, then I am beyond stoked to explore the series of his work that was added to Criterion Channel recently.",4.5
"Some people often live vicariously through the life of another person. There may be several reasons for this misplacement : A way of escaping some omnipresent void. A form of self loathing and a need for detachment. And sometimes specifically a need to reimagine another person due to the absence of a loved one. In Atom Egoyan's compassionate drama he focuses on the need to try and relieve oneself from a seemingly inescapable sense of loss. It involves a tragic car accident, a father looking for exoneration, a strip club and a horrifying discovery. I am giving you the bare bones of the story because this has a remarkably instinctive way of gradually revealing small details just at the right moment. It perfectly encapsulates the notion that in cinema less is often more without being overly evasive and ambivalent.
Elias Koteas probably should have been a much bigger star, so effective here as Eric, juxtaposing feelings of anger, melancholy, jealousy and ultimately bruising despair. All of the performances are excellent but I also have to mention Bruce Greenwood's convincingly nuanced study of a man suffering from overwhelming loss. Egoyan insightfully shows how grief can be consuming even if you didn't know the person involved. In this instance, the discovery of a dead body leaves an indelible mark on the unfortunate person who makes the discovery, which is something that only becomes truly apparent until much later. Grief is so often overly simplified and here we have a layered examination that penetrates with exceptional lucidity.
Egoyan is clearly fascinated with how our lives can be unknowingly interconnected with Eric's analysis ringing true : ' Have you ever noticed how some people drift into your life like you've known them forever? Some people you can remember the moment you met them really clearly. And then other people it seems you've known them forever, but you haven't. And they all become part of this continuous memory of yourself.' This is a film of deep soul searching and philosophical transparency with very poetic dialogue that travels to places, mostly unreached in cinema. It's only by the conclusion of the film that we can fully understand these characters and why they behave like they do.",4.0
"Love is like the lighting in Thomas' scenes, quiet and warm yet it holds beneath it the utmost of feelings.",5.0
"How fitting that at the centre of the poster for this, there is what looks at first glance like a puzzle piece. Like Memento, Once Upon a Time in America, and The Godfather: Part II, the film feels like it was built in the editing room, but it must have been such a strenuous task to plan the steady structure of this in the writing stage. It is rigorously designed so that each of the character's timelines are superimposed over one another. After briefly following one character, the camera shifts its attention towards Christina walking into Exotica, and once that happens, she never escapes, trapped in an investigation room of one-way mirrors and intense interrogation, breaking down as more of the truth (or rather, several truths) are set in place to construct the greater picture of Atom Egoyan's jigsaw of repressed trauma and psychological torture.
The elliptical habits that the characters stuck in this tragic narrative adhere to appear weird on a first visit, especially with the way that they all seem to talk in cryptspeak - every piece of information is a precious part of themselves; exposing the truth is even tougher than exposing their own body. But context is always added to the fragments of clues Egoyan offers: as the repetitions continue, we are coerced into revealing theories of our own, only to be misled just as much as any one in the central male trio. There is no way that this film would have shocked or have moved me as much as it did had it been delivered in chronological order, or even in a more conventional mostly-linear-with-just-a-couple-of-flashbacks structure. Not only is this more exciting for how it adds a surprise element to the plot, but it makes the final revelations feel even more profound: instead of ending at the film's latest event, we exit through the past, the only medium through which Francis can find any comfort, any answers. Egoyan makes time collapse upon itself. Does he want to turn it back, or leave it on fast-forward, just to see when the pain will finally end?",5.0
"On a first viewing I am hugely impressed at the masterful way this film chooses to reveal information, and the captivating use of tone with such intricate precision. It all feels very 'global', yet it is contained within only two or three locations. I think my favourite aspect however is the characters; they seem so nuanced and believably flawed, with the film constantly surprising the audience and manipulating their empathy. I love this!",4.5
"There will always be someone with a freakier kink than you, and that's ok. The Exotica has a pretty cool and unique layout for a strip club. It honestly seems like a decent place to raise a child. Take away the old, horny men and the naked women and it's pretty much just the Rainforest Café.",4.0
"“Not all of us have the luxury of deciding what to do with our lives.”
A revelation in both its storytelling and my Egoyan filmgoing experience.
Upon first appearance, this appears to be an erotically-charged, sexually-tensed story about the dilemmas of intimacy and connection and the lengths we go for the lack of it. Egoyan teases, likely intentionally, this with routine frequenting of strip clubs to cruising at the ballet to longing in monologues from the DJ booth to restraining touches in provocative lap dances.
Instead, Exotica slowly revealed, but never meandered, itself to be an examination of grief management, fetishization brought about by trauma, and routine as a therapeutic process. As Egoyan noted, he wanted his story to unfold like a striptease.
And, it is a striptease, disrobing article and article, scene-by-scene, to bare all. To show what is at the core of this film: obsession and its all-consuming nature.
Somehow eliciting shock and sympathy simultaneously. An exemplar balancing act between the sensual and the unsettling. Layered not only in approach but thematically. Through the interconnectedness of the characters we see the blurring of routine and compulsion, of healing and hurting, of the sacred and profane.
The best work I’ve seen by Egoyan so far. After a first watch, it feels I’ve only scratched the surface of what this film is saying, doing, and what can be taken away from it.

"First things first this is a very sexy movie! I understand that Egoyan wanted the structure to unfold like a striptease, gradually revealing more information until everything is out in the open. This approach to the story really works in the movie's favor. Information is teased out and you always want more, you know there is more. By the end of the movie it's essentially a character study, but the method of getting there elevates it to something much better than just a character study. It's a complex layer cake made of sex, obsession, skin, lies, murder, bereavement. It's a little overwhelming at first pass but so is, I imagine, a really great striptease.
I will probably be watching this movie again soon. While writing my thoughts down I realized I have way more to say but I don't know how accurate I would be, so I need to rewatch. I could be totally off base. So I'll withhold further thoughts for now. Also Sarah Polley who directed the Oscar nominated Women Talking is in this, and I grew up watching her in the miniseries Road to Avonlea so it's very strange to see her in this",4.0
"A maze of transactional relationships captured in repeated rituals. It has a uniquely hypnotic effect even as it draws us in, desperate to understand the characters' motivations. Elusive almost to the point of inscrutability, but Egoyan's distinctive vibe, melancholic to the core and steeped in voyeurism, is the constant that leads us through to the end. The narrative revelations, when they come, only invite more questions, only deepen the sense that what we have been watching is people blindly attempting to navigate a sense of loss and need that they can never fully understand or articulate.",4.5
"Hugely underrated film. Don't hear much about it. It's a group of separate stories involving characters whose lives are intertwined with each other. It all comes together in a quite brilliant layered piece of film making that explores grief, loss, love and why people act the way they do.",4.0
"One of the first opening scenes features multiple women dancing topless in a strip club but, the attention is being focused on the men and the response women elicit from them. While there is some aspect of eroticism present, the camerawork doesn't depict the male gaze but rather the men's enthralment and the power women have over them. The idea of the gaze is constantly being played with, as depicted in the film's constant use of two way mirrors, where one viewer controls the perception, or lack of perception that exists between individuals.
Exotica Is a erotic psychological drama about obsession, and at times felt reminiscent of Blue Velvet. The majority of the characters fall into a shades of grey category where no one is a perfect hero or particularly moral individual. Each character has their own tragic backstory that is seemingly disconnected until you reach the conclusion where the individual plots weave into a magnificent tapestry where the origins of the various relationships are finally revealed. At the surface level this movie appears to be about sheer titillation, but beneath the surface is a plot about self-actualization and the ways different people's perceptions commingle.
""What is it about a schoolgirl that gives her that special innocence? Is it the way that they can gaze at you; waiting for you to say something with so much expectation and hope that you're just paralyzed into silence?

"[Plot SPOILERS for this 25 year old film starting 4th paragraph]
A film about dark obsessions triggered by PTSD treated through a 90’s male gaze: a man whose child and wife died deals with his pain by having a lap dance. Where the stripper is dressed like a school girl in a plaid skirt. Three times a week. Hey, the man is in a lot of pain.
More than half of the film takes place in the theme-park titular titty-bar and other weird hetero-ness abounds.
Is he actually paying the teenage babysitter for sex?? His little girl was kidnapped and killed and left in a field face down. All that crazy schoolgirl stripper stuff. The story teases a super hard core pedophile vibe.
Instead, the biggest shocker is a completely sweet (considering) humanist twist to the whole thing. While incredibly misguided in execution, the intent of the man and the stripper was to emotionally support each other. Meanwhile, the man goes to shoot his antagonist and they literally hug it out in the parking lot of the strip club. Not a drop of blood is spilled, no child was raped, all the violence was off screen in the past without flashbacks. Hell, we don’t even get a hint of who killed the little girl. Because healing. The whole experience was, in a word: Canadian.
This was picked for me as an “alt” view in Secret Cinema #15 and it was an awesome choice. It’s a perfect example of where I never would have gotten past the first 15 minutes if not for a thoughtful stranger’s recommendation.

"“Exotica” primarily delves into themes of grief, emotional baggage, and the lasting impact of sorrow on individuals' lives.
The film opens with the line, ""You have to ask yourself, what brought this person to this point?"" This sets the stage for a narrative that gradually reveals the hidden pasts of various characters. As their stories unfold, we see how past traumas have shaped their present lives. Egoyan presents these characters with empathy, exploring why they might resort to morally questionable actions to cope with their pain, such as frequenting a strip club to watch a young girl in a schoolgirl outfit.

A prominent theme in film is the series of transactions among characters, which symbolize their attempts to manage grief and loneliness. These exchanges range reflecting the complex ways people seek solace.

The strip club ""Exotica,"" central to the film, is more than a setting—it symbolizes an escape for its patrons. While the term ""exotic"" often suggests something sexual, the club scenes are not particularly sexy or alluring. Instead, Egoyan focuses on the indifferent faces of the male clients, hinting at their underlying sadness. This environment acts as a sanctuary where they temporarily escape their harsh realities.
The performances are outstanding, with Bruce Greenwood and Mia Kirshner deserving special mention. Greenwood, in particular, brings a heartbreaking sensitivity to his role as Francis.
Overall, ""Exotica"" is portrayed as a humane film that seeks to understand its characters' sorrows and compromises rather than judge them.",4.0

Für gewöhnlich macht man ja von den aufreizenden Attributen einer Frau Gebrauch, um von etwaigen Schwächen im Drehbuch oder auffälligen Inhaltsunstimmigkeiten abzulenken, nie hätte ich es allerdings für möglich gehalten, dass es jemandem wirklich fertig bringt, eine sonst so dilletantische Methode der Fehlerkaschierung auf eine derart bewusstseinserweiternde Ebene zu befördern... selten haben ein Striptease, ein Tabeldance und das Heimfahren des Babysitters so viele, tiefe Schürfwunden hinterlassen wie in ""Exotica""!
Neben den hypnotischen Klängen, dem extrem-langsamen Erzähltempo, dicht gefolgt von der permanent-aufknisternden Erotik erzählt Atom Egoyan seinen paralysierenden Fiebertraum zu allem Überfluss nicht einmal chronologisch, sondern schüttet das gewaltige 10.000 Teile Puzzle nach dem gemächlichen Intro vor einem aus, ohne den hilflosen Zuschauer je einen flüchtigen Blick auf das vollständige Bild der Schachtel werfen zu lassen... erst gegen Ende fügen sich alle Handlungsstränge unserer 4 verlorenen Hauptfiguren, lassen aber davon abgesehen trotzdem mehr Fragezeichen und unerklärliche Emotionen zurück, als sie aufklären!

I could understand people really loving it (especially if you're smart and can put your finger on what it was about exactly, because I'm too dumb to do that), and I could also understand people coming away from it really underwhelmed.
I think the only other Atom Egoyan film I've seen was The Sweet Hereafter, which also left me a little cold but I did find it compelling. He seems like an interesting filmmaker with a distinct style, so I'll watch more from him eventually.",3.5
"exotic: (synonyms) unusual, unconventional, foreign or distant
In Toronto, a group of characters are connected through their association with an exotic strip club and an exotic pet store. The motives of most are unclear until Egoyan has the chance to peel back that last layer of the onion. In the end, it's a group of sad people trying to find peace by substituting what's missing no matter how unconventional it may seem.
What's clear is that you don't need to go to a strip club or a pet store to find something exotic. Peace of mind in the world? Now that's exotic. Bonus points for excellent use of Leonard Cohen's - Everybody Knows.",5.0
"Wow, this itches every part of my film brain in ways I never thought one film really could. It explores so much in such a contained and almost scientific precision, while also maintaining a trance-like aura of sensuality. It never crosses into what you think it's going to be, rather exploring (what could be) a straight forward narrative in a completely intrinsic way. The fractured storyline makes us feel one with our characters perception, we learn and grow with each of them as we feel their loss and their despair. The tone remains consistent, the muted color palette and the distant camera work makes us feel like a calculated killer, every glance quick as to not be noticed. It's sleek, it's sexy, it's thoughtful, and it's just damn good film. Kino even. Movies like these are what film-making is all about, and I'm looking forward to exploring more films by every party involved.

"“He comes in here every other night. He has his favorite drink, and his favourite table, with his favorite dancer. Sometimes he has to wait for her, and sometimes she's waiting for him, to protect him. She's his angel.”
    Wow, this movie does not end in the way you expect it is going to end. Atom Egoyan’s Exotica does not go where you think it will. Despite of its purposefully deceptive marketing and premise, this is NOT a sleazy erotic thriller. As Egoyan gradually adds context and detail, revealing more and more about his troubled characters, it becomes clear that Exotica is a vibrant and complex tapestry about the nature of grief and loss, much like The Sweet Hereafter. 
    What we are first to believe are a set of discrete storylines about a haunted tax auditor, a forlorn exotic pet shop owner, a cryptic stripper, and the married couple that own and run the Exotica strip club where she works gradually spools into a vast, interwoven tapestry. Exotica is less about sex than about relationships and coping mechanisms, and it is not until the revelatory yet ambiguous concluding scene that the audience can wholly grasp the movie’s true implications.
    This is the type of film that leaves me eager to dive back in for a rewatch ASAP and view every scene with all the added context. Its strategic withholding of information and adherence to each of its characters’ subjective perspectives in lieu of clear, objective fact are its most significant aspects. We are thus encouraged to assemble, out of the building blocks of our own viewing experience, our own specific interpretations of Exotica that are pertinent, meaningful and personal to us.",4.5
"Exotica is an indescribable mess of feelings and thoughts. An experience like no other to have ever flickered across screens, the film is achieving everything it tries - whatever that might be. Because the film goes forward in such an unusual way, has the viewer guessing all the time and still manages to keep the overview to the important stuff as the story vagily progresses, it feels like something out of this world. Something too good to be true, something so strangely familiar yet so unalterable, it becomes this undefiable mixture of everything going through the viewer's mind. But that’s essentially what trauma is.
While watching the film I had a strange feeling. I'm having a hard time finding the right words, while I think about the film my thoughts just merge into one big mishmash. It's a challenge to really stay focused and write something coherent about that feeling and the film in general. But I'll try my best. Not wanting to give only the slightest thing away when writing something about Exotica is a nearly impossible task. The film can only be understood when experienced, not when read about. Because when the silhouette of a naked woman is used as an one-sided mirror to reflect on the film and it's characters itself, when a parrot becomes the key to this silhouette that has now turned into a lock and when the counterplay of watching and being watched inserts the characters own being, it probably doesn't make that much sense when one hasn't seen the film for himself.
Like I said, the film's sharp structure, preventing the viewer from being certain about anything going forward makes it hard to keep thoughts to oneself. The film isn't as twist-heavy or mysterious as it seems, even through my indistinct description of it. It just knows how to subvert emotions, leaps of thought and fascination so well, while wanting to talk about it one's arms are tied. One cannot get it out. One cannot manage to formulate something meaningful. It's rare when a film does something like that to you. For me at least, it's rare that a film captivated, moved and fascinated me this much. It took me a strong will to even begin writing something about Exotica, and it takes me a strong will to end my writing as well. But, like all things, it must come to an end. I have enough time going forward to talk more about it anyway. Until then I'll just think of birds, schoolgirls, dancing women, eggs and trauma. You know, like it's meant to be.",5.0

"Well that was interesting! I spent at least half of Exotica's runtime thinking I was going to end up hating it. It doesn't make much sense at first, and takes a little too long getting to the point. All while telling a pretty basic story in a very weird manner. Director Atom Egoyan who also wrote and produced the film, introduces his main characters, all of which end up being linked by a single event. The problem is we meet these characters in a strange almost offputting setting, and they all come across as kinda odd and even somewhat creepy. So you spend a good portion of the film with people who in real life would make pretty much anyone uncomfortable, and due to the way Egoyan chooses to tell the story, you have no idea what's going on. These issues are exacerbated by some pretty poor acting from a mostly no name cast. In fact I didn't know any of these actors by sight except for a young Sarah Polley. Interestingly enough, by the time Egoyan finally got around to the point I actually liked it. It's still a little too weird for no reason in my opinion, and the acting didn't get much better as it went along, but for whatever reason I still liked it.
I would normally put a plot synopsis here, but honestly I have no idea how to write one for this film that doesn't give too much away. Until it gets around to it's point it's just a bunch of awkward weirdness so I'll have to leave it at that.
I mentioned the acting wasn't very good. On that note I can't help but think characters like Thomas (Don McKellar), an exotic pet store owner who smuggles eggs into the country on the side would have been a lot more interesting if played by a better actor. Or even Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a middle age man with baggage who visits the Exotica to just talk to have conversations with a certain stripper. It's not good when you're watching a film and all you can think about is how weird it is and that the acting is bad. That's why I'm kinda surprised I ended up liking it, but the way the characters end up being linked saved the whole film for me. Through all the strangeness it ends up being an interesting tale on how people cope with things. I don't know if I'll ever watch it again, but its definitely worth seeing once.
Ron's recommendation: See it.",3.0
"Here's the easy sell: There's boobs, nice ones, on a nice blu-ray transfer.
Here's the easier sell: This is a masterpiece, and possibly the best Canadian film I've ever seen (at least until I see Egoyan's Sweet Hereafter, which I now will, very very soon). This is a very relaxing and hypnotic film, that also has a very fully satisfying narrative, full of emotional weight with just enough ambiguity to leave you thinking long after you've watched. I immediately popped the commentary track on to listen to Atom wax over the amazing ending, which is not a twist but still changes the whole movie.
If you've not seen Exotica I urge you to rectify this as soon as possible.",5.0
"Art house flow without any of the pretentiousness. Downtown seedy club lifestyle in its most deprived and perverted fashion. The sliding scale between sexual healing and sexual exploitation is constantly teetering as characters are consistently projecting their feelings and thoughts on to each other through the run of Exotica.

A well crafted story about blame, guilt, loss, society's sick obsession with youth, and trauma bonding.",4.5
"""Let me ask you something, gentlemen. What is it what gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?""
Sleazy Sunday #55
'Exotica' by Atom Egoyan is a story about longing. We follow Thomas, a pet store owner, Francis, a tax auditor, Eric, MC/DJ in club Exotica, an exotic stripclub, and Christina, a dancer/stripper at the same club. The lives of these people are (or become) intertwined in a very special way.
While there is some nudity on display in the stripclub, the movie is way less sleazy than any Sleazy Sunday movie should be. But what it lacks in sleaze, it makes up for in beautiful storytelling, combined with gorgeous cinematography and an equally stunning musical score.
One-way mirrors often make a return in this portmanteau film. It's a perfect way for a character to get up close to another character, without being noticed and not out of place in a stripclub, because of security reasons.
'Exotica' left me with two feelings.
LOn the one hand: this wasn't a good match with the Sleazy Sunday segment and a bit of a disappointment in that sense.
On the other hand: it IS an amazing movie, beautiful in every sense and worthy of its cult classic status!",5.0
"ngl this caught me crying. i vividly remember sobbing for an hour by myself in grade 4 when i saw de palma’s Carrie for the first time. but this movie, i started thinking about my mother and all of the pain she went through. my mom lost her mother, when she was 12 years old, to leukemia. my grandma (who my sister is named after) gave my mother all of her jewelry before she passed away. my mother has described her gorgeous jewelry to me a couple of times, but i can’t remember any specifics. anyways, my mother moved out at the age of 16 with her boyfriend to an apartment on fraser street. if anybody reading this is from vancouver, then they would know that east vancouver (especially in the 90s, & especially around hastings street) is rampant with drug addiction, and poverty due to that. i once asked my mother when i was really little what were some of the scariest moments in her life, and she told me she came home to that apartment on Fraser once to catch a man halfway through the window above the building’s entrance. he looked at her, obviously flustered because he was caught, and quickly jumped out and ran away. my mom was terrified, and only felt worse to discover that the man broke into her apartment and stole every piece of jewelry my grandma left for her.
ive never had something so traumatic happen to me, nothing like that at all. i have no idea what i would feel, it seems like there’s no coming back from that, game over. what’s next? what do you do? watching exotica last night made me think about how things like that happen to people and how people are expected to move on. the story doesn’t end, life goes on and days go by. people are expected to rebuild. im so proud of my mother and her strength... i could never imagine that feeling of finding her mother’s jewelry missing, especially to some crackhead she witnessed escape. the recovery from something like that must’ve been extremely hard, an event like that must’ve brought back a lot of that pain she’s been working through for those past 4-5 years. i imagine myself in that position, the despair id feel, and my mother’s strength inspires me. it’s true that we didn’t ask to come here, and that nobody is asking for us to stay, but we must. days slip by so fast, but Christina’s right, that’s what they’re supposed to do, and they do for everybody.",4.5
"Exquisite on just about every level. A cleverly constructed narrative made up of multiple different plot threads and story elements that at first seem entirely unrelated, but over time they all steadily converge into one another, revealing a much bigger and bleaker picture. The end result is a film that is both heartbreaking yet captivating, keeping you hooked through its haunting and intoxicating atmosphere and the genuine emotion of characters and performances.",4.5
"Usually when describing a film narrative, we say it ""unfolds"" or ""unravels"", but in Exotica something different happens. Instead, the narrative spools, like yarn spun into a ball. It comes together in methodical steps, turn by turn, into an edifice as daunting as the titular strip club in this film.
This is one of the best films I've seen this year, or perhaps any year. It's set up like it will be a thriller – the eroticism of its opening provocatively portends so. Francis (Bruce Greenwood) is a depressed tax auditor, and the early scenes of him in the strip club with Christina (Mia Kirshner) suggest he is exorcising his lust over a young girl named Tracey whom he... well, to be frank, it's unclear at first what his relationship is to her. He drives her home, she with headphones on, and he says to her, with palpable desperation, ""I'm not that boring, am I?"" He also pays her, although why is not known. His liaisons with Christina in the club, then, suddenly snap into focus: an older man lusting after a young girl whom he can't have instead pays a stripper dressed in schoolgirl clothes to make his fantasy real. Wherever could this lead?
However, turn by turn of the spool, we learn this is not that story. I don't want to write more on the plot, since I could veer into spoiler territory, but what Exotica turns out to be is a story of tragedy and loss, grief and the inability to move on. It's a character study, a carefully constructed elaboration of the choices people make when they don't know how to proceed. About an hour into the film, we start to have an idea of what is really happening, but to the film's credit we still don't know how things will go down. It's not until the final 10 minutes that we learn the full, devastating truth. Afterwards, I sat there stunned....
I feel like I could write more, but it would just get less and less coherent. So here are a few quick thoughts:
• Whoever was responsible for the sound design on this deserves some recognition. This film oozes mood, and the music choices are perfect.
• The cinematography is nothing particularly special, but director Atom Egoyan did very well with the camera movement and placement. It was noticeable but unobtrusive, expressive but not showy. Almost like a Spielberg film.
• The metaphor of the one-way mirrors is a bit on the nose, but it was nonetheless effective.
• The writing and pacing are fantastic. I really appreciate filmmaking that subverts my initial expectations, especially when characters that are set up to be bad turn out to be quite sympathetic. This might be why a film like The Daytrippers, which I watched not too long ago (and mostly enjoyed), ultimately didn't resonate very deeply with me, while this one absolutely does.
• My initial review, composed snarkily in my head last night before going to sleep, was only going to be: ""What a film! Both the pervert and the humanist in me are satisifed."" I woke up with a clearer head and decided to write more, but still wanted to include that line somewhere. Here will have to do.
• I definitely should watch this again soon.

"How has this not been talked about as one of the best films of the 90s?
Slightly better than Egoyan's fantastic film The Adjuster only because he takes all the mystery that film has and gives it an end goal here. The characters have a sense of purpose within their healing and exploration. They have a history that we as the viewer seek out.
Egoyan's motif of video/media as an entry into the lives of others is replaced here with mirrors and I love it.

"“You are somebody special. Five dollars is all it takes to prove it.”
On its surface, Exotica is a more conventional film than what came before for Egoyan, but by making certain things clearer, it serves to deepen the mysteries lingering on the periphery of the central story. Even as who these people are and what their most basic connection is becomes apparent, their true motivations and desires become, paradoxically, more slippery and elusive. It has one of the most haunting, inexplicably sad final scenes I’ve ever seen in a film, reframing two characters locked in some unfathomable symbiotic relationship.
The film touches on the transactional nature of relationships, sexual and otherwise; the knowledge that reducing everything to its monetary value is both soul-crushing and deeply ingrained. People watch people, and people watch themselves being watched constantly, but a touch in this world might risk everything. The strip-club setting itself is a labyrinthine panopticon of endless new spaces but with nowhere to hide. Wounded people unable to heal use the closest person to desperately try to fill their emptiness.
The cast is uniformly excellent, with the great character actor Bruce Greenwood giving maybe his best performance. It’s strange that Mia Kirshner never became more of a big deal. Her performance, which cleverly plays with and subverts the sex-worker as saviour to broken men trope, is seductive, steely and extremely affecting. Her dance to Leonard Cohen’s ‘Everybody Knows’ is beguiling and troubling.
This is my third watch and I really do think it’s one of the most perfect films ever made, with each watch revealing (and maybe concealing) something new. Dreadfully moving.

"Exotica is spellbinding. I'm not quite sure how to dissect it right now upon first viewing. Setting a story about grief and the loss of a child almost entirely around a strip club sounds mind-boggling in text, but Atom Egoyan somehow makes it work. It reflects this underlying attitude and fascination and resentment toward the very concept of sex itself within our world, and as the plot slowly begins to unravel, the intensity just ramps itself up. Very much in line with the works of Cronenberg, minus the mutilation. Empathetic and multi-faceted character studies bundled together in one beautifully captured thriller, that fortunately doesn't get lost in the erotic element once promised.",4.0
"I should have every reason to love this, but it just didn't do it for me. The characters are all creeps. We have the exotic pets merchant Thomas (Don McKellar), who traffics in endangered species, uses ballet tickets to pick up gay men, and is suffering through a tax audit. We have the tax man Francis, whose daughter died recently and he's become obsessed with a stripper who performs in a school girl uniform at the Toronto strip club Exotica. That dancer is called Christina (Mia Kirshner), who hardly shows us any moves or skin or sultriness. She's the former girlfriend of the club's DJ Eric (Elias Koteas), who has more recently been boffing his boss, the club owner Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian). Now she's pregnant with his child, of course. I'm sorry, I could not get on board with the way writer-director-producer Atom Egoyan portrayed these alienated, isolated individuals. Your money is better spent going to a real strip club, IMHO. Three stars, barely okay.",3.0

"Just as enthralling as all the other Egoyan films I’ve been watching recently, but for some reason I’m having a much harder time putting thoughts and feelings into words. I guess the lesson is, don’t smuggle macaw eggs? Or maybe do, and you might accidentally end up helping a stranger process their trauma? “Good things come out of bad things,” as my mother always says.
(Also—after planning a bunch of actor-centric mini-marathons over the course of October—all hidden in private watchlists—and then coming up with a big splashy self-imposed folk horror challenge, I’m not surprised that I then immediately drifted toward my preferred method of cinema deep-dive: the unannounced director-centric marathon. The “unannounced” part is easy to explain: there’s less pressure on you to complete something if you haven’t made a big deal of it—by attracting people’s attention to this big longish-term thing you’re about to do. That makes sense! But why have I always found it more compelling to set out to watch most of a director’s filmography, instead of doing the same with an actor’s? It might have to do with the way I first fell in love with fiction, at the age of 7: by reading all of Roald Dahl’s kids’ book, one after the next. So maybe I imprinted on this idea that it’s incredibly rewarding and worthwhile to go through several works by the same person, even though of course most film directors don’t have nearly as much control over what they’re making than most authors (it’s a collaborative medium blah blah). Anyway, maybe I should embrace this, and mostly leave actor-based marathons to others. Though of course often a director will have a favourite actor or two, so that a director-based marathon ends up kind of functioning as an actor-based one as well. So an Aki Kaurismaki marathon will also allow you to appreciate the many faces of Kati Outinen and Matti Pellonppää, a Scorsesethon will double as a run-through of some of De Niro's best roles, and the films of Atom Egoyan will introduce you to Arsinée Khanjian *and* make you appreciate Elias Koteas, who before you'd only known as the weirdo from Crash and Shutter Island.)",4.0

"I remember renting this on VHS when I was 12, because I had a huge crush on Mia Kirshner... and of course I was hoping there would be a lot of nudity (I had a note on our rental account saying I was allowed to rent R movies!).

_______________________________________
Exotica is the kind of strip club that I'm pretty sure only existed in 80s and 90s movies. They're these artsy, high class places where the strippers are more like performance artists. Most of the time they don't even take of their clothes. It's also a world in which the ballet is the best place to pick up gay men on the prowl. 
I like a lot of this cast: Kirshner, Elias Koteas... there's a young Sarah Polley, too. I was a fan of Koteas even back then, due to his role as Casey Jones in Ninja Turtles. I liked Mia's character a lot. She's closed off and ""detached"", as one character calls her. All the characters are closed off in some way. They all have a darkness. The dynamics between them and their motivations are kept purposefully vague, so we have to figure things out as we go along. 
The score is earthy and mysterious. The cinematography has that warm, 90s, natural lighting look. All those 90s ""erotic"" movies had a similar look. I think Exotica is better than most of those movies, though. 
I liked it, but I have this same feeling as when I was 12: it had potential that it didn't quite live up to.

Been meaning to see this for over 10 years and never really knew what was so enticing to people. The first act delivered what I thought it was - slick and sleazy. But the film grows more tender and makes its characters more human and empathetic. And while I know that's its point, I can't help but feel the off-putting first act handicapped it from the start, and it deliberately takes its time finding its footing. Still, it's exceptionally made and acted, especially by Elias Koteas. I feel like I may like it more on rewatch when measured against my expectations, but I certainly like it more on reflection.",4.0
"One of my favorite movies of all time.
Several of my favorite actors contribute to an elaborate, emotionally brutalizing mystery surrounding the murder of a local teenage girl. There will be no stupid gimmicky attempts to undermine the viewer's intelligence or exploit the viewer's presumed desires. There will be no fetishization of murder or schoolgirls, even though the whole movie seethes with the threat of violent perversion. EXOTICA constantly elicits and then defies one's expectations as it roots around in the psyche of each of its characters, while never embarrassing them with overexposure, laying bare only that which most devastates the viewer.
I only knock off half a star because I try to reserve the five star rating for movies that do something I never imagined before, technologically or narratively--almost an imaginary movie. Make of that what you will, to interpret my review of EXOTICA.",4.5
"Exotica ends with an information dump, a series of ""plot twists"" if you will, that recontextualize the lives of the film's characters up to that point. While I don't think this data dump really works on a narrative level, I wonder if it might still be the most fruitful way to approach the film's thematic objective. Throughout the film, Egoyan dichotomizes liberally: we have the exotic strip club and the mundanity of everyday life (indeed, the main character works for the CRA—stereotypically speaking, the most boring, unglamorous job imaginable!); the real bird at the babysitter's dad's apartment and the stuffed birds at Exotica; the voyeurism at the club and the one-way mirrors in the airport; the ironic juxtaposition of the ballet and Thomas' pet shop; &c &c. These are interesting choices in their own right, but they serve a further purpose by hinting at an epistemological spectre best exemplified by several sequences in the film.
The first such ""sequence"" is the repeated scenes set in a pastoral expanse. The characters walking through the field speak of friendship, and the scenes are shot fantasy-like, as if to suggest a world apart from the seedy prurience of the strip club, an alternate escapist universe. It's only in the end that we realize the very real reason these characters are walking through the field, a discovery that militates against a fantastical interpretation of those sequences. The second is a DV snippet of Francis' family, which snippet ends when his wife covers the camera with her hand. The clip is certainly ominous (was the video a prelude to a past transgression that haunts Francis today?); only later is it revealed to be a mundane home video. In both cases, Egoyan tempts the viewer to draw conclusions about the nature of these sequences, only to dash them with the concluding narrative dump.
Given these subversions, does not Egoyan suggest that we should read the rest of the film according to this inverted logic? If the idyllic fields are not intended fantastically, is the club not the real embodiment of the fantasy, a liminal space in which the characters' pyschological states are manifested? The significant narrative developments all occur around the strip club—is it not then fitting that Egoyan strips away the narrative deception and reveals his characters' true natures at Exotica?

"I should be open with the fact while this my second time watching this, my first time wasn't exactly done with the best intentions. I was 15, and alone in the house. IFC put up a preview for something called Exotica. And by preview I mean it was the first 3 minutes of the film, and I only kept watching because I was 15. With no real internet capabilities. And there were tits on TV. And I was alone. And I was 15.
So I sat and watched for debauchery. And I got none of it. But I wasn't complaining. Watching it again now, it's interesting that what kept me going through such a slow burning film like this was finding the deeper stories behind it all, and how really it's not all that special. While the need for it to primarily take place in a strip club smells like 90's independent film pushing the sexual boundaries, once it all makes sense you think back to those scenes and see them in a different shade of dark blue.
Exotica, a club that presents itself like a palace even in the backroom, so the employees can feel more special to themselves than they really are. Along with that are the double sided mirrors, to also have people feel more special than others. But this isn't a film just about simple facades. That's too easy and simple.
Nor is it just about feeling better than everyone, and the security it brings. It's also about the security with your surroundings, and having to deal with it suddenly being taken away from you. Through extreme circumstances, and sometimes just a simple touch. But again, that's too simple.
It's an intertwining story told in a non-linear fashion that came out right around the time another film was doing that, but with catch phrases, anal rape, and flock of seagulls haircuts instead of subdued characters, subtle connecting details, and a much more centralized location where it all comes together. Guess which one I'll give a slightly higher rating to at the end of the day.",4.5

"very taken with egoyan's keen sense for the uncanny amongst the mundane, and the ways this plays with artificiality, performance, and facade. muses on the routine and the rippling effects of grief with a non-judgemental curiosity about the habits we all adopt as a means of coping with loss and alienation. the ending, while certainly a gut punch, also strikes me as having a note of profound solidarity concerning the plight of modern existence...if we all carry our scars like baggage, then we all have something we share.

"I am so deeply confused by all of the comments praising this film for its complexity, mystery, and exploration of human relationships. This is probably the most unsatisfactory thing Ive ever had the displeasure of watching. After it ended, I spent 30 minutes reading synopsis’s of Exotica trying to see if maybe I missed anything or if something went over my head. But I in fact did not miss anything. I understood it; it was simply bad. The best way I could describe this viewing experience would be getting to the top of a coaster and then just halting and slowly rolling back down.",1.5
"In rewatching Exotica, part of me worried that already knowing what happened would diminish the power of the film's twist and gut-punch finale. But I was wrong. It got better. The first viewing floored me, stunned me into an awed silence. This time I was wrecked emotionally, occasionally holding back tears as I became subsumed by these characters and their circumstances.
Just an amazing, amazing movie.

"As I journey through the Alphabet...
Very enigmatic despite its rather straightforward narrative. Nothing is purposely held back or concealed from the audience, the cards fall into place, and that's it. But there's so much more than that, demanding further and invited discussion about what seemingly went down.
Exotica presents characters troubled from their past, trying but failing to overcome the turmoil, reaping the consequences. Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas in particular are at the forefront. Koteas especially has a great performance, acting as a thematic and emotional narrator through his relaxed demeanor as the club's MC. His performance, along with the others, really sink you into narrative and the characters within.
It's really an enjoyable watch. The simple conflict masks a complex thematic structure, making Exotica easy to get into and become transfixed by its content. Following the success of this, The Sweet Hereafter might be coming soon.
Appreciate the use of Leonard Cohen in the film. Definitely isn't needed but it adds so much, more movies should take Exotica's advice by implementing it. That is all.",4.0

"Atom Egoyan finally joins the Criterion Collection with this spellbinding 1994 indie drama, making its equally overdue Blu-ray debut. He focuses on a group of barely-connected characters, all in the inner or outer orbit of a Toronto strip club, and (as per usual) the viewer spends a fair amount of the running time decoding who everyone is and what their relationships are to each other. Connections that initially seem impossible slowly become clear, and then inextricably linked, and the skill with which he draws these disparate threads together in the emotionally overwhelming closing scenes is astonishing. Every performance is a bruiser, but special attention must be paid to valuable character actor Bruce Greenwood, here showing the depth of his powers in a rare leading role.",4.5

"One of the deepest films I have seen to date, is not just about sexual needs, it is about emotional needs and loneliness, the emotions that are hidden in the film and are very obvious at the same time.

"My god, the mood, the visuals, the pacing, the incredible music—strip club Leonard Cohen, and the primal electro pulse of Michael Danna's score, with its ""world music"" flourishes. Intentional Orientalism that plays into the jarringly artificial world but is still incredibly badass. That same artificial yet revelatory tinge to the dialogue, half cryptic, the other half just floating on raw emotion. Conversation about requisite tension and baggage in adult friendships:
-""I don't think I like my dad when he's around you.""
-""That's because your dad doesn't like himself when he's around me. But that's ok, that's part of what friends do to each other.""
My only issue is that the whole strip club therapy set-up is just a little ridiculous, and the whole movie is dominated by heavy male gaze, intentional of course—it plays into that, and shows us the sick coupling of sexual fantasy and paternalism. But still, it's all a bit of a pervy fantasy innit?

"Adam Egoyan's Exotica feels like a case study in detachment. It's like an alien observance of behavior by humans who lack a clear understanding of why they've done what they've done, so they move forward, blindly, in a kind of all consuming questioning anguish. All while we watch like we are seeing exotic birds or fish, in cages, in glass tanks, as they try to go about their lives under our watchful eyes, wanting to be entertained. Each incident folding onto itself; women stripping their created identities away on stage before an audience of leering men in a pretentious night club, while on film the characters are forced to strip away the artifice of learned behavior only to find the wholly unfamiliar—a light revealing the emptiness of the lies they've been living, and the harsh truth that they must change to go on, to survive. Exotica is very early 1990's American independent, pondering the why's of existence under the capitalist guise, with a cool alternative style. People wanting to see a film about a strip club were probably most disappointed.",4.0

"Slightly disappointing, considering its rating here. Audiovisually a beautiful film. Especially in the club. Luscious mise-en-scène with a camera that gently slides through Exotica, passing the various characters and all. The constant murmur of music and other sounds creates a particular type of atmosphere and the story has a strong hook as it slowly reveals how everybody in the film is connected. There's drama in the air, but there's a downside too. Within the dreamy, moody ambiance the characters, to me, feel detached and distant. Not much flesh and blood there, so when the revelations pile up, it doesn't generate much impact.",3.0

"Criterion Challenge 2023: Made in Canada- Excellent! This moody and deceptively deep story of temptation, trauma and desire was a fantastic breath of fresh air. Thrilling without being a proper thriller, the meticulous storytelling here is immensely satisfying. A non chronological dreamlike storytelling experience, which is often abused now, but handled very well here. Hard not to invoke Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks here, but it isn’t the way that is often meant.
To be clear, this is largely set in a fancy strip club, one where Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen is played during an act. There’s a lot about sex and obsession, but centering the emotional impact in a unique way. At the heart of it, this is a detailed character study. Soft, quiet, resting sadness in an unwinding and emotional narrative that you could never guess.
So impressed at Egoyan’s ability to challenge the audience on their preconceived notions as well as their perceptions.

What a wild one. Plays out like an 11am soap opera but adds in a lot of oddness and sexy vibes. Gave off the same feel of an Abel Ferrara movie from the 90’s and it dares to be very provocative. This is an ideal movie to be apart of the Criterion collection.,3.0
"Exotica ellicits rare emotions that are nearly indescribable yet utterly powerful to the point they overwhelm the audience, forcing the viewer to take several deep breaths after the film ends to let things fully sink in. Atom Egoyan's fragmented work of narrative brilliance stands among the most tender and humane depictions of loss and trauma in modern filmmaking, focusing entirely on those affected by events that are beyond their control and how they try to find soothing in each other, yet blindly reject the option to overcome their pain because it is a mountain too daunting for the human spirit to overcome in the blink of an eye, this leads to obsession, toxicity with themselves and others and results in forcing these people in searching artificial pleasure to cover up the voids that cannot be filled. The past constantly haunts and invades their mind, tricking them into thinking things have not changed, creating a collective memory of a time where things seemed purer and better, but that were in reality the same as the present, but with an intact hope that things might get better, and whereas these escape routes to the past may seem like a self-destructive way to cope and an escape from the tragedy that inflicts the pain, in the end it is also what reminds the characters of the kindness and humanity in them, and that they can still save at least one live, albeit not recover the ones that have been lost, providing some help to calm the pain of a wound that will never be healed.

"Lost Souls Searching For Meaning.
In the darkness of a strip club, death, trauma & loneliness haunt its occupants as routine becomes ritual & rumination becomes obsession.
Beyond the intoxicating score & seedy environment, Exotica is an existential psychological drama that explores the lives of empty shells masquerading as people. They have long become disconnected from reality, lost without meaning, but within this shared disconnection, their lives begin to intertwine.",5.0
"there are few things in the world more beautiful to me than humans’ capacity for understanding one another. art is one of the only things that can elicit this connection and togetherness with one’s fellow man by appealing to what makes people people. this deep well of empathy in every person is something every artist should aspire to plumb — why create art if not to bring people together, to feel alive and connected to others?
this particular film does all of that in an almost unparalleled way, but it first submerges you in an atmosphere of grime and filth, a true rock bottom if I’ve ever seen one, exposing you to the immense pain of the people who have hit that point in their lives. any lesser film would take this idea and run with the sleazeball parts of it (I wouldn’t call him lesser by any means, but I would be interested to see what Abel Ferrara would do with a concept like this), whereas this particular film makes you feel the deep pain and loss felt by everyone who regulars the titular shithole (classy as it may be, it’s a shithole). 
the entire film is crafted incredibly, particularly with regards to the script (immediately in my top 10 English scripts ever), but the third act is simply stunning. the aforementioned greasiness had me braced for some climactic confrontation where the characters reached their breaking points and resort to violence, but… that didn’t happen at all. the story completely swept my feet out from under me and ended (chronologically) with an embrace between two men who were basically at each other’s throats for the film’s duration. if I think about that moment too hard, I’ll probably tear up. the final detail revealed before their embrace was one of the last puzzle pieces in the narrative, making everything come together and bringing together two men who immediately understood the other’s perspective with their shared pain. it is a stunning moment in a film full of them and it completely floored me. 
truly, what a picture.",5.0
"There are two ghosts haunting Exotica, ones that appear sparingly throughout the runtime to emphasize Francis’ own disassociation with everything but the club that he frequents every couple of days. He always looks for one specific girl, Christina. They have a dynamic that refuses to be understood and rejects any sort of explanation from an outsider’s point of view. These two ghosts are in the form of his dead wife and daughter, his daughter murdered by a maniac and his wife killed in a car crash months later. Whenever we see Francis, Egoyan wants us to examine how he interacts with those surrounding him, living or not. The Exotica club is almost seen as a church or a temple, where Francis can stumble into and forget the pain that haunts him. The figure he’s obsessed with is Christina. Together, they exist in a realm outside of the club.  
Egoyan’s club is covered in exotic landscapes and props: leaves and dim lights, tunnels and passages. This is a maze in which some of mankind’s greatest desires can run freely and dangerously. Obsession is a terrible thing to succumb to as we watch our emcee, Eric, glare devilishly at Christina as she bonds with Francis. We're never given the truth as to why Eric operates the way that he does; the jungle-esque beauty of the club sees him donning the predator title while Christina (and the other women) are forced into the prey role, but you could even argue that the men who frequent the club are predators, too (or maybe, since the women have the control, they are unknowingly the prey). Obsession plays a huge role in this work, but Egoyan isn’t interested in merely labeling it as a work about obsession: this is a film about why people choose to be obsessed with things rather than a conventional “obsession” thriller. 
Lonely characters walk the rainy, moonlit streets of Toronto looking for something more. A man longing for his wife and child, a stripper who dances and keeps herself close to only a few, an introverted gay man who deals with distributing exotic birds, an emcee hungry for the past, and a club owner who can only watch as it falls into tragic chaos. All of them long for something more than just a body or a memory, Egoyan’s masterpiece pushes the boundaries of sex and desire and intimacy and obsession and creates a world where the fractured mirror reveals so much truth and pain. How characters need something to drive them through the dark tunnel of life but only find solace in things that slowly crack them even more than they already are. Exotica is a film where the past cannot lay asleep because the future is barreling down the throats of these characters – it's tragic watching people try to escape the inevitable. 
The most important element of this incredibly draining and tragic work is that grief is never answered. So many people react to an event differently and Egoyan perfectly constructs a puzzle in which he slowly strips away the metaphorical clothing of his narrative to reveal a bare-naked spectacle of an open-heart that bleeds for compassion and understanding; how a single event can alter the lives of so many people without the others knowing and how conversations and sympathy are so important to establish – enforce – into the subconscious of how to live properly. The final shot is perhaps the most upsetting final shot I have ever seen: the melancholy and pain of the previous frames are blown up by this quiet pain and optimism that the final frame longs for, that these characters unknowingly embrace a permanent state of connection that will push them to the depths of Hell and dance throughout the walls of the exotic (and erotic) Exotica.  
 This is one of the most devastating films I have ever seen.",5.0
"Like with Trust, it's the best feeling whenever I show someone a favourite film of mine and they come away loving it. Bruce Greenwood as Francis, an emotionally desperate and broken tax auditor, is probably my favourite performance of all time. The hopelessness in his face, as well as his fixation with recapturing crucial elements of life he'll never truly get back, using Mia Kirshner's Christina and Sarah Polley's Tracey as his surrogates, breaks my heart. There's an incredible sense of closure as the film concludes involving Francis and Elias Koteas' Eric, both tragically sharing emotional characteristics with one another, as they embrace during the story's unravelling, which was previously characterised by seedy voyeurism and an uncomfortably tense atmosphere, always with a consistent understanding of the way in which this environment within the walls of the titular club can create the illusion of healing, bolstered by a killer soundtrack and dreamy visual flair. This is genuinely powerful stuff, the kind of conclusion which catapults an already great film to a masterpiece.",5.0
"Rewatched. A masterpiece by Canadian director Atom Egoyan. Here, everything is perfect: screenplay, actors, production design and music. Elias Koteas's character is almost as deeply moving as Bruce Greenwood's and I liked very much the use of the parrot figure (There's a parrot or at least a parrot's egg at every character's place) as a symbol of repetition in ´Exotica´. A film I'm proud to offer to my friends.",5.0

"contains a mystery that in different hands could’ve been kitschy trash, but here, the unraveling narrative web grows weightier with each turn, slowly revealing the secrets that the characters keep from each other and from themselves. depressing but not nihilistic, hypnotic but not slow. I’m generally allergic to these sorts of ~clever~ interweaving narratives about sad people being sad, but this one rises above other coincidence-porn stories by rendering the connections between characters so organically from an emotional standpoint - they’re not joined by divine providence or “fate,” but by shared, gnawing pain that brings them together into a harrowing, beautiful tableau of grief and coping. 
I often struggle with films that take on this puzzle-box structure, particularly in terms of finding actual thematic or emotional reasoning for the construction, but this one brilliantly pulls it off due to the POVs we follow being somewhat repressed and in grieving/denial, making the deliberate withholding of information a psychological depiction rather than a purely structural exercise. this angle makes the ensuing plot disclosures more than intentionally obfuscated narrative twists, and simulates the grief-stricken brains of these characters trying to process what they can hardly let themselves acknowledge. it’s a choice that’s primarily driven by perspective. beyond that, it’s a tableau of transactional relationships that are unique in how they’re based on emotional survival. the cumulative effect is devastating. I knew this was going to do a number on me when the first leonard cohen-scored strip sequence started at the depressed-people-strip-club (seriously, the way elias koteas pontificates on the schoolgirl fetish is by talking about how schoolgirls haven’t been worn down by time and regret yet lmao). truly empathetic, haunting filmmaking. will be thinking about that last scene for a while",0.0
"A rewarding second watch, as now knowing the characters’ background and how that would affect their interactions, I could appreciate the film’s meticulously constructed narrative structure: how delaying certain revelations would inform our’s judgement on the characters’ motivation and retrospectively invite us to reassess the meaning of the entire plot, it’s more complex than a shocking ‘twist’. My presumption of perversion would prove to be wrong, and the plot unexpectedly becomes life-reaffirming and cathartic but in an enigmatically engrossing way. It’s hard to take my eyes off throughout.

"Wholly relying on its atmosphere and structure to convey its emotions until it slowly reveals that it's far more than just an experiment in these things, the true wonder of Exotica shines through in every little detail, but you never realize how resonant it all is until the credits roll. It's cyclical in nature, repeating the same series of actions over and over again with slight variations that, slowly but surely, get to the core of the film and drag you closer to its heart before it all becomes far too intimate to bear. What once stood as an impenetrable wall of fog slowly gives way to certain tragedy behind the veneer that's far more personal and saddening than any guesses it forces you to come up with before its numerous reveals. With how warped and intricate it all is and how hard it leans on its dreamy aesthetics to keep you following along, the film ends up feeling like you, as a viewer, are wading your way through the trenches of these characters' subconsciouses, each with their own stories of love, loss, and pain waiting for you as you draw further inside.

deminden beri gevelememin de ele verebileceği üzere, böylesine vurucu bir eser hakkında görüşlerimi toparlamam imkansız şu an. izleyeli iki gün oluyor ve film hala beynimin içinde oynuyor. egoyan'dan ilk filmimdi ama insanlık durumunu böylesine sert ve unutulmaz şekilde aktarabilen bir isim ise sonuncusu olmayacağı kesin.
exotica, kusursuz. denecek başka bir şey yok. yeniden de izleyeceğim en yakın zamanda. o zamana kadar ise teşekkürler atom egoyan. neden bilmiyorum ama böyle bir filme ihtiyacım varmış, onu hissettim.

"I really don't know what to make of this film. Only that it's fantastic. The vibe was great and the structure was hypnotizing. I need to watch it again though because I don't exactly understand what happened. I assume the last scene was supposed to link everything together, but it didn't click for me. Too many characters and I got a bit lost trying to connect whether the characters were the same or different between some of the scenes. Needed to pay more attention to their names.
Anyway, was a perfect film to watch in the middle of the night. Giving this my recommendation, really worth seeing.",4.5
"I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a film so seductive yet devastating? You feel so much guilt watching these unfortunate lives play out so slowly, it’s almost a snail crawl of a film. It’s a repulsive feeling of self hatred when you get pulled in by it’s characters, especially Christina, you almost feel like you are intruding on something private, something you shouldn’t be listening in on. A lot of things aren’t resolved within the film, it tends to branch out into side stories to only deny us the solution. Usually this is due to lazy writing but in this film it only adds to its mystery. I can’t accurately describe what this film is about (loss, grief, the perils of sex?) or how it makes me feel, but I’ve found a new favorite.",5.0
"For Atom Egoyan's birthday.
Watching this after seeing THE SWEET HEREAFTER clarifies and confuses: this film, unlike that one, is genuinely about grief and pain and the alienation surrounding loss. However, there's an unnerving quality to the sexual perversion of children in this film that only highlights the same such stuff in the other––and I don't mean unnerving in that any sexualizing of children is unnerving, but unnerving in that the film seems not uninterested in decrying that. Usually, I don't pull the line that endorsement =/= depiction, but in this case, it's simply something I feel necessary to bring up.
This is, surprisingly, I think, a less ambitious film than THE SWEET HEREAFTER, despite the immediate sense of a more baroque vision. It certainly is more restrained in what it tries to tackle, and is therefore, I think, more satisfying aesthetically. Its backdrop (a fish store, a late capitalism urban environment and nightclub) is certainly preferable to the ghostly snow-burdened community of the later film. The Exotica's garish jungle of lights and mirrors and artifice is a production designer's dream come true.
What's so exciting, I think, about these two films by Egoyan is the way they embody the best of 90s cinema: the conscious discovery of pomo in narrative filmmaking, the employment of it towards the ends of traditional genre fare, gives us many of the most enjoyable films of the 90s and this is no exception. Egoyan, however, seems more genuinely interested in aesthetics and abstraction than the others, in the way that characters' emotional reaction push into the realm of naturalism in such an otherwise constructed film that they feel almost surreal: the way Christina and Francis interact in the club, or Christina's meltdown at Eric (the best scene in the film and an extraordinary moment of the director trusting the actors to make the scene work: the physicality Kirshner puts into it is genuinely disturbing and beautiful), or the reconciliation at the end. The epilogue, so quiet, restrained, focused on character, takes the sort of nonlinear resolution of PULP FICTION and grounds it so deeply in a left-field decision, one that feels both explanatory and un-, is one of the most affecting endings I've ever seen. Few times have I felt that I needed to rewatch a movie again so immediately and meant it.",0.0

"there’s a seductive clarity to what this film’s going for that’s hard to describe. it pushes against revelation, withholding until the very end, relishing the details that make up each character’s personal tragedy. everything’s connected in the worst of ways—they’re alive and they have no choice, so what can they do now? 
exotica is suffocating. it’s lush fields of green and then it’s home decor foliage trees, artificial; not a hint of life. it’s stagnation, longing for a vast, merciful past, for ambition, for someone else’s dream, but it’s never quite what you have and never quite what you hoped for.

"Not even a film, but an essay, cast as art to hide the vagueness of its ideas. Ludicrously schematic, pencil marks visible everywhere, every plot point sounding like the writer saying ""what if this"" or ""what if that."" I don't doubt he's explained his intentions in detail somewhere, and I'd love to hear him try to make the rare bird thing somehow defensible. (Is it really possible the film is just a sequence of association of ideas from the term ""exotic dancing,"" to race, and then to Rousseau and parrots?)
It's like he had some grand unified theory of mystery and desire and trauma that he thought he could dramatize despite having none of the skill needed to do it. Some reviews mention Lynch but I think that's only the uncanniness resulting from actors straining against terrible dialogue. The writing is so bad that I kept wondering if it was meant to be in some register or tone I wasn't expecting, but then a character would recite some awful length of exposition and I'd feel less charitable.",1.5

"It's a jungle out there, and in Atom Egoyan's cryptic and surprisingly affecting Exotica, the jungle lives everywhere. Whether it be an exotic pet store or the titular strip club at the center, strange creatures caw and growl in the background of an otherwise bleak and mundane existence. Within the corners, consumed by fog, live our strange set of characters, all effected by mysterious, psychological ailments. Through their obsessions, their rituals, their inexplicable idiosyncrasies, they partake in self-induced fantasies - where an intense need for solace brims underneath sexual pleasures.
Atom Egoyan strikes that difficult balance between style and substance, soaking Exotica in a noir-like haze while sneaking in Big Ideas of family, kinship, and healing in the process. While the characters, ranging from an exotic egg smuggler to a depressed strip club DJ with a God complex, burst with kookiness, Egoyan never lets humor deteriorate his empathetic vision. Whereas someone like Todd Solondz would paint these kinds of weirdos with a pitch-black-funny cruelty, Egoyan caresses them like rehabilitated wild animals. That's not to say Exotica veers into sentimentality. On the contrary, Exotica barely provides any answers, only a nodding appreciation of those sad shmucks hiding in the shadows of seedy sex clubs.
Through the transaction of money, these characters look not for power, but for relief. Egoyan boldly suggests that camouflaged beneath a fetish, a fantasy, a striptease - are people seeking temporary comfort. A comfort in place of a trauma or a disappointment. An escape that can repeat itself night after night, but never fully heal them. Exotica doesn't glorify or pity these creatures, but understands why they have do it and why they can't stop. After all, in a jungle as chaotic and unsympathetic as ours, what else do we have to soothe ourselves but our rituals?",5.0

"Since witnessing Sarah Polley’s talent in the recent TV mini series Alias and Grace, I made a point to take a tour through some of her earlier works. Starting with this Canadian gem.  Sarah plays a relatively minor role but carries herself well.
Exotica begins in a desperate setting - a strip club where lonely men gather to yearn for a love that can only ever be elusive and ungratified. The pace begins slowly until the disparate characters with their disconnected story lines begin to merge. The film reaches a crescendo in the final 15 minutes with the help of the gravely voice of Leonard Cohen.  Haunting in its penetrating glimpse into loneliness, grief, and yearning.",4.0

"Money, sex and trauma. Like the invisible omnipresence of gravity when not on your mind, like your brain is a pair of hands too close to a flame when they’re in the foreground. Some of the greatest films ever made are about the insidiousness of their confluence, or, at least, two of the three. In Eyes Wide Shut, it’s the former two; late capitalism is a razor blade in the candy basket of desire; all of pleasure undergirded by their power accorded to value. In Twin Peaks, the latter pair–-the spiritual pillars of the universe are the mythologies we create to deal with the dysphoria of trauma, but particularly the trauma of sexual domination.
I’ve never quite seen the way these things overlap in our lives be approached with such empathy as they are in Exotica. Its structure hinges on our own worst notions about their triangulation in how its early scenes tease us by withholding explanations to disturbing or strange behavior; that to be hurt is to exploit, that to exploit means a series of transactions where power is imbalanced. We think that is what is going on in the stories’ early movements. There is some of it; great films are, of course, about the way mixed blessings and thin lines between victory and defeat are the stuff of life. But if the tools by which we exploit are so conglomerately true to the borders and textures of our ontologies, then unless there is no love in the world, love may have no choice but to speak in blighted tongues.
Because in these environments we make for our fantasies to play out (like a strip club), care is never totally absent, and care is love. Egoyan makes a film where, because of grief and pain, titillation and payment and the roleplay they’re tied into are repositories of care. Roleplay, fantasy, and desire are often the means by which freedom, or happiness, or satisfaction is achieved in art, but care?
But, as Elias Koteas’ DJ reminds us with his foul play, care is delicate; pulled ever-so slightly away, the balance is strained, and desire is the world’s again—as fuel for oppression, exploitation, dominance, the extenuating end point of want. That is what is so powerful about the end of the film. That last shot suggests, with its score and its portent, the fickle instability of our empathy in a world built from transaction and objectification. We will not find it anywhere else but straight through that shell of wanting always around us—there is no place else to find it for there is no place else. So, then it’s also a film about choice. Your desires are going nowhere. Everybody knows them. You built them piecemeal from your trauma until you wore it like a suit. What care can you build from out of the raw materials?",5.0
"Peak. Stunning. A seemingly sordid mystery that leads to the only place it can go; pain… and empathy.
A mystery That when solved, turns everything on its head.
Egoyan mastered the ability to keep the characters at an unknowable distance without making them dull or uninteresting; we still connect with them on an emotional, human, and reactive plane. Once it all makes sense, there's a sense of relief that your worst fears or chauvinistic capitalistic exploitation are not true, except in how the grief looks.
It's a pure talent to be able to shoot 50% or this movie featuring scenes of half-naked women dancing and make the film not erotic (in a good way).
A highly technically exploration of how despite conditioning to assume the worst, we must remain hopeful that people couldn't possibly want to hurt us, for that's mean.
It's says more about society and “the system” that it does an individual that one of the few ways capitalism allows for the legal exchange of intimacy to be one that fetishes young women.",4.5

"English:
The fact that the content of the film presents itself as something very little explained and even somewhat abstract, means that the viewer has to be guided more purely by the power of the images – more precisely and sometimes even literally, by the seduction of each scene, regardless of get to know characters, motivations or even the plot itself. This more confusing diffusion of images does not sound unusual, precisely because the film always proposes very particular sensations for each segment, which make the viewer not only question the characters and situations, but feel their dramatic relationships through the acting and other elements of the staging.

"While I've been aware of this film, I never really thought of watching it. I guess I always assumed there was something a bit skanky about it because when I worked in a video store over 20 years ago only a certain type of customer would rent it... If you know what I mean.
Having now finally seen it I am all the more curious about those customers and what they thought they would be getting and if they were disappointed that instead of a skin flick from a chain video store they ended up with a meditative Cronenberg-esque arthouse film. Kind of makes me giggle a bit in retrospect.
The movie is withholding to the point of being a little too oblique for my tastes. I understand that it's a contemplation on grief, loss, and pain - the eroticism present is definitely beside the point, almost a knowing backdrop to something much more visceral and ineffable. But I think the film obfuscates those powerful ideas by having all these characters sleepwalk their way through the film to the point of erasing their humanity. I am not asking for melodrama, but the lack of emotion, of conversation, of any semblance of clarity ends up making it very hard to connect to the movie - as though we are looking through that two way mirror and only getting a partial version of the story. I also think that Elias Koteas is very miscast and sticks out too much, bringing a creepier energy than this film required.

The exploration into trauma bonding, looking for something to heal a wound that can never fully heal, trying to help people receive closure they can never fully get. There’s so much fucking ache pouring off every frame, and the way it all comes together in those final 15 or so minutes is absolutely transcendent.",5.0

"The saddest parts of EXOTICA — Atom Egoyan’s lush and affecting sixth feature, a movie inflected like its predecessors by obsessive sexual rituals and desperate familial longings — are moments when money awkwardly changes hands. This film is every bit as allegorical as his SPEAKING PARTS, THE ADJUSTER, and CALENDAR — and every bit as concerned with a need for family surrogates as NEXT OF KIN and FAMILY VIEWING — but it is only incidentally a movie about capitalism and its ability to pervert personal relationships. It does involve voyeurism, corruption, and a form of prostitution; all these things are conventionally associated with capitalism, but they’ve been around much longer.
EXOTICA has plenty to say about the modern world, including the psychological, social, and racial (even colonial) ramifications of “exotic” sexual tastes, but class difference isn’t a significant part of its agenda either. The personal and professional links forged between individuals — and there are very few relationships in this movie that aren’t both personal and professional — all seem predicated on forms of barter, as well as the assumption that everyone is, or eventually becomes, either a substitute for a missing family member or a virtual double for someone else. Within such a context, where the private and the public intersect as often as the personal and the professional, money is merely the glue, yet it always seems to tarnish the authenticity of the relationships of those involved.
The most beautiful and interesting thing about the movie is its central set — a dreamlike upstairs nightclub called Exotica where women dance for and talk to male clients at individual tables without allowing themselves to touch or be touched. The cavernous reaches of EXOTICA imply a self-sustaining universe, yet this labyrinthine space is full of deceptive hierarchies. Perched somewhere above the tables, the fake palm trees, and the stage apron where the dancers make their entrances is a loquacious MC/DJ called Eric (Elias Koteas). Sitting at a counter, he introduces the dancers with an improvised spiel, conjuring up the fantasies each woman is meant to embody. To all appearances, he’s the ringmaster-god of this artificial and faintly colonial jungle paradise.
But appearances are illusory. Eric is stationed immediately outside a curious space, hidden by the decor, where the true boss of the establishment, a pregnant women named Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), surveys the action in the nightclub below through apertures shaped like the nude bodies of women. But this is more than an office. It’s also Zoe’s home, and we eventually learn that she inherited it as well as the club from her mother. It’s a private womb inside a public womb, a sacred homestead inside a profane nightclub — or a profane homestead inside a sacred nightclub — and everything that EXOTICA is about radiates from its troubled center.
I’ve hesitated to review this film at length until well after its opening because it seems impossible to discuss what it’s about without describing the plot in some detail. Like other recent Egoyan features, EXOTICA intercuts between several apparently autonomous plot strands and then gradually reveals, via flashbacks and other revelations, how intertwined these strands are. (“I wanted to structure the film like a striptease,” Egoyan has said, “gradually revealing an emotionally loaded history.”) Though this convoluted story is anything but realistic, there are a number of facts about the characters and their past that most viewers won’t want to learn before seeing the movie. My advice to them is to skip the next section, which contains major revelations, and perhaps the section after that as well, which contains a couple of minor revelations.
Zoe, we soon discover, is a former lover of Eric, and it’s his baby she’s carrying; her current lover appears to be Chrissy (Mia Kirshner), one of her main dancers, who dresses in a schoolgirl’s outfit and caters every night to a man with special needs named Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood). Chrissy is also a former lover of Eric’s, but she doesn’t know Zoe is carrying his baby or that another business transaction, sealed by a contract, hovers over the pregnancy — a dark discovery she (and we) makes only toward the end of the picture.
We also eventually discover that Francis’s particular need for Chrissy stems from the rape and murder of his daughter years before; shortly after this tragedy his wife, a woman of color, died in a car accident with his brother, who was crippled by the same accident, and Francis then discovered that the two of them were lovers. Every night before he goes to Exotica Francis picks up his brother’s teenage daughter and drops her off at his house, going through the charade that his daughter is still alive and needs a baby-sitter; after he leaves the club he collects his niece, drives her home, and pays her, until she eventually decides to stop.
In the daytime Francis, who’s a tax auditor, is investigating Thomas (Don McKellar), a smuggler of specialty items who operates a pet store as a front. In the film’s opening sequence Francis is looking through a one-way mirror at Thomas as he passes through customs with hyacinth macaw eggs strapped to his chest, while commenting on his behavior to a black customs official.
Sharing a cab into Toronto from the airport, Thomas is paid by his fellow passenger for his portion of the fare with a couple of ballet tickets instead of money–a chance event that inaugurates one of the film’s many repetitive rituals. Thomas turns up at the ballet that night, finds a young man of color looking for a single ticket, and sells it to him; they watch the performance together, Thomas eyes his crotch, and afterward Thomas insists on paying his companion back for the ticket because he got both tickets for free. The two following nights Thomas purchases two tickets to the same ballet, finds another young man of color to sell the extra ticket to, sits with him at the performance, eyes his crotch, and pays him back for the ticket afterward. The third such companion returns to Thomas’s flat for sex, and Thomas discovers the next morning that he’s a customs official who’s been tracking Thomas as part of his undercover work–the same man we saw in the opening scene.
Alternating with this story — a relatively benign and unneurotic account of “exotic” sexual cruising, at least in this movie’s terms — are the interlocking stories of Francis, Chrissy, Eric, and Zoe, some of which involve comparable repetition compulsions. Every night Francis and Chrissy go through the same routine at the nightclub: he talks to her about what might happen to her if he weren’t around to protect her while she performs a partial striptease in close proximity to him, almost touching him but never quite making contact; then he excuses himself to go to the men’s room, where he masturbates in one of the stalls. Via flashbacks, we learn that Eric and Chrissy originally met as members of the search party looking for Francis’s daughter and that this meeting apparently led to Zoe’s hiring Eric. Then, in a flashback that comprises the last scene in the movie (though it’s the earliest scene in the film’s chronology), we learn that Chrissy was the daughter’s original baby-sitter.
During the story’s present time, which covers three days and nights, Eric, distraught by the emotional intimacy he witnesses between Francis and Chrissy, goes to the men’s room to talk to Francis and persuades him to touch her, insisting that she wants him to. When he sees Francis touch her soon afterward, he throws Francis out of the club for breaking the house rules. Unable to reenter the club, Francis blackmails Thomas — by threatening to expose his smuggling operation — into visiting the club and seeing Chrissy in his stead, carrying a concealed microphone so that he can follow their conversation in his car. Once Francis confirms that Eric set him up the previous night, he resolves to murder him, but this plan is thwarted the following night when Eric confronts him outside the club, explaining that he was the one who found the body of Francis’s little girl; Francis responds by sorrowfully embracing him. It’s one of the last in a long string of encounters in which an impersonal transaction finally gives way to warmth and some form of shared recognition.
Hovering over this tortured story is the specter of incestuous desire, involving both the acknowledgment and the disavowal of that desire, and its relation to fetishism. In certain branches of Freudian film theory influenced by the late Jacques Lacan, this acknowledgment and disavowal is expressed in the phrase “Je sais bien…mais comme meme” (“I know perfectly well…but just the same”), and it’s been theorized that some version of this formula is at work in the suspension of disbelief experienced by every filmgoer, who knows perfectly well that the movie — the cinematic fetish, the object of desire — is illusory but agrees to believe in it just the same. It seems highly likely that Egoyan is aware of this connection: all his recent movies are largely about the subtle contractual deals that are struck between spectator and spectacle, between forbidden desires and the disavowals of those desires. So it would logically follow that they’re also movies about the experience of watching movies.
The “acknowledgment” in EXOTICA is contained in the familiar Leonard Cohen song “Everybody Knows,” which accompanies Chrissy’s stage entrance and opening dance every night at the club. The “disavowal” is signaled by a recurring home-video image of Francis’s wife holding up her hand to block Francis’s camera from taping their daughter. As Egoyan points out in an illuminating interview with Lawrence Chua in the March issue of Artforum, this image is “obviously a moment in Francis’s home video that has become fetishized and taken out of context. All through the film we see that moment of the mother holding up her hand to protect the girl from the father’s gaze. It’s a very threatening gesture — it seems like something in the middle of a violent or potentially violent encounter. At the end of the film we realize that in fact it’s just a very casual and humorous moment within the family. Francis has isolated that moment, and it has come to represent what he now feels toward his daughter.” And significantly, not long before the film finally demythologizes this image of disavowal, it offers us another one involving Chrissy — Francis’s surrogate daughter — that remains highly charged: Eric shielding her eyes when they find the daughter’s body in a field.
I’ve seen EXOTICA twice, ten months apart, and the two experiences were substantially different. At Cannes last year the overall prurience of the subject matter — highly evocative of the sort of puritanical repressions I associate with Ontario in general (such as its censor board) and Toronto in particular — tended to blind me to the warmth of many of the personal interactions between the characters, which exist in spite of their corrupt, ritualized professional relations. Considering the movie’s eroticism and the sense of carnal revelation that underlies the narrative structure, I suppose I responded with a certain prurience of my own: I began to feel I was being manipulated, encouraged to pursue a dirty secret that, when the denouement finally arrived, seemed rather paltry.
I can’t say this response was entirely eclipsed in my second viewing, but it became sufficiently complicated that I realized that the film’s key achievement is less its resolution or “payoff” than its stylistic means of getting there. Regarding the resolution itself, which is meant to spell out some of the origins of Francis’s sexual trauma, Egoyan admits in his Artforum interview that he came up with it only after mapping out most of the rest of the film. He calls the overall evolution of his script organic, but what makes the ending less than satisfactory is its willfulness — it’s as if he created an imaginary disease to account for a few symptoms.
But if this resolution seems contrived, its formal execution and effect are harder to fault. A central part of the movie’s dreamlike ambience derives from the fact that the camera is in motion in practically every shot — until we arrive at the final one, an extended take that shows a character retreating into the background and entering a house. Defining a static point of origin — comparable in a way to Zoe’s house inside the nightclub, built by her mother long before any of the film’s events take place — this lingering shot at the end of a flashback places a full stop after the fantasies that have dominated the film up to this point. But it’s a beginning as well as an end; the fixed image of a home finally says more about the film as a whole than any of the specifics of Francis’s particular trauma.
Prior to this conclusion the form of camera movement is generally a slow pan around the periphery of whatever’s being filmed, creating an overall sense of drift and reverie that implicitly links the nightclub with the pet shop and both of these central locations with the conversations between Francis and his niece in his car. (The only other movie I can think of that utilizes this kind of camera movement as pervasively is Robert Altman’s THE LONG GOODBYE, and it may not be irrelevant that the only other movie that uses Leonard Cohen songs to comparably suggestive and dreamlike effect is another of Altman’s best films from the 70s, MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER.)
What I like about these camera movements, combined with the exotic, erotic ambience of Mychael Danna’s score, is that they simultaneously implicate us in the characters’ fantasies and place us at some distance from them. We literally view the action from shifting perspectives, but the rhythm and direction of our drifting gaze seem to place us directly inside the obsessions of the characters. Like them, we’re looking for a final resting place that only a home and a family can provide — cruising in search of some notion of fulfillment that seems lost in the distant past.

I suppose it’s time to raise my rating. I mean, I’ve had a fascination with this movie since I was 12. I watch it once every decade or so, but it always has a palpable sense of mystery. I love that. 
Check out the Criterion release if you can. 



NOTE: Christina wears so much clothes. It’s like billowing around her.",5.0
"First Time Watch
Exotica surprisingly works as a great character study darkest secrets of a group of people who should have no connection with one another but also works a psychological erotic drama due to its pretty good direction and clever writing by Atom Egoyan with solid performances from a very well talented cast Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner, Elias Koteas, Sarah Polley, and Don McKellar.
The themes involved here as far as grief over a child, seduction and such does goes into some pretty intense subject matter too. With great cinematography and great characters, the movie definitely can be interesting to watch if a bit uncomfortable at times due to some of the subject matter but the way it comes across it's heavy mature themes, it does it without being beatened over the head and being boring.
There's some issues with some moments that are a bit heavy to watch but nothing really disturbing and there's some actors here who does get underused as far as characters goes but overall, this wasn't too bad of a film to watch and it is a pretty great film from this director despite not seeing everything he's done. Not gonna be for everyone due to its subject matter but the film works overall with it's capable direction and strong cast.

""Nobody asked you if you wanted to brought into the world, you just ended up getting here. So the question is, now that you're here, who's asking you to stay?""
A neo-noir that uses it's sensuous implications as a smoke screen for a truly fascinating story of loss, trauma, redemption, obsession, denial, desperation, loneliness and healing. It's not too long before you realize this film has other things on its mind than the titillating poster and tagline would have you expect. A lesser film than this would give you all the exposition of the characters in the first act only to reveal some contrived thriller twist at the end. But the way this unravels is master story-telling at its finest. It explores the depths of what could possibly motivate these characters. Because of the setting in a moody upscale strip club, the immediate judgements go to lustful, nefarious and physchologically disturbing places. But what Egoyan has in store for the viewer is something far more simple. Being completely genuine to the world it creates and yet still greater in scope than one would expect; bringing the film to an entirely satisfying conclusion in a brilliantly conceived and executed final scene leaving this viewer compelled to rewind and reset and experience the whole thing over again.
...Also what an unreal soundtrack!! The Leonard Cohen Strip Club is real.",5.0

"Well performed and moves along with a mysterious, alluring pull but ultimately I wasn’t really moved by it. Idk I might just be emotionally allergic to these type of interconnected dramas. Nice soundscape tho, captured the sexually charged, puzzling atmosphere perfectly and made me want to listen to Leonard Cohen on repeat.",3.0
"I feel like I'm coming to this a couple decades too late for it to have the desired impact. This meditation on grief didn't do much to move me emotionally, but I still appreciated the film from a more distant remove, as it does possess a hypnotic power at times. The story of each character takes its time to unfold - or undress, if you will - but I just wish it hit me harder. I know this is a cult fave, so I'm hoping a second watch will land better with me.",3.5
"this is such a hypnotic film. the score is what sold it from the beginning, the first 10 minutes have such incredible music and goes incredibly well with the entire atmosphere, and the whole feel of this entire movie is just dreamy. Exotica also remains very engaging the whole time and does an amazing job juggling separate but connected storylines and with the remarkable pacing, the story is told perfectly. Overall the substance and style of this film are both on point and I really loved everything about this.",5.0
everybody knows by leonard cohen and some vibes of the three colours trilogy. damn good movie.,0.0
"On its surface it’s another 90s erotic thriller with classy ambiance, but if you look deeper it’s a felt rendering of alienation and how that’s turned genuine connection into something more transactional. There’s an element of these constructs, this paternal gaze and control, but also how many relationships are a series of projections, and interactions meant to gain something. It doesn’t feel doom and gloom judgement of it, but delicately exploring different ways people traverse these barriers the modern world has put up. It’s a portrait of all these intertwining characters who are dealing with all these festering scars and wounds that slowly come to light as this thing  moves along.
The atmosphere of this film is an intoxicating balance of erie, wistful and genuine warmth. The hypnotic score gets under you’re skin. A lot of this takes place in a strip joint, but it’s cold, weird and not tantalizing(I guess you get what you pay for with $5 lap dances) It’s has this Lynch or 
Depalma quality in the way it intentionally exposes, distorts and fittingly perverts the artifice, this grandiose operatic exoticisms mixed with this kind of soft core porn aesthetic. Can’t lie this movie being super Canadian definitely created an interesting dissonance for me in similar way to David Croenberg’s early work. (As an American I couldn’t help but giggle every time they referred to the bathroom as the washroom)
The performances are excellent. They do a good job of straddling the line between cold and deadpan, and when the moment calls for it raw and emotional. Whenever Elias Kotas and Arsinee Khanjian in film, I just know shits gonna get weird. Mia Kirshner’s gives a very felt and emotional raw performance that ascends past “innocent school girl essence” exotic dancer persona. Bruce Greenwood gives believably worn down deeply internal turn. The characters work as both symbols and real fleshed out humans. There are some ways the loose ends reveal and connect that feel a little clunky, but the final scene of this brings it together in an enigmatic, but kind of lucid way that feels like a perfect mic drop.",4.0
"Everyone's hurting because of someone else and because they all surveil each other. Every interaction is a transaction, even a pregnancy needs a contract. On paper, this makes Exotica very interesting, but every means every, and all of that means there's not much variation in ideas. There's variation in story. That moves, and Egoyan has clear control over and structure to revealing information, building this strange world of universal pain. It's a bit clean for me, on first watch, a bit too puzzle-controlled, not without some images fighting this, erotic and unstable and mysterious: Thomas with his hands loosely tied in his shirt above his head as the customs officer goes down on him, Christina's outburst in the dressing room, Christina taking Thomas's hand off of her leg and slowly, slowly closing it.",3.0
"Watching this, I wasn't exactly finding myself connecting to it. To be completely honest Atom Egoyan has been a huge blindspot for me over the years, so maybe I had some kind of expectations built-in when I hit play? That said, in the 24 hours since I watched it this really crept up on me and its sadness rattled around in my brain a bunch in a way that I really appreciated.",4.0
"Devastatingly erotic, but less so in the often physically and visual fashion and more in psychologically forbidden ways. The movie centers most of its club dancing scenes around a lust for the schoolgirl archetype, and whether you find this enticing or not is something that Egoyan has zero regard for. Christina is meant to be looked at and and sexualized despite the taboo around her character's on-stage persona, and the viewer is meant to reckon with that because Christina isn't actually here for our pleasure. It's all for the client. Exotica focuses so heavily on the deviance of money and what it can provide you with. Can you buy your forbidden happiness? Do you even want to find out? It's one hell of a ride that builds and builds as long you have enough money in your wallet to buy some time to prove you're special.",5.0
"Mainly set in the strip club known as Exotica,  this movie focuses on Christina, an alluring dancer whose schoolgirl persona is popular at the club but always under the watchful eye of former boyfriend and DJ played by Elias Koteas.  Bruce Greenwood is pretty great as a man who frequents the club who has a darkness and sadness about him.  Very thoughtful and multilayered film.",3.0
"I didn’t expect this to be a favorite going in - I had no idea what it would be about. This movie was incredible. It kept me guessing, every character was interesting, the storyline was interesting, and at the same time i felt like the movie as more of an experience because of how the director put together the images and the soundtrack. It just flowed so well. that flow and energy i’m looking for in a movie was here and I now want to get more into Egoyan’s films..",5.0
"From the first frame, the dreamy mood is enthralling. Currents of fog, lush lights, sultry movement, hypnotic thrum of music, languorously drifting camera— everything seeps together to form a mesmerizing spell.
Although caught in the trap of the atmosphere, I was not won over by the film’s narrative gambit. It keeps its characters far past arm’s length for most of the runtime, relying on its misty mood for far too long. Effectively, it un-plots itself and un-does its characters by shifting all the information to the end— but by the time its events and motivations are truly revealed, not enough has happened and the pieces have fallen together in a way that I find doesn’t amount to much.",2.5
"A beautiful, harrowing story, delicately, intricately, and brilliantly interwoven between four or five characters in such a way that there's a full pastiche of all of their neuroses and their pain, and it never goes over the top. The performances are really top-notch, too. The haunting, beautiful score and the subtle themes of voyeurism (I LOVE the set of the Exotica, and all of the one-way glass), suppressed (and a counterpoint of fully expressed-) sexuality, and familial trauma make this absolutely unforgettable.
Some of the exposition was a bit too much for me on first viewing, so I'm stopping just short of a perfect five stars. On the other hand, I'm tempted to rewatch this as soon as possible, so we'll see if I appreciate the film that little bit more to get it there next time I see it.

"Exotica is an enigmatic film. Watching it is like watching a dish be prepared, you've got all these ingredients but you're not exactly sure what they'll be used for and what the finished product will look like. Slowly the dish comes together and you gain appreciation for the final product and the steps that went into making it. That's what type of film this is, Atom Egoyan starts with a loose set of ingredients and constructs a dish with themes of lust, loneliness, and acceptance.
I felt very confused at the beginning, the film just sort of gets going without pleasuring the viewer with a proper introduction to the plot. By the end, the final shot comes around and you are able to reflect on the wide number of revelations gained throughout the film. Rewatching it would/will be a completely different experience, context is so important with this film.
There is definitely some 90's quirkiness to this film, Elias Koteas's role as the slimy DJ is something you could really only find back then, especially the way he dressed!
Overall a pretty good film and definitely worth a watch.",4.0

"Gets a lot of mileage out of two way mirrors, which always struck me as misnamed. Google two way mirror and you'll get a result that says, ""also known as a one way mirror."" Not quite right either! It's a one way window, really.
Whatever you call it, the ability to observe people through a reflection of themselves is, in cinema, quite compelling. The people on the mirror end of the equation are not mere specimens. The mirror implies consciousness, an ability to know one's self. But the window on the other side of it, and especially the observer, suggests that the behavior is not so self contained as all that. It is not merely reflective; it is revealing.
The soul of a place is in the backroom. Whatever the promises of plaster ruins and silk flower tropicalia, Exotica's essence lies in the plywood cutouts of women's silhouettes through which the main action can be observed. That, and the graffiti on the bathroom stall. There's a chasm between fantasy and reality, and it's where a person can be unobserved, aka, truly alone.
Not for nothing: Exotica greatly resembles dreaded Denver birthday party cafeteria Casa Bonita.
As a child I had an unexplainable (haha) affinity for macaws, so I was a little disappointed that the gay macaw smuggling storyline just ended like that. There was so much there. Slimy green barely illuminated tanks housing unknown creatures (what do we inherit from our parents? strip clubs and pet stores!), ballet hustlers, that cute guy energy that only turns to sexiness when his shirt comes off.

"Dipped in perverted sexual tension, Atom Egoyan's Exotica finds itself somewhere between a cautionary tale on the consequences of our temptations, and a tale on the sad reality of living vicariously through others to fill our voids. Egoyan captures eroticism on the screen unlike any other; Exotica is an opus that displays sexual fantasy in an all-too-confrontational way, one that nearly prevents total sympathy for any one character.",4.5
"Moody, melancholy, and deeply empathetic. Absolutely loved it. Also, few artists have a better track record of their music in film than Leonard Cohen.",5.0
"The way Egoyan weaves together all the threads into a tapestry of loneliness, resentment, and denial, without ever feeling like he's piecing together a puzzle the viewer has to solve (is that a mixed metaphor?), is impressive, and enthralling. Impeccable casting and fluid pacing, and the rhythm with which the narrative both unfurls and comes together feels like a revelation of storytelling. One minor qualm: I don't know if his visual sense/the photography just isn't so stylish, or if the 123movies stream is just low-quality, but I do wish the movie popped a little more, visually.
Edit: I've confirmed it was the stream quality, so I retract that criticism.",4.5

"Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter are both about an audience putting the pieces together of a situation where the characters, too, are trying to make sense of tragedy, but not finding that solace. The metaphor of the two-way mirror works as this film's main thematic element, about how we can watch them, and observe, but have to pay such close attention to understand their individual plights.
The film plays on the idea of exotic creatures. Exotic creatures are unattainable, as is finding sense in senselessness. Sense in our chaotic world is the ultimate exotic.
I know Egoyan's later films are universally panned, but I don't know if I can ever watch them knowing that he fell from these two masterworks of 90s independent cinema. They are both purely unique, feeling separate from other cinema, mythic in tone.
See it.",5.0
"I've had the mid-90s Atom Egoyan on my to-do list for quite a while. This one and The Sweet Hereafter have been as much on my radar, as the turn of the 80s/90s Hal Hartley was before I watched Trust and The Unbelievable Truth. There's a lot of directors out there that have these periods of acclaimed movies I yet haven't found the time and place to dive into, and it's comforting to know that despite all those classics and masterpieces I get to, there's still a lot more out there to discover and appreciate.
1994 have already given me experiences like Kieslowski's Three Colors: Red, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express and Besson's Léon. Others would certainly mention The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, The Lion King, and maybe even Clerks or Dumb and Dumber. Then there's Satantango, Ed Wood and In the Heat of the Sun... 1994 might not be the best movie year in history, but there's certainly quite a few goodies to pick from that year. And now I'm willing to add Egoyan's Exotica to the nomination-list as well...
I've got more respect for the general level of Canadian actors and actresses than most I'll presume. I've seen quite a few smaller films coming out of there, as well as followed a few TV-shows and also paid attention to those of them that have made names for them self across the border. Here there's once again good-to-great performances across the board. Elias Koteas is always a pleasure, Bruce Greenwood gives one heck of a performance, I'm admittedly not Mia Kirshner's biggest fan but she's great here as well, and Sarah Polley is--of course--always a pleasure whether it's on screen, behind the script or in the director's chair.
Egoyan sets the mood from the opening, and then he just begins to wrap his mold around our perceptions. With the help of a seducing soundtrack, Egoyan's skills as film-maker are far more seducing than any of the dancers at our nightclub, Exotica. Slowly he takes us under the skin of his intriguing characters, and feed us their stories a tiny bit at the time. I'm never annoyed with him for his choices. He gives me just enough to have me hang on for more, craving it. Just like the lap dancers looking to seduce us into buying another dance and hand out a lot of tips, Egoyan have us hypnotized for more information, more clues and more depth.
It's not because he uses cheap trickery, stylized takes or nonlinear storytelling, but rather because he understands human nature so well. These characters aren't your everyday A4-people blowing steam after a long day at the office, but he doesn't chalk them off as destroyed souls for us to indulge in. He doesn't manipulate us into pity, anger or even awkward shame over their behavior either, but rather undress them--layer for layer--and leave them naked for our consideration. It might not be the lap dance you came for, but there's still a lot of beauty to be found in this devastating exercise. Whatever you're left taking from the experience is as much on you as on Egoyan. That's pure class.",4.5
"Floored by this - a uniquely powerful and alluring masterpiece. Exotica gradually reins in and weaves together the fractured lives orbiting this Toronto strip club, a setting that dictates the entire direction of the film. Egoyan’s approach is akin to a slow tease, in which he delicately unveils his characters’ desires and deceptions while bridging the gaps between their storylines. Like patrons at the club, we’re kept an arm’s length away from the film’s truths until he deems us ready for them. And there are just so many dense and consequential layers for him to strip away; to go from such an aloof, disconnected starting point to one of the most walloping final shots I’ve ever seen is a massive achievement in direction. I have no idea how he gets us there, but it is so earned and impactful. Will never forget it.
Danna’s score is among the best of the ’90s - it’s completely in sync with the film’s erotic energy and unyielding mysteries. Reminiscent of Hisaishi’s work for Kitano or Thomas Newman from the era, maybe even the Strange Days soundtrack. I’m obsessed!",5.0

"As mysterious and imaginative as Jacques Rivette's Duelle, seemingly abstract and nightmarish in the vein of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive at first, and then more comparable to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut or, in its final minutes, 2001 without the galactic scope or surrealism, yet almost as impactful and precise.
Exotica does not act like a mere imitation of these masters; it, without hyperbole, operates on the same level as some of the greatest movies ever made. Initial confusion turns into gobsmacking disbelief when the pieces slowly start to come together. If you go in knowing nothing, you will be in for an unforgettable viewing experience.

"I didn't expect this movie to be so human, the final scene moved me deeply.

The slow reveal of each character's backstory and motivations leads to one of the best final reveals I've ever seen.",4.0
"A movie that deprives voyer of his comfortable anonymous position by making him an object of observation himself. A transparent wall is enough to reverse the power relations. Cinema in its essence is such a transparent wall, it possesses the power to reverse its gaze: the voyeuristic viewer feels that his soul was exposed. And, akin to strip clubs, cinema condemns the viewer to infinite solitude: what you watch you cannot touch.",4.0

"This kind of screenwriting where everybody's connected and the backstory details are artfully teased out has been so thoroughly overdone at this point that I can no longer separate Exotica from the lesser films and series that came after it. Is the film skillful? Yes, but it wasn't very interesting to watch this time around. Everything's written in big bold letters (*emphatic dolly push in on the mantle photo of the absent family members*), and the performances are directed to be so brooding that no room is given to maneuver playfully around clumsy expositional dialogue. Everything just sits there. Boring. I guess I prefer surrealism these days -- nothing's connected, nothing makes sense. Those are the films I tend to like more than this everyone's connected shit.",0.0
"A rare ending that upends the viewer's perception of what they've been watching but one that validates what came before rather than squandering it. It's a good thing too, because this tends to be a wandering sketch-like affair through much of the runtime. My attention never waned, but I certainly wanted to arrive at a better understanding of the circumstances. Egoyan keeps attention by way of instilling a sense of mystery about every single character. They're all damaged, but this never becomes the bludgeoning droll that The Sweet Hereafter devolves into. The film's best scene involves a montage of Christina and Eric's first meeting spliced with a sequence of Eric switching a lightbulb on and off. All the performances are great but Elias Koteas and Bruce Greenwood stand out as exceptional. Definitely one I'll be revisting.",3.5
"How can a film about trauma and isolation and is drenched in fluorescent neon and hazy stage smoke be so beautiful?
Atom Egoyan explores the inherent human question of why we use sexuality as currency, whether to explicitly gain something or to repress something. Three stories overlap; a grieving and emotionally-stunted Revenue Canada agent, an exotic pet store owner, and a dancer battling an obsessive emcee at her gentlemen's club. All of them converge on a single location - Exotica, a club in Toronto that seems to be the harbinger of trauma and repulsion.
Egoyan does a terrific job of building a setting that feels both liberating and confined at the same time; Elias Kotea's emcee character sits upon a perch overlooking the club, monitoring the dancers and money-stuffed patrons and two-way mirrors litter the club - thought to be designed by the owner to keep the staff safe, but a sexual escape for a rich patron. Money can buy a lot of things, but it can't escape its conversion rate into sexuality. Won't find that on the NASDAQ.
The film uses low-lighting liberally and it works in its favor to create a haunting scene. Everyone feels like they are lingering the shadows, waiting for light to shine on them. When natural light is brought into a scene, we're treated to a sense of normalcy yet that doesn't stay around too long. The cinematography doesn't employ a lot of close-ups, choosing to remain far from the action and leave the performers to their own device. It makes us feel more like voyeurs than participants in the film, which works well in this film's favor. We always feel like we're watching moments that were thought hidden.
The performances were tragically glorious; Mia Kirshner is just a favorite of mine. She never fails to deliver and Bruce Greenwood plays off it so well. Based on the performances and delivery alone, there's a mutual understanding between cast and screenplay that compliments each other. Nothing feels off and nothing feels misunderstood - everyone is creating the most important part together: the convergence of the stories and how they intertwine. Without it, the whole plot would fall apart and the conflicts would never bubble to the top.",4.0
"Wow, the less said about this the better for your first viewing. I went in pretty much blind and it was such a fantastic experience. Exotica moves at such a glacial pace, slowly introducing seemingly unconnected characters but teasing little hints to make you want to know more. I was on the edge of my seat guessing the whole way how this was all going to come together and by the end it hits even harder than I could've expected.

An hypnotic tale of loss and the transactional nature of relationships, with surprising warmth and empathy. Egoyan is starting to become one of my favorite canadian filmmakers. Truly a mesmerizing piece.",4.5
"Well this was awful.
Let’s get the basics out of the way first, Exotica is like no strip club in the history of strip clubs, even in ‘94 five bucks wouldn’t have got you a glass of water in a place like that let alone a lap dance.  And seriously a bunch of dudes sitting quietly in shirt and tie, way too many breakable objects, nowhere near enough security, no gangsters, I could keep going…..but you gotta be kidding me.
Now the film, well to me the story is frankly contrived and ludicrous, the slow reveal of the characters connection is nicely done but doesn’t feel remotely realistic, the acting is honestly somewhere near pathetic (oh god the fight scene) from almost everyone involved and the bad teen poetry type dialogue gives them nothing to work with.
Regretting this choice and won’t be watching anything from Egoyan again.
Edit:  So I’m just going to reiterate my feelings on this film briefly as every person I follow on LB is very positive about it.  It is still rubbish for mine, the acting is across the board awful but especially the Eric character who is possibly the most poorly written character in any so-called auteurist film I've watched.",1.0
"Detachment 
All the characters in Exotica feel detached. Zoe questions why Christina is so detached, Thomas seems to show no emotions, and Francis seems like a shell of a person. All the characters’ interactions feel stilted and awkward. They interact with others while not truly communicating, like they’re speaking in inner-monologue. 
The audience is also detached to these people. You have no context about their background or their relationships with others. Usually, the audience finds themselves with more information than the characters in fiction, but here it’s the opposite. 
I think this is such a powerful choice. Not only does it make the audience feel the same sense of detachment as the characters, but it also makes the revelations all the more impactful. The characters really open up to the audience in such a beautiful way. As their histories begin to unravel, you gain such a rush of empathy. 
The mystery behind these characters is something I’ve never witnessed in a film. The movie is a mystery, but in such an unconventional way. The mystery is solely placed on the audience rather than the characters. That’s such an exciting reversal. 
I was so enraptured by this film in a way I haven’t felt in a while. This is why I love movies: you lose sight of yourself and become engrossed in a vessel of empathy and emotion. 
By the end of the movie, the detachment is lifted, revealing compassion and tenderness. Although not a sweet ending, in fact it’s pretty unsettling, you do gain a familiarity and understanding of the characters. It’s like a flood of emotions that I haven’t fully processed yet. But what I got out of the ending is that Francis was able to remember a feeling of connectedness to the rest of the world. In a way, he was grounded back to humanity, finally less detached.",5.0
"Opening on a series of routines of physical and emotional separation, those involved seeming perturbingly unfeeling or completely callous in their actions, entirely devoid of personal context. With each subsequent cycle, the tapestry unravels, unearthing revelations of each individual's complexities and displaying their emotional voids, all centered around a continuous communal denial of their emotional circumstances, up until the final thread is pulled loose. Here, the sequence breaks into an inversion of everyone’s typical roles, allowing for an acknowledgment of their emotional resonance via intra- and interpersonal collaboration, concluding in closure long overdue. In Exotica, the interactions may seem manufactured and hollow, but that surface-level appearance does not negate the desire for investment nor make its necessity any less real. After all, when reality cages our traumas and unacknowledged feelings in endlessly repetitive rhythms, what other escape is there than the external projection of our innermost selves onto others in the vain hope of recognition and, hopefully, resolution?",5.0

"A tangled web of characters with baggage, headed by an intense performance of a traumatized man by glass-eyed Bruce Greenwood. Egoyan cultivates confusion by soothing us with a weighted blanket of score, lush design, and characters who refuse to raise their voices. I am not as impressed with the ""withholding of information"" plot heralded by some. But the timing to the dropping of hints and details is an engaging unfolding of the plot. I was, therefore, engaged, but not enticed. There is something that is definitely uncool about Exotica. Egoyan kills off any prolonged eroticism to let the despair stand alone, but that's for effect. Egoyan uses Leonard Cohen predominantly, as does Alan Rudolph in Love at Large. Perhaps that is where the bitter taste of Exotica is coming from. Between the Cohen score, the distinct colors, the sexless emotions, the slight stink of cheese (an exotic egg smuggler?), too many similarities with Rudolph, who I just don't click with. The two tie together in my mind, to the detriment of my estimation of Exotica, though I still enjoyed it. This review has more so turned into a one-shot hit piece on Alan Rudolph. And I don't feel good about that. Love....not hate.....love.",0.0
"7/10
Engrossing stuff. The last act is slightly too expository to maintain the dreamy ambiguity of the majority of this, but it's consistently intriguing and the payoff is absolutely worth it. So many visceral and tactful performances, lines, and shot choices in this thing. Mia Kirschner's gaze goes right through you.",3.5
"The faulty substitutes we use to fill the holes left behind by trauma.
Sex being one of them. Each character uses another person or thing to compensate for an insecurity or loss. Isn’t that the whole point of going to a strip club? The setting works perfectly in showcasing the film’s purpose. The intense specificity of the characters and their worlds eventually culminate into something very special. The movie begins with seemingly loose plot threads and random periphery details only to impressively pull all of the film’s components together profoundly at the end.
The last scene got me! It ends chronologically at the beginning. Watching her walk away toward her undoubtedly horrendous homelife, and knowing the immense trauma and betrayal our characters will soon be introduced to was so effective. Really great film and so intricately stitched together. It left me wondering if it deserved more acclaim? And why hasn’t it caught on more as time marches on?
I think the answer is in the contrived nature of the climax. Egoyan organized such a delicately nuanced drama only to have it dip its toes ever so slightly into thriller territory. Simply put, he wouldn’t have tried to kill him at the end. The pet store guy wouldn’t have helped. And the guy wouldn’t have cried in his arms. A movie expertly converging multiple storylines leaves itself eminently vulnerable to critique at the climax. Third acts are tough in general, but the slightest misstep in an interwoven narrative like this feels all the more glaring and detracts a bit from the experience. Nevertheless, this is a classic in my eyes.",4.0

Stunning. One of the greatest films of the ‘90s. A film about how the most intimate contact and connection possible can sometimes only lead to loneliness and despair. “Exotica is a place of entertainment, not healing”, says the owner. But regardless, everyone is there to find some kind of connection, some kind of escape. There’s a true mastery to how Atom Egoyan slowly weaves together the tapestry of characters, all broken in their own distinct ways — and it all clicks into place in a final shot that can only be described as one of the most devastating images to ever grace the screen. I want to say something about the recurring visual motif of one-way mirrors, but that’s for a better writer than me. Truly a revelation.",5.0
"the tracking shot of Christina that functions as the introduction to the club itself is one of my favorites ever no doubt. and it works in the film’s whole theme of things hidden inside one another, not necessarily being deceiving, just the inner webbings of it not being apparent. from the outside, it looks so basic, like a rundown, cheap club that could’ve been mistaken for a random city bar. and then once Christina enters in, it’s just so much more expansive and space-y than you would’ve thought it would be, the club taking on a complex character already within the first 10 minutes. the narrative reveals itself in a weird way, sequencing is purposely done the way it is, where things are known, it’s just the connections aren’t apparent yet until they slowly start to click with each other and it all leads to a devastating and fulfilling ending. such an interesting flip on the traditional “multiple seemingly unrelated characters actually are connected” film idea, and so much better, because there’s actual meaning for it and how one central event has affected so many people’s livelihoods. trauma, grief and repressed pain all connected. and all of this really started because this dude has a mysterious interest in a girl in a schoolgirl outfit lmao

"Exotica is an intimate drama exploring emotional baggage and repressed emotions, directed by Atom Egoyan. From it’s opening scene, Egoyan intelligently sets up the rest of the film. I love the whole utilization of the see through mirrors. The non linear storytelling aspects compliment the film and add another layer of mystery. Egoyan leaves the audience to piece together the fragments, leading up to the final flashback. The flashbacks outside in the field are extremely bright and serene, creating a stark contrast to the drab and dull shades inside the club. Before the conflict arises, the film follows the characters in the repeated cycle of their lives. Following Thomas in his pursuit for men by giving away ballet tickets, Francis’s obsession with revealing his repressed emotions with the dancer Christina and Eric’s withering mental being working at exotica.
Don McKellar continues to be fantastic in everything I see him in. This time portraying the awkward people pleaser Thomas, a procurer of exotic birds. Bruce Greenwood delivers a tragic performance as the obsessive and emotionally haunted Francis, an auditor for the government. Francis goes to exotica solely for Christina, a dancer at the club who only wants to be loved, portrayed by Mia Kirshner with fierce vulnerability. Francis has a puzzling relationship with Cristina, leaving the viewer to workout their mutual intimacy. Eric the clubs emcee and Christina’s ex-boyfriend keeps a watchful eye on the two. Looking down upon them full of jealous rage, tears visible in his eyes. The film also features a plethora of side characters with their own fleshed out backstories and plot points, contributing to the emotional weight behind the film. Egoyan masterfully interconnects all of these characters in such a beautiful way that their relationships don’t feel forced for the sake of the screenplay. 
The music, lighting and stunning set design all contributed to the mystique surrounding the neon signed exotica. I especially liked the use of Leonard Cohen. There are plenty of recurring motifs that Egoyan expertly displays, one of which being that nothing comes free, mentioned from the beginning and constantly being brought up through the sexual transactions taking place inside the club. A deep dive into the characters psyche and their emotional connections to each other. Atom Egoyan delivers a masterpiece dealing with loss, loneliness and sorrow. Providing meaningful insight into the respective characters inner feelings and beautifully intertwining their lives in a tragic way. Exotica is a new instant favorite and a deeply intimate tragedy, leaving the viewer pondering until the final haunting scene.",5.0
"The contrast between the sleazy, exploitative, creepy exterior and the tragic, soft, sensitive interior. A lot of things here worked together, to create something pretty unique and unexpected.
In more ways than one, this film is about grief and obsession, and how one deals with them. The way that you grasp on to whatever you can in order to escape your trauma. It's not the first film to do so, but there is something in the way that the story is structured, that made this feel different. It's mysterious in an almost hypnotic way. When all the separate pieces connect, it so emotionally resonant, that it recontextualizes everything that you've seen and felt up to that point. In the last scene, when everything lays bare, I got chills running down my spine, the same ones that you get when you realise something horrific just happened.
The atmosphere here is cold and detached, everything just feels a little bit out of place. The one-way mirrors, the moody lighting, the soundtrack and the sound design (which was great and almost reminded me a bit of Lynch's work at places) made me feel tense in a weird, uncanny way, almost like having a bad dream.
This movie could have easily been so much worse. The dialogue isn't really organic, the characters and situations feel awkward at times, and overall I would totally understand someone that would not like it because of those qualities. But, at least for me, it is saved by the fact that instead of devolving into a violent and cynical third act, it actually allows the characters some introspection, it lets them take a step back and realise how broken they are, and how that affects the people around them.",3.5

"This movie shouldn't work. Criterion's eye-roll of a logline (hurray for making the collection!) reads, ""A coterie of lost and damaged souls search for redemption as they work through the traumas of their mysteriously interconnected histories,"" which suggests that it's a minor miracle Exotica is even watchable, let alone a masterpiece. There's a surfeit of saccharine, overearnest Sundance indies released every year that approach grief in the most therapeutic, your-pain-is-valid bullshit sort of way that might merit similarly agonizing synopses, and they all suck.
But Exotica is not 104 minutes of the endless mopey pandering that Criterion's writeup implies. Instead, Egoyan hinges his film's ""trauma"" on a single heartrending concluding sequence: a proud dad excitedly discusses his then-alive daughter's aptitude for piano, while Christina the Babysitter, teary as she hears what a loving father ought to sound like, exits the vehicle and walks up the pathway to her house in a maliciously framed final shot. That her function in the ritualistic grief-denial/avoidance relationship with Francis has been unknown up to that point snaps the whole narrative puzzle into place, bringing new meaning to Francis's pleading ""How could anyone hurt you?"" at the club. The visual metaphor of those imposing trees in the final shot is left ambiguous, but if you reach the furthest point of its implication, it clarifies Francis's role and the dual purpose his five-word question serves: ""How could anyone hurt you?""
This narrative concealment makes the entire movie work. The first revelation, courtesy of Eric, is effective on its own:

Eric: ""I found her.""
Francis: ""You found who?""
Eric: ""Your little girl.""

But jumping directly from it to the Christina reveal is overpowering. All of Egoyan's precise subterfuge abruptly clicks. All the painterly Eric & Christina search-party segments become more distressing. The aftermath of Francis's violation of trust with Christina and her subsequent fury at Eric is suddenly made clear. Francis and Christina's end-of-movie exchange would not deliver the same emotional wallop without withholding her role until the very end:

Christina: ""I was just thinking about the way you talk about Lisa. You get so excited. It's nice.""
Francis: ""I'm sure your parents talk about you that way too.""
Christina: ""I don't think so.""

Nor would it work without those trees and that house and that halting approach up to the front door. Swear I'm not trying to copy Mikey D., but that's probably my favorite final shot ever. Wept.",5.0
"I really had no idea what to expect here, and as the world’s unsexiest strip club starts unfolding itself around the mannered dialogue and performances I ridiculously started thinking old indie guys like Hal Hartley — they don’t make ‘em like this anymore, I scoffed. Friggin’ early 90s!
Well, I was close. Nobody makes ‘em like this period. A fantastic mystery of kink and intention that never stops defeating your expectations and never stops to explain the oddities of its unnatural world. An absolute joy to watch and puzzle through. Days later I’m remembering little touches and having a solid laff at the dark humor Egoyan lays as easter eggs.
To be honest, the only reason I am holding up at 4 Meows here is I watched Egoyan’s Adjuster a couple nights later and that film blew my hair back and slapped the glasses off my face.",4.0

I’m not always the biggest fan of films where you’re supposed to follow a bunch of different characters and slowly see their stories intertwine, I can definitely lose interest fast if done incorrectly. This film definitely tested me with how slowly it reveals it’s information, but once it all came together I really dug the film. I could definitely see myself giving it a higher score on a rewatch.

Damaged, tormented people meet in this dark, hypnotic panopticon to the human body, orbiting around each other but never colliding, linked only by memories, commerce and the inevitable, inescapable sense that their days are counting down, slipping away into nothing. All we can do is skim along the same path for a while, hoping a collision will bring about a release. Like The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica is about the impossibility of healing.
Could easily see this sneaking into my all-timers after a second viewing. Maybe the best-structured film I’ve ever seen, that perfect balance of complete accessibility and concealed depths of mystery.",4.5

"What is it that gives ""Exotica"" its special touch?
Is it the unique and immersive atmosphere? Is it the intriguing build-up to the emotional catharsis, the smooth and precise camerawork, the mysterious order of scenes which hint on a haunting past or the well-written and excellently acted characters? Probably all of these factors combined, yet there is one aspect which fascinated me most: the title.

"Wow, I need a minute to digest all of that.
Exotica is such a beautiful, intimate, and hypnotic character study of a plethora of endlessly interesting characters that all have such well conceived motivations, and even if they aren’t able to communicate the pain that they’re trying to come to terms with, they’re directed and performed in such a fashion to where I can totally see myself going back and picking up on all of the little intricacies in the first and second acts that subtly reveal who they truly are.
This is a film about people who are holding back so much pain, or baggage as Francis says, to the point where it just can’t stay inside any longer, and it begins manifesting itself in progressively less subtle ways as the film continues. Exotica is a film that could’ve really fallen flat for me if it felt content with being bogged down in its own melodrama, but instead it constantly keeps its focus locked on its atmosphere, its storytelling, and above all, the emotions of its characters. So glad I took a chance on this one.",5.0
"This film has a wonderfully moody, melancholy tone. In a way it's not what I expected. It's not really an erotic drama, sure sex plays a part and there are erotic moments. But really this is a story about lost, sad people. Looking for any kind of connection in an often cold world.
It's a wonderful ensemble cast, with everyone delivering wonderful performances. The score and music choices used here are fantastic, very atmospheric.
Definitely an overlooked movie worthy of more attention.",4.0
"Fourth viewing, I believe, but my first in about 15 years and I went into this revisit remembering Exotica's ambiance—and my intensely visceral reactions—more explicitly than concrete specifics. (They came back pretty quickly as I was watching, though.) Definitely my most rewarding viewing to date: While I can't quite join the cadre of admirers who consider it one of the decade's very greatest—and I'd still choose The Sweet Hereafter as Egoyan's finest, though not by as large of a margin as before—this is a remarkable film on multiple planes, most notably its structure: Exotica almost lulls you to sleep with a series of relationships, interactions and exchanges that seem fascinating in various vacuums but hardly related before effortlessly, and gradually, tying them together in a manner so smoothly controlled that it borders on imperceptible. The moody pacing never skips a beat or alters its tempo as it unfolds: I loved, for instance, Thomas' (Don McKellar) silkily seamless evolution from an insecure petty criminal who found his inner strength by selling-before-gifting opera tickets to strangers/dates (via a seemingly fluky taxi cab encounter with a wealthy douchebag who we never see again) to using the same manipulatively genuine traits to help Bruce unearth some dirty truths in the club. (Never mind that he didn't exactly have much of a choice!)
But what's so astonishing here is how Thomas' cinematic transformation from Francis' sounding board to integral narrative cog could apply, in their own uniquely powerful ways, to every single fucking character in this thing! Koteas' unexpected historical import (dude's a total asshole, evoking zero sympathy from the audience and suddenly BAM! It all shifts on a dime in about five seconds flat); Polley's place as a surrogate on what turns out to be multiple levels; Harold's bizarre importance to the overarching chain of events; and of course, Francis and Christina, their stories shedding skin after skin as the sultry underbelly of an upscale sex club is revealed to be little more than an elaborate Macguffin, masking years of pain, suffering, healing and self-discovery. Can't wait to rewatch this again and am particularly curious to see how I respond to the final shot, much revered in some quarters but merely *good* to me—daddy issues, which play a big part in its impact (so does the exquisite framing, it must be noted), don't instinctively feel on the same level of subtle, thundering power as many other elements of the movie do. But I'm more than open to being convinced otherwise. Performances are remarkable in all corners; formal prowess and directorial patience are astounding. Closer to five stars than four.

"one of those films that, in so many regards, shouldn't work as well as it does. the way that we're left after that grueling final image to piece everything together we've just seen could have easily been a cop-out and yet here i am, 24 hours later, still thinking about the connections this movie doles out without being cute or overly witty about it. i think this works overall because Egoyan treats his material with the utmost sincerity: the grief feels real, the pain feels real, the longing feels real, and it's up to the viewer to decide at the end if everything that happened was anything truly sinister & gross or just very sad & gross (for me, it was a heavy mixture of both, ymmv). Greenwood and Kirshner's (and everybody else, but specifically them) performances exude such heavy charisma in the face of a grief-denial ritual that it's impossible for me to parse out how they pulled it off in the first place.
billed as an erotic thriller (the Weinstein's distributed it so, go figure). but there's absolutely nothing erotic about this movie. it's gross, it's frightening, and it manages to not break the chain of tension it carries throughout by ending on a note that feels less sensational than what is being hinted at. a reviewer mentioned that the film almost feels like a study of how people react to media in how art lays out its hints of what lies beneath, and i think that's an apt interpretation even if i'm not totally convinced that was what Egoyan was going for. and on that note, weird as this will sound, the piece that immediately sprang to my mind at the end was this most recent season of true detective, which was a callous and cynical attempt at doing this very thing. difference is, true detective went out of its way to try and get you to assume the worst; here, there's not a single note or hint that feels false or cheap by any measure. the twist can't be a ""gotcha"" because the tapestry is woven so meticulously that i can't fathom a more appropriate ending. just stunning writing, and his formal work matches it.",4.5

"A burning thriller that ends in a place of devastating anticlimax, writer/director Atom Egoyan spends much of Exotica's running time moving his narrative pieces around each other in increasingly close revolutions, threatening violent climax after violent climax, even if there's no explicit plot suggestion of such volatility; the tone is just that uneasy. That atmosphere permeates the film's primary location, a purposefully over-designed strip club, one where reality seems constantly on the verge of breaking down and breaking everyone's fantasies with it. There are some characters that feel incomplete (construction-wise), and it nearly reaches the limit of its withholding technique, but that last shot washes all my thoughts away and I lean back into my purgatory.

"Part of the 30 Countries March Challenge. Canada.
Strangely, this reminds me of Memento, in how both films structure themselves in alignment with the protagonists, by putting us in their headspaces. Exotica is a tale of self-delusion that derives its power from the withholding of information. Only the facade from that self-delusion is revealed to us at first, full of unbalanced feeling, and the film's mood reflects that atmosphere so well: dreamy, deeply sad, with a strong sense of foreboding unease. And when that facade begins to crumbles bit by bit late in the film, each revelation hits us like a bombshell, perfectly capturing each strain on the main character's psyche. When all the pieces fall into place in the last flashback, its emotional effect is devastating. I am going to think about that final shot for a long time.",5.0
"Decades Ago Classics 1994, 3/3
I'm a bit torn on this one. On the one hand, it's well acted, well directed and the screenplay is confident, and I see what it's doing with it's themes, for instance the contrast between the idea and reality of emotions - on the other hand, it suffers from being over-thought with a needlessly cumbersome plot-structure, and lots of talk-talking instead of walk-walking, and somehow the plot seems to be constantly hypothetical, which makes the film loose the emotional focus it so clearly holds dear.
I kept going back and forth while watching, because I could only guess the ending, so I'll watch the film again but I'm pretty sure It'll just be a confirmation of what I'm feeling now. It's really quite good, just too fussy to reach the satisfying level of greatness it seems to have within reach.",3.5

But I did remember the tone – sexy but with an air of impending disaster.
Turns out there was a fair bit of plot I'd completely forgotten about, but on the whole that sums it up. This time around, I found the ending rather weak – but it's that tone that's still the most important thing. If you like the idea of feeling horny and depressed at the same time, this is still an exquisite little gem.",4.5
"Every character in Exotica aside from Tracey is hiding something. Human beings by their very nature are secretive. We claim to want to know people in totality, and for them to know us, but we'd rather that happen through a window of some kind. One where we cannot see the voyeurism in the act.
The ""look, don’t touch"" rule is not just a common rule at strip clubs (""Exotica"" included), but also acts as the film's thesis on human connection. Our codependences force us to bind ourselves to each other in a narrative that we collaborate on, but never fully articulate. The articulation would ruin the story we tell ourselves, because if we say it aloud, we will have broken the spell.
To avoid confronting our own demons, we rely on a little help from our friends. People we meet are struggling with something, and that not only informs how we treat them, but also sets the stage for how we present ourselves.
What struck me the most this time around (besides two of the car conversations Francis has with babysitters, one where he explains why adults feel ""tense"" around each other, and the final scene in the film), was a conversation Zoe has with Francis after an egregious mistake on his part. Zoe tells him that Exotica is a place for ""amusement"" and that he should seek more therapeutic processes elsewhere. While this is good advice, it's another great example of how one character completely misses a contradiction right in front of them (either consciously or subconsciously). For example: Christina's striptease routine is for anything but amusement, something that the film's audience can spot right away but will not have the context until much later in the film. What seems like an artistic twist on an old sexual trope is actually a mask hiding incredibly deep wounds. It's a narrative being told to an audience unable to see it for what it is. It's appropriating one thing for another. It's Exotica.",5.0
"Going in, I thought this would be more sleazy and grimy affair. It still has those elements but it is much more a noir deconstruction dealing with grief, coping mechanisms, and what we do to protect people. It does such an amazing job of zigging when it is suppose to zag but earning it every time. It unfurls in such a wonderful way that I think a rewatch is going to make me like it even more.
Also the Exotica, the strip club in the film, looks so damn cool. It's like a weird jungle with all these different shades of green. They also just play Leonard Cohen all the time including during dances so it has my heart.",4.0

It’s now 1 hour and 15 minutes into Exotica: You’re well enough equipped at this point to understand that this is going to get very deep.

"This was my introduction to Atom, and I'm definitely intrigued. Glancing at Letterboxd reviews, I'm surprised no one has compared it to American Beauty. That was the first thing that sprung to my mind, with all this grief and misdirected emotion. Did they not have therapy in the nineties? If you identify with any of these characters, please see a therapist; it's 2020, we're not gonna shame you for that anymore.

"How do you even begin to describe this? The first two thirds of Exotica play out like a pseudo-horror detective story, we see the events of the past slowly unravel as we get hints towards a terrifying, disturbing conclusion. It speaks of taboo - specifically; it uses fetishization of youth & the pedophilic male gaze to demonstrate this - how taboo appeals to us in its unattainability, its exotic nature. It demonstrates how taboo forms into obsession; proposing that an assumption of bond or availability with the target provides reason to get closer - the difference between looking and touching that the film puts emphasis on. It speaks with beauty and terror and charm as to the arrogance of obsession, the idea that you could ever know anyone or anything well enough to ""earn"" it, and the suffering which arrogance brings in its wake.
And then it completely pulls the rug from under you in the last 15-20 minutes. There is no satisfying conclusion to the mystery. We never learn what happens. Instead, it becomes an empathy piece, a film consisting solely in the realm of emotion and connection. It becomes a way to heal from that suffering displayed earlier. It is the process of recovering from trauma, collectively, as social beings. The tone shifts to this in the matter of a couple seconds with a single line of dialogue and a sway of the camera. It's mindboggling, and pulled off with such frankly unbelievable skill I have no way to describe it other than to say it's Egoyan's tour de force. I have not wracked my brain so much over an ending since I first watched Perfect Blue. It is cliché to say, but I was left speechless and with chills at this moment... it is certainly one of the greatest cinematic triumphs I have witnessed.",5.0
"It’s got cult classic written all over it, and I can understand after watching how this is considered one of the best Canadian arthouse movies. The entire picture oozes with style and vibes as the narrative is fed piecemeal to the audience, always enough to capture interest but never enough to outsmart the movie. A seedy strip club is frequented with loyal patrons, one in particular that is yearning for something more. A missing girl case is opened, the town aids in searching for her. Man who runs the local pet store has an illegal side hustle and the police are closing in on him. Seemingly random narrative threads and woven together over the runtime of Exotica, and a disturbing tapestry emerges. The whole thing is structured as a striptease, a slow reveal pulling away at the disguises and bandages we use to hide our painful secrets and vices. Exotica teases at the fabric, loosening the straps, and releasing the tension while presenting characters who struggle to communicate. What passes as awkward conversations carries the threat of something far more sinister, with double meanings and suggestions of ulterior motives. As the film‘s characters are undressed, we gradually discover these are just broken people, damaged and rejoined in common tragedy, unable to heal; finding, instead, ways to maintain the illusion of health, by buying and selling emotions under the cover of fantasy. I could go on an on about how this film makes you feel a certain way, and how the presentation is so unique and atmospheric. But I’ll end things here for now, and I’m interested how this will evolve on a rewatch. Perhaps then I’ll dive deeper with a spoiler review.",4.0

It's definitely clever and beautifully shot, but it just never roped me in emotionally to the extent I wanted it to. It's well acted, as well, though it is one of those movies where it ultimately feels more like the characters serve the plot than vice versa.

"A series of stories and characters that initially I found difficult to piece together, the film not giving us too much information to go on, other than it all revolving around a high end, and almost conceptual strip club, named Exotica. In a film full of one way mirrors or hidden communications, it takes a long while before you can see the bigger picture, between these group of people, and how they intersect.
There's an air of seediness to it, soaked in the atmosphere, the sort of film where everything is whispered, or spoken with long pauses and piano music playing, as we watch these people live out these destructive and unhealthy relationships.
It didn't quite all ring true though, we see these desperate and broken characters, with the film gradually revealing the intricacies of their relationship, and as it progressed further, I found myself feeling that it was all a little contrived. As we learn more about these characters, I found them progressively less interesting, which is not the trajectory you'd want to go in, especially in an extremely dour film like this.
The aesthetic of the club and it's secrets was fun, but I did find myself tuning out towards the end.",0.0
"Atom Egoyan makes excellent use of nonlinear storytelling in Exotica to create a gripping and well paced narrative that gradually peels back its layers over the course of the runtime. The story revolves around the lives of several characters whose connections to each other become clearer over time and the majority of the movie is set in a strip club where they play Leonard Cohen songs which is an added bonus. The acting here is solid and believable with nothing too over the top and this has the effect of enhancing characters that might not be particularly interesting on the surface but emerge as authentic and multifaceted people that the viewer gradually becomes attached to. The film's main attraction is its screenplay which perfectly judges the speed and extent to which it reveals the central mysteries and emotional depth of the narrative. Flashbacks are extremely well incorporated, foreshadowing revelations to come without overly spoiling anything and the director does a good job of regularly switching the focus between several different characters to keep things fresh. When the film reaches its final act, it becomes genuinely emotional and touching but I was then pleasantly surprised by the fact that the ending is actually strangely uplifting. As well as Leonard Cohen, the rest of the music is well suited to the narrative and although the film in general doesn't look spectacular, the cinematography is excellent at exploring the key interior locations. It does feel like some of the supporting characters and plot lines were underdeveloped such as the babysitter and the smuggling operation so I think the film probably tries to tackle too much in its runtime. However, Exotica is still a gripping drama with strong writing, music and a memorable final shot.

"The first Atom Egoyan film I've made it around to, a tangled mystery slowly unfolding as characters cross paths and circle the strip club of the film's title. Fundamentally about loneliness but you only realize that as the clever narrative peels away initial impressions. In one early scene Francis, an auditor obsessed with a young dancer at Exotica, drops an even younger girl off in a shady area and hands her some cash. The horrifying suggestion made by the information we're given will eventually reveal itself to instead be a tragic and bizarre routine but we're multiple layers away from that at the time. Other key characters include the young dancer, Christina, her ex-boyfriend and club DJ, Eric, and Thomas, an exotic pet dealer hiding a smuggling operation. The ways these characters' lives intersect is complex but never difficult to follow as Egoyan takes his time guiding you to an understanding of them. Love the way this alternates with ease between dramatic reveals, abruptly defusing tension (especially in a late scene involving a gun), and leaving the perfect amount of unanswered questions on the edges. The final shot is incredibly simple on a surface level but brings out an emotional weight and burning curiosity that represents the best the film has to offer.",4.0

Filling in a big Canadiana blind spot, and I wish I had sooner! While a lot of the grief/trauma subject matter doesn’t bring anything new to the table, it’s explored in such a narratively interesting way that it still hooked me. Non-linear narratives can come off super gimmicky, but this feels really organic.
What really pulled me in was the exploration of the transactional nature of relationships and how this played out in each of our character’s lives. Ballet tickets, cash, exotic eggs, coffee, favours sexual or conspiratorial, it’s all that keeps some people in your life.
Incredible cinematography really establishes the hypnotic vibe that I think will have me interested in revisiting in the future. The lighting feels very neo-noir. I love seeing Toronto in this light.

"After I watched Atom Egoyan's spellbinding Exotica, I was unsure how I could write a review without spoiling the complicated threads of Egoyan's achievement. I will write an essay soon, but it is for readers to walk into Exotica with few details. The movie concerns the relationships between different characters and each character's emotional isolation. Exotica, mostly, takes place in an upscale strip club where Bruce Greenwood's depressed auditor has a mysterious but close relationship with Mia Kirshner's stripper, Christina. The film also involves Elias Koteas as a jealous ex-lover and DJ, Arsinée Khanjian as a pregnant club owner, and Don McKellar as a curious pet owner. Egoyan writes the film enigmatically as he directs each piece with allure. One of the most surprising developments in Egoyan's picture is how he humanely approaches each character. The result differs from numerous American mysteries that play it safe morally and narratively. Exotica probes the minds of everyday people's desires and trauma with its beautiful designs and affecting music. As Exotica finishes, audiences leave Egoyan's film as if they know and empathize with each character's conflicts.

It is criminal how unpopular Exotica is. The movie is a better puzzle than Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.",5.0

Discussed on Episode 14 of Intermission with Jordan Raup.
Here is what I wrote about the film in the description of the podcast:
""At first blush, Egoyan’s film defies easy categorization with its recursive structure, multiple central characters, and the director’s own penchant for throwing viewers into previously defined relationships. Exotica’s dizzying construction only amplifies those sensations with the characters’ winding stream-of-consciousness monologues, DP Paul Sarossy’s furtive camerawork, and Mychael Danna’s Egyptian-influenced score.
The plot isn’t easily described, but it can be distilled down to the intersection of initially undefinable relationships of clientele and employees at the namesake’s strip club. These oddballs range from lovelorn MCs to closeted bird egg collectors and Freudian father figures.
Nearly every one of these characters meshes into a diagrammatic arc to reach the mosaic-esque climax, but those intricacies are a means to an end. Exotica (and arguably, Egoyan’s body of work) traffic in the claustrophobically intimate, introducing dynamics that act as conduits for hard emotional truths. To remove the film from its obtuse contexts, consider instead that Egoyan’s two primary influences for writing Exotica were being audited in real life and learning about the no-touch rule at strip clubs.""",3.5
"“Who’s asking you to stay?”

"Men will literally hire their niece to roleplay as their dead child's babysitter and then visit a strip club for a private dance from a fellow lost soul as a nightly ritual all in a desperate attempt to mask the pain of unimaginable loss and grief and fill the resulting infinite void instead of going to therapy.
I believe I last saw this film as a 16-year-old, when, due to raging hormones and Miramax's salacious video cover, I was anticipating a Skinemax-esque erotic thriller and was disappointed to discover it was mostly a weird, elliptical character drama with occasional nudity, and thus I didn't give it proper consideration, smh. Returning to it as an adult, I appreciate its narrative structure, ambiguity, and devastating portrait of loneliness and unresolved trauma. The Exotica club is one of the great movie settings, thanks to the technical successes of set design, lighting, photography, and music to generate a distinct, tangible mood. It's the only strip club, imaginary or real, that I would actually be inclined to patronize. A thought: Is there another story location that has lost as much of its cachet and frequency of usage in the last decade (or two) as the strip club?

"A crowning achievement for the Toronto New Wave. Still, I'll have to re-watch this a few more times before I can fully articulate my feelings.

The past interrupts too--it cuts the present. Stabs. Ruptures.
I think the word 'linear' is allergic to grief. Egoyan does too. Exotica understands, deeply, what it means to be haunted. And horny. How the two states of being can combine. It's very taboo, of course--but no less true. If men ""think with their dicks"" (to quote Neil Gaiman) do they not also grieve with them? Men are very dangerous creatures.",0.0

To really get to know someone you have to talk with, listen to, love someone and even then it is not certain that you will fully understand one another.
You get deceived by your own imagination, interpretation and prejudices. You wonder what the relations of these characters are and slowly they reveal themselves.

Such a tender story disguised in sleaze, and honestly a pretty brave way to tell a story. I do believe I'll be thinking about it in the days to come.
I knew I recognized Mia Kirshner from somewhere and its from...Not Another Teen Movie. Unexpected! She's stunning. She's also in De Palma's The Black Dahlia which I've been meaning to check out.

"""It is, after all, a jungle out there isn't it?""
A film about many things but what I got most was the inexplicable, unusual ways different people handle grief, loss and the inability, or unwillingness, to let go and move on - from an ex-lover, from a tragedy - as if to to do so would somehow relinquish the last shred of hope or an idea representing something perhaps only clear to the person in question, and even then maybe not.
Tonally this was odd but unique and brilliant in a way - it has the seductive allure of an erotic thriller, the intricate plot contrivances of a mystery and the pathos of a sentimental character drama which makes for an utterly unpredictable, transfixing watch. The narrative is clever, almost too clever in how it all ties together but the way Egoyan withholds information from the viewer is impressive where it could've been gimmicky or frustrating in lesser hands. The way these characters' lives are interwoven by a web of grief and desire and obsession was compelling and well-executed, compounded by the strange somber-sexy atmosphere and memorable score. This will most likely be even better the second time around.

"The way that Atom Egoyan subtly evokes trauma through visual motifs, repetitive dialogue, and soft, diffuse lighting is breathtaking. Every minute of this film is drenched with melancholy, loneliness, and mourning, but it refrains from trite methods of emotional manipulation that many indie dramas now utilize.
I’m also impressed yet again by the complex narrative web that Egoyan spins.
His characters are usually bound by the interconnectedness of their lives, but also bound by a shared emotional trauma or anguish. His diegeses seems to revolve around communities built by tragedy, an homage to his upbringing as an Armenian-Canadian who heard the stories of the Armenian Genocide.
Revolution is also a crucial function to his work that I’ve noticed. Obviously any film placed on a reel spins to life when projected, but Egoyan’s films truly feel cyclical and even circular. Dialogue, shots, actions, and specific songs or musical themes are repeated like the short animation of a zoetrope. Repetition, in the hands of Egoyan, is not economical — it’s evocative. 
Evocative of what depends on the film we’re discussing, but in the case of Exotica, it evokes the trauma of loss. And it evokes it immaculately.",4.5

very rarified air for a film to be so haunting and mysterious from start to finish (literally on the edge of this airplane seat through the final scene). incredible performances all around, most especially from bruce greenwood. incredibly unique film to watch",5.0
"Kind of a surprisingly polished movie given that it gives off all the look and feel of a fairly low budget Canadian indie film from the get go. 
The music is well chosen, the dark, moody atmospheres just the right shade for its neo-noir theme. And while the plot is a bit fractured, it comes together well for a true feeling of mystery even as most of its characters fail to really change or evolve at all. 
The acting is even pretty strong, perhaps in part just because I have a soft spot for Don McKellar from Highway 61. But Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas did a great job as well of convincing me that they were every bit as pathetic as their characters needed to be. 
Probably the only role that didn’t really come to life was Mia Kirshner’s school girl stripper. The act felt incredibly forced, most likely just because the character itself was complete nonsense and she wasn’t any kind of dancer. 
Still, the whole thing made for a surprisingly entertaining total package. Dark, intricate, and with an entertaining (if only surface) level of vice. 
A solid 4/5 for personal enjoyment. I really liked trying to figure out where the movie was taking me.",3.5

"From the first moments of the methodical, slow piano chords, the panning camera moving across a painted wall of faux nature, I could tell Exotica would be a treat. A film shrouded in relative obscurity, unacceptable it may be that this hasn’t received a wider audience, this film somewhat forgotten by the mainstream is a desirable masterclass in story-oriented tension. Perhaps the seedy atmospheres and infrequency of solid supporting characters would turn away the more Hollywood-oriented heyday of movie-goer, but Exotica has within it such hidden brilliance, a stylish drama with all the usual connectors, but with such unexpected leaps and amazing performances, the largest components working with the smallest, most critical and crucial of details.
The trickling of talent in this film is seen in the moments that an average viewer wouldn’t care to credit. Mychael Danna’s music and Steven Munro’s sound design are, forgive the pun, instrumental in creating an accessibly beautiful and engaging story. Not just for the original score, but for their curation of Leonard Cohen’s masterclass Everybody Knows. I’m a sucker for Cohen at the best of times, but how Exotica adapts music to its layered storytelling is incredible. Non-diegetic sound used in necessary brilliance, giving us a great look into the broody nightclub that shares its name with the title of the film. An ensemble of interesting individuals certainly hover around the private dancers and the grim lobby, but we’ve no time to spend getting to know them, only the essentials are brought to us.
There are smatterings of influence from David Cronenberg, but director Atom Egoyan brings his own unique funk to this encroaching series of uniquely intense, but naturally played out events. A chance encounter between a pet store employee, Thomas (Don McKellar), and a troubled tax auditor, Francis (Bruce Greenwood), leads to some incredible scenes of intense passion, obsession, and chemistry. Fixation is at the heart of Exotica, not just of a man and his fascination with a stripper with her own troubles, but a focused pressure between the unlikely duo. Erratic characters and off the cuff decisions are drawn upon spectacularly, but there’s no necessity to see the actions through, and I do think that’s the strongest aspect Exotica has to play with, the desire and ability to take things to the extreme, but the realisation that such a story doesn’t need to.
An amazingly condensed interaction with detachment in a sexually charged environment, Exotica is a blurring of stories, all coming together with such incredible passion from Egoyan and his cast. Stupendous work, I’d never have expected this to be so compelling, yet so brief and fleeting in its description of events and characters. Rather primitive in brief pockets, where happenstance scenarios come together to form a larger, worthy narrative base, Exotica will have no trouble appealing to those of us who like to see the underbelly of society. The good men driven to dark or controversial deeds, that’s exactly what Egoyan captures here, and he does so with near-perfect results.

"Still quite confused about the story, but I really enjoyed watching Exotica with its beautiful cinematography and intriguing characters. The soundtrack in particular was fantastic, featuring everything from Leonard Cohen and hip hop to Prokofiev’s famous “Dance of the Knights” from Romeo and Juliet. 
While I really enjoyed all the performances from the main cast, I just couldn’t get behind Bruce Greenwood’s character. His acting felt very one-note and overly-emotional for the first two acts, delivering every single line in the exact same fashion which I just didn’t find believable or fitting for what his character had been through. However, in the third act this was much less of a problem, and he did end things off on a positive note by performing quite well in that final scene. 
Ultimately this was a riveting depiction of a unique relationship — reminiscent of the dark, dysfunctional one in Phantom Thread — and it was very fun to watch unfold.",3.5

Este es uno de esos casos en los que si uno no lee la sinopsis de la película, podría perderse en medio del camino. Muy aparte de eso, la historia se toma su tiempo para meternos de lleno a la acción principal.
Me gustó la fotografía, la música y la ambientación lograda en general, que van acorde a lo que exigía la película. Y la dirección de Atom Egoyan no se queda atrás. Tendré que añadir su filmografía a mi radar.

"Exotica is a really special movie, managing to balance the sensuality and suspense of an erotic thriller with something much more earnest and sad that you wouldn’t expect on a movie like this. The mystery is kept from the audience and shared merely at the last scene of the movie. But the eerie atmosphere is constructed carefully from the first shot, filling you with a sense of dread and expectancy that culminates in the ending. Exotica Is really thought provoking and it will last with you after watching. It is an extremely human tale about suffering and healing. Also  this is instantly one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever. Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen playing at the exotica while Christie clumsily dances is pretty unforgettable.",5.0
"Like if the late David Foster Wallace had written a movie that sucked and had most of two storylines removed during editing.
I remembered not liking this when it came out, but thought I would give it another try after seeing quite a few good reviews recently.
It turns out Exotica is just not for me. I don't find any of it interesting. The long slow reveal of the character's relationships, the terrible DJ patter, the sets that all appear to have been bought from bankrupt businesses after they were left to sit empty for ten years -- none of it works for me.
I find the relationships between the characters to be tedious, and loathe the never-ending hints at connections that are eventually revealed in the least interesting way possible (having a one-dimensional character recite their entire history to an equally uninteresting character.)
Not to mention the film opens by focusing on a man smuggling rare bird eggs into the country, only to eventually have them stolen by a bit-part character who reveals his motivations in a voicemail. Who are the eggs for? How much trouble does this cause for the smuggler? What happens to the eggs after Customs takes them? Why is the smuggler's plan foiled by a character who is in only three scenes and speaks in only one? These things are not for us to know.
It is almost as if Egoyan knows the story doesn't matter. Unfortunately, the aesthetic and mood are bad too. The pet store is disgusting. The residences are bland. The strip club tries very hard to be interesting but succeeds instead at looking cheap and uninspired.
What Exotica seems to want is for everyone to be so impressed by Egoyan's film school symbolism that they don't notice the characters are made of cardboard, the performances are weak, the choreography is bad, and the plot is non-existent. The entire film is spent waiting to learn how the characters are connected to one another, only to find out those relationships are irrelevant. You can shuffle each character's backstory and have the exact same movie. The connections have been contrived to make the lack of plot seem like depth.

"1994: the year of overlapping narrative structures. More than most films, Exotica does a great job of keeping you on your toes, slowly teasing out information that provides greater depth and contextualization to its characters and their histories. Everybody in this film is deeply empathetic, regardless of how broken. Despite their torments, the title isn't ironic; this movie is oozing atmosphere. I thought things wrapped up a bit neatly at the end, but damn if it wasn't a compelling ride.",4.0
"A wonderfully hypnotizing film that anchors seemingly very different characters in an apparently ludicrous interconnectedness while it bathes the audience in a nebula of great music and well-composed images. It's a film that Roger Ebert called a ""hyperlink film"", which seems to be a somewhat widespread term to describe films where the characters' connections to each other are revealed slowly but surely.
I don't think I recall ever having seen Bruce Greenwood in this big a leading role but, man, does he absolutely nail it by playing his broken man with a melancholy and tragedy that feels very authentic.",4.0
"Begins like a thinking man's Crimes of Passion, duping you into expecting a slow-burning study of kinks, hang-ups, and the ways sexual identities restrict or liberate us. But then Atom Egoyan—who jumped to the top of my ""must explore further"" list with this one traumatizing tour de force—slowly peters out a procession of haunting revelations that color in and demystify Exotica's torrid cast of depressing beauties. They orbit and bump into one another like dirty water circling the drain. This film is what so many Award-thirsty ensemble dramas strive to be, but Egoyan doesn't make the mistake of reaching for palatable themes or pretending there's a neat bow to tie on his story. It's nothing more than a humbling, contemplative purgatory on earth.",4.5

"Something doesn't really click. I think the movie almost gets there, but is held back for me by its really unnecessarily cryptic dialogue. Most of what people say is comprised of questions, which they wouldn't have to ask were the people they talked to actually clear with their words. It comes across as though Egoyan is trying to write characters who want to hide things about themselves, and not reveal every detail of their lives. That's fine, I think, but he has only one strategy of getting that across, and it's consistent across all of the characters, not just a quirk that one of them has.
I'm all for slow movies. I enjoyed the pace and was never bored exactly. More so mildly annoyed throughout. Let's really get to the bottom of these people, what their histories are, how they're related to each other, etc. It's undercooked because of its need to be mysterious, but instead of coming across mysterious, I can really tell that Egoyan is holding back his characters from saying things with a very writerly intent rather than giving them real reasons to be doing so in the context of the story... perhaps to disguise the fact that the film's characters aren't as thought through as they appear. Maybe adding silence will give them a greater concreteness than they would have if they were constantly talking. And frankly, I kind of saw the twist coming. Maybe not in the exact way that it shows up, but what happens by the end makes so much sense that it's not really a surprise, nor does it put a strong enough period (ellipse?) on the film's final moments.
There's a way to accomplish all of this that doesn't across so forced as it does in Exotica. It's just so bewilderingly handled by the director. Not something I can vibe with as much as others do. I can maybe see the appeal...? Then again, loads of other movies beat this one in achieving what Egoyan sets out to do but doesn't quite reach.",2.5
"Okay, I did not expect Atom Egoyan to be able to get this bodacious and steamy while still being able to make it about the effects of memory and personal trauma.
Like being trapped in an intricate web of lustrous affairs in which each and everyone succumbs to their own desires, longing for something that could sedate their irreversible traumas while looking in the wrong places. A hopeless journey towards affection for a heart that is already too soured to feel any form of love. Every character seems to be enchanted by an illusion of sexual intimacy, driven by desire to cancel out the inner despair. And once this spell of imaginary seduction breaks, they are confronted with their personal traumatic memories that have already spun a web of their own. But whereas the spider of desire bites with a tingling sensation yearning for more, the tarantula of trauma rips through the skin like poison to break open the buried emotional core.",4.0

"Grim, gorgeous, crushing and a haze obscuring any direction that may hide an exit. In a lesser filmmaker’s hands this would have been much darker (explicitly so), much more cynical, certain threads and setups and instincts would have been followed to their ‘natural’ or expected conclusion rather than the directions they take, often intruded on by cascades of unexpected feeling and the winds of the world ripping your feet from the ground beneath you. Egoyan maps out his characters with arms of comfort, a gaze of warmth that only heightens their despondency and longing and hopelessness, drifting clinging onto the kindness of strangers and phantoms else they’ll just drift away further, into something they know nothing of, can’t even picture, much less grapple with. The mid-90s, post-Pulp Fiction, post-Cobain ennui and irony-as-numbing flipped onto its back, the life and yearning and desire and guilt pulsating through these blank-faced beings in all their complexities and contradictions filtering through their pallid complexions.

كما يبدو هي شبكة معقّدة تسير في اتجاهات عدّة، كما أنّها «غريبة»، وتبرز تلك الغرابة إذا وضعنا شخصيات إكزوتيكا جنبًا إلى جنب مع بقية شخصيات أفلام المخرج الكندي آتوم إجويان الأخرى، فهي بين مقيّم أضرار في شركة تأمين، وعضوة في هيئة رقابة سينمائية (الضابط The Adjuster 1991) وممثل صامت (الأجزاء المتكلمة Speaking Parts 1989) ومصوّر كنائس (رُزنامة Calendar 1993).
إنها شخصيات غريبة على نحو أننا لا نلقاها كل يوم، فهي تنزوي في أركان غير مألوفة، وهي محددة بشكلٍ موغل في التفاصيل، غير أن هذا لا يعني أنها تحتوي في ذاتها على عنصر الخطر أو الإزعاج أو الرعب، وإنما هي فقط «غريبة».

"Exotica is as interested in dismantling its eroticism as it is in erecting it— the unsexiness of a sexy school girl striptease is made apparent when zealously performed for an impervious gay man. Sexual exploitation is more than just a thematic device, which is more than what I can say for directors like Lynch, it is the key to the film. 
While the strip club is a highly-stylized apparition, situated in the realm of fantasy, Exotica shatters the notion that we leave reality behind when we walk through its doors. While depicted more literally in the film, ones personal and transactional relationships with women will always bleed into one another. The erotic is not ahistorical.

(Ain't No Cure for Love, Leonard Cohen)
Exotica is set in a strip club, but sex is beside the point. It is structured like a puzzle, but solving it is beside the point. What is the point? It could be likened to a kind of spiritual striptease, slowly shedding layers and layers of pretense until the characters’ souls are laid bare. The opening speech is key:
“You have to ask yourself what brought the person to this point… You have to convince yourself that this person has something hidden that you have to find.”
The lighting, the labyrinthine plotting, the blackmail and potential murder – it all suggests a dreamy neo-noir, a bit like Blue Velvet. If it is a film noir, though, it is backwards. As a rule, films noir start with characters who seem decent and unveil their depravity; those we thought were good turn out to be bad. Exotica, however, starts with characters who seem depraved and unveils their decency; those we thought were bad turn out to be good. Instead of building to cynicism and alienation, it builds to consolation and reconciliation. It is a bit like Paris, Texas in the way it starts as a dry, distant, detached mystery before opening up onto shockingly deep wells of feeling. Comparisons only go so far with this one, though.
The film revolves around transactions, but they are always representative of some deeper desire, some deeper way in which these people give or take from each other. The film begins with taking, with a refusal to give, when the man who ""splits"" the cab fare with Thomas scams him by giving him opera tickets instead of cash. Francis is introduced paying the waitress for his drink, but barely looking at her (we never see her face) because he is intent on Christina; he is constantly paying Tracy for ""babysitting""; and Thomas is always taking money for opera tickets, then giving it back.
""I should have given them away for free.""
""Well, that would have been stupid.""
""Why?""
""Because no one gives anything away.""
The way Thomas replays the opera ticket scenario over and over again is his version of Francis' rituals with Tracy and Christina. He is not merely using the same strategy to meet people; he is pretending, over and over again, that he got the tickets for free, and then giving the money back to the people he meets. Why? What satisfaction does this give him? Curiously, we never see him do this with the man he actually takes home.
There are significant parallels between Zoe and Thomas. Zoe inherited the strip club from her mother; Thomas inherited the pet shop from his father. The club is named Exotica; Francis refers to Thomas' animals as ""exotic."" Zoe has secretly gotten Eric's seed to have her baby; Thomas has secretly smuggled eggs into the country.
It is ironic that a woman named Zoe (which is ""spiritual life,"" over and against ""bios"") runs a strip club, but perhaps even this is apropos in the end. ""Exotica is here for your amusement. We're here to entertain, not to heal,"" she tells Francis – but unlikely as it may seem, isn't a place of healing precisely what Exotica finally becomes?
The climax of the film parallels two embraces: Eric embracing Christina and Francis embracing Eric. Two men who seemed to be in an erotic rivalry over a woman turn out to be united by their mutual care for that woman (and perhaps for innocence in general). All the people who seemed so terribly sleazy at the beginning of the film turn out to be quite a bit more tender and compassionate than you would ever have expected. It is precisely Francis' tormentor, the one who ""took something very special"" away from him, who gives him unlooked-for consolation and healing. It is all quite unaccountably beautiful.
And yet, out of everything, I think I am moved most deeply by the subtly pained expression on Francis' face as he watches Christina walk slowly home. I can't quite say why, but I think it is a look of yearning: of longing to reach across a distance and help someone, but not knowing how. The film very slowly and thoroughly sketches out what Christina means to Francis, and then, at the very end, turns around to suggest what Francis means to Christina. It closes out one mystery, then opens another and leaves you with it.
Exotica is, by definition and design, a place where people are dehumanized, reduced to objects of gratification, but Exotica challenges us to do precisely the opposite: to humanize those we see by asking ourselves what brought them to this point, convincing ourselves that they have something hidden that we have to find.",5.0

"Another “hey, I read about this in Premiere” movie that Criterion has added to its catalog, from beloved director Atom Egoyan, and one that I found myself enjoying without particularly  loving. The characters are well-drawn and well acted, the screenplay intelligent and knowledgeable of human nature, and the way the plot moves is engrossing enough. Bruce Greenwood, character actor extraordinaire, shines in a leading role as a broken man trying his best to appear fixed, but I also really liked Mia Kirschner as Christina and Elias Koteas as the grubby bastard Eric. The way these characters interact and bounce off each other has a rhythm not seen in your standard dramatic fare, and picking up on it is a rewarding experience, the kind you only get from the Fertile Crescent of the 90s indie scene. A pretty easy recommendation, if only to see Greenwood’s fantastic performance, with a particularly good ending on top. Shout out to Leonard Cohen’s 1988 artistic and commercial comeback I’m Your Man.",4.0
"i worry i use this word too much in my Letterboxd reviews, but this movie really is hypnotic. it feels like you’re being slowly lured in until you’re being taken by the hand and led down a flight of stairs to somewhere you know you shouldn’t be, or at least you’re wary of going to. the control of tone and the creation of atmosphere are *too* strong. a smooth and powerful film that is also pretty unsettling and certainly upsetting",0.0

"$5? These women are so underpaid!
I took a break from my upbeat Nobuhiko Obayashi marathon to watch this - and see the sad, broken world of its characters. I love the style and tone here. 
It’s weird to see another reviewer say this is what they wanted from Crash? Although it shares an actor, that film is about desensitization and thrill-seeking. The characters don’t have traumatic back stories in Crash. Even though Exotica uses a strip club, it’s not really about sex. It’s about the roles the characters can fill emotionally with one another - more parent/child than erotic (and no, unlike my love of Italian gothic or Joe D’Amato, this doesn’t have incest). These characters are so sad and emotional compared to the intentionally monotone Crash. Exotica is the beauty of melancholy. 
As a queer man, I really connect to Thomas. From public cruising to the awkward and fetishized apartment hookup, it’s very real. I’m so glad that unlike his hookup, the queer community now has embraced body hair. I’m not turning in his eggs!",5.0
"Nothing hit me straight on, everything hit from an odd, sideways angle that left me feeling creepy... like I'm a voyeur who just watched a guy get a lap dance for 2 hours. The panting in the mic, the one way mirrors, one dimensional characters that are built up through time, everything seems distant and incredibly seedy. Well done from a tonal and cinematic point of view, not my kind of movie.",3.5
"Egoyan unravels the intricacies of the plot just like Christina unbuttons her shirt: slowly and teasingly where, at the end of the performance, she stands a few inches away from your seat but her bra is clasped and her body is not yours to touch - you get to know just enough about the story but nowhere near all of the details.
May not be everyone's cup of tea, but I can clearly see why one ""comes to"" Exotica, and embrace the fact that keeping my redundant curiosity in check is a necessity to absorb this experience in full spectacle.",4.5

"I went into this movie expecting something NC17 or something a lot more erotic and disturbing than what I actually got. And while I can't say it isn't erotic or disturbing, in fact it definitely is, it's just not quite what I was anticipating based on the Criterion synopsis and the Letterboxd poster... and I think the actual film is MUCH better than what I was expecting it to be. It's a film that is really very tragic underneath the sexy and mysterious atmosphere. The main characters are lost souls in many ways and they've both had certain events and environments that they've been put through that have affected them and their personal lives. It tells a story about emotion and coping with unfortunate events and environments and how it relates to the human condition, and the overall story is really heartfelt and poignant underneath the eroticism of the setting. Really interesting movie to think about after watching and probably one of my favorites now. Gonna be picking up the Criterion when the sale comes around.",5.0

After only two watches, I’m not at the stage were I can even begin to break down my feelings, I just know this is both a personal and beautiful enigma that achieves beyond many other psychological films I’ve seen. I only really have a joke criticism in that certain characters seem to inexplicably treat ‘5 bucks’ like this inordinate amount of money that could buy you a mansion, but within such an intricate dream, a charming Canadian one at that, it’s not something I can genuinely complain about. I feel like every aspiring filmmaker who hasn’t seen it at least twice, is missing something potentially crucial that could help them to transcend their insecurities, trust in their own individual viewpoint and find the resolve to let the art truly speak for itself.",4.5

"this movie is so insane, beautifully shot, gorgeous art direction, amazing performances. like all the parrots that shadow the characters in the backgrounds of shots (painted on walls, taxidermized on the sound booth, living in cages, etc) this movie stews in the idea that we mimic what we cannot understand. 
theres a beautiful moment where the film breaks from the smokey, dark interiors to a field. elias koteas and mia kirshner are walking and talking through tall grass. he reveals something to her “well i think i want you. does that mean you’ll slip away?” he looks up at the sky for a split second and sighs before looking back at her. i dont know if this was a conscious acting choice, but it was one of the most lovely expressions ive seen captured on camera. idk. i love actors. i love watching little things ppl do okay quirky vibes…

"Pretty mesmerising, while being weirdly not all that difficult to approach given much of the taboo subject matter. Elias Koteas is a one of a kind talent, as was apparent in everything else I’ve seen him in, but this seems like it’s probably his absolute best. It was an unforgettable dream, achieving a tone, a hazy atmosphere that feels wholly unique, even with the Lynchian, Cronenbergian comparisons you could make. It’s a shame director Atom Egoyan has supposedly proven to have Shyamalaned himself into mediocrity after his 90s output.",4.5

"Ritratto della solitudine. I protagonisti di ""Exotica"" sono tormentati, afflitti, alle prese con un attaccamento alla carne e alla sessualità che viene fuori man mano che questi ultimi intrecciano le proprie storie. Ne viene fuori un mosaico che punta decisamente di più sul ""guardare e non toccare"", sull'esplorazione dell'animo umano e delle sue pulsioni, sul sesso inteso come una pura e semplice simulazione, configurato come un vero e proprio giallo di cui però alla fine non importa granché, in quanto ciò che davvero interessa ad Egoyan è l'indagine psicologica delle vite di tutti i protagonisti, con l'ossessione voyeuristica che viene fuori come una specie di pulsione nascosta per via dello stato psicologicamente incerto e tormentato dei protagonisti.
Ed è così che Egoyan sceglie di inquadrare il tutto in modo ciclico, con una regia che punta sia al fascino dell'immagine stessa (con tantissimi totali) che alla penetrazione delle psicologie dei personaggi tramite primi piani e tramite una composizione assolutamente elegante e dal fascino invidiabile, tale da ricordare addirittura Lynch per l'uso delle atmosfere e di un certo tipo di onirismo che dà decisamente una marcia in più al film.",4.0

"""He comes in here every other night. He has his favorite drink, and his favourite table, with his favorite dancer. Sometimes he has to wait for her, and sometimes she's waiting for him, to protect him. She's his angel.""

Seductive filmmaking of the most hypnotic kind that makes you want to ask a lot of questions but you would refrain from that at the end as it isn't the point of Egoyan's storytelling in the first place...Can't get over how the camera moves here inside Exotica around those performances drenched in grief, loneliness and desire...And that final scene, uff!!!

///""Exotica is a movie labyrinth, winding seductively into the darkest secrets of a group of people who should have no connection with one another, but do. At the beginning, the film seems to be about randomly selected strangers. By the end, it is revealed that these people are so tightly wound up together that if you took one away, their world would collapse...Exotica is a deep, painful film about those closed worlds of stage-managed lust. It is also a tender film about a lonely and desperate man, and a woman who is kind to him. How desperate and how kind are only slowly revealed. In a technical sense, this is a ""hyperlink movie,"" in which characters are revealed to be connected in ways they may not know about. But Egoyan surprises us in how slowly he reveals the links and even more slowly reveals what the characters know about them. When the film ends, you sit regarding the screen, putting together what you have just learned and using it to think again about what went before.
Exotica does what many good films do and implies its troubled feelings. Nothing is solved at the end, except that we have learned to understand the characters...If we do not at first understand all of the relationships between the characters, they do not all understand them themselves, and in certain ways never figure them out. That provides the film with hidden emotional currents as powerful as those that are visible. When you think through the film later, you realize how much some of the characters never know, and yet how important it has been to the outcome. Egoyan isn't weaving these strands simply to divert us with a labyrinth; he is suggesting the hidden ways in which we affect other lives with our choices and behavior even though unaware...Beneath everything pulses the atmosphere of the club Exotica, its promise of sexuality masking deeper needs and obsessions. The grave voice of Leonard Cohen and the starkness of his songs, played by Eric the DJ, seem wrong for a strip club, but not for this one, where not desire but desperation is catered to.""/// --- Roger Ebert",0.0

Egoyan's direction doesn't do much for me, visually he's mostly just fine and his actors are pretty awkward (how intentionally or for what purpose I can't really tell) but I can tell that this is, if anything, a smart movie. Maybe it's overcomplicated but the way these threads loop and link back together is worth compliment. I'm struggling to feel like I've found this narratively rewarding (ending's a great one though) and that's the bottom line here...

There's some people that you could remember the moment that you met them really clearly, and other people that seems like you've known them forever even though you haven't.

The performances are drenched in Exotica's thick atmosphere like the dancers in the fog of the Exotica. Regardless of any other real pertaining aspect of Greenwoods performance, the pain is most notable, it isn't disconnected. Francis's pain is really imbedded into Greenwood, and is dripping like an overripe citrus; synonymous with the commercialization of stripper clubs.
The culmination of all this pain is the final act. Cheap club music blaring like the theme to Francis's pain. He distantly listens, obedient to a nonexistent authority. Eric shares the same nonexistent authoritative figure, and after turmoil, they confide in the foreboding dangers of the pain that the demon instilled in them through a hug.",5.0

Egoyan’s direction is nothing short of magnificent here.

"So real quick, one of my biggest pet peeves in movies are movies from the 90s that reek of the decade. Exotica is one of those films. From the opening frames, everything about it feels incredibly grimy. You look at the film stock and you can just imagine it has that weird musty smell of rundown buildings in the 90s before the building inspector would look at it and go “how the fuck is this still standing and why does it smell like piss?”
However, Exotica plays differently. It avoids the typical misogynistic pratfalls of the 90s while still keeping the nihilism and special sense of gravitas that defined that generation. It's a certain vibe that is a mix between very uninviting and very hostile. It's the reason that a lot of 90s nostalgia isn’t mined like the fun-loving 80s. Instead of grating on my nerves, Exotica plays like a well worn Nirvana record. It has its scratches and occasional bumps but damn, this shit slaps.
At its core, Exotica is a deep dark character study surrounded by a group of dingy 90s characters. It plays like a striptease, slowly exposing new bits to the viewer while keeping them entranced from beginning to end. It is not a film that could not be made outside of the decade and it is so much better for it. Visually and thematically there aren’t many films that line up nearly as well. Rarely do you feel that a director’s vision and the final product line up so well.",4.5

"a friend recently said to me, ""there's no right way to understand grief. grief is like a wall with understanding on one side of it. the other is all feeling."" this could very well be Exotica's thesis. take, for instance, the motif of the two-way mirror. a visual device that underscores not only the power dynamic of perceiving and being perceived but also the way the film's players deal with and understand their own trauma, loss, and feelings of alienation.
an alluring and masterful film that challenges you to reevaluate typical narrative and genre conventions and how they guide and manipulate you. all of the implicit and explicit contracts the characters have made with one another somewhat reminded me of the favor in Strangers on a Train and i wouldn't be surprised if that was something Egoyan had in the back of his mind while making this. Exotica reminds us that there can be tension and desperation that drive one to drastic revenge measures, but empathy and forgiveness aren't necessarily thrown out of the window. it's startling how this subversion of expectations makes you forget that kindness exists in the crosshair of tragedy.

This film has a very Lynch-ian atmosphere; hypnotic and puzzling. So Lynch-ian in fact that it's almost too puzzling. I had to read analysis from others to help understand the story. It's my conviction that if one must really struggle to make sense of the plot, then it compromises the delivery of the story's theme; it's moral argument suffers, and this film dances on a highwire that fails to keep its audience from falling. I kept wondering if I've fallen off that highwire. What sort of relationship did Eric and Christina really have? Was what Francis and Christina saw in the fields actually happen? What's the deal with all those parrots? Are they symbolic of something?

"""You want the full story?""
One of a kind, very few films muster this degree of ingenuity, subversiveness, technical prowess and empathy simultaneously.
EXOTICA utilizes the ultimate perversions inherent in cinema to lure the viewer (who resides behind a one way mirror) into a story where they are believed to have the upper hand from a moral standpoint and that they are ultimately going to acquire all of the necessary information to implicate the strange and suspicious subjects this film depicts. The film manages to completely flip this pendulum, an objectively confounding first half of the film starts to come into focus more and more. We start to fully know what the film is about, it's a film about watching, transactions, about days without numbers, about grief, and most effectively and poignantly, it's a film about people; ""people"" referring to the vast majority of us who are well-intentioned from birth but are weighed down by our baggage (as the film touches on throughout, right from the beginning in a very literal sense when the opening scene moves through a one way mirror into the baggage check area of an airport), and ""people"" who are simply looking for existence affirming connection (the thing that transcends transaction). Once the focus of the film has reached its apex and has seemingly illuminated all of its missing pieces, what we are left with is the vague unknowingness towards the ostensive impossibility of such connections, not due to a person's inability to connect but rather, the strange, inopportune social stratifiers that would deem such connection ""out of the way"" or much worse, taboo.

Most films are powerful for the stories they present at face value but this is one of those films that is so powerful almost exclusively through its use of cinematic language to reveal deep existential truths that are streamlined to the soul (a film like SAFE comes to mind when trying to meet that definition). I came across a piece by Peter Greenaway recently where he said Griffith may have been the worst thing to happen to cinema because of how he made narrative a fundamental part of most filmmaking and this is one of those films that from the get go, is using narrative as only a subversive entity. It's always good to be reminded of what cinema should be in its purest form.",4.5

a lot of people have said this in their reviews, but what i love most about atom egoyan is his capability to build every single character and give each one the perfect amount of time to develop over the course of his films, even when the runtime is shorter than usual. with this build-up, though, also comes egoyan's way of revealing the plot. it unwinds in ways you least expect it, and when everything clicks together in the end, it feels so bittersweet - in the best way possible.
with exotica, this is most definitely the case -- but the camerawork adds even more depth to it all. two-way mirrors, neon lighting, long takes, it's all so masterfully done.

"I can't be sure, but I believe it was my friend Leslie who urged me to watch Exotica shortly after its release back in that long ago and far away 90s. And yet it took me a quarter-century to finally view what has instantly become one of my favourite films.
Exotica is something very rare in film. It is a story without villains, even though its characters act in ways that could be considered criminal or at least seedy. It's set mainly in a strip club, and it is erotic, but it's a kind of erotic that is somehow made wholesome by subverting certain dangerous tropes and turning prurience into the most powerful kind of empathy.
And I think that is why I love this film. Its characters, struggling though they do with jealousy, lust, rage, and horror, each find within themselves not merely tolerance, not merely forgiveness, but the strength to reach out and help - to care for one another even as they struggle with their own trauma.
How beautiful this film is in its profound decency. And what a comfort to be reminded that people really do behave this way. It's a thing to be celebrated, and Exotica is a truly great celebration of all that's good in us.",5.0

A delightfully seedy film filled with loathsome characters whom you can't help but root for. Greenwood and Koteas are both excellent. The set design is very striking too.,4.0
"It's a film that thinks its clever because its non-linear structure loops back around on itself as various characters interact in various points in time, but it all feels like someone saw Pulp Fiction and decided to see what would happen if David Lynch directed it.
It's not a badly made film, there's just so many times I can watch a story about a stripper/prostitute with a heart of gold be systematically abused and have it be more about the director trying to get off than actually say anything of substance.
It's got good performances, and the camera work is damned good, but it's just another one of those examples of films that would never have existed if the director had gone to therapy.
It gets its three stars for good actors and good cinematography (and using Leonard Cohen in your soundtrack helps), but that's about all there is. Non-linear narratives on their own do not make a movie profound. Putting artificially depressing tragedies for their own sake means nothing.",2.5

"Part of the Todd Gaines Movie Challenge:
Challenge #4: ""A movie about a stripper.""
I'm not very well versed in the filmography of highly-acclaimed Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan, I've only seen his more recent works (I liked ""Remember"", found ""Chloe"" and ""The Captive"" to be aggressively mediocre and ""Devil's Knot"" was just straight up atrocious). ""Exotica"" is not only head and shoulders above everything that I've seen from him but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.
""Exotica"" is a completely entrancing experience unlike any other. Egoyan seamlessly ties together a series of story lines in a way that I never could have thought of. Information is held back only to be revealed at just the right time to send waves of chills down your spine. He also leaves certain things to the mind which makes the ending at least ten times as disturbing than it ever could've been with the information.
I'm at a loss for words with this one. It's pretty much perfect, perfect in every way. I can't wait to dive further into the earlier works of Mr. Egoyan. (10/10)",5.0
"Letterboxd Season 2015-16
Week 17: New Cult Canon Week
A neo-noir that uses it's sensuous implications as a smoke screen for a truly fascinating story of loss, trauma, redemption, obsession, denial, desperation, loneliness and healing. Looking at this with 2016 eyes it is hard to get past the cheesy music and what you feel is going to be a pretty below average melodramatic soft-core thriller similar to other fare that permeated the late eighties and early nineties. But it's not too long before you realize this film has other things on its mind than the titillating poster and tagline would have you expect. A lesser film than this would give you all the exposition of the characters in the first act only to reveal some contrived thriller twist at the end. But the way this unravels is master story-telling at its finest. It explores the depths of what could possibly motivate these characters. Because of the setting in a moody upscale strip club, the immediate judgements go to lustful, nefarious and physchologically disturbing places. But what the writer and director have in store for the viewer is something far more simple. Being completely genuine to the world it creates and yet still greater in scope than one would expect; bringing the film to an entirely satisfying conclusion in a brilliantly conceived and executed final scene leaving this viewer compelled to rewind and reset and experience the whole thing over again.",4.5
"A rewatch.
Except for The Sweet Hereafter, perhaps Atom Egoyan's most fully realized film, with all of its underground currents of sadness, guilt, loss, jealousy, eventually spilling into a shared pool. This shared pool is not crystal clear, of course, so all the questions aren't every fully fully answered, but then you likely will be better off with the wondering after them.",4.0

Why is Eric jealous of Francis if he... knows? What is the point of Thomas in the film?,4.0
"It’s only a week into the New Year, but I’ve already discovered a masterpiece in the form of Atom Egoyan’s Exotica. The director introduces the viewer into a seductive strip club where all its inhabitants have their own descent to ignore, their own tragedies to escape. Yet whilst the purism is visualised with exotic colours and a penetrating soundtrack which utilises a repetitiveness to enforce its presence, Egoyan’s film is not one platformed by the sexual actions which occur in the club but rather the aforementioned troubles to which everyone involved all faces.
There’s Bruce Greenwood’s Francis, a father destroyed by the death of his daughter and so chooses the club as a form of escapism for “what he needs”; there’s Don McKellar’s Thomas whose apparent drug struggling and activities at the ballet counteract with Francis’ thought process; running the club is Elias Koteas’ Eric who provides a powerful edge to proceedings; and the ever beautiful Christina portrayed by Mia Kirshner displays a sensual innocence in her “jailbait” school uniform appearance. All of these characters give a perspective to Egoyan’s overwhelming thoughts of escapism and the director’s study of their thought process and porcelain hearts is emphatic beyond belief.
Exotica is an extraordinary film, the director encourages a mood which lingers over everything and there’s also a Jim Jarmusch feel to proceedings which I adored. Egoyan has crafted something truly divine here; I can’t wait to explore more of the man’s back catalogue.",5.0
Η Christina χορεύει με το Everybody Knows του Cohen και κάπως έτσι αποφάσισα να ανοίξω λογαριασμό στο letterboxd.,4.0
"There are always going to be worlds that we don't fully understand. Worlds--or perhaps microcosms--where there are rules that outline interactions and how they must occur. But who creates these rules? Are they enforced or self-imposed? Among many other things, Exotica is a film primarily about the comforting worlds that are built up by people and how they exist inside of them.
Set mainly in and around the titular strip club--the other prominent location being an exotic pet store--this film follows a few different narratives while also teasing out small subplots along the way. There is a club regular coping with the loss of his family, he gets dances from the same stripper every time he's there. This stripper's ex-boyfriend is the DJ in the club and is grappling both with the breakup and some past trauma that plays out in flashbacks masterfully layered throughout the film--this is certainly my favorite character played by the constantly underrated Elias Koteas. Also of importance is the owner of the pet store. To say anymore of these characters and their relationships would spoil much of what makes this film great.
But as much as this film is a compare-and-contrast of all these disparate characters, it also mines an extremely rich visual and thematic text that is frankly very difficult to grasp on first viewing. Atom Egoyan uses so many visual links in this film between locations and characters and back-stories and words that everything becomes insulated. This is definitely the most intellectually stimulating film to take place in a strip club.
This film ultimately becomes an exploration of the fragility of the worlds that we surround ourselves with. The false rules, the perceived boundaries; everything seems to exist inside of a vaccuum in this film. Tellingly an oft repeated image used in this film is that of one sided mirrors. Everyone on the mirror side sees the place they are in, the world they currently inhabit with themselves inside of it. But there are people on the other side of these, people who make and enforce the rules, whether subconsciously or not. It's just the matter of recognizing which side of the mirror you are on.",4.5

Atom said in the Cannes interview included on the criterion channel that it is most erotic when a movie “provokes a sexual response, but you are not allowed to escape into that sexual response”. There is nothing in this movie to feel good about and there is certainly no payoff in an erotic sense. 
You always leave not quite satisfied, you can look but you certainly cannot touch, but worry not because you can always go back to Exotica in your dreams.

"Feels dropped out of another planet. This is a true puzzle movie laden with retro 90s vibes and creepy neon atmosphere. It’s weird in the sense that even though nearly every “mystery” gets “solved”, the atmosphere and execution of the events in the film still give the various coping mechanisms of these characters a really eerie quality. Something as simple as the hyacinth Macaws sprinkled throughout or the way the camera just glides through the strip club feel so hypnotic. Even though there’s a sense that we have an understanding of the relationships between the 4 characters at the end, there’s no real resolution to any of their traumas so something like Francis and Christina’s codependent relationship with each other turns from simply haunting in its obsession to also haunting in its sadness. It’s also scary to think about the trauma that’s merely implied. There’s clearly Christina in that final shot, but Francis’ brother and the gay customs officer also keep me wondering. I love the way scenes like Eric and Christina wandering through the grass can morph from feeling like a vision, to relationship flashback, to eventually traumatic context. The entire movie feels like an uncanny exercise of taking the seemingly exotic and revealing the humanity at its core. It’s also all written so well that all four stories would probably still weave together coherently even removed from all the layers of artifice, but is still all the better for having it. Gah I’d love to watch it again to see if it falls into place even more now.",4.5

"People of Interest: 17. Elias Koteas
I cannot believe how many people like this movie. It feels so inconsequential. Lots of starting and stopping emotionally with no actual resolution. The dynamics were needlessly confusing, the movie was trying to be opaque and hard to grasp for seemingly no reason other than to justify the runtime and set pieces. Too quiet for a thriller, not sexy enough to be erotic. Repetitive and annoying, cloying to the senses. Elias as the emcee was SO FUCKING ANNOYING. I don’t care if it is on purpose, YOU DON’T TALK TO THE GUYS WHEN THEY’RE FOCUSED ON THE GIRLS. It was the most non-erotic atmosphere imaginable which is a shame because the club itself was gorgeous. It needed to be nastier, it needed to be more upsetting for what it was trying to achieve. Dropped plot-lines all over the place. I don’t want people making films like Lynch because they don’t get it right practically ever.

"There is apparently an unspoken rule between middle aged fathers and their daughters’ teenaged babysitters that they get to flirt with wild abandon on the long ride home but if the dad gets out of bounds or breaks the facade in the slightest his entire family will die and he’ll be relegated to trudge through a hellscape taking the form of a high-concept strip club where the DJ is involved in a payola scam with Leonard Cohen.
I have no idea where Don McKellar’s character fits into all this. For the first hour I didn’t even recognize him in the glasses with that astounding haircut.
Egoyan insists you can’t make a movie like this anymore. Atom, may I counter, it seems like this is the only kind of movie that gets made these days. He preemptively shut down any questions or theories about meaning or explanation but personally I would’ve loved to have taken part in a q&a that was just everyone in the room talking about conflating grief and molestation one at a time.

"Intriguing.
Egoyan directed a movie in my top five of all time, and I have slept on his work ever since. I am aware that his career seems to have taken a turn for the worst, but he hasn’t let me down yet.
For a film set mostly in a strip club, there nothing particularly titillating about it. There is a fair share of nudity, but it’s not really the focus as it is the characters that are. It isn’t a mistake that there are no sex scenes present, as it’s clear there isn’t any intimacy despite the setting.
SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH! There’s one scene in the film that I found especially stunning. There is a song that plays and is accompanied by dancing, and later on it plays again; only with an entirely different meaning. Despite having the same moves and the same music, the scene carries new meaning now due to our understanding of the characters. The haunting “Everybody Knows” certainly added to it. END OF SPOILERS!
As for the score, it’s absolutely enthralling. Perfectly encapsulates the exotic nature it’s setting out to achieve but also the turmoil loss brings. The cinematography never stunned me, but it was serviceable. Although I have to admit that the callbacks of the one way windows was a pretty neat decision.
As is normal for Egoyan, the narrative is not fully understood until late into the film. In doing so, he begs us to return to it in order to pick up on details. His structure is fascinating and I frankly love it.
Our characters are all lost souls clinging to the past; they’re all husks of people, really. Giving your all into what is gone only causes disaster.
Perhaps most intriguing is the mystery of it all. Bits and pieces are shown to us of a past before the club, but how they ended up there isn’t ever revealed, except for Francis and Thomas; even their stories have mysteries to them. This seems like it could lead for an incomplete tale, but it really adds to the exotic nature of the film. Although I won’t deny that I thought Thomas’ character was a bit underutilized.
“Exotica” is cinema for the lost, and for those who only have what is lost to comfort them.",4.5

"“zoe, not all of us have the luxury of deciding what to do with our lives.”
i will admit, this took me 4 times to finish bc i am usually not in this mode anymore and have found Egoyan’s movies Needlessly Creepster in the past, particularly in his use of Sarah Polley even tho she was of age in all of the movies of his i’ve seen her in. but since this employs her in a very purposeful way and is horny in a myriad of Fucked Up Ways, that also has Elias Koteas in proto-Crash mode, i kept at it.
this is my problem, not yours.
needless to say (probably), this is the best Egoyan i’ve seen. its messiness feels intentional and illuminating. it’s not just the central theme; the opening sequence with the airport cops and the use of Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows” right after tells you so much you didn’t know you needed to know. this is also about the hierarchy of human experience, where we are powerless against events fucking up our lives and the lives of our loved ones. we have so little agency, on balance. when we feel we do have agency, it’s sometimes overwhelming or just hard to fucking tell. and it’s in the spaces where we think we’re asking for so little, something that feels so ostensibly uncomplicated, that all of that is revealed to us.
there’s so much here about the attempted relocation of violent personal narratives, bc sooooo much of sex for a lot of ppl is about isolating some long-simmering negative past experience into a different context that often cannot help but boil over. there’re no uncomplicated relationships in anyone’s life; just the ones we have less time or occasion to examine. and there are often ppl in life who so desperately want us to examine something about our history they’ve detected which we either refuse to do or just don’t clock. all that’s in here, too.

"I just looooved the atmosphere throughout the film. The use of music (what a great soundtrack!), colors and setting really put you into the mood. You can either feel disgusted or moved, but traumas sometimes can lead to obsession. Why do men have to go to strip clubs? Entertainment doesn't heal. Don't they know they can go to therapy? They can look for more meaningful ways to connect to people. It makes me wonder, where do women go when they experience trauma? For sure they don't attend strip clubs. We can all be struck by tragedy but how we face it, is what makes a difference. Escaping from reality won't do much for you. So, maybe, at the end of the day, all we need is a hug filled with honest empathy and understanding.",4.5

Explaining my personal resonance with this film, as is usually par for the course for most other movies I’ve given full marks, requires me getting into territory that truly no one else, on this website or elsewhere, really needs to know about, but between this and The Sweet Hereafter, Egoyan’s been able to tap into both a particular narrative and tonal frequency that lines up with a very specific kind of loneliness and grief - one that serves as the driver of envious, possessive impulses and bizarre instincts, all of which are rooted in deeply wounded, pitiable internal motivations, but none of which are written and portrayed with anything but real, authentic pathos on Egoyan and the cast’s part. There is something genuinely remarkable to be said here about how this film takes the harder way out from its premise surrounding transactional sex as well as the labor and services built off of it - a story where the easy route would have been to make a cautionary tale about the capitalistic impulses driving their operations, but elects instead to make itself about the emotional transactions behind why people turn to and enter these worlds from every conceivable angle. And that’s not to say anything about how elegantly this intertwines all of its disparate storylines to jarringly and retroactively recontextualize every scene featuring each character that comes before, masterfully snapping everything into place with each progressive revelation all the way up until its final shot - one composed with such raw poignance that it genuinely moved me to tears. [UPDATE, one hour after this rewatch: Is this the only film where even thinking about this final shot is enough to choke me up? Yeah, it just might. First time for everything, even after years of watching and reviewing these things.]
There’s a moment in this where Eric, the MC-narrator driving the operations of the eponymous strip club, reminisces on a more idyllic moment — his first encounter with Christina, who eventually becomes one of his dancers. He’s pouring his heart out to her, pondering about his need to feel needed, and his desire to have a friend, decades of despondent, pathetic loneliness leaking through his glances, his words, his posture. She indulges him, and then reciprocates in kind. Intercut between this scene is a moment in the present, doused in ice-cold tones and lighting, where he walks out of his bedroom and sees Christina, all dressed and made up, almost carrying a menacing poise about her with all-black attire… and then the film’s harrowing opening bagpipe theme kicks in as he walks out of the building to the roof, losing composure, trying to keep himself together. It’s difficult to describe the full impact of this moment without spiraling into two extended profiles about the characters in these scenes, but the degree to which I was shaken up by it is hard to really describe.
This is a film about the worlds of chasmic pain that split us apart and hold us together, and the bizarre, off-kilter ways through which we barely cling to the pieces that linger amid the darkness, if only it means it will give us peace in nights of silence — where the only skies we can stare up at are drywall ceilings and darkened lights. Certainly among the greatest films ever made. Hell, it just might be the greatest… but I’m not quite sure just yet. “Everybody knows the boat is leaking / Everybody knows the captain lied.” ",5.0
"Wow
That soundtrack is doing so much for me. Dreamy, sexy, dark, twisted. Even when something seemingly innocuous is happening on screen, that buzzing starts and we’re reminded that there is something more. There’s dirt underneath someone’s fingernails.
But how much and from what?
it really leads you by the necktie to make your own conclusions. It dares you to harshly judge these characters, begs you to. Just another John at the club, just another jaded stripper, just another possessive ex boyfriend; only to remind you in the end  how little we understand about each other. How little we understand about ourselves. How little damaged people understand how to heal their wounds. And how bizarre their journey can seem from the outside looking in.
I think this plus The Sweet Hereafter has to make Atom Egoyan’s depictions of dealing with grief some of the most hairy and nuanced I’ve ever seen. Also love seeing Sarah Polley in both who has proven to be a very talented filmmaker in her own right coming off Women Talking last year and a very personal documentary in the 2000s called Stories We Tell. Didn’t know she had acting chops like this on top of that. I also don’t think I’ve properly appreciated Bruce Greenwood up until this point he’s always been “that guy from that thing” but no,  no, no, this man can ACT.",4.5

"Ещё один грустнейший фильм Атома Эгояна о неотпускающих травмах прошлого, не такой, конечно, пронзительный, как следующее его славное будущее, и слегка смущающий обрубающейся линией второго плана, но всё равно приятно завораживающий красиво показанной через танцевальный эротизм хрупкостью человеческих взаимоотношений. Весь этот эротизм местной «экзотики», где как раз и соединяются судьбы персонажей ленты, для героев Гринвуда и Киршнер не отдаёт сексуальностью, а лишь воплощает их понимающее единение в общих шрамах, которые не заживут никогда. И к концу загадочная по началу картинка окончательно обрисовывает свою печальную суть: вместо танцев здесь разворачивается игра с ролями иного типа, уходящей далеко от надетого на танцовщице костюма в нечто более духовное и тонкое, чему другие экзотичные обитатели, например, герой Котеаса, могут лишь завидовать и могут лишь стараться помешать. Только, к сожалению, должного покоя эта повторяющаяся игра так и не даст, ведь каждый из её участников всё равно не забудет о том, что это всего лишь игра.",3.5
"Definitely an unorthodox look at the human condition, tragedy, and loss, with a more twisted delivery of the premise.

Is it just that it’s about power dynamics and how women’s bodies are treated by men? I think that’s what I’m supposed to get. But if it is, God, what a flimsy way to go about it. It’s shallow and lukewarm and the color beige, which is kind of at odds with how grand it is from a technical standpoint. Like yeah, the sets are gorgeous and the film is shot very well. But I just don’t think the film is worth all of that effort. I don’t mind having to come up with theories to appreciate a film, peep my favorite movie for proof, but I want to feel like it was worth it, like I got something out of the experience that I couldn’t get anywhere else, and that’s just not what happened. It has its positive qualities, but I’m fine with forgetting it as a whole.

To put it mildly, it's Cronenberg without the body horror but all the sexual frustration. It's Douglas Buck's spirit animal. Why am I only naming Canadian filmmakers? I don't know.
Either way, I don't think it's something I need to binge watch, but I found myself getting sucked into the slow burn stories of longing and living with your issues like a bad roommate.
The ending of the film was so simple, but again left me with more questions about what I just watched. So that's something I gotta applaude.",4.0
"""There's so many places you could hide something in this country.""
The '90s was certainly the decade that Atom Egoyan was operating at the peak of his powers. The run from 1991's The Adjuster to 1999's Felicia's Journey is just banger after banger after banger, with this film and its followup, 1997's The Sweet Hereafter, at the fulcrum points. Set in and around the titular strip club, where lonely men go to salve their spiritual and psychic wounds, Exotica is a complex story with a number of characters whose lives intersect in ways that aren't immediately apparent. This is because Egoyan withholds key pieces of information from us -- and from his characters -- patiently doling them out, allowing us and them to discover the whole truth in our own time. That this isn't frustrating for the audience has a lot to do with Egoyan's command of the milieu and the compelling characters he's chosen to occupy it.
Those characters include revenue official Francis (Bruce Greenwood), who is brought in to audit the books of pet shop owner Thomas (Don McKellar), who is suspected of smuggling by customs, strip club DJ Eric (Elias Koteas), who delights in introducing exotic dancer Christina (Mia Kirshner), whose specialty is dressing like a schoolgirl, pregnant club owner Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), who is disturbed by the way Eric announces her, and Francis's babysitter Tracey (Sarah Polley), who doesn't seem to have a baby to sit. That, however, doesn't prevent him from paying her to pretend while he enacts a semi-nightly ritual with Christina at Exotica. There's also an interesting parallel between Thomas, was has inherited his pet shop (which is lined with scummy fish tanks) from his father, and Zoe, who inherited her strip club (which has an aquarium-type feel) from her mother. I could mention more, but to do so would give away some of the film's more powerful revelations -- and no doubt about it, this film packs an emotional wallop.",4.5

"(Criterion Challenge 2023 - 4/52 - ""Made in Canada"")
An absolute total banger of a Sleeper. It makes me glad I've finally seen this, for one, as for years I got this confused with another twisted Canadian mid 90s joint where Elias Koteas talks on microphone to a group of horny, lost strangers (Crash); I remember I every so often in the 2000s would see this pop up on late night cable and wouldn't keep watching because I'd see Koteas doing his strip club DJ thing and thought ""but I've seen Crash already."" Fool I was. But hey, what better time than this film to reminisce and have a reckoning about past regrets!
Exotica is maybe the most vulnerable, heart-rending, searingly sincere and intriguing drama that has been made or will ever he made that has its focal point location of a strip club. And it's not that where it's set isn't crucial or could be any other place, quite the opposite, for how this is where men are ""Entertained"" but something else can happen if a man and or a woman is open to it on a connective level (plus the ""Dont Touch"" part becomes *very* key); it's what Atom Egoyan as a storyteller is doing and using the location for and the key people there- this bearded hollow husk of an auditor, the young woman dancing for him every other night, the DJ who was her former lover, the pregnant lady who runs the joint (interesting note, played by Egoyan's wife, she's really good in the part, and actually pregnant at the time) - and what brings them together.
Of course I saw the DVD cover in like Blockbuster for years and maybe didn't take it seriously to watch (again, I was a dummy, so once again major points to Criterion for the recent restoration, albeit finally seeing great to very good Egoyan films like Sweet Hereafter and Chloe certainly helped me come to this), but what's so staggering are the levels of pain and anguish that are stripped bare here amid the obssession, and what it means to make a connection and to maintain it. Or, as it turns out, what happens when that connection is twisted and possibly perverted, like what happens between Koteas' Eric with his ex Kirshner's Christina as he watches her with this man over and over again (and reading in between the lines that he's seen her with other men too - why it matter so much with this auditor Francis... well, you have to see it to find out).
There is also a kind of B storyline that does tie in with the major part of the film with this disparate, lightly corrupt (or as much as one can be) pet shop owner Thomas (Don McKellar, first time I've seen him outside of Last Night and I'm glad to see him in another more dramafic mode and yet none the less haunted or awkward as he was there, but anyway). His story might not seem in retrospect to have the same weight or gravity as what Greenwood has on his consciousness, as his thing is repeatedly going to the ballet to be close to a man who needs a ticket, giving back the money and (at least once if not more times) going back to his apartment to, as the song goes, spend the night together.
But looking back after the film ends, aside from Thomas's part in the story and in this Neo-Noirish framework he has little choice but to go with what Francis asks him to do, his is connected thematically with Francis in a sense (also all alone and looking for some kind of companionship, however off key or ""risque"" as so called proper society might deem it), and I think Egoyan knew the audience would need a kind of breather from the dramatic severity, however played in a lower key, of Greenwood and Koteas's scenes with Thomas who happens to be the kind of man with an incubator and eggs at home. It's really ingenious and just the correct way to do this kind of film where you have interconnected (Ebert called it Hyper-Linked) characters.
I also can't neglect the presence of a young and very good Sarah Polley, who serves as someone else in Francis's life that seems somewhat puzzling... until it isn't. I know I will want to revisit Exotica, but I want it to sit in my mind and soul for a while. It's not everyday you see a filmmaker who treats his subjects with this great a degree of sensitivity and emotional intelligence, like I can't think of performances or characters written for what is nominally a ""Genre"" film that are this strong and yet its this quiet intensity rocking through it all (a quasi erotic thriller, even if the eroticism is all in the name of the commerce of the Exotica club, not to say Kirshner isn't sultry but there isn't a shred of exploitation on Egoyan's mind or intention).
And thank goodness Egoyan has the actors he has; Kirshner is wonderful, but this is probably the acting that Koteas and Greenwood should be the most proud of from the decade if not their whole careers; they know Egoyan wants to take a time to draw out who a person is, not to an overlong extent but longer than what you would see in a typical Hollywood or B movie. You understand how wounded and broken these men are, and that violence won't do much to heal them in their different forms of psychic scars.
Damn good cup of patient, thoughtful and heartache-packed and slowburn ennui 90s Indie cinema; go watch it if you want to know what a superb non- Cronenberg Canadian movie looked like from the period.",5.0
"Criterion Challenge 2023 #4: Made in Canada
A year before Paul Verhoeven thrust his rowdy and noisy satire of hedonism and lust, Showgirls, onto the world*, Atom Egoyan made a film which also examines a world of lust but in a far deeper and more compassionate manner. Verhoeven's movie seems to me to exist for the purpose of pissing off as many prudes as possible (which isn't a bad thing, but it just seems to bonk the viewer over the head repeatedly). Egoyan's film however, seems to exists to penetrate the desires, regrets, and deep sadnesses of the people who frequent, perform in, and operate the clubs, to far greater success. Because it doesn't rely at all on star power, it is therefore more impactful at portraying the lives of many disenchanted individuals all seeking a connection with another, however clumsily or sincerely.
*For the record, I do like Showgirls, but find it difficult to see it as secretly brilliant as many of you do.",4.5

"My first by Atom Egoyan, a film that explores the complicated intersection between sexuality, business, and emotion by way of the denizens of a smoky, mysterious strip club called Exotica. Every night, a sad and lonely man comes to see his favorite dancer, but he seems less interested in the conventional things a man might want from an exotic dancer and more interested in working out a sort of psychological issue he seems to have. Whatever his relationship with the dancer, it irks the club’s DJ, who happens to be her ex. When his unusual relationship to this woman is threatened, he has to resort to unusual means to find the catharsis he so desperately seeks.
It’s an interesting plot with several layers to it - I read that Egoyan was interested in making a film about the role played by strip clubs in sex-obsessed societies and it feels like he’s onto a lot. Reminds me of a particularly unhinged Reddit post I once had the displeasure of seeing from a guy who wanted a place to go that would essentially be Hooters, except that the waitresses are also his friends and his therapist.
I love the atmosphere of this film. The score is sort of mysterious and tantalizing and, for lack of a better word, exotic, and along with the design of the titular club (think ‘what if a Rainforest Cafe was also a strip club but also it was really cool’), it creates a really palpable mood that sells the story well. Solid performances all around, too. I knew very little about this one going into it but I liked it a lot!",4.0

"""Strip clubs are defined by rules that mostly remain unspoken but which are, by and large, uniformly accepted by all who enter. The ecosystem of transactional desire that exists within them is a perverse hyper-reality whose perceived and carefully constructed realness can be destroyed by the smallest of transgressions. Dancers and patrons alike engage in a dance of conflicting needs and shared denial that creates a collective dream space that can erase all evidence of people’s real selves.
It’s fitting, then, that one such club figures so critically in Atom Egoyan’s elusive yet beguiling Exotica, a film whose characters are all stuck performing an array of vexing rituals, and seemingly on a permanent loop. If strip clubs are meant as temporary reprieves from the outside world, a place to come to in order to forget your troubles your troubles, the titular Exotica serves as a more eternal haven, at least for the club’s MC, Eric (Elias Koteas), a young dancer, Christina (Mia Kirshner), and her regular customer, Francis (Bruce Greenwood). Their dances of deception last not minutes, but months, even years.
Egoyan introduces these and other characters in cryptic fashion, presenting their often bizarre patterns of behavior without revealing the events, impulses, or emotions that drive them. Even their connections to one another are shrouded in mystery. We sense an odd protectiveness on the part of Francis during his daily visits with Christina (Mia Kirshner), a young Exotica dancer. His relationship with a perceptive teen, Tracey (Sarah Polley), is even more disconcerting. Even though we only ever see them talking, we’re invited to think that she may be a child prostitute, considering that Francis gives her money at the end of each discussion.
But Francis’s somber tenderness is such that it suggests there’s a deep history between him and these women. He’s paying less for their time or services than their willingness to buy into his daily fantasies, allowing him to enter his own protective dream space. He sees these interactions as a form of healing, but after eventually learning the trauma and loss that he’s experienced, it’s clear that he’s reconstructing a false reality to believe in, like a customer does at a strip club.""

Exotica is cryptic, alien, enthralling and ultimately emotionally devastating.

It contains the same themes of trauma, memory and revenge. ""Everybody Knows"" except the viewer, until the very end.
Egoyan's direction is incredible, especially the music and the way it interplays with the dialogue, lights and characters' faces and movements, Exotica has a hazy flow to it that you can see in later '90s indies like Buffalo '66 and The Virgin Suicides.

"Surprisingly unrateable, at least for now. Like Sam says, it might straddle the boundary between actual and implied power, intelligence, and meaning. But it is undeniably powerful in the moment. It’s a gross cheapening of Egoyan’s construction, but his ‘bit’ of very belatedly giving us context infuses the film — especially the first third — with engaging momentum. It is dreamy, it is allusive, it is alluring. It is built with the one-way-mirror and the surrogate, with the gesture as opposed to the act.",0.0
"This movie is about the same age as me, and I feel like everything in it about the limits of emotional support in a society where virtually every relationship is transactional has only gotten more true in the intervening years...
I'm really glad I watched all of Egoyan's earlier features before I got to this one, because I think if I wasn't already attuned to the uniquely introspective atmosphere of his work I'd have had a harder time getting into this. But I still wasn't prepared for the leap in complexity - spent a large part of the runtime thinking ""how would you even think to write something like this?"" It's not that the web of characters is more tangled than those in Speaking Parts or The Adjuster - it's that each individual relationship within that web has enough depth and dimensionality to sustain an entire feature. But Egoyan the Director also has the wherewithal not to overplay his own script, letting much of the dramatic force come from observation and juxtaposition, rather than direct confrontation, and keeping things moving at a slow but inexorable pace that makes you feel, from the opening tracking shot, like you're being dragged along by a deep ocean current.

Why did Zoe want a child badly enough to partner with Eric of all people? Were Zoe & Chrissy more involved at some point? Did Eric & Chrissy date? If so, why did it end? Who did Chrissy think Zoe's donor was? Why did Francis replace Chrissy with his brother's daughter, especially if Chrissy was still in his life? Who killed his daughter?

"there is a distinctive vibe to Exotica (albeit does switch slightly towards the end) that I don’t think I’ve ever experienced watching any other film. I know that if I were to watch this again, I would be watching it through a very different lens, if that even makes sense.
The way Egoyan just trusts and acknowledges our ignorance in regards to the genuine relationship our characters actually share for the majority of the film, only makes the “tooth by tooth” approach in which he reveals further connections and information about them more rewarding. The non-chronological way this film plays out allows us to truly experience every interaction on a somewhat surface level, only to gift us with a more complex explanation further down the line; forcing us to reevaluate the way we previously thought, and watched the film (kinda like I was saying above with the second viewing being different). 
This really is a lot more than it seems on the surface; a slow-burn, hypnotising, erotically-charged, emotionally-driven, intricately woven tale; with some of the most obscure character plots that when they come together; just seem to miraculously click seamlessly, effortlessly.

"Pocas pero reconfortantes son las veces en que una pieza toca fibras internas en formas e instancias como solamente el cine puede, y pocas son las veces en que estas se valen de los recursos más puros del medio para lograrlo.
Una obra que, magnética y hechizante en su primer contacto, merodea la cabeza mucho después que descienden los créditos finales, y se siente incluso más vívida en la memoria a medida que transcurren las horas. Y que, como todas las grandes obras, transgrede su medio y se solidifica como una experiencia tan inmaterial e intangible, como subjetiva y personal.
Exotica basa su historia en una narrativa principal - las visitas de un hombre de familia atormentado por demonios internos y tragedias de su pasado a un club nocturno, intentando reconfortar su dolor en la imagen de la bailarina estrella del lugar. Narrativa que se ramifica en hilos derivados y confluyentes en la misma, que como un embriagante y cinemático telar hilvanado puntada a puntada, momento a momento, van tejiendo su carismática y envolvente historia.
Los diálogos se desenvuelven, enredan y deshacen de forma natural y genuina. Tanto los personajes como el elenco y sus performances son cautivantes y estremecedores. La cinematografía y edición cumplen un rol protagónico en su sutileza, guiando y construyendo el film, pero jamás siendo abrasivos en su ejecución. El trabajo de cámara, iluminación, encuadre y composición tienen como único objetivo resaltar lo más profundo de los protagonistas y su naturaleza, con un aura casi onírica, seductora y simplemente fascinante. En su apartado técnico, el film de Atom Egoyan tiene pocos puntos negativos que valgan la pena mencionar en comparación al todo que conforma.
Estilísticamente, con fluidez y homogeneidad, el film es francamente impactante - en el más literal sentido de la palabra. Su paleta de colores, la edificación estructural de su historia, el entrecruzamiento de líneas narrativas, y el acompañamiento de una banda sonora con elección de canciones que encajan a la perfección con la tonalidad buscada, no solamente otorgan un sesgo artístico notable, sino también asombran en su reminiscencia por trancos a los mejores Paul Thomas Anderson de Magnolia y Wong Kar-wai de Fallen Angels, con pinceladas de Malick y hasta del primer Tarantino.
Pero más importante aún, y más allá de sus gestos técnicos, su belleza y sensibilidad de profundo alcance se instalan como sin pedir permiso en ese espacio interno al que contadas obras tienen llegada, y ubican al film de Egoyan en un cómodo lugar junto a las entradas mas maravillosas que pude apreciar en los últimos tiempos.",5.0

I haven't fully unlocked all the pieces yet, but there's something striking about how it constantly pushes towards empathy and understanding. Notably, whenever there are more than two people in a scene, the mood is broken – we are all different people in different relationships, slightly off-center, and the film lives in that nebulous inbetween area of mutual feelings, and how they require us to perform.

Each interaction filled with subtext concerning each of them binding them together by the bounds of escape. All connected by empathy and circumstance. And each character is engaging in their own way and surprisingly well performed in the world of ethereal malaise. Coming off as confusing and perplexing in it's beginning. But seamlessly coming together by the film's beautiful heartbreaking end.
I went in with high expectations for this one. But Holy Fuck. Not hard to see the high praise this has gotten.",4.5

"My foray into the understated Canadian territory.
There is a lot to unpack in this one. Multiple viewing are definitely recommended.
The vibes are immaculate, incredible and interestingly refreshing.
>>>>>Score!!!!!!",4.0
In my opinion the greatest Canadian film ever made. A mystery movie which doesn't reveal big twists or turns in the way other films do. Exotica demands repeat viewings. It unravels itself in such a perfect way that by the end you understand it but are still questioning several scenes and characters.,5.0
"I saw The Sweet Hereafter, my first Atom Egoyan film, over 20 years ago now and was blown away. Somehow, I've never watched another one of his films in the time since. Thankfully, a fellow traveler assigned me this one as part of a film club we've started in a Discord channel I'm part of. Like The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica also deals with grief. But rather than being quiet and azure, it's loud and lurid. The title has three meanings, the primary being a unique jungle-themed strip club where three of our lead characters work and a fourth visits daily. It's a unique combination of plot elements that leads to a unique combination of feelings as the film proceeds.
While the ending twist is telegraphed early in the film, I really like how the film delivers information in drips. We're introduced to Bruce Greenwood's Francis as an accountant and a strip club patron and it's only as the film proceeds that we get to know him as a person and delve into his past. It's far more affecting than giving us everything up front. My only complaint is that I wish Egoyan had found a way to switch the order of the last two scenes. They're both good, but I found the second to last scene to be more powerful than the last and I would have liked the film to end on that image. Still, it's a powerful, unique movie with a strong visual appeal. I won't wait another 20 years before watching my next Egoyan film.",4.0
"elegant, mesmerizing, and haunting
i first watched atom egoyan’s exotica last year, and ever since, it has remained in my thoughts, even subconsciously (now consciously) serving as a benchmark for other films. it practically demanded a rewatch. the convergence of the disparate tales of grief and despair in the revelatory final act is masterfully done, and everything that precedes it is equally beguiling—surely a result of egoyan’s selective withholding of information, nonlinear storytelling, and elaborate mise-en-scéne

"This is a strange, quirky, little Canadian indie. It kind of plays like a puzzle, with Egoyan putting together the pieces at the edge of the frame first. You think the big picture is going to be very dark and perverse but it ends up really being very sweet and somber. I really enjoyed the lead up more than the reveal, the exploration of the appeal of the exotic and the other, the dimly lit noir atmosphere, especially in the titular club. Some good performances, Mia Kirshner is impressively seductive and it’s cool to see Bruce Greenwood in a role that’s so weird and intense since I’ve come to just see him as Dennis Quaid 2. Overall, a pretty good movie that ends up in a more wholesome place than you think.",0.0
"I know I'm a little obsessed with how films reflect their place in time, but I can't help thinking about how this feels like a very 90s movie in the way that it features a group of characters that seem scattered at first but which eventually all become connected. C.f. Short Cuts, Magnolia, Pulp Fiction, etc. … I wonder if they were all influenced by something else? Or maybe it just seems like a 90s movie because i's exactly the kind of small, human drama that was right in Miramax's wheelhouse — the anti-blockbuster. Sigh … remember when we all thought Miramax were the good guys?
Anyway, it's an excellent and moving film about people and their pain, motivation and brokenness, and even though a large part of it takes place in a strip club, it's way, wayyyy less prurient than it might appear. It's not a feel-good movie, that's for sure, but it's a move that has a lot of concern and affection for human beings, and I really liked that.",4.0
"Trauma from the past meets somewhat questionable baby sitter fetish in the most amazing way possible. A hypnotising and voyeuristic cinematic experience up until the final frame, 'Exotica', in essence, is a challenging character study and reflection; crafted through the experimentation of narrative structure and information, the slow forge of character dynamics and relationships, and the subtle yet impactful overarching themes ranging from obsession to guilt.",5.0

"Feels wrong to say this was among the strangest films I’ve seen in a long time but somehow it sort of was? I wish I found it as surprising as many others on this site seemed to but I will admit the final scene was pretty miraculous. I wasn’t aware Greenwood could actually deliver a pretty outstanding performance so that aspect was surprising. And even if it’s narrative didn’t totally overwhelm me emotionally I never once found it boring. The tone walks this extremely strange line between melodrama and minimalistic arthouse fair which is perhaps why I found it so bizarre. Tonally I’ve never really seen anything quite like it, I just wish it tangled me in its web more tightly.",4.0

"ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN 1995
The mysterious, monotonous world of a Toronto strip club is explored in this mysterious, monotonous movie from Canadian director Atom Egoyan (FAMILY VIEWING, THE ADJUSTER). The layers of the story are peeled away every-so-slowly, as the film discreetly expands upon the relationships between a patron, a dancer, and a deejay. The mystery-- and the promise of a payoff-- is good for about an hour, after which point the evidence begins to mount that there's really nothing waiting at the center.
This onion's hollow.
Grade: C+",2.5
"mmm, reading a lot of reviews praising this films handling of grief and interwoven storylines of each of our characters. I am a huge fan of films that slowly unravel and have obscured revelations that link stories together but I found that for a 103 min run time, a lot of things were quite messy in their realisations.
Grief comes in many forms, and so does growth and healing from painful/traumatic experiences, I’m not sure if this delivered what it was showing us very articulately + Although I empathised with the characters, I still feel a lot of the story unravels at the expense of struggling people offering more than they should because of these experiences that have linked these characters together.
Set design/ Sound + Music and cinematography are all very immersive but the execution of storyline and heavy handed dealing with some of the films central storylines leaves me feeling a bit icky, also during the unraveling of this the stories, some things come to light about characters that are never developed and imo don’t really serve any purpose in learning abt their characters more, so would have been interesting if some of these things could have bled more in to the storylines we are shown.",2.5
"Bruce Greenwood with color in his hair.
All jokes aside, this lowkey canadian magnolia is quite great. So refreshing to see a filmmaker be this empathetic towards people that american cinema would demonized and condemn for their inadequacies. A lot of moments made me feel icky to bear witness to, but at least they had something to say. A sensational piece this isn't.",5.0
"God, how this took me back.
I was near the end of my teens, I was so much more alive than I am now, and I was just discovering cinema as an art form. It was natural enough that I'd come to this movie as I moved along the racks at Rogers Video, especially as I'd heard talk about it as a risque art film and a point of CanCon pride for many of my country's perpetually insecure citizens.
When I watched it on VHS, I was captivated and moved, and I recognized Atom Egoyan as, at the very least, an excellent storyteller. I'm a literary type, I guess, and my entryway into serious movie-love was through a feeling for dialogue and story. (An informed love for the visual aspect of film--to the extent that it can exist apart from narrative--would come later.) One of the big jumping-off points for me was stylized plotting, as in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, classic film noir and, soon enough, the work of Egoyan. His work is a touchstone for me--as a cinephile and otherwise.
From the vantage point of 2020 (Christ, where did all that time go?), Exotica is déclassé in the extreme. After decades of mulish psychological opacity and five-minute tripod shots, it feels almost transgressive to watch an art film that moves fluidly, that digs into character, that acts as a disclosure of its director's deepest fantasies, that dares to try and actually move its audience. It sure as hell moved me; by the end of tonight's viewing, I had tears running down my cheeks, and with that sadness came a sense of rejuvenation.
It wasn't just the brilliance of the storytelling that had caught me back in (I guess?) '95; in this film (and, soon afterwards, at the late, lamented Ridge Theatre, Egoyan's previous masterwork The Adjuster) I'd recognized an artist who understood, and was possessed by, fetishism, trauma and voyeurism. To see onscreen, at the beginning of my adulthood, the ritualistic exchange of money for pleasure (I was a heavy drug user); characters with trauma-inflected libidinal distortions (I was coming into my own as a queer gerontophile); and oh so many repetitive displacements of feeling, all subsumed into a sense of a brutal past, a sad present and a harshly circumscribed future... It was as validating as it was revelatory.
So what is Exotica to me now? Like Elias Koteas's forlorn strip-club DJ, I've wasted half my life; like Bruce Greenwood's compulsive accountant, I have a tragic death in the family to look back on every day; like Mia Kirshner's embittered dancer, I ply a trade that both fulfills me and blocks me from my true potential; like Don McKellar's nerve-wracked animal smuggler, I live in fear of exposure. If anything, the film means more to me than ever--and that's a strange thing to say about a work that was so key in my development as a cinephile. With tonight's viewing, a circle closed back in on itself--just as it does in the film, with the accountant and the DJ joining in a return to the inciting moment of horror. What's different is that the hopefulness of the climax rings out more clearly--not in the parking-lot embrace, which seems a bit forced, but in Kirshner's act of disavowal: she closes her hand, refusing an offer of money.
That moment of transcendence is followed by the last story revelation, which I won't spoil in any detail. It comes in a heartrending sequence, and the film's ending--with the closing of one door, then another, is, to me, exquisitely painful. But I'm grateful for that pain--I'm grateful to be moved. Egoyan's reminder to the viewer that the past never dies, that life is a never-ending domino cascade of causation, and that we're all, as Norman Bates says, in our own private traps, is hardly a necessary one--unless, like me, you use art for affirmation as much as for discovery.",0.0
"I really wanted this movie to click for me. I love Egoyan's patience and visual style. The club itself is a masterpiece of set design and mood. After the methodical, cryptic build-up, it was a significant letdown when Egoyan finally showed his hand. I just could not buy this story; I was unconvinced by these characters' actions and reactions (and their tight interconnectedness), and ultimately I felt emotionally manipulated. I see how this story could have packed a wallop -- the visual language is all there, from the first shot to the last -- but it just didn't work for me.",2.5

The interlocking emotional beats of Exotica are housed within sleazy artifice that belies any sort of identifiable delineation between good and bad, instead pulling further and further at these specific pockets of winking melancholy without ever truly letting them break apart. The eroticism feels manufactured as an obfuscating force to tuck away the underlying tragedy... or is it the other way around?",4.0

"There's a very particular sort of erotic thriller that was popular in the 1990s and that I think this fits into this subgenre without being very erotic or very thrilling.
What I liked about this film is that it was full of broken people who we got to to understand through a gradual unfolding of their pasts - it's just a shame those stories weren't very interesting. I also think the film had ambitions to critique fetishization though I'm not sure it managed to do that. To me it still all felt quite male gaze-y.
I'm surprised by all the amazing reviews I read before watching - perhaps my expectations were too built up? Overall I think it was a bit dated and there was nothing about it that makes me think it will stick in my memory for very long after watching.

"The Forbidden Stage. I’ve seen several Atom Egoyan films, and while I’ve liked them all, I’ve never really loved them. This is the first one that managed to completely pull me under its spell. I think most people that like this will admire its bewildering psychological complexity above all else. So much so that you'll probably need more than one viewing to take it all in. The movie itself is presented like a puzzle, where each of the character’s deeper motivations are slowly unraveled, eventually revealing just how interconnected they all are to each other.
The main story concerns a buttoned-down accountant named Francis (played by Bruce Greenwood), who peruses a strip club called “Exotica,” where he comes to see just one client on a nightly basis: a young woman named Christina (played by Mia Kershner) whose act revolves around playing an innocent schoolgirl. Elias Koteas is Christina’s former lover Eric, and is the DJ of the club (and de-facto narrator of the movie) whose dreamy musings are meant to enhance the seductive allure of the girls. From there on, the movie snowballs into a veritable Mobius strip in its stunning interwoven complexity.
To me, the most interesting thing about the film was how nearly all the characters seemed to be putting on a performance of some kind, with their “collaborative partner” either acknowledging or rejecting it due to their own hidden emotional reasons. Of course, great focus is put on the performing stage of the club itself, where Christina flirts her act of forbidden visions. Egoyan has stated in an interview that the genesis of the film partly began from the ritualistic nature of strip clubs and the idea of the strict no-touch policy that patrons have to abide by. In this film especially, since everyone is putting on an act some level, the taboo nature of touching one of the dancers seems to be more about breaking the illusion of the performance, rather than any security, or personal concerns.
The atmosphere of this movie reminded me a bit of the films of Yorgos Lanthimos. The characters seem oddly distant to one another, which adds a cold detachment to the overall experience. Even though there’s a lot of obvious nudity and sexual themes at play, this is not an erotic movie in the slightest (and deliberately made so). In Yanthimos’s films, he mostly creates an off-putting, alien-like atmosphere to present a kind of surrealistic, stripped down abstraction of reality. However in this film, there’s an actual conducive reason why all the characters are all acting this way to each other and is not really made clear until the end.
This is a slow burn, and takes a while to settle in, and takes a long while to fully establish the complex relationships between the characters, but it rewards you greatly once everything all comes together. Some movies continue to grow and grow in your mind long after you’ve seen them, and this is a movie that practically demands that experience, as you probably won’t even fully comprehend what occured until you give it some space to think back on and perform your own post-reconstructive analysis.",4.5
"The day has come, folks. I’ve found something better than Trainspotting.


This is such an incredibly written story, with complex characters (all brilliantly brought to life by the acting)  and a style to the movie that feels so unique.

"Doesn’t really work as a thriller because for two thirds of the runtime the storylines are so opaque. Once it starts revealing its hand towards the end of the second act it gets a lot more interesting. The characters are all stuck in a state of emotional underdevelopment, which I can’t tell is an expression of a worldview, a vision of what is necessary to make an erotic thriller work, or just bad writing. Some of the imagery is good, but the visual sensibility is hit & miss, and the film leans too heavily on sub-par dialogue. Cries out for a visual storyteller like a De Palma. Frustrating.
Also, Elias Koteas’s haircut was distracting.",3.0
"When the pieces of the puzzle come together, what is revealed is more or less a tapestry of different traumas and needs. The film is working as a melodrama (not a bad thing) that is structured as a kind of trick box, with lots of brilliant details and elaborations.
It's a little like Magnolia but with the flow of information managed a little more tightly; Egoyan uses familiar cinematic shorthand and subverts it constantly. So the movie is defamiliarizing but I'll say that I don't think it ever feels like it's cheating.
What the movie is out to do is to somehow make these different traumas actually hit home, not feel abjectly familiar, and I think it does succeed. But sometimes movies like these feel like they're in an intellectual horsepower arms race: they're trying so hard to imagine what somebody else's life is like, and they don't mind showing the work. What I'm trying to say is that the different narratives feel richly and empathetically imagined, but also-- well, they always do still feel imagined.
Magnolia, to me, is like this as well. My quick take on that one is that PTA didn't take his characters seriously enough in Boogie Nights and overcompensated in Magnolia, before finding his sweet spot with Punch-Drunk Love.
This movie also might be trying a little too hard. If I think about what Exotica would look like as a novel, the most immediate analogue would be along the lines of Jonathan Franzen's Freedom which is, needless to say, not a flattering comparison. From a structural and thematic standpoint they have a lot of similarities, though Egoyan's film leans harder on unimaginably horrible life events and is a little tighter and more urgent for it. It's probably better to not be allergic to melodrama, as Franzen is, and then create an absolutely flaccid piece of art; Egoyan puts his characters through some shit but understands his form well enough to make the whole machine hum.

There's no second to breathe here, as we keep being fed small bits of information that keep you wanting to know more and more. Incredibly immersive thanks to its rich narrative and fantastic score, though not without its hiccups when it comes to having a bit much going on. You might get lost trying to figure things out, as many bits of information is kept and left for you to take a guess, though there's never a point where it flat out leaves you lost. I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with how this ends, but I'm pretty sure that I'm not supposed to be.",3.0
"It has been a long time since I watched Exotica, but I had no fear, as I do with so many films that I rewatch, that it would be diminished by the gap. Nor was it. Exotica was just as good last night -- watching it with my son -- as it was back in the theatre in 1994 and every time I have seen it since.
It is a simple tale told in a complicated way, a tale of normal people who are bound together by pain and empathy. Atom Egoyan -- one of Canada's greatest directorial talents when it comes to film narrative -- refuses to make the journey into their pain easy on the audience, and this decision elevates his tale (which he also produced and wrote) to a deserved place in the pantheon of Canada's best films.
The cast doesn't hurt either: a young Sarah Polley exhibiting all the intelligence and cynicism we've come to expect from her best characters; a slightly detached, mostly bemused, wheel chair bound Victor Garbor (in what could almost be called a cameo); an emotionally raw Mia Kirshner at her most chameleon-like; a brooding Elias Koteas, all disarming threat and menace; the nerdiest possible manifestation of Don McKellar as a sort of innocent but guilty bystander; and a deeply vulnerable Bruce Greenwood delivering his bravest performance at the heart of the tale. They are all excellent to exceptional in their roles, and as this tale moves to a quiet conclusion that solves nothing (in terms of the crime that catalyzes the tale) and only shows us how and why they are all bound together by their pain, their combined talents make it easy to care for characters that we could very easily dislike.
This is one of those movies I wish I had made, one of those tales I wish I had told. It leaves me melancholic, as if the world sits under a bank or rain clouds today. But it's a good melancholy. A melancholy of pain shared, of suffering understood, one that I know will clear when the clouds break.",5.0

I was expecting some neosexual club thriller and what I got was that toned down to a 2 and a man with a hairy chest and a club MC who looks exactly like Kenny Chesney. It was pretty, it sounded sexy, and the last 5 minutes made me rethink everything. It was also fucked up which makes me happy. Also one of the best opening credits of the 90s? Plants? Flowers?

I'm sure once I rewatch this the rating will go up, now that I can really appreciate the genius of this film. Also can we talk about the score for just a second??? Oh my god that score was gorgeous.

"I'm always amazed at how the most common DVD artwork for this film (even more so than the image used on this site) makes it look like an exercise in late night Cinemax carnality.
Now does it need to make it look like a movie about the human need for meaning, and redemption, or our desires to relive our traumas until they come out in our favor, or our passions to remain in something resembling a state of grace?
Or should the cover convey that film is essentially a gaze through a two-way mirror at an artifice that's meant to repeat itself over and over until it achieves an impossible perfection?
Well, that might be a bit much to fit onto a DVD cover. But something nice with parrots wouldn't be unwelcome.",5.0
"My favourite aspect was easily Mychael Danna's fantastic score (he mixes this strangely foreign instrumentation with Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows"" to brilliant effect) that builds up a lot of atmosphere within the Exotica nightclub.

Christina and Francis form the center but every component of the cast and each of their stories explore watching and being watched, touching and being touched, paying and being payed. Apparent and deeply felt, yet riddled with inscrutability. What to make of the perplexing, somber final scene? Or the abyss of an opening shot, panning over what might be real jungle at first and then is blatantly artificial--still, there's something untamed, something forlornly beautiful and fathomless.",4.0

Compère Eric (Koteas)
A movie about a seedy Toronto lap dance joint with exotic jailbait dancers, thats amazingly more of an inner exploration than exploitation. The film centers around various characters in club Exotica, a green grotto of perversion. MC Eric (Elias Koteas) has to reluctantly introduce his former lover Christina (Mia Kirshner) to perverts for 5 dollars a dance. Shes struck up a bond with Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a man who seemingly has a fetish for the young, only his infatuation may not be exactly what it seems.

Brilliant movie, with an interesting story that plays out in totally unexpected ways, and never plays to the obvious. It features great dialog especially from Eric whose perfected the art of morose introductions.

It is pretty out there at times, there’s a scene where a guy is walking around any empty strip club and waxing lyrical on a microphone to no one about what makes the innocence of a school girl so special (this sounds really creepy and at face value it sure is but something about the tone of this film makes it logical and mostly just unbelievably sad). The film is also gentle and tender. Everything is linked by this strange surreal tone (not like David Lynch Surreal it’s way more subtle that that and is really sort of it’s own unique thing a lot closer to someone like Kieslowski but also a couple threads stranger than that as well) so it all makes sense, all the threads link together wonderfully in the final 30 minutes.

"There is an artsy sensibility to this soft core porn movie that's understandably beloved by many film people, as they like something both arousing and then sad, when the sexy form is the sugar coating for the bitter pill of substance. However, i don't think this movie manages to come together in the end at all. The sob story of the sad protagonist is revealed as a plot twist to gain audience sympathy, effectively turning a sexy stripper movie into a story about grief and overcoming grief.
But none of the emotional beats hit - there is just something about the overly cold framing, the soft robotic droning of the dialouge delivery, the unsavory mixture of titillation and emotion that all clash together. The emotions never quite ring true. I never for once care for any of the characters. The story is told in a disjointed way with questionable details that better left in the cutting room, and the way the ensemble casts' lives intersect never quite make emotional sense beyond a neat narrative contrivance.",2.0
"I watchEd this and the Player today. You’d never know these were only shot 2 years apart. Because one/this one was shot super well and the other was shot like 80s sitcom.

All the filmy 90s color is beautiful and some frames really are virtuosic. 

The nightclub itself may be one of the coolest sets ever seen and shot. I wanna go there and explore around so bad haha.

"This is an interesting one. It has a lot of fascinating characters. Every time I was about to get bored, the characters would do or say something that hooked me back in.
I love the concept of Francis having Tracey babysit for his dead daughter. It's so creepy and sad.
I didn't understand the part where everyone was walking in the grass and they saw the dead daughter. Was it supposed to be some sort of weird funeral? I don't get it.
I also thought it was so creepy how Christina used to babysit for Francis's daughter, and now watches her do a strip tease in a club every night. Like, you knew this girl as a teen and now you are seeing her sexually. That's just not right.
While we are on this subject, can we talk about Christina dancing in a school girl uniform to the song Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen? It's such a sad song, I have no idea why anyone would choose it for a strip club. However, with the somber tone of the movie, it kind of works.

The irregular structure, the cut away or the switch of conversation just as we’re about to understand what we’ve been trying to understand for so long, the hansel-and-gretel breadcrumbs left all over the place left for us to piece the movie together, etc, has to be the film’s best quality.

"Atom Egoyan’s early work was a regular fixture on SBS Saturday Cult Movie night and him, alongside Hal Hartley, defined a certain indie cinema aesthetic pre-Tarantino. I remember Egoyan’s break-out arthouse hit Exotica (1994) being advertised as an erotic thriller, posters and video boxes using the imagery of Mia Kirshner’s character dancing in a school girl’s outfit in a strip club as if it was comparable to the post-Basic Instinct terrain of Jade or Showgirls. Finally sitting down to watch it after being recommended it by several friends, the film itself is not really sleazy – its eroticism feels very cold, distanced and runs throughout its ornate aesthetic and puzzle-piece plotting. 
Exotica is almost a chamber drama, focusing on a group of key characters and slowly unveiling information about them, asking us to shift perspectives and assumptions: from the haunted accountant (Bruce Greenwood) who frequents the strip club Exotica, the young dancer (Kirshner) who counts him as a regular, the pretentious club DJ (Elias Koteas in peak Koteas form) and announcer, and a nervous pet store owner (Don McKellar) who finds flirtation and more by offering free opera tickets to scalpers outside. Using occasional flashbacks and a slowly fed backstory, the overall theme is more about trauma and transaction, the way money is used to pay for services (and emotional or physical intimacy) or denies them, and the different roles played by people depending on another’s point of view. 
Even when mostly all is revealed, the final sequence raises more questions and things to contemplate in a masterfully oblique way. All the performers are great, particularly from Egoyan’s regulars like Greenwood, Koteas, McKellar, Egoyan’s wife Arsinee Khanjian, a young Sarah Polley, and Victor Garber. It has its own peculiar, strange tone, which feels both stylishly heightened and mundanely detached, typified by the way Kirshner’s dance routine to Leonard Cohen’s ‘Everybody Knows’ is performed and filmed. Viewed on the Criterion Channel. Recommended.",4.0
"Fantastic discovery. So sad and evocative, with Elias Koteas at his most slithery ever as a strip club DJ, with a serious voyeurism problem. 
Bruce Greenwood is the real star though, as a man completely heartbroken, trying so hard to maintain a carefully constructed, incredibly fragile fantasy that makes his life just barely bearable. What a performance!
Beautiful and stylish, the film is a mysterious and tragic mood piece that only slowly reveals the part each lonely person plays in the story. Worth a rewatch, or two. Or three.",4.5

"Atom Egoyan's mysterious drama unfolds gradually, allowing us to piece together the connection between a tax auditor, an exotic-pet-store owner, and an announcer at a high-end strip club. Even at the end, there are questions that remain unanswered (such as the motives of the person who gifts a pair of ballet tickets). It's almost Altmanesque, but with dialogue that is much more clipped and precise. A cerebral and serious look at jealousy, sexuality, and grief, it remains Egoyan's biggest “hit”.",4.0

"Tercera parte de la retrospectiva dedicada a Atom Egoyan en el cineclub del Helios de Palomar. Al fin una que me gustó. Seguramente tuvo que ver con haber pasado por otras dos del director que me parecieron infumables (Ararat y The Sweet Hereafter). Eso me aclimató a su tono denso de melodrama, que acá también está. Los travelings, la paleta de colores, los personajes misteriosos y pesados, a punto siempre de quebrarse, los flashbacks. Pero acá estuve de acuerdo con todo: la trama me interesó, los personajes me parecieron creíbles, y no una máscara triste sin nada detrás, la dosificación de la información no era un despelote.
De las otras había dicho que uno de los problemas era que Egoyan siempre intenta meter una docena de personajes con sus subtramas individuales, y que no los sabe manejar: hacia el final no te importa ninguna. Bueno, acá está todo muy bien pero porque desde el primer momento, decidimos que la historia del feo que contrabandea huevos no nos importa. Esa es claramente la historia supernumeraria, menor, que vamos a tolerar y concentrarnos en las otras... pues bien, QUÉ PASÓ CON LOS HUEVOS AL FINAL? Ni a Egoyan le importa, el contrabandista los pierde (se los afanan) a la mitad de la película y no los vuelve a nombrar. Pero esa historia era necesaria para que el fachero tuviera con qué chantajearlo. Y está bien: Egoyan, aprendé a soltar",4.0
"'Maybe you want it to slip away. The things that you think you're about to have.'
Intoxicating and hypnotic.
I adore Exotica. Very few films do I consider close-to-perfect. A skeleton structure and minimal script slathered with glances, sighs, memories, and mirrors. Exotica reveals so much more to me now I revisit it on the big screen in my 20s than it did on that Artificial Eye DVD in my mid-teens when I first fell in love with it.
It's perhaps the first time that 35mm has felt truly transformative for me. Visual pleasures on visual pleasures, fetish on fetish, one-way mirrors that reflect. But then again that's not what this one's really about...
So special to revisit a film so core to my cinephilia. I was right by the speaker for this at the ICA, which at first was a bit much but ultimately felt the most immersive and experientially 'correct' seat in the house.
Egoyan as a speaker (post-show online Q&A) is incredibly engaging - enthralling even. I admire his thinking all the more and look forward to seeing Seven Veils whenever it graces our shores.",5.0

"Olyan volt ez a film, mint egy lassú tűzön főzött húsleves, gyömbérrel, kurkumával meg sáfránnyal fűszerezve. Az elején úgy éreztem, hogy fárasztó manírkodás lesz, aztán a felénél már kezdett elvarázsolni, a végére meg minden íz összeállt: ritkán van ilyen, hogy egy filmnek az izgalmi görbéje egyenletesen felfelé íveljen.
Nem tudom, hogy van-e még egy kortárs filmrendező, aki ennyire a szőnyeg alá lenne kotorva, mint Atom Egoyan: a harmincas éveiben ő volt a tengerentúli művészfilm csúcsa, Cannes-ban ünnepelt és szarrá elemzett fesztiválsztár (nálunk is volt róla egy komplett Metropolis szám, amikor a csávó még mindig csak 38 volt), mostanra meg mintha teljesen el lenne felejtve, annak ellenére, hogy kétévente csinál valamit. A Where the Truth Lies óta nem láttam tőle semmit, az viszont, annak ellenére, hogy felejthető film, mégis emlékezetes moziélmény volt: az Uránia dísztermében volt a premier, a filmet meg elkísérte a rendező, illetve Colin Firth, aki épp a Bridget Jones-elmebaj csúcsán volt, és a terem emiatt majd szétrobbant a hisztérikusan lihegő negyvenes nőktől, én meg az egyik évfolyamtársammal, Ádámmal (filmjeim későbbi zeneszerzőjével) azt néztük, hogy szegény Atomot senki le se szarja, mert az igazi atomot (bocs) Mr. Darcy jelenti.
Plusz most így, az Exotica után biztos felkerül a bakancslistámra, hogy szeretnék együtt dolgozni egyszer Elias Koteas-szal. (Az Őrület határán, vagyis 1998 óta a rajongója vagyok, de ez a filmje sajna kimaradt. Nekem örökre a Karambol dilinyós roncsfetisisztája marad.)",4.0

"Raised as I was on the erotic thrillers of the early 90s there is a certain kind of night club sleaze aesthetic that is, no exaggeration, my absolute favorite thing. So, to stumble on a movie that distills that sleaze to such a crystalline purity in service of a narrative this uncynically interested in the complexities of human affection-simple as the transactions that mediate those affections may be--is like a mainline of the good stuff.

"The commerce of relationships, each flash of the dollar a little more painful than the last. The dollar is both the excuse the characters give and the reminder of the artificial reality created by those who hand it over. The final exchange of money between Francis and Christina (and the following shot) is so shot through with pain (and such a haunting prelude at this point in the film's structure as to their relationship to come) that I found myself breathless. And that final shot! Jesus!
Such a brilliantly, brilliantly told story. As the narrative became more literal, I was initially a little uncertain, because so much of its evocative imagery and elliptical tone would have been sufficient on its own.....but the persistent, unsettled feeling only became accentuated as the various aspects of the character's relationships to each other were revealed. This is such a rare thing - for the questions that a film like this raises to be better answered than left to the imagination. Each revelation only shapes the abyss at its core into more of a distinctive and terrible form, twisting the knife a little deeper.
So many turns this could've taken into being a ""headfuck"" kind of movie. It could've been abandoned to that abyss, and it might still have been a compelling and exciting watch. Instead, Egoyan turns it into something real, and, God, it aches for it.",5.0

"Josh:
It was with great trepidation that I ambushed Stephanie with this one, an old favorite that I hadn’t seen in twenty years or so, and that was only exacerbated when it started out with all those gross men (hey look, it’s Maury Chaykin again!) leering at all those exotic dancers in various stages of undress, seemingly filmed specifically to engage the male gaze, with Mychael Danna’s brilliant, sinuous theme drawing us in, and Eric’s sleazy exhortations egging the men on, selling them the illusion of power and control (for $5? Seriously?) but I knew it was a feint, a misdirection, in this movie about the lies we have to tell ourselves to get through the day, about the lies we tell others, and about how, in the film’s grim worldview, every relationship in our lives is transactional, which makes the club, Exotica, a pretty potent metaphor for that harsh existence, and what else would Christina dance to but Leonard Cohen’s hopeless anthem of cynicism and despair, “Everybody Knows”?
⏰⏰⏰⏰
Steph:
I don’t know what to make of this because, on one hand it’s annoyingly exploitative, like totally unnecessary close-up shots of women’s thonged asses, and on the other hand, I get that this is a film that takes place in a strip club where women dance in the nude for men, so shoot it however you want, right, but for some reason we’re supposed to feel bad for this one man in particular because his personal life is in shambles, but there were too many dead and objectified women driving the boring plot forward for me to care too much about the men—including the ridiculous DJ emo-babbling into the mic every five seconds—oh and nothing about the exotic smuggling ring or the stolen eggs or the scandalous contract-baby made any sense at all, why.

"Each character in the film is dealing with their own emotional baggage stemming from either an isolated incident or a collectively traumatic occurrence, and we see how—depending upon how these things affected them—they respond either internally or externally, by themselves or as a group.
Director Atom Egoyan masterfully withholds details from us, allowing us to come to initial conclusions as to what may be going on between these people for a majority of the runtime. There are sinister implications laden throughout that seem to be purposefully placed for the viewer to cast their own aspersions about what these people may or may not be up to.
The carefully crafted environment engulfing the darkest and equally complex spheres of human impulses is intoxicating, especially the dissonance achieved between the darkness of it all and the insightful poetry of the soul.
As the story unfolds, we see how wrong we have been, and how there’s no way to imagine what is really going on here, because the only way one would know for sure is to have experienced these exact same events themselves. To be shown this cinematically is nothing short of earth-shattering, and a damn fine example of transgression with a purpose. Even in the final moments, Egoyan exercises restraint, making the implications of Christina’s past and the final shot all the more harrowing.
There is something truly unique and radical in how it creates this completely artificial, transactional space of a lush, ambient, ""foreign"" sex club where real feelings of pain, loss, longing, and obsession take the shape of a dreamlike incestuous exorcism; a perverted form of healing via the intimate, fetishistic recreations and rituals of a deeply troubled father desperate to return to a home that no longer exists.
Sublimely filmed with masterful cinematography and very few cuts, Exotica takes a deep dive into the irrational side of human beings while following the director's patterns: vicious cycles, intended repetition, and juxtapositions between past and present, the former to shine a brighter light to the latter. Obsession, dependency and the psychological trauma of disguising the past with the present as if it still was is ultimately haunting. Magnificent finale.
Exotica explores two key themes: trauma manifestation and bonding, and human beings in a most primal, instinctual state, frequently as a result of this very trauma one or more people have suffered—sometimes connected, sometimes not. However, trauma is annular. Once the brain experiences a shock so prodigious, it is permanently altered in how it operates. Where there was once a way to escape from the pain of life, there is now an enclosed ellipse that manifests responses to this pain in a way that is unique for everybody, and someone who hasn’t experienced it cannot possibly fathom its depths. One individual may externalize their trauma, expressing it openly, while another may retreat from the torment that plagues every moment of their life via a carefully constructed fantasy. It's the transactional nature of relationships with empathy & curiosity instead of nihilist resignation or camp horror",4.0
"The name ""Exotica"" must have come with the western narrative of cultures other than theirs. However, the name Exotica will always remind me of Catinca Untaru. The way she pronounces Exotica in the Fall is unforgettable for me.
And somehow, the music that keeps playing in Exotica the club also has that Indian vibes haha.

This was my 2nd time seeing Exotica so I knew where the twists were coming but I appreciated the story better because I knew everything was layered in such a beautiful way. The payoff is well worth it. Great stuff

"Slow-burn, but exciting. Emotionally loaded, but slightly depressing.
Exotica is one of those films pulls you through nearly every emotion in the book. In all honesty, I probably never would have taken the time to watch it if it wasn’t recommended to me; But I’m happy it was!

The slow introduction of characters and information felt like a striptease in itself. This haunting soundtrack and quiet beginning wasn’t what I was expecting. The performances from Elias Koteas, and Mia Kirshner are what kept me watching, but by the time Don McKeller’s bizarre character, Thomas, ends up in a strip club with a wired microphone taped to his chest, it actually started to feel like an exotic thriller! Watching these very different characters all struggle with similar issues of existentialism and identity was fascinating. Each character carries their own unique perspective on sex and sexual matters which provides a fertile soil for all of this drama to spring up into. It was fun to watch these differing perspectives collide. 
The beautiful production design was well complimented by the creative cinematography which really brought the Exotica night club to life on the screen. There were a few really cool long takes where the camera moved freely and unexpectedly, like an all seeing eye into the dark corners of this twisted story. This film shows you that sick side of humanity that we all know is there, but everyone’s afraid to talk about; Atom Egoyan did much more than just talk about it.",4.0

It took a bit for me to connect the dots but once I did and I realized Elias Koteas was Casey Jones I could not think of him as Eric but thought Casey Jones left the Turtles to DJ at a strip club. That's head cannon now.
A very bleak and very weird look at misery and guilt, centered around the characters of Francis and Christina. There are some really uncomfortable scenes that don't come together and don't make sense until the end, so this may be one that gets better on rewatch. Questionable decisions made that need to be teased out as we learn the motives of the characters.
It's a thriller of sorts, but it moves at a dreamlike pace, where things don't seem quite certain until the end. It's definitely weird, but I think I liked it.",3.5

"One of the most transfixing new-to-me cinematic experiences I’ve seen in a while, Atom Egoyan’s Exotica thrives in its ability to remain engaging and intriguing despite its puzzle-box-like structure. The structure is hinged on a mysterious set of relations, but unlike the worst offenders of the 90s “twist-core” movement, the film’s final revelations don’t undercut the preceding images, but instead reveals deeper angles to the already compelling story. Sexy as hell & juicy throughout, I’m pretty impressed with Egoyan’s work between this and The Adjuster.",5.0
"Exotica is perhaps the exact type of film you need to watch more than once to think or write anything intelligent about it. So I’m just going to share what I sent to my friend after watching it in case it’s enough to convince others to give it a go:
Exotica man... so deeply, deeply fascinating. Probably one of the best written films I've ever seen. Its cyclical, ritualistic patterns remind me much of Phantom Thread, but instead of using the magical insularity such an approach creates to make a gothic fairy tale, Exotica lulls you somewhere between sleep and consciousness and keeps you there for nearly two hours. Its many, intricately woven narrative threads—and their focus on exploring character motivation rather than story development—is also very reminiscent of Phantom Thread and, truly, most of the best novels of the modernist era. Where Exotica ends up taking us with these threads in everyone's longing for connection and safety through eroticism is Lynchian and anti-Lynchian at the same time. Basically, Exotica is like most of my favorite art jam packed into one thing. Truly incredible",5.0
"A movie about the strain and emotions that come from women of all ages and stripes being forced to carry the emotional baggage of the men around them. Beautiful, incredibly directed, and quite funny.",4.5
"Expected an erotic thriller, but surprisingly got a grief noir.",4.0
"Some films aren’t about a mystery, but unfold like one. Exotica is that type of film.
An ensemble psychological drama, it concerns a group of characters whose connections seem anywhere from tangential to enigmatic as their lives bring them in and around an exotic strip club in Toronto. Over the course of the entire film, these relationships become clearer, but emotional complexities run deep. But Exotica is a film to be experienced, not synopsized. Any attempt to do so will either be insufficient or spoiler-filled.
Writer-director Atom Egoyan wanted to make a film about society’s “sexual obsessions” and the “collective sexual outlet,” but the film is so much more than that. It’s a mesmerizing, dream-like study of possession, obsession, loss, and grief.

Maybe it’s because the 90’s out of all decades of cinema is  my least favorite  but since I was in my late teens at the start of the 90s I figured I should have more affection for the decade. There are lots of great films from the 90s obviously but I find it the hardest to enjoy. That being said I found this movie unconvincing and pretentious. I really wanted to enjoy this and this was my 2nd watch aside from seeing it when it came out and I liked it less this time. It felt contrived and for a film so well liked it’s unfortunate I disliked it so much. The acting was wooden and the erotic elements were downright corny. I just don’t find a strip joint exotic and find the connection a bit silly and while I get the exotic symbolism in the film it just did not work for me. I had a similar reaction to another beloved 90s film Bitter Moon which I found hammy and heavy handed and comically bad. The 90s I guess I always felt like it lacked its own style and it took the worst elements of the 80s that the 80s made fun of and took them seriously. Just my opinion and while one cannot make broad generalizations in fact I wish I felt differently.,2.0

"Everbody knows. A paradise lost.
Das hypnotische, tiefschürfende Psychodrama ""Exotica"" (1994) bedeutete den ersten kleinen Durchbruch für den kanadisch-armenischen Autorenfilmer Atom Egoyan, dem damit ein wirklich starkes und erstaunlich reifes Werk gelungen ist.
Dennoch scheint der Film bis heute recht unbekannt (bisher hier auf MP nur sieben Rezensionen) und mehr ein Geheimtipp geblieben zu sein.
Für meinen Geschmack deutlich zu Unrecht, denn Egoyans eigenwilliges wie ruhig-meditatives Drama ist ein nachhaltig plättendes, ergreifendes Werk, das seine Wirkung bei mir hinterlassen hat.
Die Kategorisierung hier auf Moviepilot als ""Erotikfilm"" ist meiner Ansicht nach deutlich fehlgeleitet und erzeugt eine irreführende Erwartungshaltung, denn trotz dem ein oder anderen Moment mit nackter Haut (""Exotica"" ist der titelgebende Stripclub) liegt der Fokus des Regisseurs auf ganz anderen Ebenen und könnte nicht weiter entfernt sein von ""klassichen"" Erotikthrillern wie ""Basic Instinct"" oder ""Body Heat"".
Überhaupt ist ""Exotica"" auf allen Ebenen erstmal schwer zu greifen.
Von Beginn an Hält Egoyan seinen Film in einem melancholisch-schwermütigen Unterton, welcher die vorerst rätselhafte, teils episodisch aufgebaute Narration permanent subtil durchdringt. Ein nie konkret benannter Schauplatz (Toronto); die unterschiedlichen Figuren und deren lange Zeit schwer greifbaren Motive und ihre unklare Vergangenheit; dazu die zahlreichen ambivalenten, nie wirklich ausformulierten Querverbindungen und Charakterverflechtungen..
""Exotica"" fesselt dabei insbesondere durch seine tranceartig-hypnotiserende Stimmung, dem Schwelgen darin, den vieldeutigen, symbolhaften, mehrfach codierten Bildern und dem durchweg kraftvollen Schauspiel aller Beteiligten. Dazu tönt Mychael Dannas stimmungsvoller, verträumter Score als passende Klangkulisse.
Anfänglich wie ein unspektakulärer, episodisch und unchronologisch erzählter Mysterythriller angelegt, eröffnet Eyogan fortlaufend puzzleartig diverse Querverbindungen und unklare Verflechtungen zwischen den Figuren, beleuchtet in kurze Fragmenten und Anspielungen verdrängte Ereignisse aus der Vergangenheit, welche das vollständige Bild langsam aber sicher klarer werden lassen.
Bis final die wichtigsten Puzzlestücke zusammengesetzt werden und damit das ganze tragische Ausmaß des Geschehens offenbart wird, die nur so vor irritierenden Ambivalenzen strotzt, wo Themen wie Verdrängung, traumatische Erlebnisse, Schuld und der Umgang mit Verlust sich als entscheidende Motive dieser durchweg ergreifenden, dennoch gleichermaßen seltsam betörenden Geschichte erweisen.
Ein kraftvolles, aufwühlendes Drama, welches nie auf Pathos und große Gesten setzt, sondern mit intensivem, nuanciertem Schauspiel sowie einer hypnotischen Inszenierung fesselt und zudem mit einer cleveren, unchronologischen Erzählstruktur dem Publikum genug Freiraum lässt, um das Gesehene selbst für sich zu deuten. Fantastisch",4.5

Really impressed with this film. My only quibble is that a good chunk of the ""introspective"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. The narrative construction is genius and very gratifying to watch unfold. Most of the performances are very good--particularly Bruce Greenwood and Don McKellar. I was really into the film's music and extremely impressed with the production design. Every set in the film is so detailed and so telling, from Thomas's shop to Exotica itself. There's a lot more to be said about this, but I'll need to revisit it sometime for that to crystallize in my brain.",4.5
"Really surprised by this film. A fantastic narrative that has perhaps the greatest weaving past and present together I’ve ever seen in a film. This film has a really strong and strange atmosphere a lot of which has to do with the score, which is eclectic, bizarre, and just phenomenal; goes a long way in establishing the tone. The strange and complex characters, their dynamics, the worlds they inhabit are all so singular and fascinating. Perspective is played with in an extremely compelling way in this film, keeping important information from the characters and you as an audience member and withholding it to the perfect point, or never letting it be figured out. I love how characters are being watched without them knowing, listening without seeing, being listened to without knowing, etc. The dialogue is fantastic, characters are constantly asking each other really interesting questions that are often not answered or responded to with questions. All the performances are fantastic. The conclusion is perfect and reframes the entire narrative in a very interesting way. Got no complaints here, such a unique film in presentation and content, looks great too. Might raise the score depending on how it hits on rewatch.",4.5

"this is an incredibly compelling movie and i can’t believe I’ve never heard it mentioned before. its so sexy and so troubling, dark, lush, and gleaming. fundamentally this is a movie about transactions, about relationships that can only exist within strictly defined parameters, which depend on that structure and whose respective parties in turn depend on those bonds of mutual obligation, which are deeply felt but poorly understood. the emotional content of these relationships is not diminished by this form — it is this form that makes that content possible. this is also a movie about surrogacy and displacement, the transmutation of absence into presence, grief onto desire. the soundtrack by mychael danna is a strong complement, slick and droning 90s electronica with the samples from Indian music that were such a thing in the period.",4.0
"I have previously written about my distaste for the fetishization of the 1990s as a decade, both musically and in cinema. as the internet generation, we tend to prop up all these movies that feel so 90s and feel so dated in many ways. my first exposure to Canadian-Armenian director Atom Egoyan's work is one I had heard about previously but hadn't been shoved down my throat incessantly like other films (Se7en, Pulp Fiction, Big Lebowski, etc) of the decade. it debuted at Cannes the day after I was born and had the misfortune of being distributed by Miramax back upon original release. I don't know what contributed to it not being a movie that felt heavier on the public conscious, but knowing it was a favorite of many (receiving perfect scores from both Roger Ebert and Mike D'Angelo - the latter of whom rarely ever gives 100/100 scores) made it a point of interest when Criterion rescued it this year.
being marketed as an erotic thriller by Miramax with raunchy posters is a really funny thing to look back on now. I'm sure the film suffered some really bad home video releases that made it look very 90s as well. this new Criterion Bluray brings Paul Sarossy's photography to a phenomenal level, making the film look like it was shot yesterday. like Deep End, it relies so much on color to stand out. but not only that, its one of the most stunningly photographed films of the decade, alongside fellow 1994 entry Three Colors: Red. in Deep End, we see 1970s Soho in London stand out as a gritty, sleezy place with ravishing pops of color. in Exotica, 1993 Toronto looms over our titular strip club, with its bold neon and deep shadows in its interior leaping out at the viewer. Thomas' pet shop (next to a roti shop!) feels like anything on Bloor Street right to where anyone who's ever been to the Canadian metropolis will feel the sense of place perfectly.
I did watch All My Good Countrymen in between Deep End and this film, and while Deep End and Exotica served as the perfect double feature, Vojtech Jasny's film sort of fit in there too. it's a film about everyday people in a small town and their connections together. in Exotica, the town is not small at all, but instead Canada's biggest city. yet we get an interconnected group of people in this mysterious corner of Toronto. and the way their lives connect, the way this story unfolds is some of the most brilliantly original cinema I've ever seen. Atom Egoyan is flawless with his sense of atmosphere, literally bringing the music of Leonard Cohen to life in cinematic form (I wonder what LC thought of the film, to me it really just feels so perfect for everything he set out to do as an artist) while countering it with gorgeous outdoor shots. the script unfurls itself in a way unlike anything I've seen, making you think it'll go in so many other directions and then not. what many see in Eyes Wide Shut (a film I appreciate more now) kind of apply here, but this film is so much less about sexuality than it shows on the surface, and that's what makes it so fascinating. this is a film about obsession too, and how our memories can turn to obsession. it's even one of the best portrayals of dependency I've ever seen. dependency is very much a thing in day to day life that's somehow really hard to nail down on camera...it's often such an unspoken, honest thing that only two people understand. and in this film, it's done so richly, that when you meet the finale and that incredible final shot, it makes the entire film you just watched just click so brilliantly.
a perfect film, and a total masterpiece on first viewing. already have it playing again while I write this. one of those films where I feel like I have so much to say but feel like I've barely scratched the surface while watching.
two notes:
1. cool to see Atom Egoyan went to the Orson Welles school of sexualizing your wife on camera, but topping uncle Orson by having his PREGNANT wife be sexualized (and looking stunning)
2. Sarah Polley's phenomenal Tracey is the core of the film, and it was a delight to hear Egoyan confirm this in the on disc interview he did with Polley on the Criterion disc. she really ties the entire movie together and I think understanding this is the key to understanding this incredible work",5.0

"One of those movies that feels a bit like a mist that you walk into, just something that envelopes you completely. This is my first Atom Egoyan, and something that really stood out to me was how smart the man is about sound, knowing that sound effects can often be just as or more effective than a beautiful piece of music in building and maintaining tone and atmosphere.
And atmosphere is dreadfully important in a movie like this that takes some time before clarifying the connective tissues that make this a story rather than a collection of character bites. This should make for a tough sit, especially with how many gross said and unsaid things come at you right away, but it's quite knowing in being gentle where it needs to be. I was captivated almost immediately and only sunk deeper and deeper into the story, finding something to cherish in each performance and something to be jolted by in every scene.
I wish Mia Kirshner's character had another beat or two incorporated, because though she has some memorable lines they all kind of circle back to a dissection of the wants and needs of men - not a celebration of the male gaze, far from it, but very much a movie that's driven by and centres men even in rare moments where only women are talking. That is my only problem, Egoyan fairs better than most male directors and gets great work out of everyone regardless of gender but if the women had a bit more agency it would make for a richer tapestry.
But what a tapestry it is, regardless, one that seems always threatening to tear at the seams but never does, instead it oozes an abundance of things at all times, beauty, creepiness, sensuality, grief, humanity, yearning, danger and fear. I'd love to write a story that moves like this, and I'm extremely curious what experiences revisitations of this one will bring.",4.5

"Some people watch movies just for an easy time. They except all the answers to be right in front of their eyes and to walk away with it fully confident in what they watch. I honestly believe that is why some people have an extreme negative reaction to the idea of ""arthouse"" because it does not allow for easy answers. Then again I believe that no movie anyone should come away with when it comes to simple conclusions.
Now how does this opening section tie back to Exotica? It is simply because Exotica gives us the main answer and then everything else is left up to observation. The relationship between the DJ Eric and the main woman Christina is one that is heavily touched upon, a relationship that is shown with Eric's desire for Christina and his controlling ways. That is juxtaposed with Zoe, who is not only the owner of Exotica but also the mother of Eric's soon to be child. Why did Eric decide to do that to Zoe, that is a question the film never answers. However, the way in which the performances play off each other you can hear and feel the hurt in Zoe's voice when she sees Eric announce her desires for Christina in front of everybody in the club.
There are other questions that the film leaves hidden, the one I mentioned being my favorite one, but when it comes to the one question that it actually does answer, it is positively heartbreaking. The main core of the film is about how people can use very unhealthy and almost self destructive ways of trying to heal ourselves from pain. We project ourselves into others so that they can heal us. We bare our naked emotions, just like the women at Exotica bear their naked bodies, wanting some sort of closure, wanting some sort of conclusion to the pain and in reality it just never arrives.
Everything else with the positives of this film are the surface level elements. The acting, superb by everyone. The music, jaw droopingly gorgeous, calming yet piercing, and even when it is not the film's own score, the inclusion of Leonard Cohen's adds this smokey vibe that fits beautifully. Paul Sarossy's camera is THE piece of this cinematic puzzle that makes this film soar and be the work of art that it is.
To end this, I will go back to the topic of movie's answering questions. I will argue that many movies are about answering their own questions, and when films that are clearly structured to answer questions fail at their job, they show cracks in the spell. Other films are not about answering questions, however in some cases the questions are told in such a dull fashion that the audience is left wondering why would they ever want to answer it in the first place? But with a film like Exotica, it answers the main question, the core is answered, it is the rest that you have to figure out for yourself. And luckily, that main answer is tragic and thought provoking enough to at least start you on the path to understanding this wonderful mid nineties art house classic.",4.5

"Probably my favorite strip joint ever on film and that's saying something!!
Greenwood is a home run in casting and performance -- exactly what the movie calls for. Really nuanced script that kind of demands a rewatch when this hits Criterion (great cover). After just 2 movies Egoyan is the best I've seen at capturing Lynch and sometimes Cronenberg energy without just emulating it. His use use of deadpan for both humor and overall tone is especially great.
The Big Crone vibe is especially apt considering Elias Koteas, who is amazing in this, would play the same type of guy 2 years later in CRASH: an MC overseeing a little world he's barely got contained. Also loved the pet store subplot, which McKellar was also perfect for. Crazy how much more handsome he is in CRIMES OF THE FUTURE lol.
Kirshner was pretty captivating in a role that would have been pretty easy for the filmmakers to treat one-dimensionally, and luckily that's not at all the case. From the imported eggs to the birth contract the treads of the movie are both really intriguing and really tragic, and at the same time just the right side of sordid.",4.5
"A deeply brooding, deliberately cryptic meditation on grief, human sexuality, and codependency, Atom Egoyan’s Exotica follows the interconnected lives of four very different individuals, all of whom share a link - however tangental - to the titular strip club, where the intimacy of human sexuality is reinterpreted as a transaction, while in their own daily lives, they each cope with trauma and insecurity.
Egoyan structures the film not unlike a striptease, in that elements of character motivations and relationships are revealed in a piecemeal fashion, each layer taken off to reveal a new one underneath, while keeping other bits of information deliberately obscured. Egoyan’s style here is best described as “melancholic meditation”, as a sense of emotional devastation and grief weaves through the film, only emphasizing as we learn more about the distinctly broken, crippled lives of our characters, who Egoyan fixates on with an almost clinical eye.
Amplifying these characters and helping bring them to life are a truly stellar ensemble cast, lead by the iconic Bruce Greenwood. Playing a man traumatized by the kidnapping and murder of his daughter, Greenwood embodies a sense of plunging grief and shattered sense of self, his aching performance being a master class of less is more, as the only place he seems to be able to find even the slightest bit of emotional catharsis is in the confines of the Exotica club. Opposite, embodying an undercurrent of obsessive possessiveness and masculinity driven by self loathing is Elias Koteas, who acts as DJ for the club, looming over the proceedings of each night like a sort of dark master of ceremonies, his lurid provocations over the PA system serving as an outlet for his own repressed desires. Mia Kirshner, meanwhile, plays an ethereally beautiful stripper who shares a strange, symbiotic relationship with Greenwood’s patron, while having a past with Koteas’ DJ, while her own sense of alienation and aloofness is captured in Kirshner’s soulful performance. Don McKeller rounds out the primary quartet, as the nervy, repressed homosexual exotic bird egg smuggler who finds himself entangled, pulled into a world that is clearly alien to his own subtly paranoid existence. Other supporting players, playing characters that are hovering on the edge of our quartet’s world, are played by the likes of Arsinée Khanjian, Sarah Polley, and Victor Garber, also give similarly subdued yet intimate and multilayered performances.
Paul Sarossy’s brooding cinematography balances the blend of shadows and neon in the titular club with an outside world that feels lonely and isolating, while Mychael Danna’s score, which freely blends thumping club beats with Indian folk music influences and Western piano music ebbs and flows, furthering a sense of ethereal hypnosis.
Deeply brooding, Exotica examines grief and human relationships with a melancholic yet insightful eye, weaving a darkly powerful requiem, with few easy answers, but an undeniable, entrancing power of its own.

"I'm completely speechless right now. As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect indie movie. Everything about it, from its directing to its style to its writing, is so classically indie and so outrageously bold yet so minimalistic and self-aware. It is a movie that knows its limits, and I applaud Egoyan for that.
In just over an hour and a half, Egoyan creates this whole, immersive universe with characters whose histories and emotions run as deep as those in Gone With The Wind or The Godfather; if not, even more complex. Exotica is a condensed yet expansive melancholic mood piece, a sensual, atmospheric exploration of this coterie of disillusioned characters, each fragmented and haunted by their own personal demons and desires, as they navigate loneliness and seek redemption against a backdrop of what is ultimately loss. There are very few films that manage to tackle so broadly the dynamics of redemption, isolation, and tragedy, much less sub-two-hour indie films, done so in such a clever way as to give the entire film a purposeful veil of mystery. And for that, I yet again applaud Egoyan's masterful, airtight directing.
And the final fifteen minutes of this film are a spectacle to behold. So heart-wrenchingly beautiful, yet so intimately tragic.
(not to mention the film's status as a masterclass in building atmosphere - seriously, the lighting in this one is amazing)",5.0
"“Just because they’re exotic doesn’t mean they can’t endure extremes. It is, after all, a jungle out there, isn’t it?”
Realllllly liked this which is realllllly surprising because I reallllly didn’t like Atom Egoyan’s more Oscar-friendly film, The Sweet Hereafter. Realllllly.
It’s rare that you find a film that’s both a heavy-handed allegory and a viscerally grounded examination of pain, trauma, and healing. You can tell the allegorical aspects of the film to kick rocks, and it still works wonderfully. But when you can appreciate both sides of the film simultaneously, hot damn you won’t be disappointed.
And the music! Woooo. The enticingly creepy score is one of the best unconventional scores of all time. It’s clear from those slow, mysterious opening credits what kind of film Egoyan has in store, and the score never lets you forget it. The eerie music washes over you in waves, squeezing unsavory feeling after unsavory feeling out of you as the mystery at the core of the film deepens.
I wanted more resolution with Don McKellar’s strange yet endearing pet-store-owner-turned-exotic-bird-smuggler. He’s such a great supporting character that either needed to be bumped up to a true co-lead or written down so the audience’s focus can stay with the other characters.

"Unique and elusive in the way it’s trying to get you to make assumptions, and yet a little too predictable in its plot points. Plus I’m not sure the dance sequences are truly effective in what they’re trying to convey personally. The lack of close-ups bothered me somewhat given that a lot of these actors feel like they’re holding back over expressing themselves for the duration.

- Bumped up half a star after reading Bell Hooks’ essay from Reel to Real, which talks about how this film manages to thematically touch on a wide range of issues that weren’t immeditaly clear to me. But I still think it’s a little too predictable as an entertainment piece and that I wish there was more to Thomas’ story.",4.5
"Twitter Mutual Watchlist [14/37]
Atom Egoyan's Exotica is much loved by many of my mutual acquaintances and people whose film opinions I look up to, and while I did find it enjoyable enough I'll admit I ended up tending much more towards finding it ""okay"" rather than a hidden masterwork as such. Examining a network of characters centred around the mysterious strip club that gives the movie its title, we see the relations between them in one way gradually change in how we perceive them all the way up until the wham final shot (which is admittedly quite haunting and memorable). At the same time I do feel like the psychology of these characters remains quite surface level and doesn't probe with as much interest as I thought it was going to in the early sections of the film - props for the design and feeling of the club itself though which is a perfect environment for this film and the Leonard Cohen needledrop seems oddly appropriate considering.",2.0
"Far less sleazy or salacious than its primary setting would suggest, Exotica steadily unfolds into an affecting and erotic study of grief, alienation and dysfunction. Visually it's absolutely stunning, especially with the gaudy artificiality of the titular club, which acts as a veneer for the deep despair and loneliness of the characters inside it. The idea of layering over pain ties into the narrative structure too, where Egoyan peels back every barrier that these characters put up to uncover the central ideas of guilt and grief. Whether they're on the stage or wandering the neon-lit night world, everyone is performing, putting up some sort of front to hide from their demons.
I also love the recurring images of characters observing situations without being able to affect the outcome, really driving home the feeling of distance and isolation that lingers after the credits roll. The performances are fantastic - Kirshner and Koteas go suppernova here- and the way the film uses its ensemble is another highly effective way of covering its core ideas, uniting these incredibly different characters by having them provide what the others lack. It's not uncommon for erotic thrillers to cover trauma or disconnect, but it's been a while since I've seen one that tackles those themes in such an intense, comprehensive way. A totally beguiling film from start to finish.",4.0

"For the most part of the movie, its confusing as different characters go through their arcs parallely. I was just waiting for their stories to come together. Make some sense. By the third act it did. Surprisingly, in an almost perfect way.
I had zero expectations. By the synopsis, I was in just for the nudity tbh. But this became the movie I'm going to recomment everyone.
Its a slow burn. Peole dealing with loneliness, abbandonment. People stuck in life, looking for better future. Toxic relationships. Not leting the past go by. Too much to explore. Set in around the club Exotica. Francis visits regularly, asking a particular dancer to perform for him everytime. Her boyfriend, jealous, gaslight between francis and christina. While the owner zoe, is unable to let go the legacy of her mother. Francis takes advantage of his position as tax auditor to make Thomas get more information about his incident.
All this gears up in the last act. Before that it might be a bit slow. On the nose dialogues. Questionable acting but it concludes in a very satisfying ending. Be it in an open ending. Give it a try.",3.5
"Have been meaning to see this for the longest time since two of the earlier friends I made on this app (Coppolino, Shane Craig!) were always telling me how good this was. Glad to have finally gotten around to it, even if I found it a little hard to adjust to at first. The opening act I will need to see again as I think it was just an adjustment period to the style - the lack of ambient diegetic sound especially weirded me out, as did the Hal Hartley type dialogue at first - but I also found the final scene a little out of left field even if it was interesting. Either way, it feels like a film that will grow on me - it is so stylistic but refrains from being too showy or self indulgent much of the time, and the gentle pace made the third act come together really beautifully to me. A great film, especially in its cinematography (every time it cuts to Eric and Christina in the field, the colour contrast was fantastic) and the script’s use of rituals and repeated actions. Maybe the only film that has really reminded me of L’Argent next to Good Time (for its clear linking between money, emotion, routine and transaction of favours)",4.0

"My first Atom Egoyan experience, and a hard one to put into words - especially as I haven't written much recently and the couple of other reviews I read before starting to compose my own reactions already nailed it. I was intrigued by the plot, slightly irritated by a couple of the storytelling choices for the bulk of it - but then there was a moment later on that I found extremely moving (the parking lot confrontation) that mostly justified the stuff I took issue against.

"Based on the two films of his I’ve watched now, it feels like Atom Egoyan’s work is of the type some might call pretentious, at first glance. Once you’re a bit further into the film you get a hang of what’s going on and that what seemed to be your familiar “style over substance” actually works out for the film. Then you’re like a hot beverage during winter*. I’m also a sucker for directors casting the same actors for multiple films (mostly), so seeing this was the case after The Adjuster made me happy.

This is like a puzzle of a film. At first, it doesn't make sense. All these pieces are in play and you don't see the full picture. It can be frustrating at first, as you grasp at straws to understand why we are seeing what we are seeing and how these characters connect. But at the film goes on, the pieces snap together bit by bit and by the end there's a full picture that's pretty surprising and definitely changes the way you might see the film on a second watch.

""Plusieurs personnages se croisent dans un club de strip-tease, l’Exotica, dirigé d’une main de fer par Zoe, une femme enceinte... Plongez dans l'univers sombre et troublant du réalisateur Atom Egoyan.""
( Atom Egoyan est le réalisateur canadien derrière Family Viewing, et plus récemment Where the Truth lies avec K.Bacon et C.Firth.)
Une examination de plusieurs individus et ce qui les lie/liera, avec comme fond un club de strip-tease luxueux et très attentionné. On découvre ces liens petit à petit en les observant (comme ils s'observent les uns les autres).
Un film ayant fait sa pub (à tort) sur un côté sexy inexistant alors que ce qu'il a offrir est tout autre chose.
Avec Bruce Greenwood (excellent sans que l'acteur comprenne ce qu'il faisait), Elias Koteas (le fanatique d'accidents du Crash de Cronenberg) très bien dans le rôle d'un disc-jockey, et Mia Kirshner dans un de ses premiers rôles (carrière assez longue, mais aucun film emblématique).

eRotica by madonna >>>>>> eXotica,3.0
"It took me almost 13 years to get around to watching Exotica. Scott Tobias used to have an AV Club column about cult films, and in 2008 he wrote one about this movie. The first paragraph largely talked about things the movie was not: not erotic, not a thriller, not straightforward; not, ultimately, anything the title or poster would lead you to expect. I read that post up until the following line: ""Exotica was never going to be an easy sell, because to describe it in more than the vaguest terms would be to give the game away. (And for those who haven't seen it, please take that as your cue to skedaddle.)"" I took that cue faithfully and made a mental note to watch the movie before returning to the article.
In the 13 years between deciding to watch a movie and actually watching it, your mind creates a category for it, a container labeled ""Exotica."" The longer you go without opening that container, the more mysterious its contents become to you. This is true of any movie you go that long without seeing; my experience with the first 30 or so minutes of The Godfather was greeting each scene with the realization that this is rthe specific substance that constitutes the object known as ""The Godfather,"" the actual referent. If you're told, though, that the nature of that container's contents relative to its shape is a surprise, and that the revelation of that surprise is part of the pleasure of viewing, that mystery becomes supercharged. To put it more directly, I was really excited, to the point of nervousness, to open that box.
As it turns out, Exotica is the perfect movie to withhold from yourself until its existence as an object separates from what it actually is. Or maybe it was the worst possible movie to do this with: the slow and deliberate way in which it reveals itself might be enough to create the same sense of mystery for someone who only heard of it an hour ago. It's one of the only movies I can think of that withholds its own aboutness: we watch characters move through inexplicable cycles of routine, unsure what they want, how these actions are supposed to help them get it, or why we should even care. Paradoxically, wondering why you should care is what draws you in: with each repetition of its cycles (Thomas's ballet ticket flirtations, Francis' asexual table dances from Christine, Eric's faux-philosophical stripper introductions), Exotica brings you a little closer to some understanding of what it wants to show, or tell, you through them.
What emerges is a dense network of one-way looking. One scene sticks out in my mind: Thomas talks to Christina at his table, asking questions about Francis while he listens in over a wire, Eric staring unhappily at the entire procedure. Each of these players is both withholding knowledge and having it withheld from them, the knowledge gained from looking at someone else. Francis' presence is invisible to Christina and Eric; Eric's presence invisible to Thomas and Francis. Francis is trying, desperately, to access Christina's view of him, and Eric just as badly needs to understand the nature of the two-way looks that each other man shares with Cbhristina. The looking is made asexual through the perspectives of the gay Thomas, the paternal FRancis, and the pining Eric--I almost read the setting of the strip club as a joke on the audience. Christina (and Zoe) have as much access to one-way looking as any of the male characters. Of all the post-Vertigo, post-Laura Mulvey movies made about gazes, Exotica may be the least interested in gender.
There are some questions I still have. Why does Egoyan foreground Francis' insistence on making relationships monetarily transactional? Is it as simple as the hope that it might shield him from further loss? The nagging sense that it might be this simple, this beholden to movie-logic's causal character buildiing, detracts. But what are we supposed to take from the contrast with Thomas' insistence on removing transaction from his relationships? If the answers, or at least further questions, aren't there, it's a missed opportunity, but the chance that they might be is reason enough for a future trip through this system of slowly-revealed cycles.",4.5

"I've been trying for days to write a review that explains what's so powerful about this movie, and I keep coming up blank, which I think is a testament to how fundamental cinematic language is to the impact of this film as opposed to, say, the language of literature--though Exotica is also thoroughly literary, so much so that as I was watching it, I thought this was probably based on a novel (it's not). This is ostensibly one of those ""everyone is connected"" movies (the first one ever?), but whereas movies like Magnolia end up eventually going a kind of sentimental, mystical route in defining their characters' connections with each other and movies like Crash end up being unbearably corny in their eagerness to show the ripple effects of people's actions on each other, Exotica finds a way that gestures at the metaphysics of Magnolia (some of the match-cuts here feel literally transcendent in the way that they link otherwise disconnected people, places, and sounds) while also grounding those connections in some of the most precisely articulated material anguish I've ever seen in a movie. It's really hard to describe what this movie is about without making it sound stupid (""So, uh, there are these dudes who are obsessed with this particular dancer at a strip club...""), and I was initially skeptical of it as well. But the way in which it eventually finds compassion among characters who are all basically prisoners of themselves or of others is so tremendously moving, and on a purely plot level, the way all the disparate threads of the film eventually loop in to one another is exquisite and satisfying in a way that these kinds of movies generally aren't.

"Life is a family buisness, your line of work directly or indirectly passed down from your parents, even after they're gone. You inherit their store, or strange striptease show, they make you babysit for their friends, maybe you even dance for them. What if it went the other way? What if the absent child could pass purpose onto the parent, define their life for them from afar? What an abject terror that would be.
If this flow is true too in film, then Greenaway is Egoyans predecessor, passing on to him this urge for creating puzzle boxes that unfold to form strange, intimate world's. Atom's are, like his namesake, small, every figure connecting to the others, but also small in cultural ambition. Greenaway orchestrated operas, with lord and aliens as leads in his riddles, but Egoyan manages to make the pathetically mundane feel as strange and sublime in his.
Though that sense of tired banality is present throughout the film, the title means the opposite, almost ironically. Did he start with the term exotic, and spread from there to dancers, animals and baby grands? Is there meaning to be made from connecting the disparate threads, or is it simply a word association exercise? There is pleasure in seeing the pieces click together, but there are also some that cannot reasonably connect.
How, in such a mundane world, are we supposed to buy - and everything must be bought, the film tells us this- a world where seductive minorites stand in front of ballet shows waiting for tickets? If we didn't know any better, if we were one of Greenaway's aliens, would we find that any weirder than the world of Exotica itself, which this remixes? It's all just lusty men watching dancing.
Knowing better is key to this film though, and it's at its best when we dont. Egoyan, like a dancer, knows what to show and what to only suggest, raising the skirt of his story only in spurts and only enough to seed our imaginations. So these pieces are close enough for us to want to draw connections, the questions feel valid and approachable, but ultimately you cannot comprehend any of it. What is she thinking while she walks down the path? What is she walking to? What does he think while he watches?",3.5
"Damn.
With precious few characters in the film and even fewer settings, the director is able to create quite an interwoven tapestry. It unfurls slowly over the course of the movie, and in ways you don’t expect, all under the veneer of an exotic dancer taking a keen interest in a client.

"You soothed me.
This film is a structural marvel. With its multiple storylines, each with its own unknowns, it’s comparable to films that often get categorized as Messy yet Ambitious. The comparison only half holds water though, as Exotica is clean and exact in its execution. The intricate weaving of the structure is, itself, impressive and lends the film its authentic tension as a thriller. But what impresses further is the way the structure compliments the aesthetic vision. The brevity of the interwoven episodic segments lends the film its dream-like quality. 
Moody, sexy, atmospheric, mysterious, and foreboding. Egoyan is able to conform even the murky, algae-infested aquariums of a pet shop to his erotic, neon-charged vision. The film has a killer score and soundtrack (genius use of the Cohen song).
One-way mirrors. Reflections. Repeated actions. Mirrored routines and conversations. A film about our relationship to the other as someone like us and alien to us, as someone reflecting our own inner experience as exotic and endangered. A film about soothing, about the beautiful and the demeaning ways we use one another when “we did not ask to be born into this world.” A transcendent piece of art about empathy, human connection and cruelty in the guise of an erotic thriller. 
(Also, not sure if it’s intentional, but Mia Kirschner’s two dance numbers at the beginning and end of the film are reminiscent of the two dance numbers in Nic Ray’s Party Girl)",4.5
"As Exotica unravels itself, it slowly garners more and more sympathy and understanding for its characters. What opens as (seemingly) a cold, stale thriller slowly evolves into something much, much deeper. The film grips you, compels you, but it won't let you know where it's going. Each character starts as what seems like a cardboard cutout genre trope, but by the end represent a different way of processing trauma. I mean, just sit there and think about it: you've been all of these people at least once in your life. What's important, however, is that you don't recognise that fact until the end of a film because more than anything, trauma requires time. There's not a single moment in the film that allows the characters to gain sympathy, but rather it is the collection of our continuously greater understanding of each person's situation. That is, I think, Exotica's greatest triumph: the way each scene, each line, each cut builds on everything before it in a hope to better understand the nature of trauma.

Paralyzed, into silence
This movie reminds me of high school days, searching the cable catalog for the coveted ""N"" in the ratings tag and programming the VCR accordingly. Every once in while, one of these movies would prove engaging beyond my expectation. Eventually, I would get tired of holding my thumb over the fast forward button, put down the remote, settle in, and watch the movie. Exotica came out a bit later. I would have had my own membership to a video store by then. It still has the luster of the steamy late night thriller, but it elevates it to the highest art. Watching this is pure luxury. The filmmaking here employs the kind of economy of situations and dialog usually only seen in claymation. No frame is disposable.",5.0
"""It's not just Roger Daltrey that calls women birds!"" -- famous tagline
Good example of a movie with its narrative constructed in such a way that things feel very weird and very confusing for a good long while, although the flipside of this is it does something most movies would probably want to avoid, which is having you think the character it really wants you to feel sorry for and recognize the sadness of is probably a pedophile for the first two thirds. Conversely, the pathetic loser strip club DJ character is shown in flashbacks to have an incredible amount of game: The part where he says to a woman that he just met that he wishes he had a friend to tell about her is one of the most charming lines you'll ever hear from a character you've previously thought ""God, I hate this creepy bastard's disgusting face.""
The nudity/strip club setting probably did a lot of the work to make this thing find its degree of commercial success, because besides a young Sarah Polley, who you just feel bad for, most of the actors give performances that fall somewhere along a spectrum of inscrutable to creepy.

"""...but it is, after all, a jungle out there, isn't it?""
One could say the jungle is also within, at the heart of where pain dwells shrouded in tangled vegetation with no clear path in or out. It resonates like a low frequency through bone, flesh, and concrete, leaving a vague impression of its origin. In Egoyan's Exotica, characters navigate this vagueness as we watch from the dark side of a one-way mirror. We assume and we judge, but when the lights come up the mirror turns to us. What do we see? What brought us to this place?",4.5

"A character drama with intersecting narratives telling a broader story of how trauma victims create a strange ecosystem of invisible, shared pain.

This has so many layers of narrative complexity. The visual motifs were stunning. The dreamlike escapist cinematography of Exotica cut against the cold realities of accountancy. The mundane everyday. It plays it's twists very carefully and it's deceptive in the way it manipulates your understanding of characters and their motivations. You're fooled into making assumptions that are terribly misguided. We all do this in our own lives - project our prejudices onto others. Other people who are mostly just as wounded as we are and who are seeking peace and solace wherever they might find it. It's a tragic story and it unravels in a grippingly enigmatic way.

"“Just because they’re exotic doesn’t mean they can’t endure extremes. But it is after all a jungle out there, isn’t it?”
Exotica opens to a backdrop of exotic plants slowly panning across a wall. Lime-green credits emboldened on screen like the blood of these plants. In the word “Exotica” there’s a feeling of eroticism lingering in its pronunciation. The term itself being erotic. It’s through this exploration of alliteration that Egoyan alludes to the erotic nature of the film. He connects each character through exotic themes, each of them with their own story.
The titular strip club, Exotica, the most obvious example. It’s through this immediate connection that Atom Egoyan begins to subvert our expectations. Our perversities are implored through the opening scene, where we first meet our characters. Christina performs her schoolgirl routine to Canadian legend Leonard Cohen’s Everybody Knows, while Eric, the DJ, makes his voyeuristic narration.
Francis is introduced to exotic themes through the club, but also through his black wife. His wife is never given a name in the film, and her race is explored before she is ever identified. I feel this is Egoyan making another connection to the exotic subversions he has implemented into his film. It’s through his wife, and his daughter, that Francis is forced to endure the extremes of his life. Exotic themes are used to impose an idea of sexual fantasy, but later used to represent the traumas in these characters lives.
Christina and Eric are introduced to these themes through the strip club. Eric, with a tropical bird perched in every frame, and Christina with her legendary strip tease performance. Her trauma being exposed front and center, but revealed as a fantasy, yet again. Eric, narrating voyeuristically, exposes himself to the viewer as well, using Christina and Francis to soothe his own traumas.
Thomas is the most distant character from the others, but he opens the film, as he stands there under scrutiny at the airport, hiding the exotic eggs he is smuggling. He is tied in again to our central theme of exoticness. He operates an exotic pet shop, his fear and paranoia of his smuggling operation tie in directly with his homosexuality.
Thomas’ trauma lies within his isolation and loneliness. His traumas and coping mechanisms are shown through repetition as well, when he continues to pay for the tickets of attractive men outside the theater. He is confronted with homosexuality and the smuggling operation in the same scene, as the man he has sex with is the same man who visually inpsects him at the airport for illegal activity. In that same scene, his eggs are stolen and his traumas exposed.
Perhaps the most minor major character of the film, Zoe, makes her introduction during Leonard Cohen’s smoldering song. Her exotic nature expressed through her pregnancy, as well as her sexuality towards Christina. Herself, eventually exposed like the others. The loss of her mother posing as the detrimental trauma in her life. Instead of selling the club, she keeps it, reliving her mother’s routine in an attempt to find resolve in her death. Again, Atom Egoyan uses repetition to impose these ideas, initially showing them as fantasy, and peeling back another layer with each re-enactment of their healing process.
All of these characters are forced to face their traumas under the same circumstances, at the Exotica strip club. With even Zoe unable to take her own advice as she says to Francis,
“But you have to understand that Exotica is here for your amusement. We’re here to entertain, not to heal.”",5.0
"The final moments of EXOTICA left me in an emotional state as only a few films have managed to do. Atom Egoyan perfectly combines creative storytelling and outstanding direction with profound emotions while still leaving the viewer enough room for finding their own answers. The empathy shown for these beautifully written characters is breathtaking.
I can feel it. It will stay.",5.0
"A spoiler or two is possible. I’m no judge.
Government auditor, Francis (Bruce Greenwood), comes regularly to Club Exotica. Francis always sits at the same table, orders the same drink, and fancies the same girl, a young dancer named Christina (Mia Kirshner). Christina, always dressed in her school-girl uniform, comes to Francis table to give him a private dance. Frances, however, seems more comforted than aroused. He tells her that he would never harm her, and she dances away, her curly dark hair spilling over her white blouse.
This may sound like the setup of an erotic thriller—the production company marketed it as such—but Exotica is not a thriller, and despite the setting and the pretty young ladies, the film is not erotic in the slightest. Exotica is an intellectual puzzle so deep and profound it will requires multiple viewings to fully comprehend—that is, unless you happen to be the extremely perceptive type. What makes things more challenging is that Atom Egoyan doesn’t always organize the events chronologically. Often effect is shown first; later, after he’s unpeeled the onion some, the cause.
The relationship between Christina and Francis is at the film’s core, but there are other complex relationships as well. Club DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas), is Christina’s former lover. While Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian), the owner of Club Exotica, is Christina’s current lover—even though, oddly enough, Zoe has a “baby contract” with Eric. There’s also Thomas (Ian McKellar), whose pet shop Francis is auditing. And not least is Tracey (Sarah Polley), Francis’ niece, who babysits for him when he’s at Club Exotica.
If this sounds like a lot to handle, there’s even more. Exotica blooms with symbolism—for example, eggs and birds have special meanings (I would love to say more, but I can’t). Currency isn’t just plastic, paper, or gold—it can come in many forms. The film also ponders how a person can be perceived differently through different eyes. A person can be a lover or voyeur, savior or destroyer, brother or adulterer.
Exotica isn’t for everyone, but for me—I’ve watched it many times—it is one of the greatest films I’ve seen, and for that reason, it’s daunting to write this review. What I find remarkable is how well Exotica holds up repeated viewings. I’ve seen it enough that the intellectual puzzle is solved, and yet it never fails to entertain and intrigue. I think the film actually gets better over time; once I was over the comprehension barrier, which can be a challenge the first time through, I was able to indulge myself in the rich characterization, the symbolism, and the sensual details.
Exotica is a film about devastating loss—how it afflicts us. Do we give up, tempting as that might be, or do we go on, no matter the baggage we have to carry to persevere? In one scene, a character asks a question similar to one Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) asks in The Seventh Seal. This person is looking for some insight into the nature of things, perhaps the silence of god, and whether or not there’s an answer or two in the primordial soup.
One of the remarkable things about Exotica is Mychael Danna’s incredible score, which is powerful, sad, haunting, dissonant, and even exotic, as it conjures the Middle-Eastern sound familiar to director Atom Egoyan, who was born in Egypt. The music and camera blend together so well that Exotica becomes a sensory delight. The closing shot, in fact, is one of the most remarkable I’ve ever seen on film. The still camera holds its shot while Mychael Danna’s “The Ride Home” plays. The result is such perfect cinema—a moment so bleak, dissonant, and revealing—that it often leaves me in tears.
Atom Egoyan has gotten plenty of recognition, especially for The Sweet Hereafter, which nominated for best picture (like Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter is a challenging film). I particularly like Speaking Parts as well and consider Felicia’s Journey a good offbeat thriller, but for me, Exotica is Atom Egoyan’s crowning achievement, an experience difficult to replicate, at least outside the great auteurs like Bergman.",5.0

"""Exotica"", director Atom Egoyan's second film, is about what he shows, but more importantly, about what he omits. Few directors do something like that. In a broad sense, this dry drama that swings at the speed of a lullaby to a slow and lonely wear joins the divided pieces of characters who do not know each other, meeting the worst of themselves in a mutable and corroded world. Superficially, the film encourages sex to be thought of, but its content is indicative of everything beyond that, jumping into a cloud of dust that slowly falls on a title of eroticism that is erased once it is discovered that it is not more than the presentation of a broth of sadness and despair.
Beyond that, ""Exotica"" is a difficult movie to explain. Anyone who sees it will be able to keep asking what it means, how the conflict begins and where it is headed. Of course, I recommend that it be seen more than once, and I assure you that in each revision you will find something new and the experience will become deeper, but if you decide to see it once you can find a lot and I do not mean the mysteries of the plot but to the emotional journey that it provokes.
Egoyan has a privileged narrative. He wrote the script and I do not think there's anything out there that looks like it. His movie stays with you for a long time and even becomes annoying. This prose is mostly negative emotions and are concentrated in a flow that is not presented in order. The secret of ""Exotica"" is then what you feel when you see it. Discussions about the story will always leave gaps and this is the intention of the director. Then the attention must be focused on the feelings of guilt, rejection, pain, obsession, and despair that each of the characters transmit, in order to empathize with them and understand that the action of one affects one way or another in the other. They are actions of every day and in the majority, we are unaware of the impact we generate -- even the most insignificant influence on consequences that are not measurable and, in the spaces, that the film leaves, what is not known, it will not be known because this is what normally happens.
The title refers to a 'gentleman's club' that bears that name. In Exotica, wealthy men arrive every night to the show that is organized in the place. Women are beautiful, and their sensuality is business; they dance on the stage and if you pay five dollars they will be on your table, showing parts of her naked body and touching themselves. No, this is not pornography. Dancing and songs are the path used by people who seek an escape for their feelings that do not heal. One of the most recurrent attendees is Francis (Bruce Greenwood), who every day requests the company of the young Chrsitina (Mia Kirshner). He does not seek sexual pleasure, but rather the relief and comfort to lessen his pain. In the distance, Eric (Elias Koteas), who is D.J. of the place gets aware that between these two there is more than a connection. He spends the night cheering the atmosphere of the place, but he is upset with what he sees.
Alternated to this story, we meet Thomas (Don McKellar), owner of a store of pets, suspicious of obtaining some exotic specimens of illegal form. This is true, and it is confirmed to one of the guys with whom he has an appointment. This is a strange character, with inhospitable motivations and with an evident past that he cannot correct. He attends ballet events and seems -like Francis- to want to leave an unbearable reality. They do not know each other until one day Francis, who is acting as a representative of the Treasury, arrives to inspect his papers. Egoyan wants us to listen to their conversations, understanding how it is rather an interaction of emotions that they share and the words they express are more secondary companions. During the plot, we also attend to how they mask what they really feel, projecting not lies, but rather an honesty filtered, incomplete, of characteristics that are lost between their own world and the real one.
As for other characters, there is Tracey (Sarah Polley), the daughter of an anxious Harold (Victor Garber) who is dedicated to taking care of Francis's house in exchange for money. The representative looks for something like what he does with Christina: to be heard, to be understood, or at least to feel something similar. Tracey, however, is confused with this situation, something like what the audience feels when watching the movie. Something always is missing, and we want to find the answers. Another woman who is misunderstood is Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), the owner of the club that was originally started by her mother. She has certain intentions but cannot let them go. Like the rest, she hides too much.
""Exotica"" is confident, vibrant, and even extravagant in its elaboration. It surpasses the previous Egoyan movie, entitled ""The Adjuster"" (1992) and both his screenplay and Susan Shipton's edition are the reasons why this film is dedicated to whole talks and extensive analysis in universities. Its construction is magnificent in times and rhythm. The assembly of the puzzle reminds us of ""Pulp Fiction"", but it has its own style. The rise in his intense dramatic tone tear you apart between the confessions of the characters and their media options devoid of salvation. The music of Mychael Danna is literal and it drags you, as well as the photography of Paul Sarossy in the capture of reds, blues, and greens in a combination out of this reality - too honest and cynical to be able to assimilate.
Advanced the film, the connections between all the involved ones of which initially we thought were isolated are given. Their selection seemed random and it is not. They fall in the same direction. The story is sad, but it does not generate you cry, but empty. I think it's a more difficult feeling to deal with and the explanation is summed up in something like the mysticism of ""The Sweet Hereafter."" In both, the reasons do not matter too much, nor the clarifications -- it would be dangerous to know them. What is not said, what we do not know when we act and the impossibility of facing a bitter memory is what is relevant in ""Exotica"" and its mission, like ours, is to find the way for life to take on meaning.

"Exotica is a pristinely layered drama that just so happens to be set inside of a strip club. It's an ensemble piece telling the story of a group of seemingly unrelated or barely related dodgy characters who are all, in one way or another, broken or fractured people who are all driven, or have been driven to despair through their wants and desires.
As the film progresses, it becomes clear that these people all have more in common than they initially appeared and as the film begins to reveal it's secrets, it transforms from a seedy crime/noir into a quietly powerful drama.
I have to be honest here, Exotica blew my damn mind. Full of symbolism and cryptic dialog; nothing is what it seems on the surface and everything is between the lines. I could waste pages upon pages trying to pick apart the recurring visual themes or the psychology of the characters but I could never do it justice - it's just too dense for me to get my head around. You can't engage with Exotica, you can only let it wash over you.
This was truly a unique experience and I can't recommend it enough.",5.0
"Exotica es un notable ejercicio cinematográfico que por alguna razón no logró conectar del todo conmigo, pero que entiendo perfectamente por qué llega a ser tan especial para otros que la han descubierto.
A través de un conjunto de personajes, la mayoría muy bien desarrollados, Exotica nos cuenta la historia de como esos personajes se relacionan a través de un night club que lleva el mismo nombre de la película y donde a medida que se acerca al final, iremos entendiendo el por qué de muchos de los actos que suceden acá. Dicho esto, estamos ante un film que entretiene muchísimo, pero que para mí no termina nunca de arrancar y explotarse así mismo. Aún así no sé si llamarlo decepción o no, lo que sí es cierto es que me dejó con ganas de revisarla y poder tratar de conectar más con los personajes, a ver si ese final me logra impactar como ha impactado a muchos.
Demasiado hermosa Mia Kirshner, por cierto.

"I had literally never heard of this film until a couple of days ago, decided to watch it on a whim, and... it's really, properly good. Truly original, fascinating & engrossing.
It kind of has a similar tone to Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut - the erotic rendered unerotic - and although I didn't particularly care for that film, the tone of it was at least intriguing. Exotica however, manages to craft a story that I was interested in to go along with that intriguing tone.
It's always a great feeling to stumble across a gem.",5.0
"Vista en retrospectiva cronológica, aquí es donde Egoyan se empieza a alejar de sus obsesiones, y amplía el espectro a otros campos como el thriller, que hoy ocupa casi todo su cine. También detecto una influencia de novelistas americanos estilo Paul Auster, con esa cosa del azar y las vidas cruzadas. Aunque al final, cuando todo se resuelve, sigue siendo una película muy Egoyan sobre la familia y sus ritos, y sobre el voyeurismo como forma de aprendizaje y redención. El baile de Mia Kershner con la canción de Cohen sigue siendo una cosa mágica, un icono del cine independiente del siglo XX. Todos los actores están excepcionales, la música, la dirección de arte, con esa idea de que aún vivimos en una jungla... Todo es brillante y exótico.",5.0

"I have no idea why I once thought this to be an excellent film (or why others continue to think so). In fact, Egoyan is turning into one of my least favorite filmmakers (I also really liked The Sweet Hereafter and Felicia's Journey at the time, but now I'm doubtful they'll hold up -- everything else I've seen from him has been execrable). He's one of the most heavy-handed of auteurs, always finding the most blunt and inorganic ways to bludgeon us with whatever point he's making (like the belabored Pied Piper metaphor in Hereafter, or the teenagers in Adoration exhaustively debating a minor news event as if they're on some sort of CNN forum). Even the coy way he parcels out information does nothing to mitigate this -- Bruce Greenwood dolorously demanding, ""How could anyone hurt you?"" is risible out of context and becomes even more so retroactively, once we know why he's asking it. Egoyan's sober, stilted directorial style, almost reminiscent of daytime soap operas, also grates on my nerves. At times he reminds me of David Lynch minus the irony (and irony is essential to Lynch's purpose). It's not surprising that he's fallen out of favor among cineastes; what's surprising is that he was ever in it to begin with.",2.5
"I had heard from this movie a few times but i never really researched it or anything, but i recently read a review from this movie(Adam Cook's) that left me quite interested in seeing it. Then i realized that it was directed by Atom Egoyan a director i had seen only one movie from(The Sweet Hereafter) that i had not particularly loved. But the critical consensus on saying that this is a must see made me look out for the movie and here i am now.
Exotica is Directed by Atom Egoyan and it stars Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, Don McKellar, Mia Kirshner, Sarah Polley and Victor Garber.
""The 'Exotica' is a nightclub on the outskirts of Toronto, where Eric, DJ and MC, watches nightly as his ex-girlfriend Christina performs. Watches jealously, especially as far as the extra attentions regular customer Francis garners are concerned. Thomas, meanwhile and erstwhile, goes through a series of, um, interesting situations involving his pet shop, a gruff taxi-sharing stranger, unexpected tickets to the opera and smuggled eggs of a rare bird. Multiple story lines unfold in a splendid tangle of cutbacks, forward and backward references and recurring themes, all woven around the Exotica, its customers and employees. A calm roller-coaster ride of a movie, visually and intriguingly and emotionally moving""
I can definitely say that i was not disappointed with Exotica, i expected a different movie a movie that you don't see everyday and that was what i got, Exotica is definitely not your conventional movie.
I will not get into detail about what happens in Exotica, first because i don't think you should go knowing and second because there is not much of a plot but i would still have a hard time explaining it to you. Exotica is a very slow burn, you will have to be patient because the movie doesn't give every piece of the puzzle way. Exotica builds on that slow pace, but i didn't mind the slow pace because i mood is a very calm and almost hypnotizing one. The movie is beautifully shot, the visuals certainly have an hand on that mood. But the photography would be nothing without the fantastic score that the movie has, the score kind of defines this movie. Two words to describe the mood: Haunting and Sexy.
The acting is also good with Bruce Greenwood as the lead of the movie playing the intriguing, broken hearted Francis.
Exotica would be nothing without it's great Direction from Atom Egoyan who was once regarded as one the future great director but at the moment is in bad shape.
Exotica is definitely a unique experience, the movie is beautifully shot and score is fantastic but what makes this a special view, is the way the movie unfolds it's mysteries giving a bit at the time, teasing you and in the end the movie only offers a certain amount of answers, and that was enough to leave me satisfied.

"Una película que tiene como base la mirada.
Desde un arranque el espacio principal de la pelicula es un club de striptease en el cual solo se puede mirar, no tocar.
A través de la mirada buscaran tapar un dolor, a través de la mirada amarán.
Francis mira a christine que es el recuerdo más preciso de su hija, pero no la mirará desde el deseo,sino desde el amor, christine ahora es “su hija” no quiere que la dañen, el matará a quien la lastime. A su vez, Christine hará lo mismo con el. Sus padres la ignoraron y la desmerecieron, Francis no. Francis le dijo que era una persona importante. Francis la miró, sus padres no, y ahora el es su “padre”.
Por otro lado, Eric observará a christine la mujer de la cual está enamorado, pero no le corresponde. El no la tocará, pero buscara que quienes la miren la toquen, para de esa manera deshacerse de ellos, porque el es el único que la puede mirar. También thomas mirará a cada chico que invite al teatro, pero no tendrá contacto físico, solo los observará.
Pero la mirada es lo que ama y la mirada es lo que importa. Cada vez que alguien toco a otro ocurrió algo malo. Francis tocó a christine y lo echaron del club. Thomas finalmente estuvo con uno de los chicos y este le robo.
Las personas que miran ocupan el lugar de alguien más, de alguien o algo que ya no estáal menos de la forma en que era antes, alguien o algo que desean, pero no pueden o no se animan a tener. Esto también ocurre con la sobrina de francis, que ahora ocupa el lugar de christine como niñera.Porque la mira a ella y ve a christine y la mira a christine y ve a su hija.

"What starts out as a familiar story about the convergence of different lives reveals itself to be more about how these lives each experienced a singular traumatic event years prior and how each angle this event was viewed from affected them.
It ends up being less about a convergence of lives and more a collective explanation / experience of processing trauma coupled with empathy and acceptance. Found this to be quite beautifully done ending with an expectance of more healing and understanding than with a big or shocking climax.
The films main location (an upscale strip club) serves as the location anchor and its expertly filmed with a great use of vertical perspectives, two way mirrors and sweeping dance scenes.
Exotica singlehandedly made me appreciate the 90s more and realize that what I thought (for me) was a played out structure of storytelling just needs someone like Atom Egoyan to unlock its potential.
Also highly recommend the chat between Sarah Polley + Atom Egoyan on the Criterion disc. Gets deep into his intent, her experience, eroticism in the film, etc.",5.0

I think this movie is really well made. I just think that the cast is kind of stiff. I just kept thinking how every one looked like a B version of some other actor. The Casey Jones guy (Elias Koteas) is the bright spot. His creepiness captivated me. He's the perfect strip club DJ.,3.5

"His starring in an Atom Egoyan movie is how I learn that Bruce Greenwood is secretly Canadian. Go figure.
Anyway, this is one of those movies that I wanted to love much more than I did, but its general vibe is so intense and its purpose so interesting that I’m willing to settle for just liking it.
It immediately hits this pseudo-Lynchian dream state atmosphere and never quite lets up, drifting into this fake (and not especially salacious!) Toronto stripclub that only plays Leonard Cohen and whose DJ (Elias Koteas!) is a creepy freak who verbally assaults customers in the bathroom while sporting a deeply bizarre accent. It’s feverish surreality from the get, and it’s only slightly lighter once we get to Greenwood and Canuck indie darling Don McKellar each dealing with their own issues of secrets and loss. It’s a whole vibe and it remains strong throughout.
It’s a touch too quirky for me, mind you, to the expense of some of what it has to say about those same topics. The dreamlike edges impinge pretty hard by the midpoint of this thing, and it can be tough to reconcile the more “normal” scenes with the ethereal, almost detached oddities of the “present” (though yes, I realize this may be the exact point.)
The movie is pretty careful and considerate about offering you these scenes and then recontextualizing them slowly over the rest of the movie but explaining new things about their shared/individual backgrounds; this, maybe, is the point of the film, i.e. learning what we don’t know about folks, and what role that ignorance plays in behaviours and perception. I love this as a concept, but I felt like it slides a little too loosely amidst the arthouse weirdness to really clobber me with any truly meaningful sense of it.
Again, it’s just me, because this is a fine film that goes Lynchian without being too much, and I adore the central concept. I do wish the balance was a bit finer, but this comes down to personal taste; it’s a solid flick, definitely in the weirder side of the Canuck canon, and worth checking out.",3.0

There are dull films that have a satisfying conclusion, and then there are dull films that don’t. Exotica is one film that falls into the latter catergory. Honestly, this film was not engaging for one single moment. The only reason I’m giving this film a fairly adequate score is because of the performances from the whole cast and for Mychael Danna’s score. Other than that Exotica remains on the whole a empty shell of a film that attempts to evoke emotion in its last moments and fails miserably so, trying to make connections that are both far-fetched and wholly unearned. Even though I do praise each of the actors, the story being told is one that failed to connect with me on any level whatsoever, and so what you are left with is actors delivering great performances for characters you don’t care about which is a very strange combination. I struggle to see why the film gets the amount of praise it receives. For a proper erotic thriller go watch David Cronenberg’s Crash, it’s better on every level and also stars Elias Koteas.",2.5

"I didn’t click with this one, I’m not sure if it is because people say it is a masterpiece - so my expectations were a little high. 
I didn’t connect with any of the characters. The film was both seemingly trying to cram in a lot of backstory and none at all. Almost everything that the film was building up to, and revealed, was quite obvious from early on. 
The set for the club was well done, and the performances were good. I just felt that there wasn’t enough time given to explore any character that wasn’t the father. It actually really reminded me of playing the point-and-click Blade Runner game way back when, that also relied on vibes to make what was rather a flat game much more interesting than it was.",3.0

"A tent, dark red with two white stripes vertical through the middle, stretched between outward leaning poles. It stands atop a large green hill, and buffets in the wind. Such a tent was I, am I, in the gust of Exotica. It is a good film: a spiral motion, a reverse-action, in which all assumptions are made to invert themselves, in which every pair of characters contains between them a unique and potent tension. In this sense it is a very engaging film in respect of craft. The coil unwhirls itself, we are shown all of us to be fools. So fast we judged these paper men! And so the next layer, the contrary gust, a bag of wind. I realize Exotica belongs to a particular brand of North American filmmaking in and around the 90s. Of which we might also number: Magnolia, Short Cuts, American Beauty, Little Children. Some of these are good; some are not. But between them is the common structure of existential mutuality. What – what – could that pair of words mean? A shared experience of reality; an apparently diverse and irreconcilable cast of characters who are shown, in the final frame of action, to be existent on the same plane of angst, and worry, and whatever else. All these people, despite their crimes, despite their contradictions, belong to the same stream of experience. As such, they all have some functional relation to one another, not immediately obvious. But more incisively, there is unity to all these seemingly diverse interpretations of the world. The rain falls and they all feel it; we hunt the root of their personalities and find one large tangle. There is a neatness here that disturbs me. A whoosh that unhooks some corner of the tent. All things must glide into their righteous form and all these things that appear diverse, are in fact together; that all inexplicable or contrary action in fact derives from some common cause. In Exotica we swirl around the murdered girl; every mystery in the film distends from this sundering moment. All lines conjoin, all souls sing together, dissonance makes way for consonance. By the ends of these stories – and some of them survive as good films in spite of it – I feel the universe to have narrowed. In such cleverness, and such close alignment, we find our characters to have – in some degree – merged. One complex organism, with many heads. What is at first deeply perverse is then only inversely perverse; the viewer is herself indicted as someone too quick to judge; all things take their course, and all people react to the universe as is presented them. And so, the tent slumps, lacking a pin, and the wind howls on. But another bag, another whoosh, from within the tent; the tent takes off; the tent bandies about the treetops. Which is to say, in my musing about this film, some part of it is disquieting; some part of its rejects the universal chain of those final gelling scenes. The very end, in which Francis is sat in the car with Christina. In this scene I felt a prolonged angst. I had seen Exotica before, but so long ago that my memories of it are faint. I had some premonition, some imagined memory, that something unforgivable happened in that car. That Francis’ early ‘touch’ was not merely the repeat of a basically false accusation but the repeat of something more distinctly real. There seemed to be a tension, a hint, toward the untoward. But nothing happens, nothing directly; it is only a mood. Something in the pauses, something in the positioning of this scene in the film, gives it an uncanny rattle. Perhaps it is again a reverse-indictment of the audience, who layer back the erotic of the early film into this final scene. But it seems closer to the one-way mirror; that between Francis and Christina is a layer of glass and only Francis can see through it all the way. And we peer through with him; we are granted a retrospective insight. In a film of so many swerves this is the final, and the least explicit; this is the one that suddenly undermines a narrative that seeks to order a disordered climate. After all perversities have been lined-up and examined, this final bolt mutilates the study; we realize that what we understand remains a fraction of the whole; that things are not, and are, exactly what they seem. The music rushes to cadence, but one horn plays awry.",4.0
"The name Atom Egoyan tends to be whispered in film circles with a sort of fear and reverence. Suffice to say, I had expectations going into my first Egoyan film. Not that I knew what to expect, other than to see what sort of filmmaker could have that sort of pull.
Exotica is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants ride into the murky underworld of grief, trauma, strip clubs, and smuggling. Eric, who works as a DJ at the Exotica strip club, had a relationship with one of the dancers, Christine. Despite the past-tense nature of their relationship, Eric jealously eyes the men Christine gives personal dances to, especially repeat customer Francis, who seems to have a special connection with Christine. In his daily life, Francis is a tax auditor who starts an audit on Thomas and the pet store he owns. But when Francis is unceremoniously thrown out of Exotica, he decides to use Thomas as his eyes and ears inside the club in exchange for him overlooking some ""irregularities"" in his finances.
The film kicks off with an almost slice-of-life feel as it leisurely puts characters in place and gives them an understandable world to operate within. Egoyan uses this slow build to allow the camera to luxuriate, especially within the Exotica's cosy confines: Women in scant-to-no clothes on stage or dancing on the floor. The male clientele enjoying the show as they sit in their business suits and scratch at their business-casual beards. As links between the four characters start to fall in place, the pace of the film begins to accelerate and the thriller underbelly of the film takes shape.
The whole thing is downright dizzying, and in a way I can't quite put words to. It's satisfying from beginning to end. The way information is doled, the way characters are conveyed, it all hits. And I think it's because Egoyan respects the characters. They're given strengths and flaws that inform them without fully defining them. I think that's really hard to accomplish, something most filmmaker's can't achieve.
So yeah. Exotica kinda floored me. And I think it's very likely that I, too, will start to fear and revere Atom Egoyan.",4.5

"I can't remember the last time I was this out of sync with a film. Even Andersson I understand the appeal of, although it doesn't work for me. But here, the tone and the withholding left me totally adrift.
It started promisingly, but I quickly fell of the treadmill. I don't know what is supposed to draw the audience in - is it the mystery of what's haunting these people? If so, the generals are obvious pretty quickly, the specifics don't complicate much, plus the fact that Thomas has nothing to do with that situation unbalances the film for me. Is it the relationships? If so, the withholding kept me from investing in anyone. Is it the dream-like tone, a world of Leonard Cohen-themed strippers, rare animal smugglers, possessive DJs, and deeply unlucky tax men? That never quite congealed together for me. The third act started to come together for me, but then the final moments suggest the whole thing is really about what people get emotionally from strippers - ""I'm there for you, whenever you need me"" - and that was just not the through line that was apparent to me in the rest of the film, eclipsed by all the other business mentioned above and a circumstance that only works in reverse order - if you played this all chronologically I think you'd reject it ending with her stripping for him on a nightly basis.
I know that people love this but I genuinely don't know why, and I wish I did. I loved The Sweet Hereafter, so I'm not opposed to Egoyan's trauma explorations, but that had such clarity of character and context, while this was a fugue state for me. Hope to revisit in a few years and perhaps that time be able to sink successfully into the dream.",0.0
"""Just because they're exotic doesn't mean they can't handle extremities""
I just spent the tail end of a spell of joblessness too deep in my head, right in that uncomfortable space where questions of purpose and longing and conviction dwell. So naturally I want to attack it head on with one of the most thoughtful dissections of trauma I know (which I don't think I've logged before, oops). To this day, Exotica has the five-est star last five minutes of any film I've seen. Here's to the therapy of letting go.
Where more vibe-y strung out trauma explorations like Wenders' Paris, Texas use character perspective sparingly, ya boy Atom is so original it feels hopeless to catch up to his writing. It's always fascinating how the screenplay manages to be as much about Francis as it is about Eric as it is about Christina, or Thomas or anyone in this messy tangle of unrequited longing. You see the dysfunctional incely way of dealing with that in Eric and the more somber, coming to terms with it way in Mr. Brown, with a brilliant 2 minutes of role reversal when one contemplates murder and extortion and the other wraps the conflict with a secret he's let eat away at him for too long.
""Every time I seem to get ahold of something or someone, it's bound to slip away""

Maybe just weirdos like me find it soothing, but anyone must acknowledge how tastefully this out of order reverse dramatic irony lets you make connections at your own pace and decipher a web of relationships that's intriguing on every level. And my favorite part is how Egoyan makes you look for guidance in your emotions when piecing together the jumbled chronology. A brilliant exploration of the protectiveness, possessiveness, surrogate escapism and various types of pain that come when wanting something to touch or own or love, but factors beyond your control prevent you. It's good to remind yourself that what you can't have is part of life, and you're only in for hurt if you try to change that.
Assorted thoughts:
- Another Saab 900 I will argue is placed there intentionally
- Love the subtle things you can tell about characters from their cars, like Francis and his Volvo 240
- Considering the amount of real birds in this film it woulda been baller if they used a real turaco instead of the fake one at DJ Eric's podium
- Surprising how much more I empathize with Eric's ""I always felt I was meant to do something with my time"" field monologue as I've aged.
- Chrissy's performance song slaps. Scratch that the entire soundtrack slaps. Love Leonard Cohen.
- The way the sound design flows between connecting scenes is especially in your face, maybe thanks to the subtlety of everything else
- Eyy I'll put my pregnant wife in this movie and make it even better
- The lighting mirror play throughout the movie is INCREDIBLE
- Thomas Pinto takes it black
- RIP those hyacinth macaw eggs
- A rare Victor Garber role
- Francis gives a great talk on how we accumulate baggage in life to Tracey
- Also Bruce Greenwood has a magnificent Sam Neil x AOTC Ewan McGregor handsomeness to him
- Always astonished how this deep trauma between Harold and Francis is concealed till the very last pages of screenplay",5.0

Everybody knows.
I won't lie to you, my expectation was inclined more towards the mystery and the tapestry/appeal that the work exudes thanks to its protagonist, played by Mia Kirsher, immersed by the soundtrack and the hypnotic force of its images, and although those of course are its main qualities, what distinguishes Exotica and Atom Egoyan, its director, from other plastic and/or intellectual authors around drama, is its very effective and hermetic way of exploring trauma, cycles, pain, and its characters acting as projections of past events and those that bind themselves until the turning point where that space of refuge no longer exists, all as an emotional puzzle.
Exploring its characters to the surface in their daily suffering, and much of the soundtrack matches these personalities, apart from the aforementioned strip club, the film is emotionally complex and elegant at the same time.

"the whole time watching this it just seemed SO fucking odd like why make a film about grief and a father-daughter relationship but with an erotic plot centred around a strip-club?? it’s just such a WEIRD choice, like who comes up with that without some weird underlying paedophilic vibes….
when the ending unraveled i guess these choices made more sense for some of the reasons behind it, but it didn’t really make it any less weird to me. i think i understand why some people may like this film though — the characters and their psychological motivations are quite interesting — but i don’t think i could trust a man who favoured it, because at that point are you really watching it for the depth of the characters? or are you just watching it to see naked women and a schoolgirl strip tease? 
i get it, but i’m not a fan of it.",2.0
"for a second last night i thought i loved this. then i woke up and realized i was just swayed by the competence of its storytelling. yeah, good job throwing your scenes in disarray for maximum emotional impact, but after the puzzle is solved, what is the image left?
i can take a depressed miserable asshole protagonist, but a depressed miserable asshole ensemble feels like tourism, like emotional torture porn. its the illusion of depth — every character has a flaw that dominates their entire personality leaving not much space for any other aspect of human characterization. thats cartoonish — even if the tone is somber and arthouse, thats a cartoon built on human misery.
and sure, its well made, well acted, blablabla, but none of this shit is happening in a plausible domain of human behavior. again, i can accept one character being profoundly unaware to the point of rwordation, but every single character? and a lot of the plot requires that the characters are so emotionally midwitted to not realize, not only their own cycles of absurd behavior, but the absurd behavior of those around them.
in particular, the young girl at the center of it all, she's the character given the least amount of either agency or reaction to the absurd psychodrama around her; she's a walking plot point, a barely sentient macguffin reduced to some fake redemptive symbol. the teenage babysitter is the only character that reacts to any of this shit in a remotely human fashion, and her conclusion should have been paralleled by our female protagonist. yes, the last scene explains why she stays, but is there no part of her psyche capable of realizing the strange co-dependent circus she's been involved in?
in reality, like lacan would put it, people aren't this dumb. you take the average miserable guy or gal, give him a few pints, and they'll exactly tell you what's wrong with them and what they should do to fix it. the problem is never lack of self-awareness, which most people feign for sympathy; but lack of action, lack of commitment to an ideal. these people, all post-modern subjects, lack the capacity for either. and sure, That's The Real Tragedy™, but if you know that, why then write the moopie like you don't know already?
to be fair, i feel like 'the sweet hereafter' has got what this movie lacks. everything i'm complaining about here was perfectly resolved in the better egoyan movie, and perhaps watching it before 'exotica' gave me an expectation this earlier, more irresponsible movie clearly wasn't even trying to achieve.
its just everything almost too easy, like a movie about a bunch of drunks who fist fight then cry and hug. its just commiseration disguised as social insight, depression porn disguised as empathy, with a bunch of characters that behave more like robots programmed to suffer, than anyone remotely human. i can see how this may be compelling to the modern subject, but for me, this just sounds like my personal idea of hell on earth.",0.5
"Watching Exotica made me extremely tense, but giving it the genre ‘thriller’ would definitely be an overstatement.

what i was drawn to this time around was the way all of the women are the collateral damage in these men's lives, and how mia kirshner's character resists that. i'm grateful for how that story is told and what she brings to the part in terms of the sheer physicality of her acting. you can tell a lot about what stage of the story her character is in just by her body language.

"Exotica is the second best film to ever come out of Canada (aside from Denis Villeneuve’s Incendies). This was made at a time when Canadian cinema was going through a renaissance. You had the Cinema of Quebec, which to this day is still keeping Canadian cinema respected worldwide. But in 1994, you had the Toronto New Wave, which was a movement of close knit filmmakers like Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg (a major name inside and out of Canada), Bruce Greenwood, Don McKellar, and Sarah Polley who rejected the Hollywood aesthetic in favour of low budget, noir-influenced, darkly themed dramas exploring the underbelly of the city. These were filmmakers who chose to stay in Canada and develop the film industry here, and their films gained a lot of traction on the festival circuit, until Mike Harris (the worst premiere in Ontario’s history) cut funding and abruptly killed this budding film movement.
Exotica, the film that put Atom Egoyan on the map, is an erotic thriller set in a Toronto strip club. Focusing on a set of sad, disturbed characters weaving in and out of each other’s lives, the film creates an intricate web of what it means to suffer from loneliness, loss, and self-destructive obsession. Each scene carefully adds another layer to the story, like a puzzle being put together piece by piece. It is mesmerizing, showing that small, low budget movies can feel grand when they tackle universally relatable concepts.",4.0

"Eine Illusion. Ein Vogel im Zylinder. Oder ist es doch eine Katze? ""Exotica"" fühlt sich an als würde Atom Egoyan den Zuschauer durch ein Labyrinth führen. In jedem Gang, in dem man den richtigen Weg vermutet, liegt nur ein weiteres Puzzleteil für ein Gesamtbild, das erst am Ende Sinn ergibt.""Exotica"" ist dabei das beste Beispiel dafür, warum das Kino die Kunst der Form ist. Es geht im Film nicht um die Story, sondern wie sie erzählt wird. Aus distanzierter Sicht bietet ""Exotica"" eigentlich eine relativ banale Handlung, wie Egoyan diese aber ordnet ist worauf es ankommt. Durch die zerstückelte Erzählweise entsteht ein surrealistisches Meisterwerk, das genauso vielschichtig wie sonderbar ist. Mit dem besten Soundtrack, den Mychael Danna je komponiert hat und einem Opening für die Ewigkeit schafft es Exotica eine persönliche Charakterzeichnung umhüllt von philosophischen Ansätzen zu sein. Wie ein Tanz für Geld zeigt ""Exotica"" wie jede Beziehung lediglich zum Selbstzweck besteht, was auch immer dieser sein mag. Wie von hinten durchsichtige Spiegel weiß man von außen oft nicht, was der Selbstzweck einer Person ist. Diese lassen sich bezogen auf die Figuren des Films teilweise nur vermuten. ""Exotica"" ist aber auch eine Geschichte über Täuschung und Selbsttäuschung. Es werden Beziehungen illustriert, die lediglich aus dem Zweck bestehen ein gewisses Eigenbild aufrecht zu erhalten, da dieses nicht aufgegeben werden kann. Kontakt wird als Droge der Verdrängung der Selbstbewältigung etabliert. Auch wenn ""Exotica"" an wenigen Stellen etwas zu klischeehaft ist, macht dies in keinster Weise die einzigartige Seherfahrung des Films zunichte. Wie die Figuren des Films versuchen aus einem Spiegel ein Fenster zu machen bleibt die Frage, ob ich nun die Figuren des Films oder doch nur mich selbst besser verstanden habe.",5.0

"The best way to understand this movie is through Egoyan’s own description: that it is structured, in itself, like a striptease. It begins with a sort of intoxicating flurry of images and characters— characters whose desires and traumas are eventually laid bare. Sexuality is transactional and nobody is satisfied and everyone feels alone when the lights turn on at the end of the night. It’s a really effective compositional style, at once both erotic and detached.",4.5

"Kind of the Last Tango in Paris of the 90s?  Its approach to storytelling left its impact for sure, you can see its influence on tons of indie arthouse filmmakers since. As for my take on the debate over withholding info vs. spelling it out, I’ll say, while I don’t need you to hold my hand through the movie, I also don’t think you need to be quite as deliberately obscure as this either. Both methods have their pros and cons I’d say, I fail to see how this is some entirely superior storytelling method like some seem to think.  This movie is fine but as a matter of principle I really don’t agree with that.
Anyway, all that’s fine but in the end you are left with the same questions as any other movie, namely “what’s the point?” I would never say Egoyan doesn’t have anything to say, it’s just that, he’s asking not telling. He wants to raise questions for you to think about. I’m not sure this totally works for me because I just see the artifice and emptiness behind it. It strikes me as all provocation without any conviction.  Without the engaging storytelling style, it would be more readily apparent that he’s just throwing you a few half-formed scraps of ideas to puzzle over.  It’s a flavorful dish, but not much meat on the bone.

And of course exotica is a masterpiece, with each pieces laid down meticulously, and each layer slowly peeling off like an onion. The first half in particular is impressive, speaking to its audience on fundamental levels and evoke deep resonance and empathy, trapping these codependent characters and along with them the audience in a never-ending loop that almost feel as if there is no relief. I do think the second part tied things up a little too neatly, in a city as crowded as toronto, and with something so messy and untidy and totally opposite to the word neat know as ""life"" . But overall still very impressive and gut wrenching. If only we can watch the sweet hereafter at wavelength... too bad people aren't feeling interested enough to come.

DAVID: ★★★★½
Reviewed on The Movie Show, SBS, 1995. Review by Margaret Pomeranz.
Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan has had his followers over the years, with films such as FAMILY VIEWING, SPEAKING PARTS, and THE ADJUSTER. But his most accessible and possibly his most provocative film yet is EXOTICA. It's also his best. Without spoiling Egoyan’s enigmatic journey, let me introduce the characters. Thomas, a socially inhibited pet shop owner (played by Don McKellar). Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a tax auditor who arrives to investigate his business. And the characters at a sophisticated strip club called Exotica. The pregnant owner Zoe (played by Egoyan’s wife, Arsinée Khanjian), her most popular dancer Christina (Mia Kirshner), and the club's DJ Eric (played by Elias Koteas).
Well, the beauty of this impeccably constructed film is the way in which Egoyan interweaves the lives of his characters. It's not so much what happens, as who these people are, and why they are the way they are that's important. Egoyan’s visual talent is daring, assured. Production design is tantalizing. The music intrinsic to the mood. EXOTICA is an intelligent and confident film, which confirms Egoyan’s status as a major filmmaker. In terms of lap dancing, It leaves SHOWGIRLS for dead. David?
DAVID: It sure does. And I agree with you, it's a fantastic film, this. I think it's by far Egoyan’s best film. I've liked his other work…
MARGARET: So have I.
DAVID: But it didn't really prepare me for the brilliance of this. It's an astonishing, so complex. So, as you say, tantalizing, exciting, on all kinds of levels.
MARGARET: And the thing that I love about it is its compassion.
DAVID: Yeah.
MARGARET: You know, he cares.
DAVID: He loves the people. Yes, he does, indeed.
MARGARET: And to me that that's an essential element of great filmmaking, anyway.
DAVID: I think the R rating’s a bit severe. I'll give it four and a half.
MARGARET: No, I think it's a film for adults. I'm giving it four and a half, too, I think it's terrific.",4.5

"Where to begin with this beautifully crafted drama/mystery noir?
With a focus on a femme fatale protagonist, a shopkeeper who sells exotic pets whose involvement in the main story is mysterious in and of itself, a pining ex-lover of the previously mentioned femme fatale, and a client who frequents the strip club establishment wherein the femme fatale works and who has a seemingly odd obsession with her, the definite main character is questionable and unclear, a screenwriting technique that is difficult to implement and impressive when executed smoothly (a noticeable feature of this film).
Exotica provides viewers with an abundance of questions and intricate details and plot points continuing throughout until the very end, leading them on a quest of piecing them together tirelessly and without absolute resolution.
By the end, when certain relationships between certain characters have been revealed, one is left wondering, ""what about these subtle implications and components? How do these fit together and what do they mean?"", such being left to the viewer to interpret personally and assemble on their own after much contemplation and long after the film's end.

"This one is all-time. Truly floored by what I watched. A 5/5 movie that sits above others with the same rating in my archive. Profound, provocative, and powerful. Three things that I really want to see out of films like this. 
One of the many thoughts was this notion of the ""myth"" and its purpose. A myth constitutes the aspect of human living. Ultimately, constituting the reality we live in. I'd argue myth, studied alive, is not symbolic, but a direct expression of its subject matter. What is learned from these myths supply one with the practical guide to the activities one connects with. Thus, using myths as a rhetorical vehicle to position ourselves in reality. All of this becomes the foundation for treating reality as a myriad of stories we choose to live in.
Characters in the film, 'Exotica' all operate in the same manner. Positioning themselves within their realities. Both real and fabricated. Choosing which story to live in. All playing into Egoyan's themes of identity, catharsis, and fabricated realities. Most of the film's narrative shows characters operating in a pseudo-environment. Operating on the beliefs and assumptions for one reality upon another reality, a fabricated one. I believe that is why Egoyan employs so many frequent shifts in perspective and time--shifts that eventually lead the audience to understanding, and further connecting empathetically with characters.

Exotica is by far by best by David Cronenberg, it is psychological to an extent that you feel terrified and at the same time sorry for the characters' bitter and lonely lives which they empties at Exotica which is ""much more"" than a strip club. Intertwined relationships, abuse of the past maligns people's lives and Cronenerg documents all these issues impeccably in this film. The use of colours added to the pensive and depressing tone of Exotica.
Overall, complex, psychological and very very heavy.",5.0

"it’s heartening to find an account of sexual deviancy that doesn’t revel in its own wretchedness or evil, but rather chooses to see the best in its perverse protagonists and attempts to give a good faith account of their less savory inclinations.
pretty heavily telegraphed at every step, almost to the point where it feels like a genre piece. what saves this from being a pure detective story, however, is just how much stays hidden until the last 15 minutes. many of the emotional beats only work in retrospect, making the theme of intense nostalgia all the more powerful. i think maybe they should’ve leaned into the extreme obviousness of the motifs a bit more… the film only reaches this point with the hand (and maybe the schoolgirl archetype), where they mean so many different things to so many people in the film that the wires cross, refusing to be untangled. overall good but my least favorite egoyan so far. also pretty funny that the main love triangle all look like siblings.",0.0

Killer soundtrack,3.5
"We don’t really get movies like this anymore, do we? At least not without some flamed ego present that gets mistook for “style” or overbearing symbolism for the director to use his art as a soapbox for. Sex as a theme has been more perverted than the act itself. 
The intertwined narratives worked great working off of each other, might have been a four star if each plot ended as well/consistent as the main one. (E.g. The Pet shop owner who acts as the plots deuteragonist but isn’t given enough closure so the audience can’t really tell when his arc is actually over)
Nonetheless, it still accomplishes its main goal with the total plateau of suspense that the entire movie was building up to. It’s hard to criticize this movie because the payout is so worth it and by the time you reach it in the movie, you realize it couldn’t have reached this peak any other way both structurally and tonally. 
Lots of fluffed intrigue and tangible layers of grief. Great watch but just as realistic as any other world with $5 strippers lol",3.5
"Ah this is fucking brilliant. There's this brooding, dark, sensual sort of atmosphere to the whole thing. It sort of reminds me of Twin Peaks, but specifically the first season. Very Audrey Horne.
The plot is slow and subtle revealing information inch by inch. And without giving too much away the direction in which the plot is taken is a very interesting narrative choice. It's aged well and completely elevates the entire thing. I love how the narratives and characters intertwine through the common theme of codependency in dealing with grief and trauma, but in a way that flows and doesn't at all feel forced.
The characters all feel relatively developed and are subtly acted. It has an amazingly eerie score throughout the whole thing. It has fucking Vaughan from Crash in it. It has a fucking striptease to Leonard Cohen.",5.0

Exotica is not just a movie, it is a work of art. It is a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It is a testament to the power of cinema to evoke emotions and tell stories that transcend language and culture. I struggle to express why I love this film so much but the atmosphere is so mesmerizing that I can’t stop thinking about it. I look forward to my next watch and discovering more.

"Watched this on the Criterion Channel after the recommendation from a friend. Didn’t know what to expect going into it, but it was really damn good and incredibly gripping. It moves at a really slow pace, but it’s worth the wait to see how these unconnected characters are linked to one another. It has some really spectacular performances from Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, and Mia Kirshner. I especially love the atmosphere the movie provokes, and you get especially hooked once we enter the titular strip club. The ending, especially combined with certain revelations, hits really damn hard. I highly recommend watching this and going into it knowing as little as possible.",5.0

"Atom Egoyan is always hit/miss for me, but I think this is easily my favorite thing I've seen of his. I love the way the storytelling plays with the viewer's natural instincts to connect the dots on character motivation. When the final reveal comes, it completely recontextualizes the whole movie and what you think is going on. The performances are great; i've never seen Bruce Greenwood in something like this and I want more. The design of the Exotica club is amazing and I love the neo-noir look. The unsettling atmosphere works so well with the suspense and the score choice is perfect. Exotic dancing to Leonard Cohen music is something I ever knew I needed. There's a lot that's left unsaid and unresolved, but I like that this feels like a real world where not everything is perfectly wrapped up.",4.5
"Exotica says an awful lot about the complexity of human relationships. Rich with meaning and subtext, Atom Egoyan's erotically charged film examines the lives of several lost, lonely people, using a seedy Toronto strip club as its backdrop. Details about these characters are revealed gradually, with a sense of artful purpose, like puzzle pieces. Egoyan was in complete control here; he wrote a deeply layered script and brought it to vivid life. Each of the four central performances is stellar and Mychael Danna's score couldn't be better.",4.0
"This is a kind-of sad, kind-of horny movie, so you should watch it if you’re feeling kind-of sad and kind-of horny. 
Come for what you expect will be many raunchy striptease scenes and wind up focusing on all the mirror imagery and trying to make out what the birds mean (so much, all at once). Realize your mind is further in the gutter than the movie actually is. You’ll expect the worst but end up with something even sadder. 
I don’t know if this is a five banger, there is much to ruminate on and think about and I will probably need to see it again before I bump it up, but it’s right there.
Can’t recommend this enough, a perfect mix of arthouse, dialogue driven film and erotic suspense.",4.5

"On its surface Exotica is a film about lust but at its core, it is much more a story of grief and despair. In many ways it reminds me of Almodovar’s work, which I like not love, but the Exotica experience runs much deeper than than a layered storyline leading up to one big plot twist.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt so hypnotised and engulfed by a film before - perhaps august in the water [1995] - so on style alone the film would be a masterpiece. That effect is not solely a result of the fittingly hypotonic music and pacing of the film, as of equal weighting is the ethereal behaviour and actions of the characters. By no means is Exotica a reflection of real life, but by every means it’s a reflection of real life emotion.",4.5

La cinématographie et l'ambiance sonore sont à tomber par terre, et l'Exotica est un endroit complètement hors du temps, à la fois sordide et sublime où on s'oublie rapidement.
L'intrigue est - certes- en deux temps, et j'ai un peu vu du Magnolia dans la première partie du film où on va suivre des personnages un peu partout, sans forcément que la narration nous guide trop vers un développement de l'histoire. J'ai trouvé ça vraiment agréable, et encore une fois toute la cinématographie, la photo et les dialogues sont CAPTIVANTS on a juste envie que ça continue comme ça tout du long.

"If it wasn't for the Criterion artwork, I wouldn't have discovered this perfect dark imaginative uncanny arthouse.
Setting. Exotica. The last place on earth. Or for at least two heavily scarred individuals.
The structure is insanely inventive and heartbreakingly deceitful, not to mention kind of Lynchian in its delivery, especially at the beginning. Its atypical first half feels so surreal and chaotic that when everything started to get darker and real, the horror easily became all the more effective and intense. Bruce Greenwood gives a genuinely scary Sam Neill-esque in Possession (1981) performance while Mia Kirshner gives her absolute A-game depicting a troubled exotic dancer who finds a new home in a Toronto strip club. Their slowly unveiled history brought them to where they are right at that moment. Their strange one-of-a-kind mutual dependency makes Exotica a deeply emotional and unforgettable watch.

"How is pornography treated in modern society? If you use the p-word, a million negative connotations become attached to it in any context. It's a disease, we would all think in unison. It perpetrates the unhealthy expectations of men, objectifying women as lesser than or as thankless servants of the opposite sex. It's an addiction, eroding the minds of young men with doses of dopamine far beyond natural capacity until they cannot feel a thing. It's a menace to society and its prevalent presence and the harm it causes are the faults of man. If only he would stop looking at those fake women on the screen, those pixels that give no real thought to his existence, then relationships would strengthen. If he could just stop wanting sex for one second, things could heal.
When I was coming out of a castigating religious system, so puritan in its principles that the mere mental image of a disrobed woman was a stain on the soul, I realized how complex and misjudged pornography addiction was. Men want nothing more than to be looked at, as complete sexual beings, with eyes of acceptance. We want women to adore and delight in our yearning for them, to receive the highest pleasure from our worshipful gaze in the knowledge that they are the most desired beings on this entire planet.
Phrases like ""He's just a typical man with a one-track mind"" and other disgusted derisions of man's simplicity have driven more men to pornography addiction than physical lust ever could. In pornography, there are no expectations. There is no disgust at the idea that a man's mind is on sex. The women love him for it. At that time in my life, I was indulging in various forms of pornography because I wasn't condemned there. No preacher was scowling down, demanding a purity I could never reach. There was only a woman, smiling with glee as she danced, teased, and stripped for me. I was enough for her. She was the God I wanted.
This beautifully thoughtful film touches upon the same ideas with profound empathy. Exotica is a lavish strip club and men from all walks of life, from broken and wealthy backgrounds, come to watch women smile and seductively dance for them. They know it's fake and out of reach. It's monetary and strictly business (sometimes, unfortunately, a really harmful one). Yet, those words of affection and glances of joyful approval heal, if but for a moment.
But a soul who truly understands, who truly hears, who truly loves us even as we're soldiering towards Damascus, spear in our hand or gun at our side? Well, that would be a powerful saviour.",4.5

"“You know that feeling when you think you didn’t ask to be brought into this world? Then who did? And now that you’re here who’s asking you to stay?”

It’s difficult to describe the feeling of watching this movie. At times, it feels like the oft-told story of broken men, men who are apparitions of masculinity haunting themselves. Each man in this film has (or at least they think they have) failed, Thomas is struggling to keep up his father’s smuggling operation due to his cowardice and incompetence, Eric has let the one person that gave his life meaning slip away and spends his time being envious of those who pay for her time, and Francis, we find, feels that he failed in his duty to protect his family and has lost himself in a world constructed of his delusions. All of them are armed with only the most self-destructive ways of dealing with their failures. 
“…we are here to entertain, not to heal.”
But then, it is also a bit of a meta commentary about art and the relationship we have to it. The film presents an interesting question: are we just envious cowards who come to cinema because we could not face the pain of reality?
The answer to me is: yea for sure lmao
Beyond all this, it’s a really interesting, intoxicating rather, nocturnal ride through the Toronto streets with gorgeous lighting and compositions. Mia Kirshner makes my heart burn a hole through my sternum. The characters’ stories reveal themselves slowly, and then all at once, just like when you down the last drink of a night spent alone.

"I knew nothing about this movie going into it, so the fact that it was so damn good was awesome. This movie went crazy. It has some of the best atmosphere and tone I’ve ever seen in a film; the lighting, the set design (specifically the strip club itself), and the incredible music give a compelling, captivating, and really mystifying feel to this film. A lot of what happens in this film is so different, in terms of the types of characters and the specific events that occur, they’re not things one generally sees in film. One thing that my friends and I discussed when we watched this film is the way it experiments with perspective. The entire film includes scenarios where the characters, the audience, or both are not given the full picture of what is happening; information is withheld. Characters are watched without knowing they’re being watched, characters are listened to without knowing they’re being listened to, characters speak to people without knowing to whom they’re speaking. And we, the audience, also don’t really know what’s going on until the very end of the film. It’s a very interesting directional choice, I’ve never seen it before but I really liked it. 
In terms of narrative, Exotica was masterfully crafted, Egoyan is able to weave together all these threads so well and presents them in such an interesting, non-chronological way. We’re left in the dark for much of the film, but the reveal at the end is jaw-dropping and haunting. I actually couldn’t believe the ending, and the final shot of the film is fire, it essentially says “okay, we’ve finally revealed the last pieces of the puzzle, now you have to sit in it.” It makes you rethink the entire rest of the story. The performances are fantastic, I thought Greenwood and Koteas killed it especially. The character of Francis is one of the strangest I’ve ever seen, bro is literally a psycho but it’s so interesting to observe his current deprivation when compared to his normal self in the flashbacks. The way the movie presents his denial through his depraved rituals was fascinating and thought-provoking, but also the way it subverts expectations by having Francis hug Eric rather than shoot him is a brilliant and impactful choice. I also thought Thomas was an interesting moral foil to Francis’ immorality. Overall just an amazing movie, so much good to say about it and so many unique aspects. I’d highly recommend this to anyone.",4.5

"Went in completely blind, and knew this was going to rule visually from the first shot. I was expecting this to be a bit more surreal, so when it ended up pretty plot driven that was a surprise. That’s not say the film isn’t incredibly atmospheric, and it is pretty interesting how the story here isn’t at all what you think it is from the start. Even though it is neatly plotted, the last scene delivered the level of thought provoking that I was hoping to get out of this. I don’t think neatly plotted films can’t be thought provoking, but I did fear it wouldn’t be here because of the neatness of the storytelling.
Also, it’s pretty wild to think the director of Women Talking, Sarah Polley, is a child actor here considering that film has been getting award talk.",5.0

"Disappointing drama that wants you to think it is more deep and interesting than it actually is.
That said, It is not totally without merit. It has a few interesting ideas about relationships as transactions, and argues they are as much of a commodity as the private dances in the club, although I don’t think that is interesting enough to carry the whole film.
The score is pretty decent, the layout and design of the club is excellent. The Leonard Cohen song Everybody Knows is used effectively.
Given all those positives, you would think that this is a good movie, but I thought that, for all its promise, it was fairly empty.
I thought it might be heading towards a devestating or shocking ending but it just sort of fizzles out on the note that this movie is clearly very proud of but is not that interesting - that all these people know each other and are all somehow connected - which is hardly the knockout blow that it threatened to have up its sleeve; the mystery amounts to almost nothing. 
That, however, is not the worst thing about it. I would suggest that the movie hints at and dabbles in some dark and unpleasant undertones - the possibility of underage sex and abuse - but this also doesn’t go anywhere, and uses them superficially for titillation. 
Bruce Greenwood is excellent as the lonely auditor, but I was not crazy about many of the other performances, to say the least.

"Everything about this is Canadian. The erotica and kinks all feel like they are all more polite than crude. The interior of the strip club and fact that they love to play Leonard Cohen make me want to find this oasis.
Pacing is super slow, more a mood. I felt nothing but frustrated for two acts then things started to come together by the third. Third act was great but it’s so hard to tell because the bar felt low with the pacing.
This doesn’t pander the way formulaic American films do. It’s like water, it holds the structure of the container and it remains free flowing. I can’t objectively rate it. 
It gave me vibes on so many different things with the aesthetic and it wasn’t until I surrendered all of my expectations and just let the goddamn thing unfold that I started to enjoy it and appreciate the storytelling. It gave me what art should, especially something as precious as a film: something to think about on a deeper level. Still not gonna rate it.",0.0

Well this was not what I was expecting. Atom Egoyan has a very distinct voice, specifically in his writing and dialogue. I don't want to say it's mannered but there is something stilting or inauthentic in the way his characters speak. But unlike some of his later films that I've seen (The Sweet Hereafter, Where the Truth Lies), in Exotica the slightly-off dialogue wasn't too much of a distraction.
The whole film has an ethereal sense about it, a tone that almost feels like a dream. Part of this likely stems from the non-linear storytelling and the way he holds back information from the audience. For most of the film, you're not quite sure what is going on; who these characters are and how their stories connect. But once the pieces fall into the place (for me, it was the explanation of who Sarah Polley was and what her relationship was to Bruce Greenwood).
By the end, I was sort of a wreck.",5.0

really enjoyed the way this unspools itself gradually. so uneasy! and what a score! went into this knowing nothing which is probably the correct way to see this film. first half works a lot more for me than the second. as the story comes into sharper focus towards the end it felt a bit too much like telling, when the showing of the first half had been so effective.",3.5

"This movie is exceptional at having little reveals that don’t feel momentous but continue to subtly change your understanding of each character and their motivations. This happens to such a degree that, at the last reveal, you have to completely rethink everything you know about these characters. And yet it’s not jarring but simply a slow drip that eventually catches you off guard. This maybe a new favorite for me!",5.0
Such a beautifull movie. I loved the whole progression of the story.,5.0
"About twenty minutes in I sort of figured given the era and style that this was gonna be a “find the killer” movie where the artsy “twist” is they never find the killer, but I was wrong, that’s thankfully not what this is. the killer is beside the point.
It’s not quite an erotic thriller rather it’s a dark-cutesy “therapy for Johns and dancers” via stripping message movie. “See, exotic dancing has social value, it’s not just tits and getting off” lmao.
What does work is the movie Sort of inverts the psychological thriller in an interesting manner but the vehicle of replacing therapy with stripping is somehow deeply dull and pretentious which is remarkable. 
And there’s a gay tax evasion exotic animal smuggling subplot, so it’s got “layers” oy.",2.0
"Nightclub narcissism with death, obsession, financial swindles and jealousy all down to the wire. 'Exotica' could've come from Cronenberg, but here the Canadian flag of controversiality is flown by Atom Egoyan. A breakthrough, camp film for his we are drawn into Toronto nightlife with dancers, dads, DJ's and degenerate fraudsters. Everyone's got a problem to worry about and when their stories come together there's a sigh of coincidence. Problematic pasts form broken adults. As demonstrated right here.",4.0

"روچر إيبرت قال عن الفيلم دا لو مافهمتش العلاقات بين الشخصيات مش مهم لأنهم نفسهم مش فاهمينها.
الفيلم نجح في حاجات كتيرة بصرف النظر عن أنا عرفت أستمتع بيه أو أتواصل معاه لأي درجة.
على مستوى الغموض فالسرد مثالي ومعدل تدفق المعلومات مع إيقاع الفيلم يتمناه أي فيلم في الچنرا.
وعلى مستوى العالم والشخصيات فالفيلم نجح في توصيل الإحساس بأننا بنشوف شريحة بسيطة من عالم ممتد زمانًا ومكانًا، بلغة اليومين دول سهل يتقال طب ما يتعمل سپين أوف عن الشخصية الفلانية ولا جيبولنا أحداث في وقت بدايات النايت كلوب إلخ.
على مستوى تناول الإيروتيكية فكالمتوقع تم اعتبارها مهرب من خسائر العالم الحقيقي، رغم اعتراض المالكة على اعتبار إكزوتيكا مكان لأصحاب المعاناة، وإصرارها على إنه مكان للتسلية والمتعة، لكن واضح الثيمات الكئيبة للمكان، الرقص على كلمات كئيبة بصوت ليونارد كوهين المحمّل باليأس، تعليق صوتي من دي چيه المكان يبدو وكأنه بيحاول تعرية الأسباب الحقيقية لوجود الزبائن.
أخيرًا وبعيدًا عن الإيروتيكية فالمكان كان شبه نوعًا ما الأماكن في روايات نجيب محفوظ، وشخصية زوي مالكة الكلوب برضو حسيتها شبه أصحاب الأملاك في روايات محفوظ، قد تكون مش صدفة لأن المخرج مولود في مصر في الستينيات من أصول أرمينية.",3.5

I was tempted to give this a higher rating but this is a film I’m going to have to revisit sometime in the near future. The first half of the film I was struggling to figure out what was going on. Only in the middle when things became clear did I realise this was supposed to be suspenseful.  In order for suspense to work there needs to be clues that lead the audience on. The first half of the film didn’t do that and felt like a muddled mess. I’m also one for sleaze but not for this.,2.5

"“Everybody Knows”… Exotica is a complex rumination on those not so discreet “objects” of desire and frankly, how people generally and women specifically, are forced to inhabit that “objet petit a” role under another’s gaze. But even that is a gross oversimplification of the film…
Ultimately, I concluded the film feeling conflicted (and still do). Though, I mean conflicted in a good way. There’s obviously a certain level of sleaziness contained in a narrative centered on a strip club and one whose principal act is a schoolgirl Lolita, no less. That said, I couldn’t help but also feel a degree of wholesomeness, that despite the bleakest and seediest of circumstances there’s hope of maintaining human connection. However raw, messy or screwed up there’s still something “real”, contained and obscured, in all of that exotic fantasy.",5.0

At the end of the film, I felt empty and I thought it was because the film didn’t really do it for me, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about the final act of the film since and I believe that’s the exact feeling Egoyan wants you to experience. How it tackles the way people deal with grief and the way the numerous character connections and plot lines intersect at the end seems to have really struck a chord with me and I’m starting to think I love it. I will definitely return to it soon to try to fully piece together my thoughts.",4.0
"a primeira metade do filme foi feita pelo david lynch. a câmara acompanha um dos personagens, sobre o qual não sabemos muito, mas ele esconde qualquer coisa, intriga nos. ela move-se lentamente ao redor dele, da nos a sensação de isolamento e de que estamos a sonhar, com música e fala de fundo abafadas. sentimos que estamos num ambiente EXOTICO (ao qual nao pertencemos?). 
gostava que o final não tivesse juntado todas as peças do puzzle. acho que a mensagem de isolamento e de perda e do lugar mítico do clube teriam ficado melhor com alguns laços por juntar. 
Em geral prefiro sempre quando os filmes acabam sem nos dar o confronto que prometem, ou quando as peças quase que encaixam mas nao batem bem certo com as outras",4.0
Wouldn’t be a horny film from the 1990’s without Elias Koteas would it?,3.5
Tremendous control of narrative and revelation. It’s a film that feels like an actual puzzle that is being assembled as we watch but we can’t see the whole until the final scene and even then it causes reflection rather than a dismissive understanding. Similar in structure to other Egoyan films but perhaps none as intricately balanced and assembled as this.,4.5

Atom Egoyan’s neo-noir thriller deals with inconsolable sadness on a macro level in comparison to his later trauma drama, ’The Sweet Hereafter’. Bruce Greenwood and Mia Kirscher are two tortured souls whose lives are forever changed due to one terrible event after the next, finding solace amongst one another, whereas Elias Koteas’s character simply can’t understand, and is viewing Kirscher’s character superficially for the majority of the film (which is ironic since her character only interacts with everyone in a purely transactional manner similar to a femme fatale in many film noirs). The same could be said about Sarah Polley’s character in the film, where Greenwood constantly drops her off at a seedy hotel, handing her money, making us the audience think the worst of the situation, which Egoyan has a bit of fun in this film playing around with stark juxtapositions and fooling the audience with red herrings like the group of people coming over a hill in a “heaven-like” manner or the VHS flashbacks to a mother and daughter, only showing about 5 seconds in repeat, forward and backward. The same could be said about the musical choices in the film with Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows” being Kirscher’s characters entrance song (ironically used since only her and Greenwood know the situation). There are quite a few flaws in the film, especially towards its very end (how does one not recognize someone’s voice whose been speaking into a microphone for like 90% of the film?), but overall the film gets its tone and atmosphere correct. 4 / 5
Watched on the Criterion Channel",4.0
"Atom Egoyan’s Exotica is branded as an erotic neo-noir, but at its core it is an art house drama on the lines of Boogie Nights or Magnolia (yes the latter films came later). Bruce Greenwood is terrific as the doting father suffering from a severe loss. Mia Kirshner steals show every time she came up, and I only wished we had seen her more often in the screen after this banger. The restoration is pristine, makes me wonder if it was made in the late 90s / early 2000s, although it has the 70s / 80s appeal. Elias Koteas did a great turnaround too.",5.0

Rewatching it for the first time since then now that Criterion has finally put it out on a Region A Blu-ray. I was stuck with a terrible Miramax barebones DVD for many years. In any case, ""Exotica"" has held firm as my 3rd favorite film of all time for the better part of my life. I estimate I first saw this film in 1996 or 1997, so I would have been anywhere between 12-14 years old, and it was when Bravo aired it. I've always had a deep, emotional connection to this film and, in some ways, I don't necessarily comprehend why. The film is about depressed and damaged people engaging in unhealthy coping rituals, and I saw it years before Depression manifested itself in my life, or I engaged in any unhealthy coping rituals of my own. Sometimes a certain film will just hit you at a time in your life, and it will stay with you like that forever. I was also lucky enough to take a course in college on the director, Atom Egoyan, so I got to watch and discuss this film in an academic setting and read scholarly articles about it and further enrich my love of it as I was getting my degree.
The plot gradually reveals itself, but it's largely about a group of characters whose lives intersect at a Canadian strip club called Exotica. Francis (Bruce Greenwood), comes in regularly to get dances from Christina (Mia Kirshner), who dons a schoolgirl outfit and has a routine set to Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows"" (one of the best songs of all time). There's a sexual component to their relationship as dancer and customer, but it's evident from the start that there's some other connection between them. The DJ at the club who announces the dancers (Elias Koteas) is Christina's ex. When Francis goes to the club, he hires his niece (Sarah Polley) to go to his house and babysit, despite the fact that he doesn't have a kid. And then there's Thomas (Don McKellar), a closeted or repressed homosexual exotic animal smuggler who feigns having extra tickets for the ballet so he can attend it with men looking to buy scalping tickets as a pretense for hook-ups. As the film unfolds, these characters will intersect and their backstories and connections to one another will be gradually revealed, with the throughline being that they are all hurting and engaging in behavior ostensibly to cope with that hurt, but what is actually just prolonging their pain.
When the film came out it was marketed as being overtly sexual, when it really isn't. The nudity is brief and there's no on screen sex at all. I can probably trace my love of girls in schoolgirl outfits to this film, which is kind of messed up given the context of the film, but beyond that this isn't a titillating film. In many ways, the characters of this film have their wires crossed between sexual needs and emotional needs, but then again who doesn't? The film was given an unusual one-off award at the AVN Awards (the porn Oscars), which probably confuses the issue too.
This film is a masterpiece and perfectly executes what it sets out to do. I'm going through a tough time right now in my life, which may be why it made me tear up at the end (I don't cry every time I watch it), but it remains an emotionally powerful film that doesn't lose its impact no matter how many times I watch it, and I've seen it dozens of times in the 20+ years since I first saw it. That is why, no matter how many hundreds of thousands of films I have watched in my life, this is my 3rd favorite of all time.",5.0

"Un hombre de saco y corbata visita un bar de Toronto donde bailan mujeres con poca ropa. El lugar es artificialmente elegante, con palmeras y Leonard Cohen sonando de fondo. De todas las muchachas, el hombre siempre elige a la misma: se llama Christina y se viste de colegiala. Antes de visitar a Christina, con quien apenas habla y a quien jamás toca, pasa a buscar a su sobrina y la deja sola en su casa, para que practique piano y flauta. A veces el hombre dice que su sobrina está trabajando de niñera, pero no es cierto: antes en el hogar vivía una niña, su hija, pero ya no.
Otro hombre llega a Canadá después de un viaje; trae escondidos unos huevos valiosos, a los que trata con toda la delicadeza del mundo. En cierto punto descubrimos que dentro de esos huevos se gestan loros fascinantes y carísimos. El local en el que cría las aves ilegales tiene un aspecto penoso, pero las peceras refulgen como carteles de neón. Atom Egoyan evidencia, así, la máxima estética que rige su película: visualmente, todo deberá ser llamativo, impactante, casi publicitario. El objetivo es la sensualidad absoluta. No por nada la película fue vendida como erótica, cuando en verdad todo resulta un poco triste, incluyendo las peceras y las muchachas que bailan en el bar.
Los personajes de este relato están casi todos rotos; cargan traumas, sufrimientos, secretos, dolores misteriosos incluso para ellos mismos. Es evidente que hay un hilo que conecta todo, un hecho denso que de a poco se irá develando. Una filmación en VHS repetida en loop, con un ruido visual que quiebra la pulcritud del resto del film, parece esconder un indicio.
También hay un DJ que está obsesionado con Christina y no puede soportar la conexión −misteriosa; todo es misterioso− que ella tiene con el hombre de saco y corbata. El DJ, que parece un tipo relajado pero tiene un costado oscuro, es también el encargado de presentar, ante una pila de CD, un micrófono y un loro de mentira, a las muchachas que bailan en el bar. Cada vez que le toca presentar a Christina se paraliza, perturbado. El vínculo entre ambos también parece esconder un pasado.
Cada tanto, Egoyan quiebra el presente nocturno de tormentas, visitas a la ópera y canciones de Leonard Cohen con planos diurnos, muy impactantes, de personas caminando por un prado. Están buscando algo. Un cadáver, tal vez, o un poco de calor entre tanta fachada.
Christina, bailando, se adentra más y más en el laberinto. “Me parece que, para la mayoría de las personas, el sexo reside más en la imaginación y la fantasía que en el cuerpo”, dijo alguna vez Egoyan. El cuerpo de Christina, eso sí, no es cualquier cuerpo. Lo sabe el hombre de saco y corbata y lo sabe el DJ; lo sabe también el espectador. Ella trata de liberarse de las ataduras. La pregunta es cómo llegó a estar tan atada, acorralada por obsesos, danzando entre palmeras y luces de neón.
Cuatro personajes intentan encontrar calidez en un bar donde bailan mujeres con poca ropa. El lugar es ligeramente decadente, con cuevas de cartón pintado y sexualidad fría; es el corazón de un thriller sin armas, un thriller espiritual. El lugar se llama Exotica.

"Wow - what is it with Canadian directors this week - Cronenberg and now Egoyan, although of course this is an older film. Lynchian and plot twisting. Gentle and softly shot as if it was permanently 4pm in good sunlight. Arsinée Khanjian definitely has an Isabella Rosellini thing going on as Zoe. Atom always seems to make a subtle point of illustrating the complexity of peoples lives. He uncovers depth in such a tantalising fashion that you are intrigued to keep watching. So deft.",3.5

"Of all the great ensemble dramas of the ‘90s, Atom Egoyan’s masterful Exotica is undoubtedly my favourite. Even though this is only my second viewing, a good decade since my first, there is something unique about the film that magically draws me to it and makes it impossible to forget. Every beautifully framed image, every revealing line, every perfectly judged performance and every evocative note from Mychael Danna’s score creates a haunting reaction that is hard to explain let alone do justice to.
Despite his recent missteps, Egoyan is one of the most interesting directors to emerge from Canada. His off-kilter style helping create a strange slow burn atmosphere that never fails to pull you into the intoxicating mystery of Exotica. Although other filmmakers, most notably Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, created more overtly attention-baiting multi-stranded dramas no filmmaker of the decade managed to tease so many seemingly disparate stories into such a satisfyingly cryptic and hypnotic whole.
Exotica is a film that takes its time to reveal its mysteries. Even after the final haunting image has long since faded it lingers in the memory as you explore each little detail Egoyan delicately and deliberately teases. So often the ensemble drama is undone by cheap narrative contrivances yet the gradual way Egoyan weaves together these unconnected strands is exquisite.
The film is set in and around the eponymous gentleman’s club where women give private dances at five dollars a time. Within this ever-present location, four separate yet connected stories slowly play out. The interwoven stories of loss, longing, voyeurism and surrogates continually cross paths creating a rich tapestry of non-linear storytelling that is only revealed during the film’s closing moments.
My praise-filled rambling demonstrates an inability to adequately express why Exotica is one of the finest films of the decade. Whilst it is easy to discuss its many identifiable attributes whether it be Bruce Greenwood’s soulful performance as a grief-stricken tax inspector or Mia Kirshner’s sensual yet sensitive turn as an Exotica stripper, there are elements that are harder to describe: It’s overwhelming atmosphere and sense of longing or its elliptical and cryptic nature that stays with you days later work at a level that can only be felt rather than articulated. It is this quality, this beautiful and mysterious cinematic alchemy, that separates the good films from the truly great. It’s a quality that speaks to the audience in ways even the audience doesn’t fully understand and it is a quality Exotica possesses in spades.
Exotica is a film that only seems to improve with age. It is Egoyan’s masterpiece and a film that simply demands to be seen.",5.0

"The first time I saw Exotica I was perplexed by the subtleties and the quietness of the piece. What I see with this film is that there's a lot of shots of people looking, looking at mirrors, looking through glass. There are even items put behind glass like the pets in the pet store or the eggs in the incubator. The film opens with Thomas (Don McKellar) and a man (Peter Krantz) splitting a taxi. At the end of the ride the man gives Thomas tickets to the ballet in lieu of payment.
This sets a recurring motif throughout the movie, money or favors exchanging hands, most of the time its given for someone dancing although ironically in the case of Thomas he's tries to give money back for taking someone to the ballet (a kind of dance in and of itself).
This is a portrait of loneliness and longing. The desire to just have a connection. Not so much a sexual one but one that just wants to feel human and be with someone or understand them. It's actually a film that speaks more to the body than the mind in some ways, you feel it deep in your soul more than the mind.
The performances are all spectacular. I don't think any single one is out of place here. Bruce Greenwood (Francis) conveys such spectacular loneliness and sadness with just one look, I particularly love the last shot of him in this movie as he looks through the car glass at Christina (Mia Kirshner) walking away from him. Elias Koteas as Eric the Club DJ gives a sense of pure machismo in most of his scenes but we can see deep down he's hiding pain.
Exotica is a mysterious, quiet and subtle film. It doesn't spell out the answers for you. But to me this is a film about very sad, very lonely people searching for connection and the barriers that are put up between them. It's incredibly human and beautiful.",5.0

"I can't stop turning this over in my head. This film is compelling and strange to watch but what makes it an extraordinary cinematic achievement is the obsessive spiral Egoyan's complex characters and bizarre plot are sure to drag you into post-viewing. Never before have I found a film's afterlife more fascinating than its runtime and the experience has completely redefined the medium for me. And when you consider how masterfully the viewing experience mirrors the film's content and major concerns, such as how memories haunt us and the ways in which trauma permeates ordinary life, you can't help but feel totally flummoxed by how anyone created a film so subtle and smart.",4.0
"Too disjointed for its own good. The last half hour is something, but not nearly enough to make up for an hour of aimless plot lines that feel like red herrings for an ending that never really delivers on the sense of dread leading up to it.
The club looks cheap, lacking in the production value necessary for it to be the transportive setting the script/characters build it up to be. Performances are inconsistent (Bruce handles Egoyan’s dialogue better than everyone else), and the story only dances with really being about something.
A few viewers have said it on here (and I agree fully) this is an art house soap opera, akin to something like Almodovar’s Parallel Mothers. The difference is that Almodovar knows what he’s doing and infuses it all with sense of camp that is sorely missing from Egoyan’s works.",2.5

"For a film, labelled as an erotic thriller, this sure wasn't very erotic or very thrilling. Even the few recognisable actors couldn't really elevate the film to something sizzlingly attractive or grippingly tense as the plot and labelling suggested. When I first found the film in a bargain bin, I thought it might have some softcorish and stirring vibes in a strip club, but it never really roused me to the edge of my seat. In the end it felt like the promising script was just executed so blandly you just don't feel the motive to invest attention to it. Shame.....",1.0

"Hmm idk. I really enjoy a lot of Exotica. The music is fantastic. The mystery is often enthralling. The performances, particularly those from Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas, are mostly strong. But at times I thought the dialogue was a bit clunky and the way backstory was revealed/how things connected was contrived (the moment where Eric confronts Thomas in the bathroom feels very much like something dropped in by a screenwriter to keep the plot churning forward. Christina and Francis’s mutual eagerness to reveal details of Francis’s past with Thomas doesn’t ring true and feels more like a cheap expository device. These problems stand out even more when contrasted with the brilliant way Christina’s tormented past is alluded to without needing to spell it all out). Scenes often felt soapy and uneven to me (it’s a very minor moment but the scene where Christina confronts Zoe about her contract with Eric feels like some weak material pulled straight from All My Children). Might have to give this one another go some time because the atmosphere was terrific—especially early on—but it didn’t quite come together (could be the mixture of my cat jumping in front of the TV like a crack addict and our door dash order being mysteriously canceled as I waited longingly for my dorito shell taco. Truly a perfect storm of a night).",3.5
"Billed as an erotic thriller but featuring very little in the way of actual sex, Exotica useds the seedy backdrops of strip clubs and smuggling rings to tell a very human story about grief, loneliness and the self-destructive coping mechanisms that develop in such a broken world. The tragedy behind Francis' inexplicably sexless obsession with Christina gradually unfolds as Egoyan peels back the layers to reveal why such a put-together man seems both utterly transfixed and hollow as he stares out painfully at her erotic performance. Even as she seductively gives him a private lapdance, there is no desire is his eyes, only this profound absence that's gradually revealed to run so much deeper than lust. Although Freudian touches and hints of sexual impotence appear, it's ultimately the mark of an oversexualised society that Francis' inability to process his own daughter's death manifests in this muddled fixation on the image of a schoolgirl when it's clear what he really needs is to feel human connection again. For all the apparent eroticism that gives Exotica its tastefully seedy tone, sex and desire for carnal pleasure alone is portrayed as a wholly destructive process; destroying fraternal bonds, inflicting physical disability and corrupting the innocent relationship of two teenagers. Instead it's love in its more altruistic forms through Christine's continued and reciprocated kindness to Francis and Eric's honest confession which allows for real connection. Not a furtive glance through a strip club peephole but a tearfelt embrace in the parking lot where one had come to kill the other, but leaves knowing his grief weighs down and is shared by others.",4.0

Stone cold masterpiece. Hypnotic 90s vibes. Feels kinda oblique and this aids the movie greatly in leaving a lasting impression. The performances are also excellent.

"me watching the credits at the beginning when it said “and elias koteas” and i wasn’t expecting it:  i’m cumming right fucking now…only for him to end up being the scraggly dj in the strip club in this 😭😭😭 (ok he did look hotter after his first appearance i will admit it was mainly that ugly green bowling shirt in his first scene pissing me off)
this is everything i wanted it to be and more; don mckellar as the anxious gay pet shop owner that illegally imports macaw eggs while in his free time picks up hookups at the opera…say absolutely no more…oh but atom did, he said a lot more! for example mia kirshner and arsineé khanjian - my god were they incredible in this. bruce greenwood was fine, but i think that has more to do with my general disinterest in him as an actor than the power of his actual performance. 
overall i loved this and i am continuing to obsess over how egoyan subverts temporality in his films",4.5

"“All I'm saying is nobody asked you if you wanted to be brought into the world. You just ended up getting here... So the question is, now that you are here... who's asking you to stay?”
I loved the script. It was so well written. Started off as a weird drama film that I transitioned into even weirder mystery. It went into completely different direction that I would have thought. They way this story was told through monotone scenes. Same scenes, same dialogue just with a little bit more information or different characters acting it out. That was great. The soundtrack was fantastic and elevated this movie even more. One of the best soundtracks I have recently heard in a film.
Honestly one of the weirdest (in a good way) experiences. I do not think that this is such a weird film when you compare it to other films that are for sure weird. However, the way this story resonated with me and how the characters' stories have played out, it created such an odd experience. It felt like a David Lynch film combined with a soap opera.
The problem for me in this movie was acting. It was fine and and good most of the time but there were scenes where it just did not work for me. The atmosphere that was created through the story and soundtrack was not broken by the acting so I am not that bothered but it was the lowest point of the film for me. I thought that most of the characters were explored perfectly fine and everything tied up well at the end however, some of character just felt like they were there to be catalyst for others. It is not a bad thing but I wish they had a more full story.
Also, what happened to the eggs?
I definitely would like to watch this again after some time.",4.0
"Wow, wasn’t expecting everything to tie together. Well except I was hoping for the conclusion of the lost eggs, but whatever. Damn this was really stellar.

"7.5 Good, but had potential for greatness. If only Egoyan decided to explore Christina's character more. Her backstory seemed to be the most interesting of all characters in the film. I really wondered what has happened in her past (grooming? domestic abuse?) and how she ended up working in the club. Sadly, the director used her mostly as a device to explore the men, mostly Francis.
Why the relatively high rating then? The structure really impressed me here. Slowly unfolding Francis's past kept me engaged as it changed what I thought about his character a couple of times. I'm also a sucker for atmospheric stuff and Exotica definitely delivered on this front. It's strange, somewhat lynchian yet seductive. Sometimes that's all I need.",3.5

This is told in a very intriguing way. The pieces unfold but it’s not totally clear what certain motivations are going on. But that’s ok as the narrative alone is enticing. There became a point towards the ending climax where I thought it had all been told and so it lulled for me for a minute but in the end it was absolutely satisfying. I didn’t realize I was being emotionally pulled into this as much as I was until the end and at that point I loved it. That’s not to say up to that point was unlikeable. I enjoyed all of it quite a lot. Great movie.,4.0
"The last scene of Exotica on first watch made me second guess whether I actually understood the first 90 or so minutes beforehand, but the last shot now on rewatch is an all timer. We will never know exactly what goes on in that house, what goes on in their bedroom, what goes on in anybody’s mind outside the context of surface level assumptions and appearances. The entire first act is an exercise of introducing seemingly sinister events or occurrences only for the film to slowly peel them away. The only thing that mirrors or remains throughout is the transactional nature of every human interaction in the film. How the first shot in a car reflects the last shot literally made me squirm out of my chair. An absolute heat seeking missile of a slowburn that I’m too excited to cop the Criterion for.",4.5
Incredibly interesting on many levels. I love how this withholds information from the viewer at the beginning and through the course of the film it slowly reveals itself (that sounds like something a stripper does which is exactly the point now I think about it).

Exotica (the club) has to be one of the top five movie strip clubs of all time!,4.5
"I don’t know where to begin. It’s a masterful movie. Score, design, camera, casting, all serve thematic purposes. It honestly feels like everything is more symbolic than meant to be real, more dream interpretation than an attempt at verisimilitude. Like I’ve never been to a strip club that looks like the Rainforest Cafe with a philosopher DJ who plays Leonard Cohen, but who knows.. I’ve never been to Toronto. 
It’s always thoroughly difficult to wrestle with a character who is doing deplorable things, and that’s certainly intentional here. We’re not meant to think Francis is moral, but he is the movies emotional center, which is icky to sit through. It’s a movie that makes you ask yourself how you do things that make you hate yourself. What weird places would you take yourself to relieve loneliness and despair? (Tbh not these, what the fuck? But I digress) I’m less intrigued by the themes themselves than by the way they are displayed. The constant visual cue of one way mirrors, the visual hints at much much worse scenarios revealed in the cyclical narrative, so much cinematic storytelling to interpret.",4.0

Fast to the malfunctioning dyad of departed documentation and the invasiveness of a possibility, thought witnesses body language, a lack of acquaintance to an objective corroboration between someone's reflex and the alchemy behind it, and to its internal hermitage they isolate it, presumptuous of miscommunication and mismanagement.
No remembrance there of the company sustained, in which our intrapersonal truths tabulate, can overtake the reach of subjectivity whose dimension beyond people longs for them, loathes them, commodifies them for the introversion whose sight and conclusion have the thinnest of conjunction between them.

"Indispensable in its exploration of human relationships, trauma and sexuality in the post-capitalist world. Contemplative and melancholy but then so tender. A low budget masterpiece.
For being so small scale in terms of narrative and budget, it’s astonishing how much ground Exotica covers. Technically, dramatically and philosophically this film is gifted. From its emotional highs to its more subtle moments, there is a sense of confident and appropriate direction through and through. Each scene is carefully staged and filmed with intent. Exotica’s director Atom Egoyan has indeed revealed them to be shot from the perspective of a character technically missing but deeply important to the entire narrative. From her eyes, we see each and everyone here in their totality by the end of the film. There may be an antagonist in Exotica, perhaps each character is one to each other but there is no villain here. The characters of Exotica are flawed in some important ways but far from unforgivable. We see them at their best, at their worst and at their most vulnerable so they come across as fully and truly human. The plot devices that move along the story become a lot richer with the humanist quality present throughout the entire film.
Mychael Danna’s score is a beast. The sexy, Lords of Acid-esque beats form a nasty combo with the composer’s signature sampling of Middle Eastern vocal work. The lustful nature of the synth and the soulful nature of the actual singing sum up a lot concerning Exotica. With multiple sequences of nonchalant nudity and a particularly seductive female lead, the film at it’s surface appears very sexual. The movie was even marketed as an erotic thriller, and successfully at that. But Exotica is actually more of a slow moving, surreal and nonlinear ensemble drama. The deeper stories behind the characters unfold carefully rather than all at once and it isn’t until the third act when something resembling a thriller materializes. Still, you’ll be quite disappointed if you come looking for that. Rather, the film’s resolution is a moving celebration of our human desire to relate. The two characters primed for a fierce conflict with one another opt for something so much richer. By the end of the film, you understand Egoyan’s primary message of the film. Humanity is interconnected and collective. We can delight in this reality or seal ourselves off for certain death, spiritual or even physical.
Such an altruistic message could seem obvious to some, or just altogether idealistic. Exotica isn’t ignorant of this. An essential aspect of this film is love and sex in relation to capitalism. The characters in Exotica, though disillusioned when we meet them, do desire relationships. The only issue is, they pay for them. Francis, the tax auditor, pays for private dances from Christina that also function as pseudo-therapy sessions. Thomas, the exotic pet merchant, buys men tickets to shows as a surreptitious means of dating but is reluctant to actually date them. In a society motivated by the pursuit of profit alone, anything can and will be bought or sold. These characters wrestle with both societal pressure and their own psyche.
One of Exotica’s most prevalent fixations is that of trauma. While Thomas’ is left up to the viewer’s imagination, we come away fully aware of what broke Francis and Christina. A sequence of crushing events has destroyed these people, their capabilities and capacity for healthy relationships. What is perhaps most beautiful about this film is how a conversation or connection between the right people heals these emotional wounds. Maybe just human interaction in good faith alone is the way toward peace.
The acting within Exotica is near perfect through and through. Major and minor characters alike shine moment to moment. Bruce Greenwood’s Francis seems like a far realer portrayal of a character you’d run into in a neo-noir film. Detached from his conditions, he could be considered rather deplorable. But the film compels you to relate with him and understand his neuroses. Mia Kirshner is enchanting as Christina. Many other films would make her out to be some maneating femme fatale. Here, she is at heart so concerned with the welfare and goodwill of others but in conflict with her own sense of agency and self sufficience. Don McKellar’s Thomas is what brings the whole story together. His character’s soft demeanor first appears weak but is ultimately what resolves the various conflicts within the film. Arsinée Khanjian and Victor Garber have smaller roles that still feel so integral to the overall plot. Khanjian’s Zoe initially seems rather cold and callous but the power of this woman becomes obvious as the story unfolds. Garber’s Harold holds just as much significance in terms of plot and comes across with a sense of calm coolness.
I do think a weakness of Exotica lies in the thread that connects its characters. Essentially, coincidences are what brings them together and these are maybe not the most believable. Though, if you’re the type to harp on plot holes, you can go watch a Nolan film or something.
So, so good. The kind of movie you think about incessantly after watching.",4.0

"Not sure the best way to phrase this, but I appreciate how Eric is written. He’s gay, but that doesn’t define the totality of his personality (i.e., walking stereotype) nor his arc, e.g., the threat of being forcibly outed—often an unsophisticated and cruel writing trick. He’s just a regular multifaceted dude who happens to be gay. His extreme discomfort in the club stems as much from being gay in an establishment catering to the desires of straight men as being an awkward softboi. This shouldn’t still feel progressive in 2022.
I also dig how Exotica plays with the semiotics of terrorism and prostitution despite not really doing much with them. Eric is Persian or Middle Eastern; during the opening, we’re meant to assume through his gestures and nervousness he has explosives strapped to his chest, not smuggled reptile eggs. Pretty probing stuff for pre-9/11. The same’s true with our introduction to Tracey and Harold, which gives off waves of Taxi Driver-core discomfort but turns out to be something much less noxious, though still sad and pathetic. Of course, both of the moments interrogate the viewer who’s ultimately the one generating these assumptions.
Ash mentioned how the film likens men’s treatment of women to the societal treatment of exotic(a!) animals—something to be equal parts coveted, protected, and feared while of course mediated by capital. This nicely plugs into the Madonna/whore complex too (sorta stealing this observation from Kendall). It’s a really elegant reading that I’m kicking myself for not having recognized earlier. Still, Egoyan unconsciously dips his toe into the same mentality he critiques. Christina is Exotica’s narrative and moral center, but she’s made out as a mystery. She clearly knows a lot more than she should, and her substantial flashbacks-to-present personality shift isn’t particularly clear. If you’re critiquing the exoticization of women, maybe the best move isn’t to semi-exoticize your female lead?

"Exotica is a stunning and heartbreaking film from Egoyan.

It slowly unravels the past of all these characters who have experienced tragedy or darkness in someone or another and ultimately leads to a heartbreaking climax that nobody would have guessed after watching the first 15 minutes. 
It’s filmmaking at its best, the direction is flawless and there’s so many decisions from Egoyan that are genius. It’s so obvious that he’s made a film he’s passionate about and every scene and shot was chosen wisely for a deeper meaning. The performances are amazing, especially Bruce Greenwood.

The flow of this film reminds me of the sick feeling a person gets from staying out all night. As the film nears its end, and the “morning sun starts to rise,” the oppressive, surreal surroundings give way to stale, unraveling clarity.
In terms of narrative, I appreciate Egoyan’s approach to information. Much of the dramatic tension in the first half of the film comes from withholding information (ie context), and actively builds upon it. The audience isn’t just encouraged to draw their own conclusions, as the way that scenes play off one another creates a lot of tension and emotion by leading the audience to false conclusions (in a careful, authentic manner).

It's a film about not letting you in on everything, not telling you where a story ends, and keeping you in this world for a little while. Bruce Greenwood, Koteas, and Kirshner give it their all in this smoldering neo noir though the set of the Exotica club is the big star here.

I really wanted to rate it higher because it is a very unique and enjoyable watch, however I couldn’t help but feel that the ending was a bit of a cop out and also I feel like several of the character storylines don’t really get enough closure to justify their place in the film.

“what brought the person to this place?”
this is real cinema. The ideas on screen here could never be matched in their power in a book, a song, a play or a painting. Our longing to watch people who we will never know, places we can never go and ideas we could never articulate in words, is what makes cinema so incredible. We see ourselves in that world, whether we like it or not - this is what a great film should always try to exploit.

The film’s implication of the viewer’s voyeurism of the characters, all within in its own philosophy of trauma is done with such skill and artistry. The interweaving of multiple character’s lives while withholding just enough information to force us to make assumptions about them is achieved with real finesse - the revealing of information never feels like a “plot twist” or a contrived character flaw, rather it plays on the very assumptions and judgements we make about all people whether strangers, friends or lovers, in our every day lives. In playing with them, it shows us how little we truly know about each other and how rarely we ever bother to try and really understand one another.


This film perfectly understands the way in which trauma and suffering can tear people apart, but even more so how it can bring people into our lives, and us into theirs. We find ourselves trapped here and there with them, because now we cannot be without them, and once they’re gone, they’re still with us even if only as a memory, as an idea that neither can let go of. We need them just as they need us. 

I know I’ll be watching it again sometime soon

Bruce Greenwood is like, really good here though and a large success to me based on that central performance.

Thomas is talking about matrilineal hair loss but the statement is polysemic—it also refers to the way Egoyan has his characters move reiteratively through the same behaviors and dialogue until the pattern snaps and another truth oozes out. 
trauma performances and audiences to trauma are cloaked behind and refracted through mirrors and doors (I love those shots of Eric goading Francis in the bathroom) and windows and walls or windows playacting as mirrors or walls with exceptions carved out. there’s no promise of healing once the viewer and viewed confront each other sans barrier but they can extend themselves some clarity rather than projected and distorted fantasy under the neon glow.

"“Just because they're exotic doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.""
A tax man who lost his family is a frequent customer at a higher end strip club in Toronto and we follow the lives of the people who work at that club as well as a smuggler the tax man is doing an audit of.
Written and directed by Atom Egoyan this is a seedy noirish psychological drama.
It's a very good movie and a very depressing movie, I thought of David Fincher's work a lot watching this with it having a noir flavor but mainly because this movie ends and... nothing really works out for anyone. There's no hope or happiness for the characters in this movie.
Terrific performances from everyone like Bruce Greenwood as Francis the grieving tax man, it's nice to see him in a lead role since I know him mainly from his excellent supporting work in stuff like The Place Beyond the Pines, Star Trek and TV work like American Crime Story.
Mia Kershner is excellent as Francis' favorite dancer Christina who goes back a while with him in a really sad way that closes out the film in haunting fashion.
Elias Koteas plays the MC of the Exotica club who ALSO has a history with Christina and eh.... I've seen him be better in other movies like The Thin Red Line. I didn't think he was the right fit for this sex club MC... I did love his last scene, though.
Don McKellar plays the smuggler and I knew the name looked familiar in the credits, turns out he directed a movie I liked a lot I saw last year, The Grand Seduction!
Egoyan does a nice job writing AND directing here, gets good performances out of all the actors and the way the story wraps up and sort of resets itself making it prime for a rewatch is very well done. It's actually VERY similar in style to how Remember ended, another film by Egoyan that I watched right before this.
This came out 5 years before Eyes Wide Shut and while it doesn't have Kubrick's visuals it has the script and characterization that was missing from that film that dealt with similar themes about people obsessed with sex.
Exotica is a solid deviant drama.",4.0
"I didn’t want this one to end. Exotica is an incredibly fascinating psychosexual anatomy describing the pathology of a communal sexual underground. The film is largely concerned with interrogating the psychological workings of transactional sexual relationships that are of mutual value to both parties, not in the erotic, but in the therapeutic.
Exotica explores the roles ritual and substitution play in the lives of those tenacious but fragile existences shaped almost wholly by the experiences of their past—holding their forms by sheer force of will and interdependency on those who share their fates. The central characters in the film are defined largely by their substitutions of roles, who they choose to be to someone else—a father, a daughter—and the way they ingratiate themselves into the existential navigation of kindred spirits in doing so.
Here, everything is sexual; Exotica understands keenly the inscrutable ubiquity sexuality possesses in every facet of human psychology—it is for this reason that the titular strip club is the stage of projections, the theatre of the mind, where the client and the dancer cast themselves in the roles that hold together the ever precarious nuclei of their existences. I feel like it’s the sort of world I could revisit again and again, getting lost in the tragedy of its allure every time.",5.0

"Kinda sorta like a Canadian Blue Velvet.

If you've ever observed beautiful strangers in a club or restaurant and wondered about their lives and made assumptions of their relationships, this film is pretty much like that. It's slow-burning, unraveling, twisting; and somehow looks like both an art-house film and made-for-TV-movie.

"Beguiling at times, but a bit frustrating. The story takes a while to really get going, and only until about 2/3 of the way through does this finally begin to start making sense.

"I didn't get into it like everyone else seems to, but probably it was because all the characters are depressed and i was in bad mood, but it deserves a fair shake.

"dont really know how to put it into words yet, but Exotica, to me, seems to be the greatest cinematic exploration of the affect of surveillance I've ever seen. What comes about when we attempt to navigate the contradictions that emerge through living in a constant state of hyper-connectivity? When our increased isolation interacts with the knowledge that we also live in a state of constant exposure? There are no secrets, only things we tell ourselves are secrets. From the beginning of the film, we implicitly understand the relationships that exist between these characters, but they are still presented cinematically as secrets, and revealed as though they have been secrets all along, calling into question the absolution we spectators of thrillers may allow ourselves. There is always the need for greater ""understanding,"" more granular details, more watching. Our cinema acts as a one way mirror, like the foremost recurring motif of the film. But the parrots that also recur throughout the film--seeing everything but never speaking though they have the capacity to do so-- imply a reminder that we too can accidentally, and banally be exposed at any time.
Egoyan explores these contradictions, allowing us to see how they emerge in a state of simultaneous comfort and discomfort for his characters, as they navigate the internal strife and guilt that emerges from finding comfort in exposure, but always knowing that it can be used against us.",5.0

"“Don’t be afraid, I know everything about you.” 
Exotica is truly an experience. During the film, my opinions on whether I enjoyed it or not fluctuated quite a bit before finally settling on enjoyment.
This weird weird film is honestly something to behold. The plot is gripping and interesting, grappling with topics of grief and justice, and it effectively gives off a feeling of haziness with a touch of unease. 
Overall, this movie is definitely one to be enjoyed if at all possible, it was an interesting ride. 
Happy Watching!

lush, sensual images and music. delicately weaving the threads the characters share. challenging our assumptions--a man drops off a teenage girl in an unseemly neighborhood and pays her cash--what could that mean?. how complex relationships can be. gently peeling back the layers on the mystery. the secrets we hold in and the secrets we lay bare, for better or worse.

Was initially getting strong Donnie Darko vibes from this one. Turns out it is far from it. It’s a snoozefest that disguises itself as a mysterious and chilling slow-burn that seems to be building up to some sort of big reveal or jaw dropping ending but all it really leads to is disappointment. Having two scenes with ‘Montagues and Capulets’ was nice though.,1.5
"This is one of those cases in which I absolutely cannot fathom how the majority of the reviews for this film praise it. The only way I can process it is to imagine that somehow this director or producer or both were the kind of people who had enough money to pay reviewers to leave this miserable garbage pile positive reviews.
I watched this for a few reasons - the number one reason, by far, was because I find Mia Kirshner (known primarily as Jenny Schecter in The L Word - my favorite character, sorry haters) to be in the upper tier of the sexiest women I have seen, and a great reason for this aside from her physical self, is in the volatility and almost frightening energy of her presence in her acting performances. The other reasons are because the rest of the cast seemed intriguing (Elias Koteas, Sarah Polley, the bad guy from Disturbing Behavior who looks like Sam Neill crossed with Alex Trebek), and because one person I trust said it was good, and it's on the Criterion Channel. If I've learned anything from this experience, it's that not every movie that gets Criterion support is worth watching.
This has the epitome of 90's straight-to-video erotic melodrama vibes. The pacing is so grueling I feel okay calling it lethal - because it destroys this viewing experience and it has the potential to destroy you. The whole cast gives a good effort but the writing is so messy and emotionally off-kilter that no one can save this material. The film needs a re-write, a re-edit, and a different director to turn it into anything more than an absolute pain to get through. The characters are all dreadfully dull and simultaneously unlikable. When things ""wrap up"" in the end it is so nonsensical I can't even appreciate it in a surrealist or absurdist way because it's clearly taking itself so seriously - as if you're supposed to feel something real. It tries so hard to create some profound emotional message but the way things so unrealistically connect simply does not work in any sense. There is nothing real within any of this, for me.
I hate saying this but seeing Mia Kirshner naked really is the only valuable thing in this film and even that feels tainted by the sour flavor of everything else going on in the film. How do people like this?!",1.0

Die soeben erklungenen (fünf am Zählchen) Zitate mögen einleitenderweise als Ersteindruck fungieren und arbeiten im eigentlichen Hauptwerke gekonnt mit Schlüsselmomenten, diesmal erfolgte die mein‘ge Sichtung des in nicht wenigen Ländern (in deutschen Gefilden bedauerlicherweise ausschließlich auf VHS – vergriffene Ausgabe aus dem Jahre 1995, wann erbarmt sich jemand?, wann nimmt sich ein label des Werkes an?, das Warten schmerzt) erhältlichen Ausnahmedramas im Rahmen einer holländischen Variante (7 DVDs: „The WORLD of Atom Egoyan“, ebenfalls 7 Discs beinhaltet die Box von Artificial Eye, dorten befinden sich meine Worte zum süßen Jenseits, die letzt‘re Edition empfiehlt sich für all jene, welche die ersten sieben Hauptwerke zu sehen gewillt sind) und bereits die musikalischen Wunder im MENÜ sind magischer als es sich jemals jemand erträumt hätte, die Poesie in den Kompositionen und die sagenumwobene Macht der Bildsprache erzeugen einen ureigenen Kosmos, die verschiedenen Trailer des Werkes sind ebenfalls bereits rauschhaft, jener von Miramax eher Effekthascherei, aber nicht minder faszinierend, in der Einstiegssequenz bauet sich der elegante Titel Exoticas (Exotica) langsamst Buchstabe für Buchstabe auf, die Kamera sie fährt zeitlupengleich von links nach rechts (scherzhaft könnte man sagen: Super Mario Side-Scroller ohne Tempo), wir schwämmen sodann durch ein leuchtendes Tauchbad der Gefühle, die extravaganten und im bestmöglichen Sinne überkandidelten Bildnisse zeugen von düsterer Aura, das lebende Gedicht als 99- bis 103-minütige tour de force kinematographischer Exzesse, eine Odyssee jenseits aller Grenzen (die aber gleichwohl gesetzt werden – bräche man sie, flöge man hinaus und landete im Regen, Francis weiß wovon ich parliere, später mehr), in Bälde lernen wir zu Beginn des Films Thomas kennen im Rahmen einer absurd-komischen Taxifahrt, anschließend treffen wir Mia im Exotica, einem Garten Eden, der Eure Sinne wird betören, selten jedoch sonderlich erregend wirkt, sondern die meiste Zeit über eher ein Trauerkelch verlorener Seelen zu sein scheint, die visuellen Eindrücke zwar sind bestechend, aber selten nur von Heiterkeit geprägt, eigentlich nahezu nie, selbst dann nicht, wenn besagte Mia zu „everybody knows“ ihren inn‘ren Schwung nach außen trüge, in solchen Momentaufnahmen vielleicht gar am Allerwenigsten.
In der deutschen Fassung erhören Sie eine sehr warme, zarte Stimme auf Greenwood, was zum sensiblen Charakter seiner Rolle zwar kongenial passen mag, jedoch reichlich wenig mit der extrem coolen, durchaus tiefen Originalstimme gemein hat, Greenwoods eigentliches (deutlich näher am Originale seiendes) deutsches Stimmpendant (späteren Tages sehr häufig: Oliver Stritzel) spricht in Exotica hingegen Eric (Elias Koteas), dieser wiederum klänge im Original höher, weitere Stimmen im Werke finden sich u.a. in Jan Odle, die Kombination Stritzel/Odle erinnert den geneigten 90er Jahre Experten an Mike Leigh‘s Meisterwerk „naked“ („Kannst du mir folgen?“, dieser Satz begleitet auch Exotica aus eben derselben Stimme heraus), alsbald geleitet uns das Werk in die Oper und von dorten aus musikalisch führet es uns auf direktem Wege weiter zurück ins Exotica, in die EIGENTLICHE Oper, in die noch Emotionalere, Aufregendere, Packendere, das Filmwerk stünde dabei für recht fließende Übergänge, keine radikalen Schnitte ereilen uns, alles Erdenkliche harmoniert in Gänze, besonders Sarahs Spiel an der Flöte im Einklange mit dem sich verselbstständigenden Yamaha-Flügel, eine Traumwelt voller Spiegeleffekte der delirierenden Seelenzustände, jedwede Form von Nähe erwiese sich als notwendig, aber vonnöten seiend hin oder her, verweilt sie gleichwohl in schmerzdurchtränkter Tränenseelentristesse, zumal und zudem selbst Rückzugsörtlichkeiten nicht für die pure Stille stehen, sondern (Koteas manipuliert Green – oder versucht es zumindest, Greenwood beteuert anderswo, er wäre enttäuscht gewesen, ließe sich Mia auf den „gut gemeinten“ Vorschlag Erics/Francis‘ ein, wollte es gewissermaßen „prüfen“, einerseits schwer zu glauben und andererseits im bitterernsten Kontexte seiner sich später annähernd erklärenden Situation durchaus herzensschlüssig) eine Welt der Gespräche und Konfrontationsformen bilden, zwischenzeitlich zeichnet das Farbenmeer ein Kontrastbild und gelobt uns im Zeichen der Erinnerung den unendlichen Weiten und Welten einer Weide beiwohnen zu lassen, dort zeichnet sich erwähnenswerterweise ein gänzlich anders als die Gegenwart gelagertes Kennenlernensbild zwischen Mia („Nicht noch ein Teenie-Film“, für Daniel :D) und Koteas („The Adjuster“) ab, ...wie im Jahre 1997 im süßen Jenseits (dort vielleicht noch verstärkt – aber alterstechnisch tendenziell weniger kontrovers) wird sich (Sarah Polley ward noch kaum erwähnt worden, ich liebe sie, ihre hiesige Rolle dagegen weniger, die gesamte Welt Francis‘ ist ihr zu verworren, sodass sie ihn zunehmend mit diesem „Such‘-dir-Hilfe“-Blick ansieht, der er nur zu vielen „Normalos“ inhärent ist, auch sein „You don‘t understand“ gegenüber der sonsten durchaus netten Zoey ist hier von Schlüsselbedeutung, nachdem sie äußert, das Exotica und seine Atmosphäre seien einzig der Unterhaltung dienlich und mitnichten einer Heilung im eigentlichen Sinne zugedacht) das Verhältnis zwischen Sarah/Tracey (sehr schöne deutsche Stimme, zauberhaft, erdentrückt) und Greenwood als (wenn auch minimal) zwischenmenschlich (!) gefärbt präsentieren, ich würde nicht so weit gehen „erotisch“ zu sagen, aber ein winziger Hauch von Beziehungscharakter wohnet den befremdlichen Situationen vereinzelt inne, wie gesaget aber kommt Tracy, let‘s face it, bei den hochgradig tiefgründigen Ausführungen Francis‘ nicht annähernd mit, im süßen Jenseits spielt Sarah eine äußerst intelligente und feinfühlige junge Frau, Tracy dagegen (das kritisiere ich überhaupt nicht, es ist mir nur leider etwas fremd, wie „wir“ ihr eben – denn ja, in gewisser Weise regelt sie die Dinge deutlich besser als er, rein wohlfühltechnisch betrachtet dürfte sie ihm haushoch überlegen sein, aber ihr irritierter Blick sprach eben Bände und trägt nicht sonderlich zu einem Verständnis ihm gegenüber bei) in ihrem (– eigentlich verständlichen, außerdem wird auch sie schon ohnedies zur Genüge unter Stress stehen, auch ohne als Abendpsychologin zu fungieren, ...lediglich beim Musizieren offenbart sich ihre magische Seite, aber auch da bezweifle ich, ob sie die Klänge wirklich FÜHLT, oder ob sie nicht „einfach“ notenbrav erlernt worden sind –) Wunsche nach einem unbeschwerten und locker-beschwingten Teenager-Leben freilich, kann die komplexen Erzählungen Greenwoods, härtlich gesprochen, nicht ab, eine andere Theorie hingegen wäre: Sie KONNTE es, tat es aber derart lang, dass sie ihren Sinn für ihn mit der Zeit verlor und daher indessen nur noch mit (einmal immerhin feinfühlig) Kommste-auch-klar-Fragen reagiert/replisiert, hier können Sie Ihre interpretatorischen Flügel ausbreiten. Resümee: Ich will mir nicht erdreisten, sie als unterbelichtet darzustellen, denn das ist sie wahrscheinlich nicht und auch dann täte ich es ungern, sage lediglich: Seine Themen sind nicht ihre Welt, Punkt, aber entschuldigend: Wer wäre hier nicht überfordert?
Immerhin: Keineswegs uninteressant zeigt sich ihre Aussage, dass sie ihren Vater in Francis‘ Gegenwart nicht mag, also speziell wenn Greenwood mit von der Partie sei, seine Replik hierauf scheint sehr schräg, hier haben die beiden Personen gefühlt für einen Augenblick die Rollen getauscht...
ALLES ist im Puzzle verflochten, verwoben, das umfasst Erics ZU inniglich daherkommenden (stellenweise unangenehmen) Ansagen vor den Auftritten Christinas (Mia), die Situation seitens Francis sowieso etc., selten bis nie ist ein Filmdrama, selbst wenn von einem Zeitgenie wie Egoyan geschrieben, SO brillant bis ins kleinste Detail durchdacht und ausgetüftelt, gleichwohl zugleich , und der Planung zum Trotze, erstrahlt die WIRKUNG des Werkes hochgradig pur, emotional, echt und natürlich, ein Film zarter als jedwede Klaviatur, jede vermeintliche Kleinigkeit hat Einfluss auf die Dialoge und deren Stimmcharakter, etwa in Thomas‘ Büro die unterschwelligen Dschungelanspielungen betreffend, um nur ein Beispiel unter gefühlten Tausenden aufzugreifen, Bruce spielt seinen Francis unsagbar facettenreich und mimt die Vielfalt des menschlichen und irdischen Daseins, sowohl charmant und höflich agiert er als bisweilen auch durchaus streng, er kommuniziert sehr ruhig und besonnen, versteht es aber aus der Not heraus gleichsam, Thomas in Nervosität zu versetzen und mit kleinen bedrohlichen Spitzen auf eine nächste Ebene hinzuarbeiten, im Gesamtbilde agiert der Film dabei stets leise mithilfe der zärtlichsten Zeitlupen und dehnt besagte Szenenwirkung noch einmal über die Maßen aus, im Jahre 1994 (hierzulande: Januar 1995) erschien ein unvergessliches Meisterwerk, dessentwegen der Begriff „Faszinosum“ noch gar kein Ausdruck ist, um diesen seltsamen Seelensegelflug adäquat in Worte zu fassen, denn man KANN ihn nicht beschreiben, wer vermag das schon?, wie sollen SOLCHE Bilder angemessen in Worte gekleidet werden?, wie sollen Worte das malen können, was ich fühle?, es ist mir ein Rätsel, ein Rätsel mindestens so enigmatisch wie der eigentliche Film, aber auch wieder etwas anders.
Die Stadt wird in tiefdunkle Nacht getaucht und gehüllt und es ertönet das exotischste Stück aus dem zuvorigen Film „Calendar“ (die Kombination Danna/Egoyan ist wohl mit das künstlerisch Fruchtbarste, das jemals seinen Weg in Richtung einer Leinwand fand), bläulich und von Zartstichen getragen erleuchtet die nächtliche Odyssee als besagte tour de force der Herzen, „she‘s his angel“,
„sometimes he has to wait for her and sometimes she‘s waiting for him“, selbst die reißerischsten Szenen einer erst 19-jährigen Mia enthöben den Film in keiner einzigen Passage zu einer Schmuddelschau (was jetzt noch nicht einmal einen „moralischen“ Spruch darstellen soll, denn wenn der Film weniger Tiefgang besäße, würde ich ihn für Szenen dieser Art dennoch nicht vollends ablehnen, warum auch?, ein Hauch von Ehrlichkeit sollte durchaus gestattet sein, Ästhetik ist keine Untat, sofern sie respektvoll mit ihren Figuren umgeht), verträumt gleiten Greenwoods Augen dahin und folgen der Person der Erinnerung, Mia und er haben ein hochsensibles Verhältnis zueinander und hegen es fast rituell, wie man es in dieser Intensität selbst im hübschesten Kunstkino so gut wie nie zu Gesichte bekommt, speziell die (die ihre ebenfalls nahezu perfekt, aber was Greenwood in diesem Filme entbot, ist wahrlich absolute Höchststufe der darstellenden Kunst, schade nur dass es eine Rolle wie diese für ihn anschließend nie wieder hat geben sollen) seinige schauspielerische Diversität ist in ihrer bereits zur Sprache gekommenen Vielfalt eine einmalige Angelegenheit, nie wissen wir zudem, ob wir gerade dem strikten Finanzprüfer beiwohnen, dem sympathischen und respektvollen Familienvater, dem erotisierten Clubbesucher, dem charmanten Erpresser, dem zerbrechlich labilen Wesen ewiglichen Verlustes oder Anderswem, keine der Aussagen ist unzutreffend, am Ende des Tages aber überwöge der Schmerz und die Zustände der nicht gerade im Übermaße vorhandenen seelischen Stabilität erreichen einen neuen Höhepunkt und sind wirklich nicht die Widerstandskraft in Person (visuell schon eher), Exotica ist der bildgewordene Orkan der völligen Abwesenheit von Bedeutungslosigkeit, jedweder Lichtschalter (!) ist bedeutungsschwanger, kein einziges Detail kommt von Ungefähr, Egoyans Instinkt geleitete ihn zur Erschaffung des perfekten Films, zweimal hat dies gelingen und reüssieren sollen (1994 und 1997), ansonsten nicht selten zwar, aber nie wieder in exakt derselben Weise wie weiland in den 90er Jahren.
Erstmals löst Exotica, welcher sich zuvor ungefähr auf Platz 5 befand, „Élisa“ (1995) als Lieblingsfilm ab (erneut ein „E“-Film, dessen Titel lediglich aus einem einzigen Worte besteht, aus einem Namen, wenn auch diesmal nicht einer Person, sondern einer Örtlichkeit), das Werk legt den inszenatorischen Grundstein für das süße Jenseits (1997 gestaltete man die Welt des Verlustes allerdings naturgemäß, da nicht überwiegend in einem Etablissement spielend, etwas weniger kompromisslos, zumindest auf visueller Ebene, rein psychologisch gesehen nehmen sich die Filme hingegen nicht viel und bilden ohnedies eine einmalige Einheit zweier Perlen filmischer Gestaltungsnatur), ist bereits gleichermaßen perfektionsfreudig wie sein Nachfolger, vielschichtig auch die Leistung von Mia Kirshner erneut hervorzuheben, von strengem Bisse bis hin zur süßlichen Zartheit ist die Bandbreite ihrer Rolle enorm, sinnlich verkörpert sie den Rausch ihrer Umgebung und doch wissen wir um die deutlich umfassenderen Elemente ihrer Innenwelt, wie konnten unsere Figuren ALL DAS überleben?, jeder Hauch einer einzelnen Berührung seelischer wie physischer Art bedeutet in dem Filme „Exotica“ gefühlt fast mehr als ganze Leben es vermögen würden, so real spüren wir die Strömungen und Energien, als befänden wir uns direkt vor Ort, die Dialoge lassen uns genauso wenig kalt als betrachteten wir beispielsweise einen Film von Éric Rohmer, der Film ist genauso nah an der Liebe wie ein Zulawski, so subtil und gut strukturiert wie ein Polanski, so düster wie ein Marian Dora, David Lynch oder Robert Sigl, so schwebend wie ein ki duk, die Wahrheit Exoticas verbarg sich stets hinter den Farbenmeeren der Dekorationskünste, präsentiert wird eine widersprüchliche Welt irgendwo zwischen absoluter Offenheit und dennoch einem „You‘re not supposed to touch“, letztere Art von Kontakt böte Potential für eine von Koteas gnadenlos missbräuchlich verwandte Möglichkeit eines musikalisch orkanös untermalten Rausschmisses, welcher unseren Freund Francis auf direktem Wege auf die Straße der gewittrigen Nacht führt…, nächtens blüht die Welt mal wieder zu brutal.
Eines NACHTS (fürwahr, der gesamte Film ein Abendgedicht) philosophiert Eric für sich selbst im Exotica, MIT sich selbst, die entscheidende Frage aber, auf welche seine durchaus kontroversen Satzgebilde hinauslaufen, ist verblüffend simpel:
„Was isses‘?“
Im Kino des Atom Egoyan gibt es nur selten einen Kippschalter, fast niemand besitzt die Fähigkeit, vollends „abzuschalten“, die Nachdenklichkeit kann zuweilen geradezu ungebremst eine Endstufe erklommen haben und macht dennoch weiter als habe sie soeben erst begonnen, der Gipfel ist allgegenwärtig, die Gespräche zwischen Mia und Thomas (jawohl, nun Thomas, wie sie konstatierte: die Psychokonferenz) erweisen sich als außerordentlich berührend und bewegend, hochgradig emotional sitzt Greenwood derweil im Wagen, höret die Konversation, lauscht gebannt und präsentiert die schauspielerisch besten Passagen des gesamten Films, eine der bestgespielten Szenen der Filmgeschichte und in der klanglichen Untermalung einzigartig, ein Zitat wie (Nosferatu II) „Zeit ist ein Abgrund tausend Nächte tief“ würde auch nahezu perfekt zu Exotica passen, spüren Sie das Puzzle der Verschiebungen, der Verwicklungen, der Verrückungen zwischen Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft, einstmals rosig, später tot, künftighin ungewiss, Thomas sodann begäbe sich in stille Welten, zöge sich zurück, dorten dann versuchet Koteas dieselbe Form von Manipulation bei ihm walten zu lassen wie zuvor noch bei Bruce („you‘re with me?“), „she really seems to be herself with you“, erstmals füget er unmissverständlicher hinzu: „I used to be her lover.“, fürderhin wird er es wohl nicht mehr sein, nicht zu Unrecht rastet sie in seiner Gegenwart alsbald aus.
Vom (unklaren, verschwommenen) Ziele sind wir stets unweit entfernt, ihm aber dennoch NIE nahe, mal erscheint etwas „lösbar“, kurz darauf begänne die Suche von vorn, Sätze wie „There is no baby to sit“ bleiben haften, EVERYTHING taken away… , so ließe sich die Welt des Francis in wenigen Worten zusammenfassen, seine diplomatisierte Drohung „Make it your day“ Thomas gegenüber, ja, sie bildet einen weiteren recht extremen Moment, überhaupt ließe sich, wie ich finde, sagen:
Der gefühlt auf so gut wie jedem auch nur annähernd mysteriösen Schrottfilme abgedruckt werdende Satz „Nichts ist wie es scheint“ (man dächte etwa an den recht überraschenden abrazo zwischen Eric und Francis, tatsächlich haben diesen nur wenige Zuschauer vorhergesehen, dessen bin ich sicher) träfe auf nur sehr wenige Werke so sehr zu wie auf Exotica (bei vielen Filmen verheißt er genau das Gegenteil), Exotica, bei welchem (oder vielmehr dessen Regisseur) ich es durchaus bedaure, wenn fast ausschließlich über prätentiöses und verkopftes Strukturkino jenseits der Verständlichkeit parliert wird, dabei halten die Werke ihren Finger IMMER an den Puls und die Emotionen unserer Herzen, das traf auch schon auf frühe Werke wie etwa speaking parts zu (1989, Jubiläum, ein Oldtimer), Exotica ist keine intellektuelle Schlaftablette, sondern sagenhaftes Seduktionskino, wie es einfallsreicher und brillanter kaum im Bereiche des Möglichen läge, Verführung und Untergang gehen ironischerweise Hand in Hand durch des Filmes Feuer, wir leben einerseits für den Zauber der Momentaufnahme, aber dennoch ist dieser Effekt gepaart mit massiver Seelenqual emotionaler Exzesse, gegen Ende naht ein letzter Licht- und Rückblick in eine wohl bessere Zeit, damals half ER Mia, heute hingegen SIE ihm (nicht dass das möglich wäre, aber sie ist wirklich nah dran), sie hören einander stets zu und geleiten uns in Vollkommenheit in die schönste Abspannmusik der Filmgeschichte…

i’m so overly impressed by the unpredictability and the parallel narratives (multiple protagonists) of this film. it seems to have the right mix of everything: confusion, mystery, plot twists, closure, hardship, crime, seduction, along with great cinematography, performance, and score—not to mention positive and realistic representations of a gay man and a sex worker. it carries a classic 90’s drama style, but takes every aspect to the next level. as much as i’d like to keep this film all to myself and even “gatekeep” it, i continue to recommend it to almost everyone because it is so under-appreciated. seen this 5 times now and looking forward to every next watch!",5.0
"A dazzling, emotional mystery film that hugely impressed me with its emotional power whilst also feeling incredibly restrained. It's surreal, woozy atmosphere draws you in and creates a level of ambiguity that slowly unravels throughout the film.
However, unlike other mystery films I've seen, the twists in this film never feel cliched or forced. There is a really effortless nature to the way in which the film slowly reveals pieces of information that add to its emotional depth.
The ambiguity that the film presents also shows in its thematic choices. Whilst there are plenty of things to take in on the surface due to the difficult nature of the topics, there is plenty underneath each of the characters that links them together without them even realising. There's a real effortless nature to the way the film explores its characters and their journeys throughout which will stay with me on repeat viewings.
Overall it's a mesmerising picture, one that balances its ambiguity and atmosphere with fantastic story telling and character studies. It's a film that has aged wonderfully and will continue to age as time goes on, I for one will be revisiting many times in the future.",4.5

Exotica is my favorite kind of film: the kind that feels distinctly unlike any I've ever seen before. Completely unpredictable in how the story unfolds and how information is parsed out to the viewer, and finished off with excellent photography and a really unique score.
Others have written about the film's story with plenty of detail, so I won't go into great depth about its characters or plot other than to say that it's deeply humanistic and I love it for that. But I would like to say a few words about its really ingenious use of one-way mirrors as a motif.
One-way mirrors appear throughout the story; there's one in the very first shot. At first they appear to be primarily a visual device. In multiple instances their opacity is reversed as part of a transition, which is a really interesting effect that I don't think I've ever seen before.
But more than being unusual pieces of set dressing, the mirrors also serve as an ingenious metaphor for the story itself. Many of the events of the narrative are concerned with observation, characters monitoring each other without their knowledge. From across the room, over a wire, through their bank books. There's also a lot of artifice in their actions, as they stage events to reflect the reality that they would prefer, rather than the one that actually exists. A one-way mirror can show you yourself, but adjust the lighting and suddenly it can show you whatever you want. That's essentially what the whole story is about.
And, if you'll bear with me here, the one-way mirror can also be a metaphor for the viewer's experience as well. We enter the story at arm's length. We can see the characters, but we can't interact with them. Nor can they see us. They continue going about their lives as if we weren't watching, and without any obligation to explain to us why they do the things they do. We can only watch through the glass, like scientists, gathering data until we can understand what's going on.

"This film has one of the best opening 30 minutes I’ve ever seen. A film to rewatch if I ever try to make one. It’s all in the editing, editing scenes into on another, in those first minutes. Mimesis—repeater patters and foils—works powerfully on me. I want that unity, the memory of patterns, things reflecting one another, things that look very different at first all unifying... That’s art for me, and this film does that. Eggs, babies, exchanging money which mars an otherwise egalitarian social interaction, exotic objects of all kinds, looking at people through a one-way mirror. The list goes on. Good film. I’m glad that there are things that remain a little mysterious at the end.",4.0

"I watched this film about 5 hours ago and it kept me thinking.
Then I decided to watch it again just now.
I knew it was fantastic, but it really revealed itself to me on this rewatch.
This film is so deliciously bizarre. Exotic. Within that exoticism I found a lot of meaning.
I took the interactions in the film for face value on my first watch. As if they were normal interactions. But they’re not. They resemble normal interactions just enough to be passable (kind of?), but upon this rewatch it was as if the characters were constantly ""exposed"" psychologically and emotionally.
It can also be surprisingly humorous, like the moment with the coffee and the cream/milk!
“This has cream in it too.”
“It’s milk.”
“Oh. Oh good!”
The movie is incredibly different, but despite its tough subject matter, bizarre scenes and controversial themes, it still feels warm, inviting, and even very delicate. It reminded me of how a parent holds a newborn baby. A lot of care and fragility.
The director treats these characters’ flaws and traumas with the utmost respect and dives in with a non-judgmental curiosity. In a roundabout way, *through* the strange and exotic it made me feel acknowledged and at home.
That is pretty much the highest praise I can give a film.",5.0

"Kenneth Lonergan directs Twin Peaks. The score is seedy with a fanciful undertone and the core setting is an Elephant Bar qua strip club. So, I'm expecting violence, sex, some weird fetishes, maybe something demonic. And, the first act seems to deliver, if in an oblique way.
Right as I settled into the esotericism the film began its reveals, and didn't stop, all the way to the creepy-curious final shot which asks many more questions. The film asks for the audience's imputation. It shows the characters through a myopic lens, with an increasingly harmonious, though bizarre backdrop. There's a lot here on self-denial, custom, rituals - and crazy enough - chastity/modesty. A rewatch might reveal a religious element as well.",5.0

But as the film progresses and as we get to know these characters layer upon layer, the film changes into something else entirely. Basically, the erotic imagery and the sensationalism seduces you to watching it but then it becomes something more profound, more human and it absolutely knocked me over.

Didn't quite hit me the way that others have described, though I did find the gentle unfolding of the narrative to be quite eerie and potent. Bruce Greenwood turns in a very reserved but powerful performance. Everyone else was a little shaky, though they had their moments to shine. and shine they did! There were some powerful monologues, but also a few interactions that felt a little wooden in an uncanny way.

Analogies aside, Exotica is a masterful film that never fully exposes itself. I see that as both a pro and con, creating much of its allure in trying to unravel its mysteries. Through Atom Egoyan's great direction and especially Mychael Danna's mindblowing score, it creates a tone that I've never experienced in a film before.

"A very interesting film, one that is better than I expected it to be, and one that keeps unfolding for me the more I think about it.
We expect the film to be about sex, but actually it is about eros, which is a much larger matter. Egoyan plays with our expectations in this respect, as in that early scene in which he is paying Tracey for her babysitting, but we (or at least I) initially interpret it as a scene of prostitution. Francis is in a strip club, but what he is seeking is not really sexual; it is a longing for something that has been taken from him, and this is the main substance of the film.
The film is very much concerned with ways that we try to control eros: through contracts, through conventions; and with what happens when those controls fail. Are our conventions barriers to real human contact? Even if they are, are they perhaps still necessary? In what ways do we hide ourselves from others?
The film has been thoughtfully put together. Think, for instance, of the cases of parallelism between the club plot and the exotic pet shop plot:
- Zoe is pregnant; Thomas wears macaw eggs strapped around his waist
- there are one-may mirrors in both the club and the security gate
- the presence of macaws (at the pet shop, at the club, and even at the home of Francis' brother)
- the exchange of cash as an instrument of control (Thomas refusing to accept payment for tickets, Francis paying Christina and Tracey)
There is also the recurrence, throughout the story, of the phrase ""everybody knows"" -- in the Leonard Cohen song, most prominently, but also a number of other times.
The late scene outside the club, as Francis waits with a gun, is very beautiful. Egoyan shows us, in sequence, a shot of Francis embracing Eric, and then a shot of Eric embracing Christina; we are perhaps to understand that Francis is, at this moment of catharsis, embracing Christina, as though they are Russian dolls, recovering, in a moment of catharsis, the thing he has lost.",4.0

"Well, this is very exotic",0.0
"Exotica is a remarkable achievement with a perfectly structured story and a lush, ubiquitous symbolism that does not bother at all. It also has something of a charade or puzzle, but I think the director only relies partly on the enigmatic character of the scenes and the motivations of those involved in them, the accent falling equally on the atmosphere (one of deep sadness, of diffuse sorrow) and the feelings of the characters – that's all the more so by half their story becomes quite clear. The film is undoubtedly a pessimistic one, as long as it shows how life systematically contradicts limited, unrealistic and therefore ... exotic ideas that we make about happiness, perfection, and comfort, but it is a tame pessimism by the conclusion that it is better to accept the painful truth and thus (re)become a man than to pretend that truth does not exist and, therefore, turn into... a green parrot.",4.0
It gets better every time 😱,5.0
"Exotica is a film about repetition, self-reflection, fantasy, voyeurism. There is an abundance of one-way mirrors in this film, though these aren’t limited to the literal panes installed in various scenes. Each character, with seemingly limited relevance to one another initially, weave together not only narratively, but thematically. They all long for something they consider essential, and try to force this thing to life in vein, revealing the depths of their person in the process. Revelation is an essential word when discussing the film at large, as it is Egoyan’s main mode of narrative tension. The motivations and actions of characters are left intentionally vague. Hints can be picked up on, but these are left to the viewer to interpret; the audience will each respond to these images differently, and so construct their own fantasy. This fantasy, like those of the characters within the film, will unravel as Egoyan plays his hand. Exotica manages this without ever falling into pretension or overt obfuscation – it caries itself with an enviable grace, and is all the more watchable for it.",4.0
"The story has two dovetailing strands. There's Bruce Greenwood's traumatized tax agent who tries to get over the murder of his daughter (for which he was for a time falsely accused of) by going to Exotica, a high-class strip club where he has a strange (and platonic) relationship with a dancer whose shtick is dressing up like a schoolgirl. And then there's Don McKellar (the hilarious Darren Nichols from Slings & Arrows) playing a repressed exotic pet dealer, investigated by Greenwood. Also watch for young Victor Garber and even younger Sarah Polley. Egoyan creates the film in editing, pacing it non-chronologically as revelations of the heart. The relationships are mysteries but obviously important, and only by the end do we understand why the characters are who they are. It's masterful and surprisingly touching. Don't let the sordid subject matter put you off.",4.5
"Perfect sound design that kind of twists, and throbs in your ears, eliding into music and back again.

It's a fine enough movie, but the glowing reviews many have given it confound me.",3.0
"A perfect piece of art on film. A mysterious, sensual, melancholic trip that keeps the audience guessing; but never really satisfies in the traditional cinematic sense.

"Forget Shawshank, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump 'cause this 1994 film blows all of them out the water. This is a gut-punch of raw emotion and nuanced characters, toying with assumptions and destroying any semblance of predictable writing.

The performances are absolutely wonderful. Eric's character could've gone so wrong but Elias Koteas is incredible in the role - there's less room for disaster with Francis and Christina, but that doesn't mean that their performances aren't as good.
This is T E R R I F I C.",5.0
"From the very opening shot, Exotica gives its viewers a taste of what’s to come. A hypnotizing pan while Mychael Danna’s “Something Hidden” plays melodiously in a somber yet jazzy tone. This atmosphere carries on as the film introduces entirely different characters going through various challenges in their life—Thomas is a man who tries to find a living by owning and handling a shop with exotic animals, and is thereafter found watching productions of Romeo and Juliet as if he’s looking for someone, and Francis is a seemingly ordinary accountant who, mostly every night, visits this high-class strip club called ‘Exotica’ to exchange conversation with a stripper dressed like a school girl named Christina.
The film is like a tease, there are quite a lot of mysterious subplots unfolding around the characters, but it never bothers answering any of them. It is a puzzle that leaves everything up to the viewer to connect its strange pieces; people view it as a murder mystery, but I view it more as a testament to the mystery of human nature. It is very much well established from the start that these characters seem to have so few in common, but there’s this potential gravity that seems to pull them together, and that is the mystery the film tries to exhibit. How the human nature is unorthodox, and how everything feels so arbitrary until the lives of two people intersect, and in this case, in a classy and jazzy Toronto strip club.
There are six main players in this story—Thomas, Francis, Christina, Eric, Zoe, and Tracey. Everyone is caught up with their own lives at the start until strange little coincidences mysteriously put each in their own respective relativity from each other. The entire film has a very eerie tone of dolefulness, as if there is something going on behind the curtain. This is emphasized by the two-way mirror, and as the film progresses, it gradually reveals characters backgrounds and histories thought to be concealed, and by the time it reaches its third act, the artfulness of its mystery hit me in a profound manner as I realized the subjective reasons on why characters did some eccentric decisions during the rising action. Again, this is all theory, as the film never fully gives any answer, but the thought is there; the idea of how a past tragedy can creep up on one like a smooth finger tracing one’s spine, how the idea of sex and paid prostitution can never heal the scars of the past, and how prejudice can quickly lead to anger, and soon, murder.
The way this film deals with its themes of loneliness are handled maturely with elements of trying to replace that feeling with physical pleasures. Everyone might seem ordinary at the start, but once it reaches the end, it shows how everyone is scarred, how everyone has dealt with tragedy and is trying to cope with it by trying to live life’s entertainment. Each of these characters has something to say, and the grayness of each just astounds me. From the seemingly young and innocent girl to the older but experienced DJ, these set of characters is a prime example of excellent characterization bounded by human nature, not human caricatures.
At what at first seems like a murder mystery-themed Showgirls turns into something deep and sincere. Exotica is certainly not what I expected it to be, but in the best way possible. It explores something hidden, a plethora of mature themes affecting a group of seemingly unrelated people while still being in that atmosphere of surreal jazziness and peculiarity as if there’s something not right, as if there’s something out of place. The entire film is like an artwork waiting to be interpreted; every single detail is in there but merely judging it at a first glance won’t do, as single-handed prejudice leads to more bewilderment that spirals down into a rabbit hole of hypnotic dancing accompanied by Danna’s smooth and unfurling tones of a gloomy and murderous ambiance of something-not-right in the air.",4.5
"For me, this is one of those films that simply requires two viewings before even beginning to properly articulate it. I was really liking what this film was offering—the strange nocturnal mood, the loaded visuals, the acting, and hypnotic exotic score, etc.—but because so many character motivations are kept in the dark until the final third, I found it difficult to properly engage with. It may have also been because I watched it in the middle of the day – not particularly helpful for a film that takes place almost entirely at night. There is no grand reveal or climax of sorts, which the film is falsely building up to, just an understanding of the characters is gained. In that sense, it's like a twist ending without a discernible twist. So yeah, I definitely need to get round to re-watching this in the next few weeks. If anything to slip back into its odd otherworldly mood, but to hopefully gain a better understanding.",0.0
"felt very much like a 90s cronenberg film, what with its stilted rhythms and chilly formalism (must be a canadian thing). differs thematically though in that psychic traumas aren't manifested via flesh but rather through the characters' schematic coping rituals -- grief kept at bay through measures both routine and unorthodox. it's engaging enough at first but by the time the big narrative revelations start rolling in during the third act, egoyan's off-kilter sensibilities have largely lost me and those big narrative revelations subsequently fail to leave much of an emotional impression. still, i'm curious as to the large gulf that exists between my own viewing experience and other letterboxd users'; most describe this film in glowing terms that would suggest A Profound Experience of Art. obviously i can't say the same so i might have to revisit this at some point in the future just to offset the dissonance. in the meantime, file this under ""of purely academic interest""",3.0
"""Everybody knows the boat is leaking. Everybody knows the captain lied.""
What a totally entrancing film this was. I enjoyed The Sweet Hereafter quite a bit when I saw it years back, but this really brought me somewhere. I'm not sure where to start on the performances in this ensemble, they're all moving and brilliant, but it was once again (after Cronenberg's Crash) that Elias Koteas really impressed me the most. Though nobody really puts a foot wrong.
The motifs are all quite brilliant as well; the two-way glass, the trapped animals, the luminescent green, parrots, they all serve the main narrative as visual cues for thinking about voyeurism and the difference between watching and touching.
The best thing a film can ever do is challenge me and make me consider my own relationship to the world around me, and this certainly did that. I began to question cinema as an act of voyeurism, how I've coped with losses in my life, and what fatherhood means to me. This is what a great film does. Thank you, Atom Egoyan.",5.0

I understand that Egoyan dislikes audition for his actors, preferring to select them on past work (preferably theatre work) and then presenting them with the part. In that way they take ownership of the character and we get to experience a very emotional tale. A list of the more difficult themes in which this film engages would put off many and that the main location is a posh strip club might seem an obstacle for many. Nevertheless this is an important, beautifully shot film in which seemingly minor moments turn out to have great significance, first for one and then another. Mesmerising with perfect direction, camera work, acting and music. I cannot praise this work of art more highly.",5.0
"My first foray into this director's body of work and I'm rating it a 5 on impulse; rarely has a film in recent years had the emotional impact on me this one did. A brilliantly and tragically woven tale of several seemingly disparate lives that comes together as the timeline is revealed in a smart non-linear fashion - not entirely unlike P.T. Anderson's Magnolia or Robert Altman's Short Cuts - through the film to its haunting conclusion. Brilliant acting and performances throughout, especially the characters of Francis and Christina. I'm sure I will have more to say about this with repeat viewings and some time, but needless to say I am beyond impressed and recommend it highly.",5.0
"Skillfully constructed narrative flow with just enough information being fed to keep interest piqued. The characters are all mysterious from the start and most of the information just creates false assumptions. And when you do find out the actual truth it's generally screwed up in a different way than you expected.
The thing that makes it all work is the detached dreamy atmosphere, especially in the titular club. It's a sleazy club with disturbing characters and the grossest presenter, but it ends up feeling almost entirely unsexualized. Perhaps it's partly just the look and feel of Canadian indies from the 90s, but it is a perfect match for the themes of symbiotic voyeuristic comfort.",4.0

Tak seperti film-film yang suka 'menjual' adegan seksi sebagai bumbu cerita, justru Exotica berjalan selaras dengan premisnya yang tajam. Dengan konflik kronik dari karakter utamanya, Exotica sukses menjadi film yang menghibur, menggoda dan twist yang tak terbayangkan. Keren!",4.0
"This definitely falls in the category of films where the less you know the better. What starts out as a seemingly noir-y, seductive drama gradually unfolds it's plot until the by the end everything you assumed at the start has turned out to be false.
And it is the plot that's the main draw here, Atom Egoyan really does keep the audience waiting with regards to exposition and in doing so constantly makes you recalibrate what's actually going on. Consider the flashbacks to the scenes in the field which are at first jarring, then they gradually work their way into the plot before delivering the final twist right at the end that makes the viewer question everything they'd already seen.
But what really sets it apart is the empathy it feels for its damaged characters and the loneliness they have. It's centrally about people who desperately want to make a connection with someone else but pursue it in ways that only further put them at a distance. Which was pretty much the last thing I expected from a strip club film.",5.0
"There's a complex depiction of male/masculine desire here – all the visual rhymes (the schoolgirl outfit, the hands holding money, the walls separating the characters, the voyeuristic gaze of a seating person), the construction around the human body (desiring and desired) and the barriers of physical contact, etc. The film's intricate cinematic discourse stands as a very interesting achievement.
Sadly all this work ends up limited by the strict male gaze that organizes the whole thing. In the end it's all about men struggling to council the paradoxes of a patriarchy we, as oppressors, built and still maintain. Women seems to exist only on the basis of an unescapable sexualization of their body and soul. What about women that chooses not only to have nothing to do with female eroticism but, unlike Zoe, decides to fight this objectification? They have no place in this film, worse yet, they seem to have no real option to scape their ""fate"" of being an object to male desire and control, afterall the film seems to point out that it is only up to men the resolution of this problem (the two opposites hugging each other in the end, as if an equilibrium was finally achieved). If men trespass the invisible (and moral) barrier (touching), women deals with it as an understanding and passionate performer, always ready to give ""the suffering men"" a second chance on their ""cruel"" journey.
‘Exotica’ seems to unconsciously impose and universalize men's perspective on a matter that concerns and affects women in a most cruel, constant and direct way.",3.5
"Interesting opening credits. Interesting cast. Interesting use of Leonard Cohen's song. But in totality, just above average. The film deals with a set of characters, each having some sort of a psychological problem. Visually strong, but content-wise very weak. Don McKellar who plays Thomas is made to resemble director Egoyan. Is there some autobiographical connection hidden in there?",3.5
"Exotica is a fascinating mosaic of mood and intrigue. The film follows a spider-web of characters anchored by an otherworldly strip club called - you guessed it - Exotica. Maybe the word ""otherworldly"" suggests supernatural undertones - I don't mean it to. But it's the key location of the film and it carries a strange ambiance that feels separate from real life. It's the kind of place people go to get away from their pains or just to escape a mundane reality, either to enjoy titillation or, in the case of Bruce Greenwood's character, to confront their demons in the shape of a stripper dressed like a school girl. All of this is often set to the funeral-funk sound of Leonard Cohen.
Egoyan's story is a slippery one but never is it confusing. Ambiguous, yes, but never unsatisfying. He wisely reveals the connections between characters out of chronology, through flashbacks (or maybe they are memories?) It's a film which haunts and captivates you. While watching it I felt myself fall under a spell. There's a world to this film, a world of emotions and tragedy. Egoyan's approach is never fantastic or showy but, as I keep saying, there's something strange and dream-like about Exotica. You can't help but keep watching. You need to know why these characters are so fucked up. They are all orbiting something deeply hidden and we want to know what it is. It's strange in that even the slightest connection would have been satisfying but the conclusion Egoyan arrives at is everything you want it to be and more. You suddenly have to think again about characters you'd previously judged. Almost as soon as the credits rolled I knew this was a film I would have to see again to completely unlock.
There isn't a single weak link in this cast. Many of them are faces we don't see much anymore beyond supporting roles in big blockbusters directed by filmmakers who I suspect were deeply touched by Egoyan's influence in their formative years (looking at you JJ Abrams). Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas are still familiar characters actors while Mia Kirshner, who is so incredible here, seems to have transitioned into starring in acclaimed TV shows I've yet to see. There's also Sarah Polley and Don McKellar who have blossomed into accomplished filmmakers in their own right. In short, everyone holding Exotica together has something special to offer. As for Atom Egoyan, this is the first film of his I've seen. It won't be the last.",4.5
"EXOTICA is moody and interesting but too distant for my tastes. There's a lot of early mystery and innuendo that doesn't really spin into very much. A lot of the creative decisions are great for atmosphere but bad for audience engagement - the dream state conjured by the incessant clubby soundtrack and the neon lights (club signs, fish tanks) filling every frame, the careful, elliptical revelation of plot, repetitive, oft-whispered lines of dialogue. But I could never really get into the story, which seemed over as soon as it started. And despite the emphasis on mood, it felt like the sort of movie that would go in one ear and out the other. It's skillfully made, but never grabbed me.",2.5
"The box claims obsession to be this film's main theme, no that's wrong. This is a film about ritual, and what it means to give a service versus a true relationship– it's very important when money changes hands. Obsession's there too, but it's more epiphenomenal then anything else. Above all, this is a puzzle box movie, that slowly unfurls in front of the viewer just fast enough to allow the audience to think they figured it out. Atom Egoyan, Chloe does not mean you are a hack.",5.0
"A screwed-up film about how we always assume everyone else is more screwed-up than we are. We are all guilty of that, of failing to see abnormal behavior as a mask for pain, fear or intellect — weirdos are just weird, d'oh. This is a ""puzzle film"" of unsuspecting sensitivity, and I say it's screwed-up only because of the story's implications, not because of anything seen. Four stars seems on the low side, for me, given Exotica's empathy and deconstruction of we're-all-connected narrative tropes (the wave of which arrived a decade after this film, no less). But the greatness here snuck up on me at the very end and after, when I considered what it was saying so obliquely, so softly. Another viewing is needed, whereupon I should feel comfortable addressing this with the praise it deserves.",4.0
"Atom Egoyan is the master of detached psychological drama, and in Exotica, he creates a fascinating study of damaged people, all of whom are longing for things they can't have, or have lost. Egoyan delivers on the promise he made in the raw Speaking Parts by fully fleshing out his intertwining characters, each with an agenda and a secret.
The beginning is purposely ambiguous, with connections and relationships between characters unclear. As the film progresses, each mystery is slowly revealed, one by one, each with its own moment of revelation. As a clearer picture takes shape, a larger tapestry is created, connecting the characters and exposing their motivations, all the way until the final, powerful main plot is finally explained.
As always, Egoyan creates a mood, a cold environment where people stay at arm's length, always trying to move closer and find connection. The tax auditor (Greenwood) who has a curious and unusual obsession with an exotic dancer (Kirschner) is at first seen as somewhat sleazy, then rather pathetic, until he is redeemed when his motivations are revealed.
Egoyan does a fantastic job of keeping the players' information just beyond our realm of knowledge, which keeps the revelations from becoming contrived. Exotica is compelling viewing: a tale of desires unfulfilled, and ultimately, how pure love is the real motivation.",4.5

"It feels like every second indie/auteur project from the 1990s had the multiple characters intersecting, non linear storytelling approach, and it feels pretty tired by now. Exotica however uses it fairly well, avoiding the melodrama and contrivance that so often comes with it - although it doesn't completely distinguish itself from countless other films of the period. It's a touching film about loneliness and struggling with trauma and the past. It's shot really well and has a downbeat, mesmerising tone. Definitely worth seeing",4.0

Well, the layers come off, the characters come more into focus; larger elements, emotional, deep sensations take hold. Truly a remarkable work that at times feels uncertain about how to tell the story, but it wasn't the story, it was me who was a bit uncomfortable.

"“The panopticon is a design of institutional building with an inbuilt system of control, originated by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. The concept is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single corrections officer, without the inmates knowing whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single guard to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched motivates them to act as though they are all being watched at all times.“

"A haunting mosaic of seperation, voyeurism, repetition, sexuality, and lost identity.
I'm a bit in awe of how much this film manages to tackle, while rarely scrutinizing or analyzing it further. Just an outside observer in the depths of human emotion and unspoken interdependence between traumatized people. The objectification and infantlization of Christina, from both the average patrons of the club, Eric, Francis, and even Zoe to a degree all for differing reasons.
The distance in the shots is great, the bathroom sealing Francis from Eric, the two way mirrors sealing Zoe from Christina, and the microphone concealing Francis from Thomas. This film seeks not to overanalyze, but to be an open look into wounds that manifest in different ways. How we use repetitious and seemingly nonsensical rituals to cope with our traumas. And how a closed society brings us to our most disconnected means of dealing with them.
I also appreciate, how just like all of these other feelings: the queerness of our characters is presented, but not heavily proded at. We see two characters struggling with sexuality as much as their other traumas, but general trauma is at the forefront and queer trauma isn't weighted further for shock or otherization. I thought this was a haunting and beautiful piece, that I'll have to rewatch to fully grasp the weight of.",4.5

Once again, I did not want to cheat with my Canada entry for this challenge. I wanted to do some real maple syrup, aboot type shit. I decided to choose a film on my watchlist that I was interested in from Criterion’s selection of Erotic Thrillers (easily one of the best types of Thriller)
What I wasn’t prepared for was one of the most compelling and emotionally complicated films I’ve seen. Egoyan absolutely nailed the atmosphere and insight of this film out of the park, participating in the foundational themes and aesthetics of the erotic thriller while already adding his own flavors to it. People saying it’s Cronenberg-esque but I feel like that’s Canadaphobic. Regardless, this was an excellent demonstration of storytelling and intertwined relationships, while maintaining a great urban noir world. 
Also: You cannot convince me otherwise that Bruce Greenwood and Sam Neill are different people. Both of those guys could be in this film switching scenes back and forth and you’d have at least SOME trouble telling which is which. More celebrities should do that",5.0

"Fulfilling desires is a transactional agreement among strangers, and even acquaintances. It's why prostitution is often referred to as ""the world's oldest profession"". Consider: ""Person A"" wants something from ""Person B"", but Person B doesn't want to give it. Person A knows that Person B wants something that Person A can give in exchange, so ultimately Person B agrees. And thus economics was born. This thought underscores the entirety of Atom Egoyan's erotic drama, Exotica. Following several people whose lives intersect in and around a strip club in Toronto named ""Exotica"", the movie is a quiet meditation on the awkward ways with which we interact with people when we want something that we cannot have in our everyday lives.
Exotica is one of those movies released in the Nineties that quietly snuck under the radar for many. I blame the overly salacious trailer that treats the story like a trashy skin flick, which--despite the setting--couldn't be farther from reality. Exotica is a tale deeply saturated in sadness, from start to finish. It isn't because the women in the strip club--like the beautiful yet jaded Christina (Mia Kirshner)--are exploited...that is, they aren't exploited any more than anyone else who takes off their clothes for money. No, it's because the main characters in Exotica are each afflicted with desires that are largely elusive for them. (Out of necessity to explore the meaning of the story, spoilers follow.) Let's begin with pet store owner and amateur exotic macau smuggler, Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), because this is where the movie begins. Thomas is awkward at every step in the film, including his choice of attire, which always looks like it is worn to make him into someone who he isn't. Thomas makes repeated visits to the ballet, where he scalps tickets to would-be attendees. And Thomas is a closeted homosexual; in each instance, he specifically offers to sell his ""extra"" ticket to a handsome man, and the suggestion is that after each show, there may be more ""transactions"" to be had between them. For Thomas, there are at least two (probably more) things which he wants but does not openly declare: a one-night stand with a man and supplemental income from his exotic egg smuggling, implied to be to help support his late father's failing pet shop. Then there is Francis Brown (Bruce Greenwood), a tax auditor who is inspecting discrepancies in Thomas' books, and who himself makes frequent visits to Exotica, where he always requests Christina to dance at his table. Their interactions are intense, but not overtly sexual. He uses this time with Christina to exorcise the trauma from losing his daughter; she was murdered two years prior. Christina's routine of dancing in a schoolgirl outfit feeds into Francis' delusions, so that he can summon his daughter back once more, and so that he can ""protect"" her from further harm. When he says this to Christina, is he talking about his daughter or Christina? Francis also simulates his past life before the tragedy by hiring his niece, Tracey (Sarah Polley), to ""babysit"" his house while he is at the club. Implied to be a part of their arrangement, Tracey practices her music so that when he comes home, it can be as though his daughter were still alive. Francis is a widower; his wife died in a car accident after he discovered that she was having an affair with his brother, Harold (Victor Garber)--Tracey's father--who was left wheelchair bound afterward. Christina--like the other dancers--will dance at a guest's table for five dollars, with the rule being that there is to be no touching the dancer as they perform. Francis pays Christina and Tracey for their respective contributions to quelling his personal demons. And when Francis needs assistance to infiltrate the club later, he coerces Thomas into being his mole by offering to conceal his tax evasion in turn. And finally there is Eric (Elias Koteas), the DJ for Exotica, who introduces each new dancer with enticing statements about their sex appeal, giving special attention to Christina. This is because both of them met while students--during simpler times--and became lovers. At some point, however, the implication is that Christina then took up with the owner of Exotica, a woman named Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), who is pregnant with Eric's baby; and all three of them still work together at the club. Eric supposedly has agreed to ""never lie"" to Christina, but in key moments he conceals the truth through vague or pointed dialogue. He also stalks the hidden chambers around the club, spying on patrons while commenting over the loudspeakers into his microphone about his observations in nonspecific ways. Eric harbors resentment that Christina appears to want everyone except for him, and schemes to sabotage her work, with Francis becoming collateral damage. For Eric, despite being the voice of Exotica, he has nothing with which to barter, and so he could be considered the film's ""antagonist"", constantly undermining the transactional efforts of others.
Exotica is a movie with strong visual motifs, either deliberately speaking to the characters' motivations or subverting them. The most outstanding example of this is the constant exchange of currency, largely by Francis. Francis is successful enough to afford him the luxury of a fine house, a nice suit, and time to spend at Exotica. He shows his gratitude for services by handing young women money; isn't this a form of ""prostitution"", even though there is no exchange of sexual favors? I say this, even though Christina puts on the show of an exotic dance for all of her clients, including Francis. As the relationship between them isn't fully established until the ending, it would appear at first glance as though Francis is motivated by Christina's sexuality, and yet it couldn't be farther from the truth. When the jealous Eric taunts Francis incognito to touch Christina, it gets Francis thrown out of the club...violently, and more importantly, by Eric himself. Eric, Zoe, and Christina all agree that he ""broke the rule"", but they mean this in differing ways. For Eric, it was a deliberate ploy to end something he could not enjoy himself, while for Zoe the rule allows her to maintain a semblance of control over the vision her mother had about the club, which she desperately tries to keep consistent with that vision. (Interestingly, both Zoe and Thomas seem bound by the enterprises of their deceased parents.) But for Christina, it goes deeper. When Thomas is sent into the club with a wire on Francis' behalf, Christina divulges that Francis has reciprocated things for her, explained to an extent in the ending. In a sense, Francis and Christina's relationship was more ""pure"" than any other. She was the original babysitter to his daughter, yet it is implied that she had a troubled home life. Francis offered to be her confidant out of nothing more than kindness...and yet he ultimately pays her for watching his daughter at the end of the car ride back to her house. Every time Francis offers money, it seems to reduce these young women into nothing more than agents for Francis' need, despite his best intentions. In this, Exotica offers a critical commentary on the inherent dangers of a society that uses money to compel others into doing something that they wouldn't ordinarily do. This is also found in the way Thomas uses ballet tickets to entice other men--all implied to be gay--into an engagement, with the implication of sexual favors in return. Thomas only gets the idea for this after sharing a cab ride from the airport with a businessman (Peter Krantz) who give him a pair of tickets because he can no longer attend, suggesting that he scalp them if he doesn't want to go himself. The man asked Thomas if he likes ballet, and somewhere deep down, Thomas' urges were no doubt stirred into thinking that he might be getting solicited himself--and the idea was planted. The whole act of scalping the tickets feels as though it were a part of a facade for cruising, a masquerade for certain men looking for romance without coming out and saying so. This role-playing routine of buying and selling ballet tickets becomes a kind of ritual, not that dissimilar to the ritual of exotic dancing performed at Exotica by nubile women in various states of undress for men in suits, prepared to pay to transform their fantasies into reality by degrees.
The other strong visual motif in Exotica comes by way of one-way mirrors. This is evidenced from the very beginning of the film when a customs officer (Calvin Green) watches Thomas through the glass. His colleague advises him to treat everyone as though they were trying to hide something, and to pay close attention to people's behavior--a key statement that informs the rest of Exotica, as it happens. Thomas gazes deep into the mirror--at his own reflection--while the officer feels as though he were staring at him. It is ironic, then, that the two should meet later at the ballet, each of them connecting with the other while looking to obtain something they subconsciously know that the other can offer. (Although I would be hard pressed to imagine a customs officer so thoroughly dedicated to seizing contraband as to go as far as this one does!) The other one-way mirrors are to be found in the club itself, from which both Eric and Zoe spy on Christina specifically, aroused by the performance she gives for her clients. For both of them, there is something even more erotic about the act of watching than participating. Zoe later reveals that these halls were built not as she originally indicated--by her mother to keep her dancers safe--but at the behest of a wealthy patron who wanted to watch the dancers for this very same reason. Film always has an inherently voyeuristic quality. We watch actors perform for our enjoyment, through which we glean a greater understanding about the human condition, in all of its myriad forms. As with movies ranging from Peeping Tom to Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this makes us complicit in the acts performed within the film, although we always have that safety net to stop the movie whenever it gets too difficult or challenging. So in a sense, the television becomes a ""one-way mirror"" into a world staged to satisfy our own desires. And, yes, this also often comes with the exchange of money for the privilege. The idea that one person is in control and that the other is the receiver of the controller's message is revisited when Eric suggests to both Francis then Thomas to touch Christina. He plants an idea that he wants to see manifest, and the others perform for him because he has motivated them to do so. You have to question just how much of our lives has been manipulated by others? Similar to the one-way mirrors and movies themselves, Eric becomes the ""director"" of the events on stage at ""Exotica"", and we watch the performance, influenced and affected by these events, which in turn ask us to consider just what they symbolize. And like the patrons of the club, once the show is over, we walk back out onto the streets of life with a new perspective, pointed toward a new destination by the director of the performance. Has the veil of artifice been peeled away from our eyes, or has it merely been replaced?
Recommended for: Fans of a complex and nuanced psychological drama deceptively packaged as sleazy ""Skinemax"" fare, at least if its spurious trailer is any indication. Exotica raised important questions about key elements of modern society, from the psychological cost of commerce to our inherent desire to watch and control events around us, even when we aren't directly involved--because each of us is a member of the audience of the world.",5.0

Tout est dans la subtilité (sauf visiblement le décor super kitsch du club et le mix douteux entre la forêt tropicale et une écolière qui danse sur du Leonard Cohen) et dans l’intelligence du dialogue et de l’agencement temporel, offrant au spectateur des indices laissés jamais au hasard. 
Exotica ensorcelle en rendant attachants des personnages qui n’ont en apparence rien pour l’être, en évoquant avec virtuosité les effets dévastateurs des pires drames humains. La figure du miroir à sens unique, ouvrant le film et revenant de façon récurrente, est brillante, et crée une mise en abyme d’une force rarement égalée. 
Le film joue avec notre capacité à nous faire des scénarios, en nous amenant finalement ailleurs. La scène finale (difficile à décrire sans rien révéler) est déstabilisante.

"The way all the characters connect in this erotic web of a film is so tender and well-observed that it’s almost surprising that the setting is so sexy and vibrant. Every actor here kills it as they inhabit such well-crafted characters that almost all end up effecting the other’s life in some way be it massively or quietly. Mia Kirshner is especially fantastic as a schoolgirl-themed stripper that has to contend with one man who is possessively obsessed with her and another who’s helplessly, emotionally dependent. I don’t like it quite as much as “The Sweet Hereafter” but it’s definitely the second best Atom Egoyan film I’ve seen.",4.5

"a movie about a father who grieves losing his daughter by going to a strip club to meet a dancer dressed as a schoolgirl sounds like a movie I'd stay away from and never like, but for some reason I did! I can't certainly say it isn't just a question of perception, but it's so interesting to me how, while Francis and his struggle are the main focus of the movie, all the attention shifts to Christine. her being controlled by men in her life, her being uncomfortable with having to dress up as a child, and her clearly having an unstable background. 
thanks to Mia Kirshner's great performance, Christine turns into the most interesting and captivating character on screen. all of this reads as a bunch of men trying to solve their problems by putting her at the center of their lives. somebody they perceive as a ""savior,""  somebody they want to complete them. when Francis touches her, he spends the rest of the movie trying to prove he was provoked to do it and setting up revenge schemes. in all the twists and turns, one thing stays the same: he touched her. he knew the rules, but he still did. it looks almost absurd how far a man can go to prove that he sometimes doesn't really have atonomy. 
I have no problem with the movie being the way that it is. it's beautitul, creepy, feels like a long nightmare, and makes you very uncomfortable. but I may have a problem if people are sympathizing with Francis when there's a clearer story of trauma in here. ",4.5
"""Great Movie"" - 14/362 🌟⭐️

After taking a day to process my thoughts, Exotica (1994) continues to linger in my mind, its intricacies demanding reflection. Describing the experience of this film is a challenge. it's a cinematic gem, showcasing a unique and captivating form of direction. Initially, viewers are thrust into a narrative where the characters' motivations remain elusive. Yet, as the story unfolds, a fuller understanding emerges, fundamentally altering perceptions. Characters whom I initially despised or misunderstood underwent a complete transformation by the film's conclusion, revealing the depth of their intentions. The seemingly straightforward relationships between characters belie their complexity, offering a poignant message about withholding judgment and allowing time for genuine understanding.

😱🤨🧐
Exotica (1994) may not appeal to everyone, particularly those averse to slower-paced narratives. The film's enigmatic nature, filled with cryptic flashbacks, may initially perplex viewers. However, this confusion serves a purpose, director Atom Egoyan masterfully crafts an atmosphere of uncertainty, inviting audiences to unravel the mysteries concealed within. Despite the initial bewilderment, I found myself utterly captivated by the unfolding intrigue. As the perplexing climax arrives, it's met with a flurry of emotions, eventually giving way to a profound sense of comprehension and melancholy. Exotica (1994) is the type of film that warrants revisiting, each viewing promises a richer experience, as the layers of its 104 mysterious minutes slowly unravel.",4.5

"tells us that humans (men?) build patterns to return to that one ephemeral 'true' moment. if you are a woman your image (mirror, veil) will repeat itself as mask under a violence that feeds on itself and slips past you. the schoolgirl, the mother. even though egoyan crafts a film of profound distance and individualization, of projection and disconnect it ends on a note of tenderness. a touch inside the simulation.

Nah foreal now. This was super bomb. I haven’t seen something in a hot minute that actually pulled me straight in and established another perspective in its world which is you! And me! Ahhh! Lmao idk. Film was extremely immersive in its stylistic and thematic creation, like you wouldn’t know (in a way) that this film was Canadian, which is like cool as a conceptual piece of art for-sure though can also be seen as like independent exploitation in its ignorance to its own nation. I don’t really have a take on Canadian nationalist films so fuck it it was just a dope ass movie. 
Elias Koteas remains a fucking legend just hope no one ever gives him a Jose Canseco baseball bat when fighting him.

"É como um Short Cuts ou Magnólia (por ser não-linear e retratar vidas se contrapondo e se [re]encontrando), que acompanha um grupo de pessoas deprimidas e sem perspectivas. As principais diferenças são que os motivos para a apatia vão sendo aludidos através de insights poéticos do diretor Atom Egoyan e o número de personagens correlacionadas é menor. A estrutura usada aqui também é bem críptica, como se o filme fosse um grande enigma sem pressa alguma em se revelar, tocado com um certo grau de suspense e obscuridade. Nesse sentido, os sentimentos transparecem de maneira crua, para além da prerrogativa temática ou da fotografia em tons de azul, mas a coesão da abordagem e a estética soturna corroboram com um cenário melancólico.",4.0

I guess the only thing it was lacking in a little bit for me was the plot. It’s pretty simple and you kind of just end up in the same place the movie starts. Definitely recommend seeing it at least once though.",3.5
"Underestimated how tired I was when I started this but got too into it to shut it off, so my memory is pretty hazy, but this is a great first impression with Egoyan's work. Dialogue can be overwritten, but that doesn't detract from what an impressive screenplay this is. The ellipses and information control are very absorbing and gives this a unique take on the network narrative structure.

I can’t say that I fully understand how transcendent worlds can be achieved this effectively, but I’m obsessed with understanding what makes it work.

"Calling all fans of Eyes Wide Shut. Like Eyes Wide Shut, this movie ostensibly about sex turns out to be not just sex-less but un-horny in an oppressive, spooky way. There are TWO striptease montages set to ""Everybody Knows"" by Leonard Cohen, so no, this is not a feelgood movie lol. Exotica is beguiling and hypnotic in a way that reminds me of fellow Canadian Cronenberg (absent any body-horror or violence). There's no horror in this movie, but it certainly feels like a horror movie when you're watching late at night. Looks and sounds outrageously good.
Exotica breaks so many rules of screenwriting, where the movie withholds information for as long as possible in a way that would -- in a lesser crew's hands -- be maddening. Instead, each of these scenes are interesting in their abstractness, and the small connective reveals we get through the movie are delivered for maximum emotional impact. A lot of ""ohhhh, THAT'S what that interaction before was about,"", which is a dangerous storytelling device. Very satisfying here and will reward a subsequent viewing.
Bruce Greenwood is outstanding. Love the sad beard, too.

"Some secrets are deeper than sex and more painful than honesty
Sex for money sometimes conceals great sadness. It can be sought to treat wounds it cannot heal. I believe that may happen less in actual prostitution than in the parody of prostitution offered in ""gentleman's clubs."" Whatever is going on is less about sex than psychological need, sometimes on both sides. Atom Egoyan's ""Exotica"" is a deep, painful film about those closed worlds of stage-managed lust.It is also a tender film about a lonely and desperate man, and a woman who is kind to him. How desperate and how kind are only slowly revealed. In a technical sense, this is a ""hyperlink movie,"" in which characters are revealed to be connected in ways they may not know about. But Egoyan, who also wrote the film, surprises us in how slowly he reveals the links and even more slowly reveals what the characters know about them. When the film ends, you sit regarding the screen, putting together what you have just learned and using it to think again about what went before.
The critic Bryant Frazer wrote that after the film played in the 1994 New York Film Festival, a woman asked Egoyan what had happened at the end. Egoyan was ""visibly perturbed"" by the question, he said, but finally responded. Frazer writes, ""Here is what the last scene in the film meant, he explained, his four- or five-word declamation a stark and numbing negation of the gentle, almost languid spirit of the film, which invites the audience to its own discovery. The 'what happened' is simple enough to explain, but you can't really understand it unless you're fully caught up in the cinema when it unfolds in front of you.""Frazer is right: There is no mystery at the end, except the mysteries of human nature that Egoyan evokes. What you think about those will define the film's importance to you. For me, they make it a cry of sympathy for people suffering from loss and guilt, and also an affirmation about how others are wiling to understand them. A film can only get so far by simply stating its message; if the message is that easily defined, why bother with the film? ""Exotica"" does what many good films do and implies its troubled feelings. Nothing is solved at the end, except that we have learned to understand the characters.""Exotica"" takes place in a Toronto strip club, but not one of those hellholes of expense account executives and drunken bachelor parties. This club seems to fill the special needs of the men who go there, although we learn only about one. He is Francis (Bruce Greenwood), who every night buys the company of Christina (Mia Kirshner). She looks young, dresses in a school uniform, opens her shirt before him, and then they talk softly and intensely.Watching this is the club DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas), who stands on a perch above the action and contributes an insinuating commentary on the lives below. Also watching, from behind one-way mirrors, is the pregnant Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), who inherited the club from her mother. The decor creates a tropical club heavy with palm fronds, the music slinks between the tables, the lighting is an oddly muted garishness, gloom cut with neon reds, greens and blues. Egoyan's camera glides around the room, pausing to regard Francis and Christina. Whatever they're talking about hardly seems to be sex and seems to absorb them equally. The DJ notices this.
Other characters are implicated. The opening shots of the film show customs officers scrutinizing an arrival on a flight from the Far East, through a one-way mirror. This is Thomas, whom we discover is smuggling rare macaw eggs. At the airport, a man suggests they share a ride to town and pays his share of the ride with two ballet tickets. Thomas gives one of the tickets to a good-looking gay man outside the theater, and they eventually spend the night together. The man was one of the customs officers. He confiscates the eggs, but wants to see Thomas again. Thomas' pet shop is audited under suspicion of illegal imports -- by Francis, who later wants him to help eavesdrop on Christina. You see how the subterranean connections link.I have made ""Exotica"" seem to be all complexities. Following the connections is straightforward. Deciding what they
mean
is the challenge. Egoyan has not unfolded the plot as simply as I summarized it, and he uses other suggestive characters. There is Tracey (Sarah Polley, then 15), the young girl Francis hires every night to baby-sit while he is visiting the club. But it's other than baby-sitting. At the club. he's a client of Christina, who dresses as a schoolgirl; does this suggest he has a sexual interest in Tracey? What does Tracey's father think of the arrangement?Enough of the plot. Let's draw back to admire Egoyan's method. If we do not at first understand all of the relationships between the characters, they do not all understand them themselves,
and in certain ways never figure them out.
That provides the film with hidden emotional currents as powerful as those that are visible. When you think through the film later, you realize how much some of the characters never know, and yet how important it has been to the outcome. Egoyan isn't weaving these strands simply to divert us with a labyrinth; he is suggesting the hidden ways in which we affect other lives with our choices and behavior even though unaware.
Beneath everything pulses the atmosphere of the club Exotica, its promise of sexuality masking deeper needs and obsessions. The grave voice of Leonard Cohen and the starkness of his songs, played by Eric the DJ, seem wrong for a strip club, but not for this one, where not desire but desperation is catered to. The advertising, selling a sexy thriller, is all wrong.Zoe, the club owner, is in some ways the spirit of the film. She is very pregnant, very happy about it, very convinced that her mother created the club in a special way for a special clientele with special needs. She knows more about some of the clients than they realize. She is worried about the tension between Eric and Christina. She meets with Francis after he is thrown out of the club. She wants to restore peace and order, and I won't tell you why that is so difficult for her.Atom Egoyan, born in 1960 in Egypt of Armenian parents, brought up in Canada, has consistently stepped outside the mainstream in style and subjects. He's fascinated by how people are kept separated by the realities of culture (ethnicity, gender, background) and walls of images, and how they try to get through or around them. One of the most uncompromising of major directors, he hasn't made a single film for solely commercial reasons.Egoyan is best known for ""The Sweet Hereafter,"" which won the grand jury prize at Cannes 1997; ""Felicia's Journey"" (1998), and ""Where the Truth Lies,"" that remarkable 2005 film with Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth as a team not unlike Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, implicated in a murder. He often works with his wife, Arsinee Khanjian, who like Ingrid Bergman has the ability to project carnality and sweetness simultaneously. Egoyan brought his first feature, the $20,000 ""Next of Kin,"" to the Toronto Film Festival in 1984. He was only 24.There is a quality in all of his work that resists the superficial and facile. Even at the very start, he wasn't interested in simple storytelling. He is drawn to what Fitzgerald called the dark night of the soul. Secrets, shames, the hidden and the forbidden coil around his characters, but he is not quick to condemn them. He and Khanjian are warm, friendly and smile easily, and in the films, you sense love for the characters and the belief that to know more is to forgive more.

"Los flashbacks que se aparecen con intermitencia orquestan trágicamente la dinámica entre un aquí corrupto y un allá en el tiempo: es el relativo a la melancolía, al recuerdo de un paraíso perdido.

Muchos años después, una selva dantesca ha sido emplazada sin nuestro consentimiento alrededor nuestro, y es desde este punto que Exótica es particularmente política: los pasillos desde que espían a las bailarinas, construidos -atenti- por un millonario, ¿qué son más que los emplazamientos de una sociedad, de un ""orden mundial""? Todo, velado por la mentira de ""es por tu seguridad"" (¿y qué es esto sino el mantra del mismo ""orden""?- Calasso ya nos advirtió: estamos en la época de la fe ciega en los procedimientos). Las características de este nuevo estado de las cosas es la potenciación de nuestra sombra; recordemos, al inicio, se anuncia que ""Kali"" bailará para nosotros por tan sólo 5 dólares: es el anuncio del Kali-Yuga, la última edad del hombre, en la que la medida de las cosas es el dinero (""geldkristall"").
Todas las simetrías entre los espacios y los personajes son una forma simbólica de ""encerrarnos"", una forma simbólica de hacernos saber lo que es estar asfixiado por la sempiterna presencia de los crueles emplazamientos de la sociedad moderna: el loro es tanto Harold (el padre de la niña), como Eric, como el loro del lugar en que trabaja Thomas, es decir, son todos ""poseedores"" y ""vigilantes""; el trueno suena sólo en dos ocasiones: una, cuando el chico con el que sale Thomas del teatro ""se le escapa"", es decir, se va sin avisar, y cuando Eric habla a Christine del miedo que tiene ""de que se le escape""; las selvas son tanto la del negocio de Thomas, la del stripclub, y la de la ciudad misma (esto afirmado por Francis mismo), lo que es un símbolo del perverso ""emplazamiento"" del que antes hablamos; los ""espejos mentirosos"" son tantos los del chico con que Thomas sale, que es su perdición, y los de Eric y Zoe, que también son la perdición (prestemos atención a cómo, a través de este espejo, el chico con que sale Thomas, termina haciendo algo ""por su propio bien"", y en realidad sólo termina perjudicándolo, lo que es un símbolo del proceder judicial mismo). Como último, lo que tenemos, es el abrazo entre Eric y Francis, ¿que qué otro semejante podemos tener, más fiel que el abrazo entre Príamo y Aquiles, hito fundador de la piedad? En ese abrazo se sintetiza la condición humana frente al mundo: padecemos juntos y de igual forma, por más que la ficción que se orquesta alrededor nuestro contingentemente, según se le cante, nos haga amigos o enemigos.
Hay muchos detalles más, pero sería demasiado exhaustivo sacarlos todos a relucir: en resumen, tanto en el análisis ""general"" (en el que también podemos meter la ""sensación"" general que nos da), como en el análisis ""específico"", la idea parecería ser que este mundo en el que vivimos es un pesar fabricado a consciencia (¿por el diablo? ¿por el hombre?) para padecerse, y, seguramente, no para ser comprendido.",5.0

"“You have to ask yourself what brought the person to this point, what was seen in his face, his manner, that channeled him here. You have to convince yourself that this person has something hidden that you have to find. Check his bags. But it's his face, his gestures that you're really watching.”
A cipher. A turn of phrase. An aching heart. A forlorn gaze. There is so much conveyed in this film with so little. Exotica beguiles, and honestly, turned me away at first, with its seedy setting and mawkish camera, almost leering at those who come into contact. But then the story starts to unfold. Slowly, delicately, like ripples in a pool, Exotica begins to reveal a vision of a truly heartbreaking lament. The score, the setting, the jungle chatter which permeate almost every scene, allow you to seep into this little corner of the world and be truly transported. With each movement and exchange, new layers are revealed, connections form, characters begin to come into focus. What is given to the viewer is a film teeming with substance, beauty and tragedy. A film with movingly understated turns from Bruce Greenwood (love him) and Elias Koteas. A film which examines in the most sympathetic way the troubles and remedies of broken people, people who are trying to find meaning and connection in a place where such things seem beyond reach.

This movie I like, but it’s fucking weirdddd.
There’s lots of gorgeous scenes, the club’s gaudy interior, fake greenery, intoxicating soundtrack. Doubling down w delusional, unsettling, obsessive, creepy scenes. Paired with the background storyline of smuggling exotic birds, further conveying the theme of trapping something beautiful. The strip club, a reminder to many of things you want but can’t have. 
The big picture is beautiful but when you look deep, noones happy. The way this film unfolds and ties everything together isn’t very satisfying.

"One of those movies that, when you really get to the bottom of its complexity, makes you fall in love with the idea of filmmaking.
The opening scene is shot through a one-way mirror, foreshadowing the basis on which this whole masterpiece is built. Between us, the viewers, and Atom Egoyan's meticulously crafted universe, lies this purposefully implemented informational asymmetry, which keeps us guessing at the characters' backgrounds and intentions.
By the end of the movie, the whole ""puzzle"" unfolds, and cements its heart-wrenching message of how grief, loneliness and trauma can affect the human psyche in the most irreversibly tragic manner, but also how they can connect people in the most obscure, yet fascinating ways. And it does so in a way such that, were the pieces of the puzzle given to us when we felt we needed them, were the confusion of the viewer completely avoided, the finale wouldn't have been as chilling and harrowing.
Surely among the most stunningly assembled films ever made, and a seductively withholding tapestry of open wounds and misplaced desires.",4.5

"Honestly, not exotic or sexy enough! I'd hate to be at this club trying to get a dance from a beautiful lady and the DJ is talking a mile a minute while also playing weird chanting music?? Like I love the vibes and aesthetic of the club itself but we hardly ever saw it!
There's no satisfying conclusion to anything, there's no bigger meaning or reveal, the plot kept teasing some kind of conclusion or reveal but nothing ever really wrapped up!! This movie was so frustrating especially bc there's some real good material to work with here!
The cinematography was gorgeous and lush and green and I loved that, and the physical sets and locations looked great. Bruce Greenwood looked like a combination of Hugo Weaving/Sam Neill/Dennis Quaid and he was such a hottie but his character didn't get ANY development.
Personally, I wanted this movie a little more fucked up. Like, Francis was going to a strip club to look at a girl who reminded him of his daughter! At least if they kissed it'd be a hot complicated mess, then it'd be more interesting and add to the characters.
Like was it just me or did Francis have a complicated/slightly sexual feelings toward his daughter??? Why not lean into that? He's still clearly grieving the loss of his daughter, you'd think going to a strip club would surely skew his idea of her. Idk I just think it'd be way more interesting seeing him untangle his feelings in that way and understand that Chrissy is not his daughter, no matter how much he wishes she was, rather than that flat, abrupt conclusion we were given.
It wasn't for me but I'd love to see this remade. Maybe someone could do Exotica justice and give it the character development it deserves.",2.0

High-tier hypnotic puzzle piece movie. Best first watch so far on the year.,4.0
"cerebral softcore - a surrealist and sophisticated take on the erotic thriller, enjoyable both as an soapy and mysterious drama and as an art house meditation, but as a whole becomes something completely of its own kind. human in substance and hypnotic in style. an excellent example of characters reflecting eachothers experiences and pain in ways you can’t really understand until you see the full picture - all of the answers lie within eachother in the end. made me feel a lot - these characters don’t feel complete, not because they’re underwritten or flat, but because you can tell something is being withheld from us. these people aren’t whole, they’re developing in front of our very eyes, and while we may discover more than we ever expected by the end, we’re still left with plenty to figure out on our own. an excellent film that abandons genre cliches and takes the road less traveled to create something much more rewarding, fulfilling, and devastating.

"94/100
Exotica had been a film very high on my watchlist for years at this point. But had been warned to go in with an open mind and not expect something that’s going to be mind blowing in the beginning. I can definitely understand that perspective, especially if you don’t get into what the film is presenting beyond the terrific set design and cinematography that I could imagine was exploited even more with the Criterion Blu-Ray. 
One thing I did sort of know about the film was that its topic would be about trauma. And that is definitely almost the prior factor its story. Or grief could be a better word overall for it. But it definitely goes beyond that in some terrific character storytelling that is not only paced in a phenomenal way. But the fact that it was achieved in less than 2 hours makes the work from Atom Egoyan even more respectable than it already is. The setting also brings the closed down and forbidden surroundings to everything else, that’s even more than the ‘Exotica Club’ itself.
Regardless of what was really brought to knowledge (or even further) throughout, it still had me entranced the whole way through. But definitely not in the settling kind of way. But at the same time, it’s undeniable of the creative execution to it, and the rising appreciation for it might not be enough justice.
Many different aspects are going to keep leaving a different kind of brain implosion the more I either think about it or watch it. Egoyan is the primary. But the entire cast (even some not mentioned) can definitely be argued for being up in those ranks as well. Bruce Greenwood does a great job, and I think his performance could be a bit overshadowed with either the highlighted performances of others or what the reactions his character can bring out. Don McKellar brings such great mystery and unhandiness to his character, that further leaves more impact by the end of the film. Arsinée Khanjian’s presence isn’t as utilized as the other main characters, but some gut punching impacts in the story are heavily due to her involvement in those scenes. But when it comes to the highlighted performances of the film, Elias Koteas really blew my mind here. Being a fantastic character actor, this is easily the best character I’ve ever seen him have. And his delivery, emotion and the ways that can be represented in each act is extremely powerful. And Mia Kirshner could’ve been the glue to them all. The character of Christina is already the central piece to the film overall, and she brought to such a different level of heartbreak and is one of the most concrete performances I’ve seen in recent memory. And I’m sure it’s going to sink me back even further every time.",5.0

"What is it that gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?
Exotica offers a glimpse into one of the most private places with its own rules and unusual characters, like Mia Kirshner and especially Elias Koteas who give outstanding performances.

And another thing that makes it all as good as it is is the score. Its mysterious and exciting tone makes it so you won't forget about that experience soon after you've watched it.

"I don't like this movie one bit. It felt so dated and trying to be edgy but without any actual substance that made me feel remotely anything. The only interesting aspect was the strip club's aesthetic. But finding out Christina used to be a babysitter for the main character made me feel very uncomfortable but not in the way where I appreciate that a film can take me there kind of way but more of a why? The dialogue was so flat and everyone acted like they were not real characters. Does not help that all that Christina is is a stripper girl fetishized in a school girl outfit, when I can tell a man is clearly behind the camera drooling I don't like it boo. And I'm not even a nitpicker feminist gal cause sometimes sexy is fun, cool, or needed for the larger story but here it just felt nah. It felt like the director thought he was the shit but he was not at all the shit and that bothers me. And I know he's Armenian but I still can't look past how much I did not enjoy this movie.",2.5
"This is so up my alley, but there’s something not clicking for me. It’s got a weird rhythm, which is usually a plus for me. Don McKellar is so beautifully dressed and so magnetic on screen.

Everything is so close to working for me, but I feel absolutely nothing about this movie. I don’t care about any of it.

"I was very pleasantly surprised to find that there was such a thing as Toronto New Wave recently. I'm even more pleased now that my first venture into the collection of filmmakers from Toronto in the 80s and 90s has been this weird, complex, parrot/Lolita obsessed, therapy session with tiddies. A film about the people in a strip club where the actual story strips for you and you're left alone in the bathroom feeling pretty awkward about what just happened. Actually genius.
Strip joints are intensely emotionally loaded establishments. From the patrons to the employees, it takes a different kind of person to spend any kind of time in a place like that. Atom Egoyan flips your gut from wondering what twisted things these characters will do, to being concerned for what twisted things have been done to them. EXACTLY like the emotional journey of most conscientious people the first time they stoop to take a peek at the inside of one of these places. what's gonna happen in here? wait, who are all these people and what kind of life makes you a regular/employee?
DJ Eric pets his stuffed parrot while he watches the thing he wants fly away and his baby mama yells at him to change the song. The next dancing bird walks out to what looks like her natural habitat, only everyone in the room knows it to be a cage for all the things they can't let go of. If the symbol of this film isn't a woman's silhouette, it's a green parrot. Woven throughout Exotica the motif of the parrot hints towards an exotic, highly regulated thing of beauty that we don't always take the best care of. Francis' brother, Harold, has only taught his parrot one word but it doesn't say it anymore; the neglect might be a reason he's just fine sending his daughter to babysit a dead girl. Thomas carelessly cons the wrong man into his apartment and loses his precious macaw eggs. When the film is all stripped down and we finally see what it is that brings them all back to their cage day after day, you can't help but feel bad for all the parrots and their observers. Makes you wish they could make an exception to the No Touching rule that allows for hugs.",0.0

"I've seen this film a few times before but this is my first time rewatching it in at least a decade. Extremely well made mystery written and directed by Atom Egoyan about a few random characters who all end up interacting with each other thanks to the strip club Exotica. The opening credits kind of suck you right in with that eerie score, and then the way the story unfolds, it's a smart and complex script, I love the way how everything comes together in the end. Elias Koteas is perfect as the emcee of the club and I love how calm and tragic Bruce Greenwood is here. It would be fun to watch this again for the first time just to be surprised by the twists and how everyone is connected in the end. And man, that final scene is just great. An underrated 90s film.",5.0

"This was completely different than what I was expecting. I was expecting an erotic thriller but it is similar to American Beauty with a structure that is similar to Happiness. However, Exotica is far different in tone and style compared to both American Beauty and Happiness. Exotica has a script that is a bit more down to earth and subtle compared to American Beauty (though I actually love American Beauty, that movie is not subtle at all with its’ themes) and it is nowhere near as disturbing or as dark as Happiness. Also, with those films, the character’s background, personalities and traits are revealed pretty much instantly. Atom Egoyan slowly reveals how each of these characters are interconnected and their psyche and personality traits as the film progresses. I can see how many wouldn’t want to stick around throughout because it doesn’t seem like anything is really connecting together at first but the third act really does tie things together nicely. I really enjoyed it and this is definitely a film that I am continuing to think about and will likely think about for awhile. 9/10 (closer to an 8 than a 10).",4.5

Les personnages qui viennent s’échouer à Exotica, le temple de la luxure, sont tous et toutes des épaves. Ils souffrent. Ils geignent. Ils pleurent. Ils affichent une moue stoïque ou profèrent des logorrhées goguenardes mais leurs tourments est palpable. Jusqu’à cette fin. Cette fin. Probablement la plus forte que j’ai vu de ma vie.

"billed as an erotic thriller but was ultimately neither erotic nor really all that thrilling. granted i was a little pressed for time, but i kept waiting for the story to blossom into what i was expecting (and what, i have to imagine, the director was going for), but instead, because it’s one of those “limited setting” kind of joints, it felt like it just sorta meandered between the past and the present, between the strip club and the outside world. boring! it’s gotta be quite a slog for me to be lamenting oh no, they’re back in the strip club. but that’s just how it felt.
i don’t think bruce greenwood can carry a story with this kind of emotional heft. he’s too nice. he’s too canadian. because he was overacting his relationships with the other characters (except maybe the christina character played by mia kirshner) were stilted and overshadowed. 
on a positive note, this movie looks amazing for the most part (they didn’t have great wigs back then i guess). the flashback sequences with eric (elias koteas) and christina were the most compelling parts of the movie by far.
idk this just felt too…whiny, immature, to really embody the noir i know it wanted to be. without being able to really invest in that style as a vehicle for the story, the rest of everything just sorta fell apart.",2.0

"The first and only other time I’ve watched EXOTICA was on a small, 13-inch TV in a college dorm room. I remember liking it at the time for sure, but I wasn’t as enamored with it as my brother was or other fellow film students were. Maybe I wasn’t mature enough at the time, maybe it was the small TV…either way, I always figured it’d benefit from a rewatch and the new Criterion edition is definitely a better presentation for it than that small TV/VCR combo from back in the day.
Sure enough, I got more out of it this time. It’s funny to think about how a lot of filmmakers could easily make something pretty insufferable out of the concept of “a bunch of mysteriously interconnected lost souls converge at a strip club and ultimately find their own personal redemptions,” but in Atom Egoyan’s hands, it’s kind of a masterpiece. Egoyan uses psychological thriller elements and the occasional neon-soaked neo noir-style visuals to explore notions around memory, grief, obsession and regret and it’s a mesmerizing, empathetic and ultimately devastating viewing experience. The nonlinear storytelling, the transfixing Mychael Danna score and powerful performances from Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner, Don McKellar, Sarah Polley and Elias Koteas (still rocking that Casey Jones hair) all stood out even more on 2nd viewing. I feel like I can easily pop this back in and watch those first 10 minutes on a loop.
I still have a lot of Egoyan blind spots, but I’ve always been a fan of this one and THE SWEET HEREAFTER. I’ve also seen a couple of his somewhat more mainstream efforts like WHERE THE TRUTH LIES and CHLOE, along with a few of his more abstract, hard-to-get-into efforts like FELICIA’S JOURNEY, ARARAT and ADORATION, but my reactions are generally more mixed on all of those. Eventually I should probably catch up with some of his earlier stuff, but I’m guessing I can probably skip everything he’s made since CHLOE, right?",4.5

"Release and relief in the routine, whatever that routine may be.
A film that asks why we look at certain things and how we know or learn to look away. Bruce Greenwood, Don McKellar and Elias Koteas are all fantastic here, each displaying an attempt at playing it calm and cool while hiding a deep vulnerability underneath, but it’s Mia Kirshner who truly steals the show, playing a woman who knows more and sees more than she initially lets on.
My main takeaway is that this is also a film about desperation: the desperation to hold onto what once was, desperation to keep certain people in your life, and desperation to share a moment and personally connect with someone else whether it’s in a strip club, an opera, the front seat of a car, or a moment of intimacy with a lover running their hand across your chest.

Visually it’s got a lot going for it, however, the sincere-yet-softcore porn style completely ruins any merit. It feels like a better acted version of Showgirls at points, and the clever yet convoluted plot unveiling can’t save it.
It’s just so painfully 1990s, in the worst possible way. Perhaps ‘everyone’s got trauma and is using sexual transaction to make it better’ felt like a groundbreaking theme back then, but now, despite a few small yet clear differences in quality, Exotica mostly just feels like a run of the mill 90s erotic thriller that ends up being unintentionally funny.",1.5

"Wow, so all this time Canada was harboring another Cronenberg and no one was going to tell me?? jk folks I know brainiac Semitic-Canadian filmmakers are all just generally into Ballard, Burroughs, et al but they’re definitely operating in the very same postmodern psychoanalytic playhouse of musings on the knottiest (naughtiest) extremities of repression, emptiness and desire in a not-quite-our-world late capitalist purgatory; Exotica isn’t technically science fiction but you could tell someone the shadowy luminescent blue-green sets with their hypnotically garish Arabesque designs and musical accompaniments were pinched out of Blade Runner and few would bat an eye.
The multi-strand narrative here, which pokes out in numerous different directions rolling gently in and out of sometimes pretentious musings (“If you didn’t ask to come into this world… who did?”) rests a lot of its (minimal) momentum on a puzzlish structure of concealing/revealing basic details of character relationships and backstories that are known to the characters but not to us, which I always find a tad cheap. As a film of tone and milieu though it never falters, following its morbid, grieving, paranoid, horny id through the nocturnal Ontarian funhouse-mirror underworld in every frame and every slinking, hypnotized pan and push in. Pulls off the rare erotic thriller feat of being actually erotic in the same degree as it is unsettling, often at the same time.

"Rewatched this with Gabriel. Attached below is my original review:
This one is all-time. Truly floored by what I watched. A 5/5 movie that sits above others with the same rating in my archive. Profound, provocative, and powerful. Three things that I really want to see out of films like this. 
One of the many thoughts was this notion of the ""myth"" and its purpose. A myth constitutes the aspect of human living. Ultimately, constituting the reality we live in. I'd argue myth, studied alive, is not symbolic, but a direct expression of its subject matter. What is learned from these myths supply one with the practical guide to the activities one connects with. Thus, using myths as a rhetorical vehicle to position ourselves in reality. All of this becomes the foundation for treating reality as a myriad of stories we choose to live in.
Characters in the film, 'Exotica' all operate in the same manner. Positioning themselves within their realities. Both real and fabricated. Choosing which story to live in. All playing into Egoyan's themes of identity, catharsis, and fabricated realities. Most of the film's narrative shows characters operating in a pseudo-environment. Operating on the beliefs and assumptions for one reality upon another reality, a fabricated one. I believe that is why Egoyan employs so many frequent shifts in perspective and time--shifts that eventually lead the audience to understanding, and further connecting empathetically with characters. 
The first 10 minutes of this set the tone for the future unraveling of the narrative.
That ending shot is absolutely crushing.",5.0

Kind of a weird movie, where you have Greenwood as this man that always gets his lap dances from the same dancer, Kirshner, which annoys the club DJ, Koteas, who used to date Kirshner. Greenwood also pays Polley to babysit, who I didn't even know was her, she looks so young and different.
Just a lot of random drama happens as we learn the truth about Polley's babysitting, or the real relationship Greenwood has with Kirshner.

"The two-way mirror in Exotica is the most compelling framing device I've seen in a hot minute. Not only is its introduction done in a (retrospectively) titillating manner, but it serves as an interesting commentary on the power of surveillance. The opening scene shows TSA agents spying on passengers via two-way mirror, showing that this form of voyeurism comes with material power, and one of the agents comments on how to distill ""good"" passengers from ""bad"" actors, stripping the people they are surveilling of their humanity. Egoyan utilizes this in the titular strip club, the saddest place on Earth, and shows the point of surveillance: attaining power. Whether it be from emcees obsessing over exes or perverted men getting a better look at the women, every act of voyeurism gives the chance to dehumanize and impose one's will over the other. In its luscious and exotic landscape, Exotica's dark corners exposes one of the sinister parts of humanity that is growing ever more present in our everyday lives. Even if we know we are being surveilled, the power of the voyeur is still there. Perhaps the biggest question comes this fact: Egoyan shows the subject and the voyeur. What does this say about us, the audience, and the spectating nature of film? Are audiences, and the artists who create these pieces of work, the ultimate voyeurs?",4.5

Took me a while to get into Exotica, but once the first act was finishing I was enjoying myself. Definitely comes together as I expected it would, and I did think the subject matter was dealt with well. However, some of the acting - especially Mia Kershner - felt a little wooden and at times overdone, which took me out of the movie a bit. 
Still, a talented piece of work by Egoyan that is absolutely worth checking out.",3.5

"A beautiful labyrinth of despair. What’s most striking about Atom Egoyan’s seminal film is that it can be so sad and so devastating while also being utterly  invigorating to watch. There’s an energy and excitement to the filmmaking here that is refreshing. The camera moves through the titular strip club in the same way it moves through the boring pet shop that is as much a focal point of the story as the club. It’s not a movie about sex but about transactional relationships.
Every character needs something from another. Every character thinks they are the hero of their own story and should be treated as such. And then they all come together at the end in the most empathetic yet hopeless way. This is an example of a coiled narrative that is less interested in making you gasp at the knots and far more interested in exploring how those knots got there to begin with. 
“Don’t listen to what they say, watch their gestures, watch their movements” is the first line of dialogue spoken and that is as clear a thesis as any I have heard. For that’s what we are doing throughout this narrative: observing and drawing our own conclusions. And the final shot of the movie (an absolute all timer) only drives the thesis home. A haunting masterpiece.",5.0

"Really not sure I have the words to describe this without it seeming like a glib joke. Some relationships, even ones that outwardly appear sexual or physical, have so much more depth to them than people realize. There will be people in your life that you’re connected to for the strangest of reasons, from shared trauma, to isolation, to being a small happy constant when everything else in your life seems meaningless, and those relationships are worth keeping around if you can. And maybe people will misconstrue what they’re about and jealousy and anger and sadness will do what they can to divide and conquer, but we’re all just humans who want other humans around. 
Does that make sense?
This film is a lot more than a sad strip club film. It’s about needing people and not necessarily being able to explain why. It’s about not being able to let go or accept yourself. Also there’s boobies in it and boobies are pretty cool.",5.0

The story is woven in a everything-is-connected way that could feel like a cliche now but I imagine was cutting edge then. To me, that element still feels fresh here, but I don't know if it's because the story is so sharp, or because I have the knowledge that this came before Crash (2004) and Magnolia.

"This is an interesting slow burn. I’m not sure if it pays offs for me, but I was never bored with it even as slow core as it is. There’s something weirdly interesting about it’s repetitious nature, and what it seems to want to do to its audience. 
I feel like it’s wanting me to to assume things, and draw certain connections that need to get rewired throughout the film. There are also certain things within its plot that I’m not sure are necessary and feel a little bit confusing to me. 
It’s also not really about characters who grow or change, as much as they just sort of feel, which to me, is cool, even if not my favorite kind of story telling. I can’t really be sure anyone is any different than when they began. But I can tell that the especially one of the characters has felt very deeply in a way that sort of radiates and shapes the structure of the film, which is really impressive.",4.0

"Los finales anticlimáticos son problemas de primera impresión, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane también me dejó insatisfecho la primera vez que terminé de verla, pero cuando les das una segunda oportunidad todo entra en su lugar y se siente bien. Mejor dicho: cuando te das a ti mismo una segunda oportunidad, porque es la mente la que después de años de ver películas ""gratificantes"" está entrenada para esperar una estructura determinada y te decepciona a pesar de ti mismo si no cumple con la norma. En este caso el anticlímax consiste en el truco de narrar un evento feliz del pasado cuando se sabe que todo terminará mal, generando así un sentimiento de melancolía, de triste nostalgia. Como en La Casa Verde de Vargas Llosa, que narra la boda de Bonifacia después de que se sepa que se convirtió en prostituta.

"i guess if i ever went to a cool, “elevated” strip club like the titular exotica, id appreciate walking in and hearing them playing “everybody knows” by leonard cohen.
shockingly introspective and tender, which isnt exactly what i guess i expected from it. kept making a very strong mental connection to Magnolia while watching (in a good way). the whole cast is doing the work throughout, but elias koteas and bruce greenwood just go nuts. im obsessed with mia kirshner’s goofy dance whenever they play leonard, it kinda rules. 
i could see the way it unfolds in some ways, but theres information you can easily miss. i like the way everything is slowly introduced and certain plot devices or characters are introduced like a very subtle chekhov’s gun that implants a subconscious memory in your brain to be fully revealed later on. relationships are central to everything here, they make the film what it is and turn the key.
i thought id like this one and picked it up as a blind buy last year during a sale, but i was really surprised. im obsessed with the way its shot. theres a distinct cool tone from the film stock and the scan criterion used for this issue looks super crisp. its insane that movies dont look this good anymore, theres just something crazy about it. i highly recommend it, and just feel like this is such a sleeper. its incredibly good.",4.5

"This was such a dense, heavy watch and not in a bad way by any means. There's so much to dissect, so much subtle yet visceral emotion beneath the sleazy, dreamlike exterior. Bruce Greenwood is incredible, you get this feeling that he's repressing something, and that it could boil over at any moment, it creates this tension unlike anything I've seen before. When you find out what happened to Greenwood's character it feels like a punch in the stomach, and when everything unravels it's so bittersweet. The film manages the audience's expectations and emotions so well in the moment and leaves you with so much to think about with regards to grief and the six degrees of separation between people you wouldn't assume would be connected in any way. Just a transcendent experience.",5.0
Elias Koteas is one of my favorite actors of all time. He’s the most compelling person to ever exist. Honestly all of the people in this movie are impossible to look away from. This is pure uncut 90s art house sleaze and I liked it. 4.5 stars out of 5 I wish they still made movies like this.,4.5
"Watched this about 1.5 times since yesterday. I inadvertently fell asleep watching it last night and realized upon waking that I'd been paying way less attention than I thought. So I put it on again to the last bit I knew remembered and IMMEDIATELY fell asleep again. So today, again, I went back to that point and gave it another go with far greater focus.
So, with that non-standard viewing in mind, I don't rightly know what I think about this one! I remember it being somewhat controversial and taboo when I was young, like a movie a teen/tween shouldn't see but should totally get an older sibling to rent for them, and yet I feel like I would have been wholly flummoxed by it had I watched it then. It's certainly not THAT KIND of ""erotic"" movie, and what it is dealing with is far darker and more adult than I could have dealt with. Even now, when I'm familiar with Egoyan's oeuvre and can recognize some of his hallmarks in this, I legitimately struggle to work out just all the emotional and psychological implications of everything that's happening here.
But I can say that the film is haunting or, perhaps, haunted, that tragedy is at least as much of an element as sex, and that Egoyan is walking a lot of very fine lines VERY successfully. The result is hypnotic, well-performed, and mysterious—not in a ""mystery box"" way but something far richer, deeper, more unsettling, and less direct in how it wants you to feel. But because of that ambiguity and difficulty, I'm not coming out of it with a definite, settled opinion after one viewing (especially as disjointed as mine was) but I am confident that I enjoyed the experience and found a lot of merit in it, whatever else may be said about it (t)hornier elements.",3.5

This is the kind of work i’m always seeking out but rarely find. it’s the epitome of 90s arthouse cinema. films that capture such emotion and yet deliver us a stylish rendition of what that emotion means. all my thoughts right now are all over the place and nothing i’m saying here makes any sense.

Everyone in this film has their own version of exotica, the unattainable, and limerent fantasies they choose to build and live in rather than acknowledge the scars of their past, their present, and the feelings of safety and connection that elude them. The characters are drowning, and it almost feels like the viewer is drowning with them - you want them so badly to save themselves by swimming to the surface and taking a gulp of clean cold air. The moments of connection that finally do break through the walls of fantasy are simple, understated, and all the more profound for it.",4.5

I think this subverts the expectations of a 90s sex thriller by using the perverse as a facade to later reveal something surprisingly more sympathetic. In many ways it’s antithetical to the genre with the voyeuristic characters being analogous to this larger conceit about perspective and one-sidedness that at least I certainly wasn’t expecting.

"When my late best friend was in film school, he made a series of shorts that his teacher likened to the work/style of Atom Egoyan. That was the first time Egoyan appeared on my radar, but it took another fifteen years until I was curious enough to finally watch something of his. What a mistake— if the rest of his work is anything like EXOTICA, I’ve been seriously missing out. 
A movie about seedy inner city strip clubs has never been this gorgeous. I’m not talking about the dancers, although they are certainly more of an airbrushed, “Hollywood” version of their real-life counterparts; I’m talking about the haunted performances and the striking production quality. Criterion’s recent Blu issues a transfer steeped in a rich palette of roses, corals, and dark turquoise hues. I could dive into every frame and spend hours studying the way Egoyan uses light to paint his subjects. The performances — my man Elias Koteas in particular — are haunted and suffused with the ample empathy Egoyan affords them.

"In lieu of a better, more fitting and soothing reality for each of Exotica’s characters, they set out to bend their experience until they can cajole themselves, convince themselves it will remain so. Grief is allowed to be so dressed down and frank here. Not in an unsophisticated way, it is an intricate vision of characters processing pain, but it is refreshingly messy and dirt covered. Thomas’s exotic pet store seems submerged in polluted water, it looks damp and soulless. Eric is seen laying in a room with only a tattered mattress; it’s this kind of thing, coping with the little glimmers of comfort and hope available, through fantasy or fact. And they are all playing into it, a collective oasis that staves off change and healing. In a lonely moment, Eric, who you have already seen by this point introduce Christina’s schoolgirl stripper routine a few times, says to an empty room, something to the effect of: “another thing about a schoolgirl is they have their whole life ahead of them.” These characters are all making due but would like to do something other than maintain, it’s a sewn-tight tapestry that captures regret and grief and coping to chilling affect.",5.0

As you are watching this it makes you think it is a sleazy twin peaks HBO psychological sex thriller drama but in the end it is actually so much more smarter and rarely realistic movie. Narrative threads climaxing together in such much better way than in somewhat similar movie, pathetic Magnolia and also Short Cuts, it is not even about length because i adore long movies.
Sounds cliched but this is why movies were made for, arguably why they are the greatest medium.

"English:
This wonderful little independent film just does everything right. At the beginning, one is still fascinated by Club Exotica with its very specific atmosphere, which is much more than just a cheap strip club, but more and more the decisive characters are highlighted. And more and more, the reasons why someone acts the way they do are revealed to the viewer. It is not difficult to put the newly gained insights into context, and in the end, we have a very sensitive drama that makes complete sense. I am very glad to not have seen this work for many years, so that the finale was a surprise for me as well. I am now curious about what else Atom Egoyan has done. I found his ""Chloe"" to be quite average, but I will keep an eye on the director.

Dabei fällt es nicht schwer, die neu gewonnenen Erkenntnisse in den Kontext zu setzen und am Ende haben wir hier ein sehr feinfühliges Drama, das komplett Sinn ergibt. Ich bin sehr froh, dieses Werk sehr viele Jahre nicht mehr gesehen zu haben, so dass das Finale auch für mich wieder eine Überraschung war.

"Average filmmaker: ""I'm going to set my movie in a strip club because it will be sexy and extreme!""
Atom Egoyan: ""I'm going to set my movie in a strip club because I think it will be interesting to imagine a web of people centered on it who use each other to replace the major missing pieces in their lives. None of those pieces will be sex.""
Really surprising movie. It has a very lurid wrapper suggesting the sexual exploitation of teenage girls. But almost none of this is actually about sex. (Except probably for Elias Koteas as the world's most discomfiting strip club DJ, fixating on his ex, and, indeed, on ""what gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?"")
Having only the data points of this and THE SWEET HEREAFTER among Egoyan's films, I can only extrapolate that every single one is about a group of sad people struggling to move forward following the death of one or more children in their community.
If you watch on the Criterion Channel or the disc, I highly recommend the conversation between Egoyan and Sarah Polley,

Bruce Greenwood (Canadian Sam Neill) is a miserable tax auditor who frequents a strip club that looks more like the 90s jungle themed restaurant chain The Rainforest Cafe. He obsesses over and acts weird around the young, very bad dancer Christina, who the world's chattiest strip club MC also pines over. We also meet Don McKellar's character (who may or may not be in Treble Charger or Sloan or something) who pees sitting down and picks up boyzzz at the ballet.
Listen this movie is weird, but it ends up revealing itself very interestingly, like peeling back the layers of an onion. By the end, everything makes sense and it's actually quite effective. Pure vibes.",3.5
"Atom Egoyan's Exotica is a movie I have meant to watch for years. The Canadian director has the mood of Cronenberg's less grotesque work, but I think the heavy handedness kept me at a distance. Surrounding the patrons, dancers and proprietors of Exotica--a Toronto based strip club--the movie finds a tax auditor, the schoolgirl stripper he's obsessed with, an exotic pet store owner, and the babysitter ready to stop her job (played by a young Sarah Polley). I'm sure it was very edgy in 1994, but the endless melancholy with limited stakes made the exotic elements seem showy more than ways to enhance the storytelling. The pieces all tie together, but it keeps a distance for a story that's supposed to be painfully personal. I'll give it another watch eventually, but this one couldn't catch me.",3.5

Just caught up with this one and it really blindsided me. 1994/95 was time of a lot of great and influential films but this is right up there. A tale of a few damaged characters that are connected by a Toronto strip club (and by a local tragedy we learn about gradually). This is intriguing all the way through. Bruce Greenwood is truly brilliant here. Elias Koteas, Mia Kirschner and Don McKellar are amazing as well. It’s a film that reveals more and more about the characters as it goes, and their strange relationships to each other. But it leaves a lot of mystery at the end about what these people actually know, what they feel and what certain symbols in the film mean. It’s pretty fantastic. I know I’ll be wondering about the meaning of the final shot for a long time. It only falls short of 5 stars for under-using Victor Garber.

Week 4: Made in Canada
Exotica hurts. Initially presenting itself as another sex laden 90's drama, Exotica slowly pulls back the curtain on it's main players, transforming them from bland stereotypes to deeply human characters. The lust and melodrama fade away to grief, insecurity, and kindness. The real standouts are Mia Kirshner and Bruce Greenwood, taking a young stripper and her sleazy looking regular and turning them into a sweet and empathetic young girl helping a man grieving a loss few of us can imagine.

4. Made in Canada
It took me until the end of the film, as I thought back on the beginning, to consider surveillance and looking as a thematic element in Atom Egoyan’s Exotica, a film in which he withholds information and slowly reveals it until the interconnectedness of these characters is completely clear. It might appear at the outset to be about lust, sex, and jealousy until it begins to reveal grief in the inner worlds of the characters. It is immaculately well-paced, and even though it toes the waters of soap or melodrama, it never falls in, bolstered by a particularly vulnerable and measured performance from Bruce Greenwood.",4.0

oof. dang. yeeeeeeah. hypnotic and gently cryptic, Egoyan spinning a very indie 90’s tangle of interlocking characters into a thread that reveals itself but still has layers and layers of intrigue and ambiguity. Bruce Greenwood creates a real whopper of a chracter, like if Jerry Lundegaard in Fargo was an abyss of loss and despair, filling the hole left by tragedy through a simulated experience that remixes the women in his life. Thomas lives through a similar simulation, the performance of showing up to the ballet with an extra ticket, selling it to a hot guy, and then feigning remorse by offering to give the money back afterwards. but of course, the titular location, the strip club, is an inherently simulated experience, love and acceptance and attention all given for the low price of $5, no touching. visually the restoration looks sooooo good, the ambient neon lighting of the fish tanks and the animal store, so rich in color and texture. killer ending.",4.5

"Going into Exotica cold, I had no idea of the kaleidoscopic ensemble drama I was about to enter. Every character carries some sort of baggage, some visible, others hidden. The past plays a role in shaping their urges to find escape or expression for what they have repressed. Likewise, the web of relationships that unravels illuminates the characters' symbiosis. Though some are motivated by dependency while others pleasure, desire is always figured in the space of emptiness. Egoyan takes this a step further and contemplates what it takes for an erotics to be predicated on this lack.
Though I suspect Egoyan's fixation on technological mediation of the past and trauma gets less pronounced with time, Exotica still bears its fingerprint by the repeated shot on home video. Albeit somewhat removed, the constant playback and pausing evokes the complex relationships the characters have to acting out and recreating stagnant replicas of their past. Part of me wishes there were more to surround it, more footage to flesh out the dimensions of this part-voyeur, part-sentimental selective memory. The other part of me recognizes it's probably made stronger put in isolation, because that's what it really is: isolated.",3.5

His niece Tracey understands his grief as much as to entertain his wish of 'babysitting' but she doesn't know what went wrong between her father and uncle. And finally even as the audience assembles a picture of Francis we know little about what Christina is getting out of their relationship, until the goosebump-inducing final scene.

Exotica is an onion with layers that are screaming to be peeled back. The film centers around the relationships between a set of characters and how they all weave in and out of each others lives. The film manages to be really compelling when we're left in the dark. The performances by Bruce Greenwood and Mia Kirshner (who was only 18 at the time of the filming) carried the film.
That being said, personally, I didn’t really think the film went to as interesting a place as the set-up would imply. I may have to go back and re-watch, which I’m certainly open to, but I don’t think the connection between Francis and Christina’s connection added any context to their relationship as portrayed on screen. It certainly doesn’t help that all the connections are revealed in expository info dumps.
I definitely want to watch it again knowing the connection between the characters ahead of time, but as of right now, I’m certainly a lot more tepid on it. I loved the performances and the overall aesthetic, but the plot, which the film hinges on, left me wanting.",3.5
"I planned on giving this a 2-2.5 initially - - solely due to my confusion.

So... My rating (significantly?) improved.",3.5

"Four quick thoughts:
#1. 5th viewing cinches it—top 10 Nineties film. Combines best aspects of theater (limited locations, complex character psychology, everyone-is-connected) w/ cinema (incredible sets, music, expressive yet subtle acting). Could talk about it for days.
#2. Egoyan is very deft at presenting these unsettling, almost inexplicable relationships and slowly peeling back the layers—esp. with the Bruce Greenwood character, who at first gives off the impression of being a creep only to reveal a different kind of damage as it unwinds.
#3. Love the symmetry of the film revolving around two inherited businesses—the pet shop and the strip club, both in the business of selling something exotic, both covered in glass that invites observation but keeps the viewer at a distance, both threatened by secret deals.
#4. Not big on strip clubs but if someone made Exotica in real life I’d move in there tomorrow. The Henri Rousseau-esque jungle decor, Leonard Cohen over the speakers—incredible vibes.",5.0

The music is a major contributor to said atmosphere in Exotica and deserves special mention.
I certainly felt a small amount of your typical 90s indie awkwardness in the first act of the movie, but it drew me further and further into its hypnotic mood as it went along. It's a movie that deals with grief and desire in mysterious and unexpected ways all the way through to the end. There are set ups for climactic confrontations that subvert expectations in their denouement that end up hitting a much more profoundly human note.

-relationships bonded in trauma
-sexualisation of said trauma
-unreliable characters who hurt those around them

the Canadian Cultural department really made a poor choice not making Christina the protagonist of this. Given more characterization and a few more points up her DSM-5 this could've been a fem-cel genre classic, the vibes we're right.

For a film with a lot of potential to be a stylish moody art-house movie about sex workers, about fantasy and grief, the tired narrative is a letdown...

A sexy, slow burning, mystery that has elements of a neo noir but mainly discusses the interconnectivity between people and their traumas. The story is so uniquely crafted, having you confused at times on how possibly any of this could be related, only to create the perfect atmosphere during this time and give the necessary mindset to proceed to the third act. What clearly is the most interesting dynamic here is the relationship with exotic animals and the exotic humans; exotic humans in the sense that their debilitating life experiences have created a need for a connectivity, a bond to ease the pain. Like exotic animals; their behavior is unpredictable and out of self defense. I think there is more here than meets at first watch and can be better explained by someone smarter than me.  A rewatch for years to come. ",3.5

"Quite appropriately, Atom Egoyan bring us in with the allure of the exotic. A cover is presented where when interpreted without context heavily implies something seedy and perverse. Mychael Danna's very Indian score initially seems to be only serving to give off that allure, to the point of maybe even feeling appropriated. But what this all unravels into ends up going in a completely opposite direction - a film about grief, loneliness, and the roundabout give and takes people partake in to escape the former two. And when we get to the closing moment, Danna's incredible score is no longer for exoticizing, but rather its Indian origins feel understood and its proper use makes it understanding - providing empathy to its characters. Now I'm left thinking that more Western dramas need Indian scores. And perhaps, this is the greatest strip club film of all time? For one, it's got the coolest design of a club that I can think of, which of course turns out to have a perverted origin. And the club is effectively used to encapsulate the ubiquity of sex and perversions as an exterior for baggage and anguish. And what better way can Egoyan's achievement here be cemented than the fact that this won both at AVN and Cannes?",5.0
Exotica is a weird one for me after watching this for the first time. I felt very withdrawn and emotionally discharged for the first half of this movie but that second half completely won me over. Egoyam’s direction and way of telling this story is quite uncoventional which is something I’ve always admired in a movie but as said before it took me a while for everything to fully click for me but in the end I found this to be incredibly beautiful yet tragic at the same time and I haven’t seen a lot of movies that capture raw human emotion this well. That first half does kind of hold back Exotica from being one of my instant favourites but I think it’ll get there with another viewing. Just a really really good movie,0.0

"Me encanta la profundidad que Atom Egoyan les concede a sus personajes, dotándolos de pequeños detalles que los tridimensionan por completo. En Exotica encontramos igualmente varios niveles y capas en su historia, que al final termina dándonos un vuelco emocional haciendo que nos replanteemos todo. La estructura de este filme es una de sus características más notables, pero son sus atmósferas, la obscuridad y sus luces, lo que envuelve e intoxica. Además de su música, una partitura compuesta por Mychael Danna a partir de escalas exóticas. Exotica es una película que en posteriores revisiones sé que crecerá en mí.",3.5

"July Criterion Movie Challenge
That time of year again to catch up on some Criterion titles. With this being a new title coming out in September I thought why not start off with a fresh one, especially since I am intrigued in the other film included in the set.
Halfway through I wasn't really liking where this was going, but eventually it started piecing itself together. The dreamlike sensation is in full effect. It kind of makes you feel uncomfortable because you think its heading in a much different direction. Characters seem perverted given how the film chooses to introduce them, but the much needed depth and understanding does slowly start revealing itself as the film progressed. The acting isn't great and character introductions are odd and awkward, but I do love the moody score and the web of mystery it spins. I also find the third act really good at encapsulating all the pieces presented earlier on. There's an overarching theme of healing and letting go of the past, with all of the central characters and it takes time to fully realize that, because for a good chunk of the film you think ""why are we following these characters? and how is this all going to link up?"".
Definitely felt some David Lynch vibes with this one. I could already watch it again and I do think it will grow on me more over time.

"Exotica centers most of its action around the strip club named in the title. We follow the owner, the act announcer, one of the dancers, a frequent customer, and a drug smuggler, who doesn't at first seem to be connected to the story. The story unfolds a little at a time, drawing lines between characters and their motivations gradually, until finally we start seeing how everything fits together. The mystery of it all, surprisingly, doesn't feel as sensationalized as you would assume from the broad strokes of the synopsis. It's almost got the atmosphere of a slice-of-life story, just one with less traditional centerpieces like drugs and strippers and murder. I found myself genuinely involved with these characters and their concerns and wanting to know how things were going to play out for them. The ending holds on to that understated tone, which, again, feels odd to say when murder and intrigue are so much a part of the ending, but it ends somehow... very gently. It's a unique and interesting movie that kept me engaged the whole time.

"You don't easily forget the first time you walked into Exotica. Gloriously off-kilter Hindi music playing as naiad like dancers writhe before your eyes. A crowd of dead-eyed men, slouched in their grey suits, looks on. One of them, Francis, has had the light snatched out of his life. The man standing over the booth, announcing the dancers, is broken too. And Christina, who unbuttons her blouse, as Frances stares, moist eyed at her face, knows a thing or two about broken men. I don't know how this film did it, but I felt like Eric, the DJ who felt soothed watching Christina soothe Francis. Someone tenderly attending to another's grief, can spill over, and spread a warm blanket over our hurt too.",5.0

"The mental gymnastic going on in most reviews of this is more entertaining than the movie itself. I've noticed that frequently, if a movie displays both lots of tiddies and an overall ""serious/deep"" core theme, people who enjoy it a lot tend to desperately try to rationalize their enjoyment by linking it to some profound, subtle philosophical meditation that is supposedly going on in the movie itself. The more the tiddies and the asses, the more these dissertations look like legitimate college homework papers. The effort that it takes to say that 103 mins of girls dancing half naked and pathetic men being either obnoxious crybabys or fucking creeps is ""metacinema"", a ""reflection on medias and the matter of memories"" and shit like this is objectively striking and I would say almost brave. The fact that some many people are not comfortable in just saying that they liked this for the erotic titillation is explained by the fact that this movie has a really disturbing quality profoundly sewn in it. There is a clear pedophilic-incestuos subtext going on, and the pedophile in question is our main character. No one ever questions or calls him out for his pedophilic desires, projected on Christina, which happens to casually wear the same school outfit his daughter is wearing in the photo on the living room wall. It's obvious that the police suspected him for the murder because they knew he abused his daughter. Tracey seems to be genuenly scared of him, not disturbed only because he tries to pretend Sara is still alive. All the pieces of the puzzle are out in bright shine light, and I will not believe for a second it was not intentional. But instead, what we get is the crybaby (no pun intended) pedo being beaten by another pathetic pedo crybaby. Eric, while he relives his first encounter with Christina as he presents her on stage, calls her a ""jailbait"", focuses on her ""pure"" appearance and other heinous shit, and in the last sequence of the movie we basically get to know she was barely a teen when they met.
The movie is overall interesting, worth a watch if you want to see something strange and out of the norm. But please people stop embarrassing yourself like this by making long ass essays on why two fucking pedos whining for more than hour is some profound philosophical meditation about life.",3.0

"Atmospheric, hypnotic, makeshift therapy in the psychological shadow of Toronto. Our characters have a line of causality separate from their conscious desire, and their words, and their intentions, become voiced by some other person within the venue of the Exotica itself. And so, distinct from its intended purpose of recreation and entertainment, it will always, in a misfitting, sloppy way, be a place of healing.
Egoyan sparingly, but powerfully, uses slow tracks forward as a character peers in (or past) the camera, in ways that evoke the flashes of a dream: each time, a quick portrait, their gaze at us with a distinct intention, and our gaze at them with another. These shots last only two or three seconds each time, but they linger throughout the entire film like a compilation, a separate little montage.
Egoyan connotes the static gaze with the voyeur, always letting us watch the characters watch and investigate their interest, their trance, wondering what so powerfully endows their look; he is then, in turn, always connoting us as viewers with momentum. He wants the camera to be the omnipotent ""cut of the dream""; he doesn't want us to be another voyeur participant, though we inevitably are.
So we are always cutting to different chronological and psychological spaces of this dream — and these always coloured with different formal elements (video camera haze, colour grading, sound distortion) — and in the conscious world, we are always moving as we look. Conversations are consciously narrated by the camera, gracefully tracking and recomposing themselves in a way almost reminiscent of music videos; when shots are still, we are invariably looking into someone else's gaze at another. Thus the camera is the participant, not us; it as narrator leads the dream, instead of letting us self-effacingly be another viewer.
During this first watch I thought the film was leading something very basic — the invariable status of woman as healer, creator, child and sexual object, all played to a stunted masculinity. But that last sequence of the film loads everything that preceded it with something a bit more complex; that last sequence is the initial dream, the initial life that shattered into the only components that can heal, the only places and personas left in the players that can heal, apart and in their open secrets, alive only in the collective unconscious of the city.
Conversations are devastatingly stilted, isolating, and loaded. No one can seemingly say what is on their mind, because, I suppose, they are so preoccupied with a deep, devastating question forced onto them by the initial dream. Each question is different, and it guides the desire of the character; it guides their therapy. The climax surprised me; we only reach resolution once we can see, for ourselves, that first place, in full.
For the first time, we linger, watching with our subject. And it cuts to black, completed.",5.0
"As a mystery film, this has a lot of potential. As a mystery film lover, I always want for more, thus I was just left unenlightened after finishing it.

"I could listen to this film, the way it moves in your ears, from one to the next. The film asks, I think, to be received by ear.

"Was war da eigentlich los im Kino der 80er und 90er Jahre? Unzählige schmierige, kaputte Typen, die sich an verführerischen Frauen ergötzen, sie belästigen, von ihnen reingelegt werden, ihnen Gewalt antun. Das Genre ""Erotikthriller"" hat in dieser Zeit wahnsinnig viel Mist hervorgebracht (oft produziert von der größten Drecksau Harvey Weinstein), der heute wirklich unerträglich ist. Die Filme von David Lynch, Paul Verhoeven oder David Cronenberg gehören zu den wenigen herausragenden Beispielen, vor allem weil sie sich weit über die Konventionen des Genres hinausbewegt haben.
Der kanadische Autorenfilmer Atom Egoyan wagte mit EXOTICA einen wiederum anderen Zugang. Sein Film verweigert sich ebenfalls den Klischees des Genres, entblättert sich aber vielmehr langsam als tieftrauriges Psychodrama, in dem die schmierigen Männer (herausragend changierend zwischen Verzweiflung und Sleaze: Bruce Greenwood und Elias Koteas) zwar immer irgendwie bedrohlich wirken, aber in Wahrheit nur psychisch am Boden liegen und Zuspruch brauchen. Den finden sie im Stripclub ""Exotica"" und beim Stripdance von Christina (eine furiose Mia Kirshner) oder beim Autofahren mit der Nichte (eine ganz junge Sarah Polley). Die Hintergründe der Story offenbart uns Egoyan nur ganz langsam, und mit jedem Detail setzt sich das tragische Puzzle weiter zusammen.
Am Ende haben wir in Abgründe gesehen, vor allem aber die Suche nach Wahrheit und Nähe beobachtet.
EXOTICA zeichnet sich durch eine humanistische Perspektive aus, eine Wärme, die den Filmen der oben genannten Regisseure abgeht. Die Wirkung entfaltet sich langsam, ist dafür am Ende aber umso stärker.",4.0
"Canadian Film Watchlist #2: Exotica
Atom Egoyan does a really great job of starting in the middle of the story and using the revealing of context as markers in the plot. It's a bold move and one that's only available to somebody who's able to establish enough intrigue in their characters and setting to keep the audience asking questions. The film unravels like a mystery, but the core strands of it are ""what brought the characters here? and why are they staying?""
The politics of Exotica are ones where men ascribe their own world view onto their objects of desire. Christina isn't just expected to give them erotic entertainment, but also a sense of personal fulfillment, and it can be pretty harrowing to watch the (quite few) scenes that explore how its affected her. Voyeurism becomes a participatory theme in the film, where the audience is given a sick fascination in learning about the lives of these tormented characters.
If I were in Exotica I would simply respect women.",4.5
"Incredible performances, beautifully shot and written with delicacy — this is why we watch multiple features a day.",5.0
"The rare film that just gets better and better the more you watch of it and the more patience you give it. In the beginning, you simply have assumptions about the major players here. You assume Francis (Bruce Greenwood) is into Christina (Mia Kirshner) because he's just into that kind of thing and you assume things about Elias Koteas's character. You assume things about the relationship between Francis and Tracey (Sarah Polley) the girl he 'babysits' except in this case that oddly just means Tracey practices music at his house for awhile. The film introduces another POV through Thomas, an exotic animals dealer whom Francis is auditing. Eventually, the film slowly and thoroughly unravels all these assumptions and ends in a place where you understand these characters (even if I still think their actions in light of this information are um...troubling I'll leave it at that). Stick with it, you'll be glad you did.",4.0
"More of a satisfying curiosity than heartbreaking gut punch for me.
This got me thinking about twists in general, and how the Shyamalan discourse from my childhood made them seem gimmicky or something both loved and reviled, like pun dad jokes. But this movie's weight rests a lot on its twists and is very highly esteemed in critic circles. Is there a right way to do twists, and is this the way? Maybe it's because there's some thematic or emotional purpose to them, rather than to just get the audience to say ""damn that's crazy,"" the latter of which might feel like a self-serious street magician making a card disappear. It's impressive, but you know it's just a trick. There is some deftness to the twists here, where it doesn't feel like it's hitting you over the head with the fact that there's a reveal happening. It just sort of zooms out a little (literally), which I think is very clever.
I could see myself growing to really love this one so I'll come back to it eventually.",4.0
"Alright, well obviously the Leonard Cohen themed strip tease adds a star automatically. But unfortunately this movie suffers from, ""my ex would probably like this a lot"" vibes. And I don't make the rules, but that means I have to hate it.",3.5
"A jigsaw film. The pieces are the various broken individuals we meet, the big picture is their interconnectedness and shared histories. The driver event, around which this present swirls, was the murder of a little girl. We meet - in the surreal environment of the titular strip club - her father, the couple who discovered her body and other related actors. We also encounter a right creepy dude, a collector of exotic eggs, whose role seems very opaque. Stick with it, things do resolve, and you’ll be eager to rewatch, armed with knowledge instead of bemusement.
My favourite element here is the soundtrack which is just sublime. Leonard Cohen scoring a ‘schoolgirl’ striptease, you gotta love it. Even if you’re floundering with the plot, the sensory pleasures alone are worth it. Elias Koteas is memorable as the club DJ. A lot of the acting can seem weirdly stilted but, again, not so much on second viewing. Bear in mind these are traumatised people; hollow shells. Fascinating film, I need to check out more Atom Egoyan.",3.5

A través de los flashbacks se muestra el origen la relación entre Christina y Eric y se explica el enigmatico vínculo entre Christina y Francis. Convincente interpretación de Bruce Greenwood como Francis. La película se preocupó de dotar a cada uno de sus personajes con cierta complejidad psicológica. La ambientación (y la decoración del club Exótica principalmente) es hipnótica.

I should probably knock it down a half-star for the minute inconsistencies between the film prior and the ending but the ending is so emotionally affecting and ingenious at suggesting worlds of meaning that it’s too hard to beat.

"An enjoyable film, with some clever foreshadowing and interesting plot points. The thing I enjoy most about this is the bleak reality of stripping. It shows it for the depressing, suffocating profession which it is. It also highlights the dangers which obsession and jealousy can lead to. Pain is shown through every character in different ways. Christina shows pain when she reveals she doesn’t want to be a stripper, asking Zoe why she enjoys the club and why she doesn’t want to leave. Francis shows pain through going to the club, and by hiring a babysitter. Pinto shows pain through pretending to have free tickets to a ballet, luring men into sleeping with him by giving them free tickets. Eric shows pain through jealousy, as previously mentioned. The film links characters together well, with all stories coming together. Everyone gave good performances, nothing exceptional but all solid. It was pretty good, but not one of my favourites I’ve seen this year. 7.5 seems fair, but Letterboxd doesn’t let you go that in-depth.",3.5
"it just feels so sublime in so many regards; it prolly doesn't show on me, but it presents a mystery that has so many clear-cut answers as vague as it may seem at first, yet by the end, even though we get satisfied, there's still that feeling that it's not everything. it's one of those plot types that really lingers with you, trying to mull everything about it over, but still getting lost in the clear mist it presents itself in
and while it definitely follows in the footsteps of other psychological films, it especially stands out not just because of what i mentioned beforehand, but that, even with as dreamy as this movie can get, it's also extremely tender in it's own special way. you have these characters all lost in their alienation trying to reclaim past loves in their own weird and unique ways, and when those twists keep coming, it's a different of gut punch in relation to how it was set-up
if it sounds like i'm being too cool on it, that's only because it's atmosphere is cool enough to relax me as much as it had me on the edge of my seat. it weaved it's way into my delicate skin throughout, and even if it didn't have full power over me, i can easily see why this was so effective for so many others. it's just an exceptionally well-crafted psychological mystery, made especially better in comparison to the many weak efforts of it's kind in this era",4.0

This film begins with purposeful ambiguity that is slowly morphed into something completely different, and I found that journey to be absolutely riveting and unique. This movie may not be for everyone and parts of it are incoherent to the point of inaccessibility, but I had a blast seeing this narrative develop and I'd love to explore more of Atom Egoyan's filmography in the future.",3.5

"Like a web that’s gently tightening, Exotica is exquisitely well-woven, intensifying from every angle. The dialogue careful to create enough ellipsis, displacing us from unlocked truths, but adding new steps towards connection. It’s all infused with a strange and intoxicating atmosphere that’s stayed with me since - the alien greens of the pet shop fish tanks, the synthetic canopy and fake parrot of Eric’s DJ crow’s nest, the otherworldly gestures of Christina’s dance to Leonard Cohen, Mychael Danna’s shapeshifting score.
The spatial dynamics of the club itself mirror something of the viewer’s experience, as we attempt to peer in but stories remain frustratingly compartmentalised - out of reach. As Egoyan has said:
“This idea of creating a panopticon within the club, where all these people were being observed and yet none of them really understood what their connections were to each other, that begins to create this very interesting erotic tension, even though there’s no overt sexuality.”
Everywhere there are deep ritualistic patterns on repeat, like the mating dances of exotic birds. Turning up to the ballet with 1 spare ticket. Paying a babysitter to play piano in an empty house. ‘Everybody Knows’. Coping mechanisms for unspoken traumas. Birth and motherhood are oddly displaced, with stolen rare eggs, the strip club’s matrilineal history, a secret contract for a baby that’s growing in the owner’s womb.
The ending is abrupt, in a way, but an effectively prismatic close - revealing some new glimpse of understanding but keeping certain truths still locked away.
Made me think of Lynch (quite a lot) and the short-story of web of Short Cuts (a little), but in many ways it's sui generis. On initial viewing it felt to me like a ‘younger’ artist’s film than The Sweet Hereafter, for better and for worse, but its depth - both tonally and thematically - has really persisted with me since, in ways I couldn’t have predicted.",4.5

"""Exotica"" absorbs its audience in a warm and numbing atmosphere strongly influenced by the film's pleasantly shady set pieces and a luscious soundtrack. Director Atom Egoyan clearly enjoys to slowly unravel the film's characters and their backstory – and maybe he enjoys this a bit too much. Camera work, editing and dialogue always carry a subtle undertone of mystery, crime and sorrow. Sadly, the plot and its motifs are much less interesting than their presentation suggests. The audience is confronted with a rather uninspired tale and an inconsequential crude ending. ""Exotica"" is a technically solid but overall mediocre drama whose most striking feature is the ability to capture and reproduce an elusive sentiment of full-bodied but aimless sadness that seems to be impregnated into every frame. Transcending this sentiment would allow for a cathartic experience – an experience that is absent from Egoyan's 1994 feature.",3.0

"Nr. 21
Ein weitere Film aus der Reihe von Roger Eberts grössten Filme aller Zeiten. Diesmal ein Film von Atom Egoyan aus dem Jahre 1994. Exotica ist der Name eines sehr speziellen Erotik-Etablissments in dem sich die Wege der verschiedenen Protagonisten, wie wir im Laufe des Filmes erfahren werden, kreuzen. Da ist zum einen Francis (Bruce Greenwood ), ein Finanzprüfer, der täglich in diesen Club kommt und immer wieder die gleiche Frau, Christina (Mia Kirshner), an seinen Tisch bittet, damit diese vor seinen Augen tanze. Dies erregt zunehmend den Unwillen von Eric (Elias Koteas), ein wie wir später erfahren frührer Liebhaber von Christina. Schliesslich wäre da noch Thomas (Don McKellar), der Besitzer eines Reptilienladens, bei dem Francis die Bücher prüfen soll.
Genau so unzusammenhängend, wie dies nun klingt, wird es auch erzählt. Überhaupt ist die Erzählweise das eigentlich interessante des Filmes. Denn erst auf den allerletzten Metern erfahren wir, wie die verschiedenen Charaktere zusammenhängen und dass das, was zunächst völlig wirr und unzusammenhängend scheint, aufs Engste miteinander verknüpft ist.
Ein wenig begibt sich der Film damit aber auch in eine Falle. Zwar gelingt es Egoyan den Zuschauer bis zuletzt in einer süssen Verwirrtheit zu halten und ihn sehnsüchtig auf Antworten hoffen zu lassen. Am Ende aber wird das Ganze vielleicht zu einfach und zu eindeutig aufgelöst. Anders als etwa bei Lynch entstehen hier keine mehrfachen Lesarten und ich kann mich des Gefühls nicht ganz erwehren einen zwar brilliant gemachten, aber dennoch einem klaren Theatertrick aufgesessen zu sein.
Dem Film hilft allerdings seine durchaus ""exotische"" Skurrilität der Protagonisten. Auch seine, durchaus auch 1994 noch eher ungewöhnlich offener Umgang mit Homosexualität sei hier kurz erwähnt.
Am Ende bleibe ich etwas ratlos zurück. Als Film, der über von seiner nicht-linearen Struktur lebt, bleibt er für mich deutlich hinter z.B. Memento zurück. Als Film, der sich für die psycho-sexuelle Neurose seines Protagonisten interessiert, bleibt er letztlich zu sehr an der Oberfläche.",3.0
"A feature which initially beckoned one hither with its choice and particular air, prior to committing to an Hitchcockian thriller plot, which, while fairly well carried off, was all folded up a shade too neatly and via a shade too much telling, over showing. The intertwining of what initially seem to be unconnected characters is a sound basis for many dramatic pictures, but in this instance it was the distinct and peculiar setting and register which proved the most gripping elements, and these were somewhat consigned during the film’s second half.
The film’s opening line was delivered in such an intense and angular fashion that transplantation to the ‘real world’ seemed a very remote prospect: it advised a customs officer to gaze through a two-way mirror and take in all a prospect’s detail, in a way which immediately enhanced the senses, immersing me near-totally in the glass, darkly version of human relations and the built environment which was on the film’s agenda. The dialogue proceeded without quite so much portent, but in a fashion which seemed superficially reasonable and seldom languorous, while leaving vast quantities of context and sentiment unexpressed. Bruce Greenwood, in particular, spoke with a sound courtesy and articulateness, even as he was engaged in practices for which there seemed no innocent explanation. Visually, the film was a succession of visions, of things which were not right, dirty even, or criminal, and captivating for the challenge they posed, their wavy movement, and the consumptive strength of their wrongness. A dreamy figure requesting one ticket for a ballet, say, or bank upon bank of green-tinged, leaky fish tanks, were not the sort of spectacles easily put behind one, to mention nothing of the film’s titular strip club, shot with such a distanced, rolling view that the shame of the place became choking, its interior design eerily warped and reptilian.
Having established such a different, and otherworldly, tone and aesthetic, Exotica played out in a fashion encountered much more commonly, the whole film from that point given over to that fashion. The threads began to tie together, and the reasons for each of them doing so, matters from the past and the present, were spelled out, as the film’s dramatic payoff. In some instances, as with the fitting of the sickly green vision wanderers into the completing jigsaw, this was handled well, an awful revelation brought across by one distressing shot, and an indication provided, via good acting, of the distress it was still causing. In others, as with the cleaning up of all of the whys of an audit and regular $20 an hour payments, and a particular relationship having been sustained, the donkey work was given over to the dialogue, which made sure to leave nothing unaccounted for. At the end, the full monty was presented, gift-wrapped and with a tight little bow tied about it. Not quite the end I had been hoping for for such a many-bywayed proposition.
Exotica might have better lived up to its title, but it did not do badly on that score, all things considered. It truly was unlike anything else (by any non-Atom Egoyan director, that is, and even that qualification is only valid to a certain extent), until the point, about the time of the first bathroom encounter, that it was no longer so.",3.5

"I really wanted Exotica to dive a little deeper into the mystery surrounding the murder of Francis’ daughter that is briefly displayed and talked about towards the end of the film. We get a slight glimpse at why Francis acts the way he does with the stripper Christina but it all seemed to jam packed at the end to try and reveal a big secret that really doesn’t hit the bang it intends to do. Exotica could have benefited from flashbacks of the murder during all of the strip club scenes to give the film a wider range that could have ultimately left a longer lasting ending impact.
Score 73/100",3.5
"Provocative in many ways, this character driven piece centered around some suspect folks is a classic midnight movie. The film has a good suspense-style pacing that plays on the oddities that are the Exotica and its frequent patrons.
The attention to detail in the dialogue is what really drove this film to me. Long scenes felt meaningful. So much of the drama felt established without a lot of context as to who these people were and why the story was connecting all of them. This leads to a very fulfilling finish and one hog who is full. 😋
This style of film is always going to be in an upper tier for me. They have this unique strangeness that feels like me in so many ways.

"Begins like a thinking man's Crimes of Passion, duping you into expecting a slow-burning study of kinks, hang-ups, and the ways sexual identities restrict or liberate us. But then Atom Egoyan—who jumped to the top of my ""must explore further"" list with this one traumatizing tour de force—slowly peters out a procession of haunting revelations that color in and demystify Exotica's torrid cast of depressing beauties. They orbit and bump into one another like dirty water circling the drain. This film is what so many Award-thirsty ensemble dramas strive to be, but Egoyan doesn't make the mistake of reaching for palatable themes or pretending there's a neat bow to tie on his story. It's nothing more than a humbling, contemplative purgatory on earth.",4.5
"I think what this movie does that other mysteries fail to do is to give us a satisfying conclusion. Whereas most mystery films attempt to shock us with some huge affair, a murdered lover or a character who has been dead the whole time, this one doesn’t.

Incredibly well written, acted and directed. The atmosphere of exotic, voyeuristic, sensual pain is conveyed well.

"It’s rare to see fictional media this fucked up that’s also this tender and cathartic. Even if Egoyan hadn’t gone for a deliciously complex structure rife with parallelism brinkmanship, that delicate balance would’ve been enough.
Strangely, there are a lot of seemingly loose ends that, if anything, enhance the film. Many of these surround Christina: her life decisions aren’t entirely clear, and her demeanor shifts between the flashbacks, present, and final “reveal” aren’t either. I’d argue that she’s just as crucial as Francis to... the plot? the emotional core? but leaving those holes empty fills something else. Exotica clearly has strong n influences; maybe that’s the femme fatale leaking through.
Gorgeous set and lighting design, both reminiscent of Terry Gilliam taken down a few notches and weaned off psychedelics. The score’s also excellent: Indian and maghreb-inspired ambient house (like a William Orbit B side or if Transglobal Underground was commissioned for muzak) sprinkled with pastoral piano/keyboard work. I also wasn’t aware of that Leonard Cohen song until now. I thought it was Yello until I noticed the lyrics were actually serious.",4.5

What MASTERMIND plotted this tapestry.

The score was also really unique and set the mood. I will admit to watching a lot of movies cause I feel like I should watch them and I find a lot of favourites doing that but it's so special to watch something like this i wanted to watch and was excited by it and not being disappointed from a few scenes in I also was in and ready to see where the ride took me.,4.5

"I really haven't explored 90s arthouse as much as I should have. Watching this movie, I enjoyed imagining what it would be like for someone like Mike D'Angelo, who I know loves this movie, to watch it first the first time in 1994 as a nascent film critic and get his mind blown. Yeah, this is exactly the kind of smart, sexy movie I would have loved too. The formal inventiveness of interconnecting stories (after Crash, it should have been retired) and out-of-order storytelling (not yet stale; I still enjoy these kinds of movies) has been done to death so it doesn't feel quite as fresh as it might have in 1994. The out-of-order storytelling has been done by people like Tarantino (to great effect) and Iñárritu (to lesser) but at this time it was still new, I think. What I liked about it was that it was not at all what it appears to be, and has plot twists that don't feel cheap. The story unfolds, and each scene reveals new things that force you to re-contextualize everything over and over again, so it's only at the very end that you arrive at where you should have been at the beginning, narrative-wise and knowledge-wise. I think it's a great depiction of the ways we can let desire rule our lives and enslave us, and the ways that we duct tape together solutions for our traumas rather than working through them.

That said, I was a little put off by some of the dialogue, which often lacked a sense of subtlety and made it feel like more of a stage play than a film at times.

With his obsessive character study, 'Exotica', Canadian auteur, Atom Egoyan creates a magnificent work of cinematic style and craft, that would go onto cement his name on the global filmmaking stage.
Egoyan's elusive and intricate tale follows a man who is plagued with issues from his past, as he frequents the club Exotica in an attempt to find solace, but even there his past seems to follow him with characters who seem to be connected in ways, even they may not know about.
With immense narrative depth in the films character dynamics and emotions, Egoyan has made a profound and drifting work with 'Exotica'.
Delving into the mysteries at the core of human nature, Egoyan evokes rich ideas of sexuality and obsession.
Featuring some masterful out of sequence editing and appropriately atmospheric cinematography, this is a film in which the technical craftsmanship is matched by the sensational ensemble cast at the forefront.
From its allegorical opening frame, to its meticulously structured conclusion, 'Exotica', is a work of sensational filmmaking talent. Egoyan helps us to confront our darkest secrets, through both despair and empathy, perhaps in a way only he knows how.",5.0

"Can't deny the emotional complexity, which deepens as the film unfolds and details reveal themselves. It's heavy and affecting stuff, particularly through the last few scenes. I wasn't really sold until then. It's a very serious film, and I had trouble getting on its level through long stretches. Weirdly, the aesthetics and tone kept me at a distance, and it's not often that something feeling dated makes it feel less prescient to me. The movie isn't so stylized, but the conventions of the time, from a big gaudy club set to these specific character archetypes to the extremely sincere dialogue, don't do much for me. Feels like normal 90s artifice but here telling a delicate, complicated art film story. I tend to love movies about broken grieving people, but there wasn't much here that felt real or human to me despite strong characters and a satisfying narrative. It's very good, effective, and compelling storytelling I didn't enjoy as much as I wanted to.",3.5
"I love this movie. It makes Canada look really dark and gritty but all these terrifying maniacs are still saying things like Aboot and Eh. It’s a melodrama with a mystery’s structure that plays like a character piece. It’s moody, and perverse, and it digs right into the taboos of sex work without judgement.

Would be a fun double feature with Hustlers if you wanted to trick a bunch of normies into seeing something great.",5.0

4. Watch a film that either takes place in Ontario, or was filmed in Ontario.
Exotica explores the animalistic nature of human impulses and desires. Atom shows these feelings intensified by loss. Out of jealousy, deceit, or physical separation, introducing intimacy may drive some mad. The masks we wear to conceal our behavior will slip. Like the dancers, Egoyan delivers this in a flashy package, doling out details with each extended scene. This carefully crafted piece culminates in one final show. Only the final release never comes. In its place is a cold, anticlimactic finish. Dancer or tragedy, the most desired connection fails to materialize.",4.5

"Well, I think I have a new favourite.
I understand that that's a very sudden conclusion to make, and honestly it's one I'm not totally sure of, but the state of pure awe this film has left me in definitely inclines me to believe that it is among the best films I've ever seen.
While its atmosphere is very seductive and intriguing in the beginning, it becomes crescently more dispondant, bleak, and much more depressing than what I was anticipating, while maintaining, throughout the entirety of its duration, an overall mystery of which we can only make assumptions of. In my opinion that's why the writing here is phenomenal, it maintains such a dense mysterious tone that inevitably induces us to try and put the pieces together of what's happening. And sure, many films do that, but I think none does it in the way this film does. Honestly in the last 30 minutes or so my heart was pounding off of my chest, and the ending really blew me away.
Not only is Exotica's core narrative spectacular, but also the exploration it presents of its characters is very intriguing, hard-hitting and honestly unforgettable. The writing also shines in this aspect, in the way it progressively lets us know about the individuals while always maintanting the mystery about them, which appears quite paradoxical, but is executed with a degree of perfection that is impossible to describe.
The acting further contributes to the psychological exploration of the characters presented here, with every actor giving his all in his performance. It's basically impossible for me to pick a highlight because everyone did their job so much better than what I can put to words.
The cinematography is beautiful, and really helps in defining the simultaneously seductive and mysterious atmosphere of the film, with the highlights in my opinion being the scenes that occur in the Exotica club. This film really looks amazing and has such a characteristic, unique, very defined tone to it.
And the cherry on top of the cake is the soundtrack, that is nothing short of perfection. Every moment of it goes perfectly with the film and improves the experience even further.
Exotica is an amazing experience, a tale of obsession, desire, depression, and surely one I will not forget, due to its perfect writing, acting, cinematography, and soundtrack. This is going to stick with me for a long while.",5.0
"A vanity of vanities. An expression of love for pretty things. Pretty characters sleepwalk and exchange feeble dialogue in pretty places. We're led to believe their lobotomized cool conceals dark truths, that gazing through a one-way mirror is starring into somebody's naked soul.
I find it's more like Narcissus mistaking his reflection for another. The voyeurism is a cover. It's a way to obfuscate ego. That's what art is. It's deconstructing experience into self-reflexive points so abstracted you might barely recognize them yourself. So abstract that another might mistake your reflection for their own.
This movie for instance. I can't be sure Exotica is as interested in what I find interesting about it. It clings to taboo like a ticket out of the abyss. It treats the allure of forbidden fruit as something singular and profound. In a way, that's true. Transgression isn't a fetish itself. It's the condition for fetishization underwriting every nasty impulse we'll ever feel. The examples can be normalized and, in effect, destroyed. Art that speaks generally to that urge will endure long after.
Of course, transgression requires rules to break, the oldest of which have been codified into religion. The chief metaphor here is obvious. There are Adams, Eves, devils, forbidden fruits, and Edens aplenty. Two or three variations of the tale collide. Nabokov's Lolita is recalled in one as a man pacifies his pedephilic urges with the aid of a dancer posting as a nymphette. A scorned ex-lover tempts him, and he is cast out from the strip club to live in sin.
The overlap and interaction between these falls from grace is poignant. Identities echo each other and conflict with themselves. The universal myth is grounded again and again in tragic personal experience. The differences between people become superficial. Everyone is a Christ redeeming another's sin. The late twist isn't half as elegant as that symbolism. It's a very 1990s way to end a movie, but it's probably more satisfying than something more sophisticated. It also raises more suspicion about how much of this is just an exercise in edge.
Thankfully, it's all beautiful. Look but don't touch.",3.0
"Gonna ignore all the one-way mirror thematic shenanigans and the calculated, devastating plot reveals to instead talk about Thomas, whose character's importance would be reduced to nothing more than a mannequin plot device in lesser hands. He doesn't have the backward-reaching narrative importance of the other characters and primarily serves (plot-wise) as a fulcrum for Francis' intended murder, but Egoyan goes and gives Thomas a soul anyway. His own version of ritualistic behavior constantly gets crosscut with Francis' grief-denial, and he is far more privy to what Christina's and Francis' symbiotic relationship entails than either you or me. Rather than sideline him, Egoyan weaves him into the thematic structure of the entire film. That's one hell of a way to write a would-be ancillary character.",4.5
"Wow.
Eroticism being a conduit for deeper thought and investigations of trauma...
While eroticism ( and of course exoticism) plays a big part in this movie, it is a symptom of the dis-ease that lies underneath. Depression, jealousy, trauma.
There's so much that is unspoken, conveyed by small movements and looks by the actors, the music and the shots.
Atom Egoyan is extremely evocative in the way he directs. What a mood.
I love how it slowly and subtly picks up pace to reveal itself.

"A deep dive into the sexuality that underlies our varied emotional and psychological states. The film is a wild swirl of four principal characters as they navigate each other and the film slowly reveals their complicated histories.
Its strong emphasis on grief provides an examination of how people find solace through exotic channels of human connection. But from strictly a narrative standpoint, the film wouldn't work as well without some creative play. Specifically, the way in which the film starts with darker, seedier portraits of each character, and slowly peels away these assumptions to reveal the more sincere and emotional distress that fuels their actions, creates a mysterious framework of plot directions. It's this feeling of marinating in a pool of narrative possibilities that gives the film a dynamic quality. This along with a tight script, great dialogue, a moody soundtrack, and precise editing lends this film to be a hidden gem.",5.0

"This is my first introduction to Atom Egoyan and his direction/writing is absolutely phenomenal in Exotica. Although comparisons to Cronenberg and Lynch come to mind with its seductive setting and dreamy noir aesthetic this still feels like the work of a distinctive auteur in complete control of their craft.
From the very first scene the interlocking clues and motifs start presenting themselves, teased in the cinematography and dialogue as characters are stripped bare just like the dancers at the titular club. Layer by layer we see them unravel through growing pains of grief, innocence, obsession and twisted desire. What begins as a sexy glimpse at nightclub life gradually builds to a psychological red light roller-coaster of intensity and emotion.
And through it all we are led by the fantastic performances of Bruce Greenwood and Elias Koteas, the former presenting an insidious vessel of trauma while the latter sports a strange affection behind his masculine stature. However I will say that despite being hooked by the plot and characters I thought some of the twists and turns were fairly predictable, but it definitely did not deter my enjoyment one bit.
Overall this film was a satisfyingly complex and clever experience with a hugely impressive attention to detail and some very strong storytelling. To thoroughly unpack the dense themes and symbolism will surely require another visit to Exotica and I highly anticipate my return.",4.5

"EXOTICA is the intoxicating, seductive, hypnotic film directed by Canadian/Armenian Atom Egoyan.
On the surface, the strip club EXOTICA is erotica: a live cock tease. For the price of a lap dance, lonely, horny guys can feel a little less lonely. And a lot more horny.
But the customers aren’t getting it up. They’re drawn to EXOTICA by urges much deeper and more complicated than their anonymous quickies in the john to relieve the pressure.
It's the hunt, the hope, and the elusive promise of sexual pleasure that's an antidote to their grief and profound loss of intimate human connections.
It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
It's the secret lives of an exotic mix of randy tax auditors and hot customs agents, creepy peeping DJ's and pregnant club owners, furry pet smugglers and gay ballet lovers, baby-sitting jail bait and barely legal strippers.
All of whom have much to hide. And much that binds them together in surprising ways.
Without getting too close to the unknowable, director Egoyan gradually sneaks us past their façades as they dare to bare the state of their souls.
The ambiguity of having our assumptions about the motivations and intentions of the characters constantly upended is unsettling, creating a sense of uneasiness about what we think is going on.
Egoyan cracks open the mysterious unknown of trying to know--and being known by--another human being.
In the lyrics of Leonard Cohen:
And everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows",5.0

"In Exotica, Francis is a regular in the domain of the erotic, a Toronto strip club, but it isn't jouissance he is after. Meanwhile, Thomas maps and re-maps a potential erotic encounter onto the plane of more traditional entertainment, the opera. The sets, mood, lighting, costumes, photography, and acting are all brilliantly done. Egoyan has said he constructed the story like a strip tease, peeling off a layer at a time. In doing so he has made a melodrama that feels like a thriller and a ""sexy movie"" that is a moving meditation on grief and trauma.",5.0

Some questions are answered, others are left dangling, and the drama winds up culminating in the next to last scene, with a glimpse into the fantasy to close out the narrative. Sarah Polley is electric, Greenwood is great, and the other performances are perfectly weird/dirty, particularly Koteas.",4.5
"Despite its purposefully roundabout structure, it doesn't take long for Exotica to make its way to the title strip joint. Thomas (Don McKellar) has just disembarked from an airplane and is more or less pushed into sharing a cab with a man on their way downtown. When he gets out, he hands Thomas a pair of ballet tickets in lieu of splitting the fare, leaving the soft-spoken pet store owner to bumble his reluctant acceptance. The cab drives off and we find ourselves across the street from Exotica, the central location for Atom Egoyan's breakout feature.
After entering the club, it doesn't take long for the film to lose almost all of my sympathy. A film can feature people genuine stripping and develop those characters at the same time, but Egoyan is no Lorene Scafaria. Instead of first endearing us to the stripper of note, Mia Kirshner as Christina, we arrive at Elias Koteas' DJ/MC character, Eric. Maybe that was a decision made to put us in the seats of the Exotica audience members, but Egoyan forgoes many opportunities to develop Mia as a character. We spend more quality time with Eric than we do Mia, and a good portion of her performance is just her dancing.
There's a hint of lesbianism that is dropped and never discussed, and the flashbacks that feature Eric and Christina in a radically different environment add nothing to their characters but unnecessary backstory and a cheap setup. If Egoyan was going to make good on what I assume is an earnest intention to look at the potentially important role any given stripper could have. Christina doesn't need to be as bombastic or central to conflict as Eric is, but she does need to be more than a plot device for Bruce Greenwood's grieving Francis. And Eric needs to be good at his job. I've never been to a strip club, but I would assume that if the dancers were female and the announcer were male, I would not want him to whisper cryptic or repetitive phrases with a nervous growl. I'd rather him talk as little as possible.
Francis, Thomas, Christina, and Eric are interconnected in various ways, and some are not revealed until the contrived ending. The two main events imply that human connection is just a moment of honesty away. If only Egoyan had a grasp on what it is to be human. He waters his characters down to be defined by tragedy rather than action, leaving them to move around his films like pawns for a theme.
He trusts these cardboard cutouts to do more than he has made them capable of doing. We have only seen Thomas participate in some sort of unofficial gay hookup system using spare ballet tickets and in his brief interactions with Francis. His action at the climax of the film is literally forced and there is nothing established in his character that would allow him to transcend that. The final moment between Francis and Eric is devoid of any actual tension, almost immediately resolving itself despite the seemingly high stakes. There was no ending that could have salvaged this unnatural creation. Exotica is deeply flawed, starting with some extremely illogical assumptions about how humans grieve and internalize things.",0.0

On sens les émotions d'angoisse mais on est perdu dan les relations. C'est quoi le passé entre ce dj avec les cheveux de Kenny G et la stripteaseuse qui personnifie la voyeurisme des jeunes filles. L'intrigue du contrebandier et ses chers œufs est laissé tomber et existe plus pour la symbolisme même si ça fait pour une bonne histoire toute seule.

"Exotica is a mystifying Atom Egoyan movie, intriguing and out of reach but building repeatedly to knockout scenes. I prefer The Sweet Hereafter overall, but Paul Sarossy shoots the shit out of this, and it may just eclipse The Ice Storm as my favourite Mychael Danna score (and he's one of the best composers).
The appealing central ensemble of people who you can never see in big enough showcase roles normally--Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner, Arsinée Khanjian, Elias Koteas, Sarah Polley, Don McKellar, and Victor Garber--is a pretty unimpeachable batch of performances. Greenwood is best in show; with big scenes that each demand a different mode for the character, he's tasked with the believable throughline and for the flashback whammys tracking. It's one built for rewatch value, that's for sure.
I do think more nuance and insight is granted to the male characters and more room for performance range therein despite most of them being dicks; the women nod along in vague agreement to the best lines, and they're saddled with the more esoteric and voiceless roles. The character dynamics and sympathies are appropriately post-De Palma, but a self-aware male gaze doesn't automatically cease to suffer from its issues.",4.0

Masterful. One of the most well directed films I've seen. How does nobody talk about this movie?

The characters are incredibly interesting and I was enthralled to see where their stories went and how they correlated. The screenplay is complex but never feels over packed. The score is immaculate. Just amazing. The whole cast is great, but Bruce Greenwood has this contained turmoil that's portrayed fantastically. The ending is a lot to consume at once, but after thinking on it for a day I've decided most of it works for me and leaves an unnerving feeling within me.

"The first time that I watched this I was more enamoured with the performances than anything else. Elias Koteas and Bruce Greenwood are both fantastic, with pitch perfect work from Don McKellar, Arsinee Khanjian, Victor Garber, and main draw, Mia Kirshner rounding out a super heartfelt ensemble. That said, I think the brilliance of this movie I really didn’t appreciate on initial viewing, because its magnificence is not in the plot, but in the meaning that the individual viewer draws from what unfolds on screen.
The narrative does not unfold in linear fashion, the film is presented to us as a tangled web, and it is very much up to the viewer to decipher or draw meaning from it. As the puzzle of a plot is sorted into order, as we learn more and more about these characters, we understand more about them, and are left to judge for ourselves how we feel about these people based on what we now know at journeys end.
Such movies are obviously hugely polarizing, because many people have no interest in unearthing understanding, and would rather just be told a story. If that’s what you’re after then this is not the movie for you, because just watching it for the narrative you’re not likely to take much away from it beyond the very basics of human behaviour, with effective portraits of jealousy, and loneliness, but if you’re prepared to pay it your full attention, I think it’s a hugely rewarding piece of work that gets life just about right.",3.5

"What I initially thought was going an enjoyable sleazy 90s erotic thriller, Exotica slowly morphed into an entrancing character study on emotional dependence. Much more somber than sexy (even tho bearded Bruce Greenwood can, like, get it.) At first glance the plot may seem unfocused and scatterbrained, but every piece of the narrative puzzle falls into place without contrivance or convenience. Exotica is presented as if it were a striptease, always hiding in plain sight and subtly revealing its true self throughout its runtime. And it's easy to feel that way when the whole film is as expertly scored by Mychael Danna. Felt like I was suffocating in a pleasant cloud of sweat and hookah smoke. Also a lot more gay than any of the other tragically hetero pandering sexual thrillers of the era I've seen so brownie points there.

I love the way each plot thread eventually weaves itself together, but ultimately the big picture still left too many open ends for some of the players of the film. Atom Egoyan certainly has a keen sense of place and tone, but a lot of his dialogue borderlines on saccharine and over sentimental. Egoyan and Cronenberg are both Canadian talents with a firm grasp of their vision, but I prefer the body horror master's sense of detachment in his characters than the romanticized emotional heft Egoyan goes for here. There are also a few moments of bad dubbing, awkward cuts, a poorly choreographed fight(?) scene, and the titular Exotica at times looks less like a seedy nightclub and more like a Rainforest Cafe.

There's still something utterly transfixing within the walls of Exotica that I can't quite put my finger on, and judging from a lot of the more positive reviews here that seems to be a shared sentiment. What I can say is that it is an absolute crime for there to be zero U.S. distribution for the film both physically and digitally. This work deserves a LOT more than a youtube rip.",4.0
"I don't think I'll be able to write a correct and compelling review for this movie, but here goes nothing anyway;
Exotica begins with a handful of strange characters. I'd want to visualize them like puzzle pieces - out of prejudice I can assume what the picture will look like and I start putting the pieces in certain spots and corners accordingly. But as the film goes along not only do I realize that the placement of the puzzle pieces is incorrect, the picture in my head is way off. I am a bit annoyed at myself for assuming as much as I did about the characters. I hate that I thought I could figure out the directions the movie could take when in actuality, I couldn't have been more wrong. I won't go too deeply into my assumptions, but let's round it up by saying everything is a lot more mild and cuts way deeper than I could have imagined. So for defying me and hurting my ego, I give this film credit.
The movie is not much of a puzzle in itself. It is pretty straightforward but the use of non-linear storytelling to let everything unfold at a satisfying tempo works miracles. Each and everyone from the cast is stupendously good. I have no complaints, not a single line is delivered wobbily, not a single gesture or movement takes me out of the movie or has me ""suspend disbelief"", as we all so often have to in order to enjoy our movies. I can hardly think of movies that flesh out their characters so well.
Francis is a man who visits an erotic club named ""Exotica"" every other night. He seems to be obsessed with one of the dancers, Christina, whose act includes that of a schoolgirl. But whether Francis is obsessed by desire or something else, you can't quite tell. The DJ of the club, Eric, is concerned with their odd relationship, because he once used to be Christina's boyfriend. Meanwhile Thomas, an exotic pet-shopkeeper, has successfully smuggled two eggs of an expensive animal species. His accounts are a mess and Francis is set on the job, because he is a tax auditor. He finds out Thomas may be up to some shady stuff.
A lot can be said about the characters, but in no way do they confirm to any sort of stereotype. Everything about them is as complex as any real person, perhaps even more because hey, they're all tormented by all kinds of feelings and their feelings are interesting enough to make a movie about. The fact that even then, after fleshing these people out, yes, they are people, even then the movie finds ways of intriguing me with suspense and an open mind that allows for interpretation and different takes, maybe darker in tone than Egoyan would have thought himself. Saying it would be a lighthearted movie would be saying something like Parasite didn't deserve the Oscar for being a foreign language movie. You couldn't be more wrong! Still, I feel like some light filters through the trees that cast shadow. Because that relationship between Francis and Christina is very much one that I would compare to something like Charlotte and Bob in my beloved Lost in Translation in terms of my emotional involvement in them, however screwed up anyone might think it is.
It's rare to come across movies that have this effortless sense to them. It's a perfect picture. There is no way around it. There are more perfect movies, but I don't always enjoy them enough to give them the highest scores - in this case I have no reason to refrain from doing so. Exotica is genius. It goes far beyond what I expected from it, and it goes far beyond what I needed to have an amazing 100 minutes, and as my favourite movies do it reminds me of how much I love watching movies. If it was possible, I want every movie to do that. I want everything to hit me as hard emotionally, whether it is crying your eyes out or laughing your ass off or being so excited that you are biting your nails while at the edge of your seat - I want every movie to do that, and give me more reason to go, ""hey, you know, that's why movies are the best thing in the world!"".",5.0

The movie jumps between settings, timelines, and characters, while slowly exploring their psyche.

The wonderful ensemble cast brings to life the wild and exotic characters of the story who are, somehow, interlinked in this mysterious journey.",0.0
"From the outside, this probably gives the impression of an erotic thriller, and while I won’t contest that adjective (let’s just say that Kirshner’s routine + Koteas’ DJ…produce the intended effect), Exotica is hardly ever strictly thrilling, strip club sting notwithstanding. That’s an observation, not a criticism. What the film really is is a masterful exercise in withholding, parceling out, and recontextualizing information, anchored by a truly first-rate Greenwood performance which plays as inscrutable on first pass but in retrospect is imbued with astonishing sincerity. Knowing going in that all of the narrative threads would eventually cross* denied me the pleasure of being set adrift and subsequently reeled back in by Egoyan…but then I also suspect that actively trying to put the puzzle pieces together from the jump may have kept me from disengaging as I might have had I not known that I was looking at a disassembled puzzle. As is often my experience with “puzzle pictures,” I find myself more…affected, let’s say, than deeply moved, but I’m writing this nearly two months after seeing the film and am still haunted by the final shot, which on its own is completely ordinary (save for its striking composition) but in context carries a staggering implication about the nature of Francis and Christina’s relationship. For that reason—the recontextualization aspect—and a few others (viz. the hauntingly beautiful score, the protagonist that copes with trauma via perverse dress-up rituals), Exotica reminds me of Vertigo, which inspires optimism re a rating uptick upon my inevitable second viewing.

"Although as narratively and thematically uneven as any of his movies, there are few filmmakers with as confident a grasp of tone and atmosphere as Atom Egoyan. He has had a strange career and the character of his movies seems to be well expressed by his own identity blending a stereotypically mature Canadian thoughtfulness and introspective attitude with an Eastern sense of mysticism. His collaborations with composer Mychael Danna, whose music is a similar blend of styles contribute a lot to that unique atmosphere. 
All his films have a similar focus on interpersonal relationships where sex is more of a visual metaphor than a subject itself, the film instead presenting characters undergoing overwrought melodramatic storylines with an impassive sense of reserve, his writing overburdening every character with an inner life of self analysis and reflection. There is a lot of talk here about who the characters are, what motivates them, and how they seem to one another and the audience. 
Here the ensemble drama is built around a strip club where melancholic tax inspector Francis goes to dote on one of the dancers, while various other characters drift in and out of the orbit of the establishment. 
How much the film is accomplishing and how well is debatable, at the centre of all this navel gazing there seems to be nothing more than a little sentimentality as it’s foundation, which leaves the film open to reasonable accusations of pretentiousness, but the film is more about atmosphere and character than theme and it’s an oddly compelling film that perhaps takes a little too much of its watchability from its salacious setting.",3.5

"I had completely missed this one.
""Exotica"" takes place in a Toronto strip club that is decorated very much like one of those ""Rainforest Cafe"" chain restaurants where it starts to ""rain"" every 15 minutes during your lunch.
However, the film itself is a tight, nuanced, jigsaw- like experience. Although slow- paced, it never felt slow. More like methodical. The film tracks a mentality ill tax adjuster who is enraptured with a young dancer at the club. Her ex-boyfriend is the brutally annoying DJ at the club, who is obsessed with the dancer.
A second parallel story tracks a pet shop owner who specializes in smuggling exotic Macaws, and who goes to the ballet to pick up men. Yes, it's bizarre.
Bizarre as it may be, it is very original, gripping and very atmospheric. It also has a banger of an ending.
""Exotica"" is a great one out of Canada.",4.5
"Exactly the type of storytelling that I usually hate — a filmmaker deliberately withholding information from the viewer to blindside them with it later. After all, the flashbacks weaved throughout and the VHS footage proves that Egoyan is an omniscient third-person voice: he could tell you everything you needed to know from the very first scene, but decides instead to keep most (if not all) of the character motivation in his back pocket till the last 20 minutes.
But what makes it work is that ultimately you learn he’s not actually interested in the plot so much — the climax that he’s set up his pieces for totally dissolves in a tragic, pathetic hug. Instead, he really wants to explore people, even people as narratively redundant as Thomas, whose whole purpose on page is simply to get one character where they need to be at the right time. Everyone is a cog in a machine, but by the end you learn the machine doesn’t actually do anything; it has no purpose at all. And when you realise that, you’re forced to go back over the whole thing and see the cogs for what they are.",4.0
"I think what really captivates me here is the sense of mystery to the whole thing. So many characters behave in unusual ways, and even when their motivations are explained, some of them remain anomalies. The narrative is constantly shifting, as Egoyan's script hides information to be exposed at key moments, and at its most extreme this process radically changed my perception of certain main characters. It's a tricky tonal tightrope, but every detail reinforces that beguiling mystery, and the performances go a long way towards selling these odd, broken people. It's such an atmospheric and impressively shot movie, too, where the camera frequently enters locations with a moody establishing montage, and where each set is framed to underline the emotions of the scene. The cryptic layers of symbolism and unusual character behaviour ultimately makes the themes somewhat cryptic, but that's to the film's benefit, as the peculiar mixture of sexuality and grief here is as fascinating as it is unnerving. I'll surely have more to say when I inevitably revisit this; for now I'm content to highly recommend it.",4.5
"I’ve seen this a few times before, and it’s easy to get caught up in its clinically mysterious tone (really, there are no jokes whatsoever in early Egoyan films, and probably the late ones too but I stopped watching him after Ararat [which fyi I think is very good]) even though I know exactly how it’s all going to pan out. Mike D’Angelo’s rave gives this one some serious credence, but as with his similarly enthusiastic thoughts on The Game, I don’t see quite the same depth behind its stunningly crafted facade.",4.0
"1. A rather lackluster drama of interlocking narratives. Motivations are not clearly presented, but at the same time not ambiguous in a productive way.

3. This movie feels like it's trying to be important, profound, serious. It ends up being just a bit goofy.",2.5
"Falsely marketed as an “erotic thriller”, Atom Egoyan’s haunting, hypnotic, multi-faceted drama is a curious examination of loss, needs, soullessness and reconciliation with the past, where the connections between the characters only become clear (to an extent) by the end.

egoyan sets up a slow burn in which each scene has enough ambiguity to where your personal prejudices and expectations will lead to false assumptions which ultimately reflects those back at the audience and leads to further revelations.",4.5

"What if it's all hiding in plain sight? The mirrors were never really put there to passively view, the film explains. This is just one of the many instances in Exotica where the entire present is the subtext. Everything built upon itself in a slow building cacophony. Something pulls all those threads of the past together, intertwined, and cannot be undone. Easy to pull the one-two punch from Egoyan along with The Sweet Hereafter as a parallel meditative study on its subjects and psychology in a style and manner that's almost impossible to explain in words. Various losses so profound and living with it almost oppressively impossible. There are certain films that might play too close to the vest for many but it is something that just deeply resonates with yourself just as if a common language has been shared.

"Threatens early on to become a Canadian riff on those 90s-00s mosaic dramas, but the narrative solidifies wonderfully over time, as we realize that the characters aren't interconnected by mere ""chance"" (shudder). For the bulk of the runtime, you're not sure what those relationships even are, or really what the hell is going on at all; you're just presented with a series of enigmatic behaviors. In a movie preoccupied with role playing, especially role playing based on the past, that creates a genuinely haunting feeling, a pleasant uncanniness at the story's emotional core. (This is probably why I kept thinking of Kiarostami's Certified Copy throughout.)
There are certainly some weak threads in the tapestry, or at least some yoking moments that seem too abstruse for their own good. (I'm mostly thinking of Eric's scenes.) Still, there's a fairly rigorous intellectual center here (the voyeurism stuff) that seems to echo Egoyan's earlier, more experimental work (which I haven't seen); that nicely tempers the melodrama, which, combined with the ponderous style, might have become fatally overwrought. As with The Sweet Hereafter, I love the mysterious, achronological final shot; I wish more movies ended on such question marks. Watch for the animal in the final seconds...",4.0

"I wanted to rewatch this thinking this was probably his peak film before his style descended increasingly into hack thrillers or creative misfires. Did the internet kill Atom Egoyan's edge? Was it the pressure of higher budgets? But all these assumptions were upended when I realized that I could not judge this properly because when I first saw it in the 90s I had no life experience and was probably overly impressed. I can't remove that nostalgic sheen from this film. I do like how seamlessly the different stories interlink here and how each story is pretty interesting and troubling in itself. It made me miss indie Canadian films from the 80s and 90s. They feel small, they were shot in real locations, and they don't feel weighed down by self-consciousness or certain commercial concerns.",3.5
"Second viewing confirmed a couple of slight worries I had going into it. The film is a nice little puzzle box but doesn't really go anywhere worthwhile for me. There are powerful moments for sure but the weight given to certain passages just doesn't really ring true for me and when the pieces are all laid out, instead of revelatory it feels like a damp squib- ""is that it?"" .
Moments like Christina's hysteric attack of Eric just feel a little too much. Clearly something has gone on in the past between these two but the film signals that it is little more than a bad breakup. Whatever it is I just don't care that much at the end of the day, and that's the same for much of Thomas' saga.
I might sound meaner than I intend to, I do like the film and find it fun to sink into. Chistina's almost unacknowledged half of the strange relationship with Francis is chilling and holds the sort of mystery I wish more of the film did. Francis himself is also a brilliant character, every scene with Bruce Greenwood is better than those without, for me at least. His understanding of the ways in which he is broken but inability to do anything else is really heartbreaking, and the character is filled out well.
I guess my issue is just that as it goes on my mind can't help but conjure up the image of a magician performing their big final flourish, only for it to be a malnourished rabbit quaking as it comes face to face with an underwhelmed audience.",3.5

"Amazing pacing, amazing suspension, amazing characters, amazing synchronicity. My god.",4.5
"'Exotica' is a film that exists in a realm that can be called elevated reality. This is because neither is the narrative fully grounded in hardcore realism, nor does it expect the viewer to suspend disbelief completely. The movie remains suspended in between hardcore realism and fantasy fiction, which ends up giving it a tone of poetic realism.
Thematically the film is primarily about grief, emotional baggage and the lasting effect that sorrow can have in a person's life. The opening line of dialogue is - 'You have to ask yourself, what brought this person to this point?' I think this line very succinctly summarises the film. We come across various characters who are engaged in various activities. Director Atom Egoyan slowly and gradually divulges secrets about their past lives and slowly we get to understand what baggage all these characters carry and how they are connected to each other, some directly, some tangentially. We come to understand that all these characters have had incidents happen to them in the past which have shaped and molded their present. In order to deal with grief and past trauma, some characters have had to adopt options that many people might call objectionable and morally questionable. This is where Egoyan lends an air of humanism to the film as he tries to understand why and what circumstance will compel someone to choose to do something morally problematic(like spending every night in a strip club and watching a young girl dressed in a schoolgirl's uniform dance for you) instead of judging them for their choices.
Another prominent thematic element in the film is the presence of a constant series of 'transactions'. Characters constantly engage in transactions and exchange favours from one another like the transaction between Francis and Christina, the contract between Zoe and Eric, the agreement between Francis and Tracey, the exchange of ballet tickets between Thomas and the random strangers at the ballet performances,etc. The root cause of these transactions is again the need for people to get to terms with their grief, their loneliness and their lives as a whole.
The film is called 'Exotica' because the strip club called 'Exotica' plays a central role in the film. But why did Egoyan decide to name the strip club as well as the film 'Exotica'? Whenever someone hears the term exotic there is a tendency to equate it with something sexual. However it has to be said, that the scenes in the strip club aren't really very sexy or alluring. So again the question stands, why is the film called 'Exotica'? My interpretation of the name goes like this - 'exotic' in the true sense of the word means something that seems unfamiliar to a person's usual existence. In the scenes inside the strip club, what is noticeable is that instead of focusing on the naked dancers, Egoyan devotes a lot of shots to capturing the faces of the male clients who sit at all the tables, one of them being Francis himself. Something that is easily visible is the look of acute indifference on the faces of these men. Yes they are appreciating the ladies dancing for them, but one can see the indifference in their eyes which is hiding some sort of latent sadness. This gets explored more deeply through the exploration of the character of Francis. So, this strip club is sort of like the garden of Eden for these men(the trees and palms give the club a distinctive look too) where they come to escape from their real sadness to enjoy a few moments of planned make- believe. Since the club gives them an experience which gives the men a relief from their tough realities, it is called 'Exotica' and since the major characters in the film go out of their way to cope with the grim realities of their lives, it is only natural that the film will be called the same too.
The primary score composed by Mychael Danna is just perfect as it so beautifully captures the tone of the film. The score certainly sounds exotic and has a distinct Middle-Eastern vibe to it which lends it a bit of a seductive aura. However, beneath the seductive edge, one can also very distinctly notice a melancholic core that enriches the score.
Performance wise I think everyone is brilliant. But I'll give a special mention to Bruce Greenwood and Mia Kirshner. Bruce Greenwood exudes and lends so much sensitivity to Francis and makes him an absolutely heartbreaking character.
'Exotica' is a film about people with grieving hearts who are compelled to engage in transactions and make compromises in order to cope with their severely distressing lives. It is a very humane film that tries to understand the characters instead of judging them. Highly Recommended.",4.0
"94/100 (A)
Definitely needed to watch this a second time to fully appreciate it. Once you stop stressing about following the plot and wondering if you missed a moment of exposition, you can simply marvel at how ingeniously structured Exotica is. Atom Egoyan wanted the film to work like a striptease, seductive and mysterious, and it succeeds at being consistently gripping while revealing as little as possible at any given time.
From the sleaze of the titular club to the clammy claustrophobia of the pet shop to the lush fields which contain the body of a murdered child, Exotica is beautiful and moving, emotional without ever being manipulative. The score, at once sinister and sexy, accompanies the film nicely, and all five of the main cast members are terrific.
My only complaints lay in the ending, which feels as if it rushes its conclusion in order to get to the epilogue/prologue, and Elias Koteas' character, who ultimately redeems himself but can feel a shade too sleazy and repulsive, making his scenes more of a slog than the rest of the film. Otherwise, this is absolutely top notch, and one of the most criminally underseen films of the 90's.",4.5

"""Baggage creates a certain amount of tension. You can pretend it's not there, or you can acknowledge that it's there, and have friends anyway.""

Humans are animals, and yet utterly distinct from any other species. No film explores that common-sense idea as consistently and thoroughly as Exotica, using thematic and visual precision to make its concepts novel and arresting.  Through manmade structures like windows, mirrors, and doors, characters in the film hunt prey, not for food or advantage, but to seek understanding of the past and guidance through the present. The only possession is symbiotic, shown as distinct from typical symbiosis by tinging most every scene with a motif of the human concepts of favors and currency. This hunting, the benign therapy every human seeks and almost never finds, uses catch-and-release tactics where every animalistic moment of predation is diffused before it becomes dangerous, either through true motives being revealed, or in one heartbreaking instance, a hug. It's beautiful, to watch characters almost never actually hurt one another on screen, but sad to see them never get what they want and constantly remember the hurt they've had in the past. Despite their memory of the failure and pain, humans still attempt to forge their futile bonds to survive, expressing the humanistic failure that is our preoccupation with the importance of memory and relationships. 

All the themes I've stated are paired, combined, shuffled or isolated in every scene, composing a thematic wonderland that starts high and stays there. This, combined with a visual style and soundtrack that fufills the dreams of every fan-trailer making YouTuber, makes Exotica my favorite first-watch that I've seen since joining Letterboxd, and an immediate all-time favorite. It's a jungle everywhere, one character says, but we get through the animal kingdom together.

Like Egoyan's other classic The Sweet Hereafter, I already feel like I need a second watch to digest and dissect Exotica. On my first emotional gut instinct, I found it hugely intriguing, beautifully crafted, and a little too ambiguous for me to fully understand its intricacies.
Exotica itself is one of the best movie sets, a strip club where the dancing becomes art. Complex characters are given to every actor and they all deliver unusual, fascinating performances. It's an original take on grief and longing, and delivered in a wonderfully stylish and emotional way. It's in the flashbacks with Elias Koteas and the animal smuggling sideplot where I feel a little confused, although that may be me trying to find more meaning than there is.

The acting is certainly the highlight of this movie in particular Elias Koteas' jealous and covetous club DJ Eric, Bruce Greenwood's gruff and grizzled tax auditor Francis and Don McKellar's awkward and nerdy Thomas.
Atom Egoyan and Paul Sarossy are a terrific Director and DP combination, the look of Exotica is very exquisite to the eye and no I'm not just talking about the dancers, I'm talking about the lighting and the atmosphere, it's a film that really captures the uneasy atmosphere of this entire movie.",4.0

The film centers around a fictional strip club in Toronto called Exotica. It is not so much a skeezy place, but a place that attempts to put tantalizing fantasies up on a stage. However, it's also a place that attracts sad figure, especially one individual who has lost his family to tragedy. He uses the club and a specific dancer to subside his pain, but never to heal it.

"Affect & Fetish.
Affect. From Spinoza to Deleuze & Guattari to Massumi, the idea of Affect has taken on the signification of something inexplicable, outside the signifying order, outside language, but felt only by the skin because the skin knows when the consciousness doesn't. Exotica is just like that, inexplicable in its representation of loneliness, longing and voyeurism, but almost tangible because we feel the loneliness and longing wash over our skin.
Fetish. Walter Benjamin talked about the aura of objects, how it thrived on the ritualistic quality of art. Representation, Images take on the auratic quality from our memories of a person, object, thing. In Exotica we see four characters - an exotic dancer, a smuggler, a revenue official, and a DJ- come together in a strange, imperceptible way, taking on that fetishistic, auratic quality for each other. And that's why it is not simply transference or surrogacy. It is so much stronger because they have intertwined memories.",4.5

Dark drama with an astounding performance of the main actress.,3.0
"Should be watched in succession with The Sweet Hereafter, just so the learning curve on Egoyan isn’t as steep. Both films investigate the aftermath of tragedy from multiple vantage points, both films reveal the tragedy at an unorthodox moment, and both films refuse to play narrative catch-up, plopping you at a specific point and demanding that you swim your way out of it. The parallelism here is immense: the way that Thomas and Francis slowly dispense money for imaginary services (the baby-sitting, the opera ticket); the two-way mirror in the club and the two-way mirror in the airport; the men’s room door that blurs truth and desire for Thomas and Francis; the rare bird eggs and the non-traditional baby Zoe is carrying - thematically united in that last shot of Christina where we can see that every interaction has the seeds of an alternate path. A film with no wasted moments, but I do wonder if its reticence, the decision to obfuscate relationships, is a little coy for its own sake, e.g. the bird eggs, Eric as a surrogate donor, the paralyzed uncle - these are incredibly bizarre details that could be jettisoned for something more practical and I’m not sure the film’s central story would suffer, but here they work like mini-enigmas, in service of what exactly? Granted, the curiosity factor is part of the attraction, and Egoyan maximizes drama like few others, but I would still like to prod him over certain decisions. For example, why start with the Thomas character? He’s probably less relevant than Francis, Christina, and maybe others. A tough nut to crack.",4.0

You're not quite sure what Atom Egoyan is doing at first, but the film has such a dreamy, enigmatic tone that you just sit there entranced by it all as you begin to slowly piece everything together.

True story - I always wanted to rent this way back in the day at my rental place but I felt too embarrassed bringing it up to the counter because I thought the girls who worked there would think that I was renting some skinimax softcore porn movie.",5.0
Viewed for the Year of Viewing Dangerously. More to come.,3.0
"We see several apparently unconnected and very different lives, but gradually, through a non-linear timeline, find out what links them all together. I'm not sure that the film really works - some of the characters weren't people I could believe in, so I did really care what made them tick, and why they were as they were.",3.5
Intoxicating.,3.5
"It's great because of the information that is withheld, but also because it is such a challenge, and because the little emotional attachments take some getting used to (as do some of the arrangements - Greenwood and Kirshner's to be specific). The way Egoyan's characters are slimy - but pitiable, and human - makes his portrait of these strange, circumstantial encounters so emotional and so haunting.",4.0
There is something really amazing going on in this film and it feels very David Lynch like that it has this whole dream like feel to it and you are not sure what is going on in the film with Bruce Greenwood and why he wants to go to this place every night despite looking bored and not really happy to be there plus there is a guy who has an animal business that is somehow connected and then end conclusions is quite shattering. It is one that will make you think about things.,4.0
