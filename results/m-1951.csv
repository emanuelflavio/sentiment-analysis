Comentario,Nota
"""Why God, why?"" was the question I was trying to avoid asking while watching this remake of Lang's 1931 masterpiece, but as in other semi-recent attempts to both see a film for the first time and read it against the grain, I failed to think and counter-think simultaneously. As such, this film comes out pretty lame on almost all accounts, especially since Losey is not just remaking the scenario but literally repeats visuals, compositions, and directions from Lang's movie. Big differences (that are not deficits) include the ending trial, here set in a stage-like and very modernist underground garage, and where the killer, who is notably (and importantly) far more bland than Lorre's monster-looking monster, gets a fascinating and psychologically updated explanation, in a riveting long take. Small differences abound and make the film interesting but not necessarily good: in Lang, the mob utilises their union of homeless to capture the killer, in Losey's L.A., they utilise gangs of greaser teenagers; Lang makes the success of the gangsters' fascisms subtextual, Losey has a cop deploring laws and courts; Lang's studio-bound aesthetic makes the story removed from reality (though not from society) and abstractly set, while Losey uses location settings, including the interior of the striking Bradbury building, to counter this feel; yet the murderer in Losey's film, rather than whistling the classical tune that Lorre did, has a very creepy Pied Piper tune he plays on a flute, giving the character the feeling of existing in a parable. It comes as a big disappointment to this Kubrick fan that Losey had a sequence in a mannequin factory before Kubrick's Killer's Kiss. The movie also features a disappointing but nevertheless rare appearance of Glenn Anders, whose insidious voice and corrupt appearance Wells used unforgettably for the character of George Grisby in The Lady From Shanghai.",1.0

"putting this off for years helped me to see it as a paranoid thriller in it's own right, apart from lang's classic. losey, who would soon leave the US for good, cast several blacklist victims in the film as if to underline his theme. outstanding use of LA locations such as bunker hill and the distinctive bradbury building, and the unusual decision to use david wayne in the role of the child-killer were master strokes. no one could replace peter lorre so why not go in the opposite direction with the most ordinary looking person? the scenes in the mannequin filled room were borrowed by kubrick for 'killer's kiss' (merely his first losey homage) and wayne's bland mommy-fixated killer prefigures 'psycho' norman bates. the trial scene is still extraordinarily moving, if a bit clunky (even in lang's film). sadly neglected for obvious reasons",4.0

"Revendo esse filme pela enésima vez para um texto, e sempre surgem novas observações.
Tem um corte, que não deve significar nada, por si só um mero exercício de estilo, mas que parece exemplar em demonstrar a visão do cineasta para o filme: um dos chefes da organização criminosa está dando ordens a cinco de seus homens, instruindo sobre a perseguição ao assassino. Ele está sentado numa cadeira giratória, dentro do que parece ser um bar (ouvimos, mas não vemos, os sons de tacos de sinuca), e os outros em pé ao seu redor. Ao fim da cena ele levanta-se e, ao sair, dá um forte impulso na cadeira, que gira velozmente, no centro da imagem. Ao redor dela, assustados, os cinco homens afastam-se da cadeira com um salto. Corta para um plano frontal de dentro de um táxi, o pára-brisa emoldurando o quadro, enquanto este faz uma curva fechada.
( youtu.be/CdiOKfDKqP8?t=1879 )
Tanto plástica como dinamicamente os dois planos são completamente diferentes; no primeiro, o quadro é fixo e o objeto giratório está centralizado, e a encenação cria um efeito centrífugo um tanto absurdo, em que os atores parecem se afastar pela força própria do giro da cadeira. No seguinte, temos um primeiro plano fixo, em silhueta, e um fundo que se move como um borrão indistinto linearmente, da esquerda para a direita. A partir destes dois movimentos, Losey constrói um match cut totalmente abstrato, a partir não de semelhanças do que está na imagem, mas da ideia de ""giro"" que depreendemos dela.
* * *
Esse salto abstrato para o plano do táxi, não à toa, leva a uma das recorrentes imagens do filme em que observamos alguém que observa, como o motorista aqui, de costas, em silhueta, com o vidro que separa o observador da realidade, e o chassi emoldurando o quadro.
Deste plano do interior do táxi, em que vemos a rua na altura dos olhos, passando por detrás do vidro do pára-brisa, outro salto abstrato: a imagem, chocantemente avulsa, do assassino sentado no banco de costas para a cidade, com suas avenidas se estendendo até o horizonte. Sem ser possível traçar uma continuidade espacial precisa, entende-se que o táxi está lá, em algum lugar do fundo, mas agora visto de muito longe, apenas mais um elemento de um grande tabuleiro. Deixa de ser aquele carro em específico, para se tornar apenas um carro, um dos muitos que estão agora patrulhando a cidade. O banco, inclinado, sua perspectiva levemente acentuada, sugere algo de instável; entre as suas próprias formas geométricas e as da cidade, algumas árvores, nas bordas do quadro, os separam, enquanto são agitadas pelo vento. A clareza, a bidimensionalidade geométrica da imagem lembram algo dos Lumière de Laveuses sur la rivière, e que Ernie Gehr viria a recuperar mais tarde.
Essa cena, se é que podemos chamar de cena, evoca a relação um tanto ambivalente do indivíduo com a sociedade, algo dado desde o primeiro plano do filme. Ele proporcionalmente gigante, sua presença cobrindo toda a cidade e provocando nela o terror que testemunhamos, ao mesmo tempo que parece ignorá-la, de costas para ela, completamente alienado da realidade, brincando com sua flauta; e a cidade que o persegue e parece aprisioná-lo em suas linhas.
* * *
Outro recurso do filme que parece levar a uma abstração é um uso muito calculado do som em algumas cenas. Ao contrário do filme de Lang, cheio de voz-overs, de falas que escoam sobre a cena seguinte após um corte e outras brincadeiras do tipo, salvo engano neste filme o ponto de escuta sempre coincide com o ponto de vista. Nos frequentes planos em que vemos pessoas de costas, não é incomum escutar um diálogo, de forma que, pelo enquadramento, não vemos a boca que fala. Sem de fato dissociar nada, cria-se uma dissociação perturbadora. Como na cena em que um grupo de cidadãos preocupados reune-se em volta da TV da vitrine de uma loja e, num plano geral onde todos estão estranhamente imóveis, ouvimos o diálogo: ""Como assim, as crianças não foram violadas nem abusadas? / Que diferença faz? Ele as matou, não foi?"". De forma que qualquer uma daquelas pessoas poderia ter sido a responsável pela fala; o enunciador do diálogo é abstraído para toda a população da cidade.
Outro exemplo, não muito depois, quando os pais da última vítima estão no gabinete do comissário, após terem recebido a terrível notícia. O plano sequência começa enquadrando apenas eles dois, sem vermos nem o comissário nem os outros oficiais que estão na sala. Enquanto vemos os rostos inconsoláveis dos pais, a voz do comissário ecoa, descorporizada, uma preocupação que, assim abstraída, ganha um peso que parece ultrapassar os limites diegéticos do filme: ""Podia ter sido a filha de qualquer um. De qualquer um. Ninguém está seguro."" Toda a composição sonora do filme, em geral, parece extremamente minuciosa – outro exemplo, quando o assassino observa o trem de brinquedo na vitrine da loja e, quando a menina se aproxima, o som do trem se intensifica, até que a garota vai embora e é dissipado.
* * *
O chefe da máfia tem a sua inicial bordada na sua camisa, um ""M"".
* * *
Quando o assassino vai pela segunda vez comprar um balão para a sua vítima, o plano começa próximo das mãos suas e do vendedor cego, enquanto é passado o dinheiro e o balão. Por trás das suas mãos de verdade, um grande cartaz com a representação de uma mão anuncia o serviço de leitura de palma.
* * *
Em relação ao filme do Lang, a articulação temporal aqui é bem menos relevante. No filme de 31 há flashbacks, idas e voltas no tempo ilustradas por voz-overs, sequências de montagem paralela, criação de antecipação e espera: os mafiosos aguardando a chegada do chefe; os policiais que esperam Peter Lorre voltar para sua casa; na perseguição no prédio comercial, toca o alarme e os bandidos correm para procurar o assassino antes que a polícia chegue – enquanto que, no filme de Losey, o alarme toca só depois de já o terem encontrado, não contribuindo com nenhum suspense, apenas motivando o fim da sequência e a mudança para o cenário da garagem.
* * *
O assassino, que na sequência de créditos é apresentado como uma força capaz de invadir o espaço vindo de um fora de campo inusitado qualquer, a ameaça de sua presença assim ocupando sempre a tela toda mesmo quando ele não aparece, e que no plano de abertura, à medida que a cidade se afasta e diminui, parece ter suas próprias dimensões engrandecidas. No final da sequência de créditos um zoom ótico nas suas costas, que passam a ocupar todo o quadro enquanto ele observa a próxima vítima. Depois o filme começa de fato com um plano que lembra os que acabamos de ver – o assassino, de costas para a câmera, observa a sua vítima – mas desta vez ele não invade o quadro, está lá desde o início. Mas uma nova ideia é estabelecida: há uma janela que o separa do espaço da cidade e da sua vítima. Ele a observa, então levanta-se, sai de quadro, e reaparece do outro lado do vidro. A cena lembra a abertura de The Prowler, em que vemos a janela do banheiro de Susan enquanto ela sai do banho, e se olha no espelho. Então, olha para fora – quase na direção da câmera – e grita ao ver o ""prowler"", fechando a cortina. Ali, com o olhar da personagem, já denunciava-se a posição de observador passivo da câmera, colocada lado a lado do invasor, e o fechamento das cortinas barrava o nosso acesso através dessa ""janela"", clássica metáfora baziniana do realismo. Aqui já é escancarado que estamos do lado do assassino, e que ele é capaz de atravessar essa janela e invadir o mundo diegético, enquanto nós continuamos como espectadores; mais uma vez a janela do filme não se abrindo para algo além, mas sendo reforçada como uma superfície, a qual não podemos ultrapassar.
* * *
A multidão, a população local: se o início do filme estabelece, através do assassino, essa força ameaçadora que invade o plano pelo fora de campo e, de costas para a câmera, afronta a realidade, as aparições da multidão não fazem mais que ecoar essa imagem. Assim ela é apresentada quando observa a TV na vitrine, no linchamento do velho que cuida da garota de patins, na cena da garagem no final.
* * *
O assassino continua sendo essa figura invasora e insidiosa quando se aproxima lentamente pelo fundo do quadro, na composição em profundidade de campo, para comprar o balão do cego, junto da menina Elsie. Mais tarde há a tal cena dele sentado no banco; mais ao final, quando inicia-se a perseguição, logo a geometria da cidade, que antes era distante, parece engolí-lo, e suas dimensões encontram-se cada vez mais reduzidas, correndo pelas ruas, descendo escadas, espreitando o guarda dentro do prédio; similar aos planos da mãe de Elsie descendo as escadas no início do filme: a figura humana pequena e a geometria uma força engolidora. Na sequência final, temos mais uma vez um plano do ponto de vista do assassino, em que o vemos de costas, em silhueta, com um vidro e uma espécie de moldura na imagem: ele está preso dentro de um conversível na garagem, observando as pessoas ao redor pela janela do carro, pensando no que vão fazer com ele. Então corta para fora do carro, abrem a capota do conversível e o arrancam lá de dentro à força, culminando naquele plano sequência do monólogo dele sozinho ajoelhado, de frente pra câmera, sem fundo, sem nada em volta, se abrindo completamente (no filme de Lang, a fala de Peter Lorre é claramente dialógica, presume um interlocutor, é uma tentativa de convencimento, ele desesperado tentando salvar a própria vida; aqui, David Wayne começa assustado, mas logo parece perder-se em seus pensamentos, um solilóquio; ele acaba aceitando a sua punição, implorando por ela).
Após esse momento de revelação, de presença humana absoluta de David Wayne/Martin Harrow na tela, a turba mais uma vez ataca, a polícia invade, o assassino é preso e o advogado é morto: o filme, em sua composição final, retorna à uma geometria bidimensional nada menos que brutal. A rampa parece dividir a tela em dois: na parte superior, ao fundo, três figuras policiais – a lei a ordem – que guardam o recinto, postadas como linhas verticais, feições indistintas, e uma placa que sinaliza: ""MANTENHA-SE À DIREITA"". Na parte inferior, submetida à vigia da superior, em primeiro plano, à direita, o corpo do advogado que nos fora dado a conhecer e simpatizar – o direito à defesa –, deitado na horizontal, jaz morto. No meio, os dizeres: ""THE END"".",5.0

Aqueles que consideram o recurso aos tribunais apenas como um ato moral (tanto mais moral quando não acontece por vantagens materiais) dificilmente compreenderão o caráter experimental de um processo que tem como problema a própria moral. Também aqueles que, por experiência, só entendem um empreendimento planejado desde o início e apenas feito por amor à experiência, não perceberão (isto é, não poderão apreciar) um empreendimento como o Processo dos Três Vinténs. É que, para tais pessoas, é difícil compreender que um ato moral se possa transformar lentamente numa experiência sobre a moral. Da mera reação inicial a uma injustiça insuportável resulta um procedimento sistemático que toma por objeto uma injustiça mais geral, melhor dizendo, uma situação social que não comporta atos de justiça e de moral. Ao longo de um tal desenvolvimento, o tribunal transforma-se em acusado que tem como advogado de defesa a ordem social, a qual, por sua vez, se torna então acusada. Pois o tribunal, inicialmente autorizado a fazer justiça, vê-se em breve forçado a pronunciar-se sobre essa justiça. Perde importância o caso jurídico, torna-se agudo o problema da justiça.

SOBRE A REALIZAÇÃO DE EXPERIÊNCIAS SOCIOLÓGICAS
Falámos de uma ""experiência sociológica"" querendo com isso significar que, através de medidas apropriadas (atitudes apropriadas) se provocam e tornam visíveis as contradições inerentes à sociedade. Uma experiência sociológica deste tipo é simultaneamente uma tentativa de compreender o funcionamento da ""cultura"". Estimula-se o pensamento público, e este assume os papéis distribuídos. Trata-se quase literalmente de um processo de pensamento. A matéria aparece aqui viva, a funcionar, não se limita a ser objeto de contemplação. O observador vive também, e vive os acontecimentos por dentro e não por fora.
[...]
A experiência sociológica é um procedimento que permite mostrar a ""situação da res publica"" no seu desenvolvimento.
[...]
Compreender a experiência sociológica é ""apreendê-la em pontos concretos"". Isto não se concretiza com base num ato contemplativo, nem se dá por encerrado quando se chega a uma opinião. Aqui, a base de atuação deve ser a experiência adquirida.
– Bertolt Brecht, O Processo do Filme A Ópera dos Três Vinténs (assim como no caso do Losey, pouco antes do exílio)

E tem até ensaio: abload.de/img/vlcsnap-2021-06-01-011gk13.png
E falando em ensaio e em experimento...
Sua arte [a de Losey] é uma arte de laboratório. Coloca-se um bloco completo de experiência vivida num recipiente. Criam-se as condições mais favoráveis para o experimento. Analisa-se então com precisão todas as relações objetivas que se formam e descobre-se que a luta é a origem vital de toda realidade.

Se em The Prowler já havia uma narrativa impelida por uma lógica avassaladora, aqui essa lógica avança um passo rumo à uma pureza, uma abstração, na medida em que lá ela estava colada às manipulações de uma personagem (a de Van Heflin), enquanto aqui ela está fragmentada e dispersa, descentralizada, deixando de existir nas partes para existir apenas no todo. O filme quase não possui sequências até o terceiro ato; em sua maior parte é composto de cenas isoladas, que funcionam como uma série de argumentos encadeados num raciocínio lógico que se desenvolve não atrelado à uma personagem, mas ao ambiente da cidade de Los Angeles, que nunca ganhou tanto destaque e nunca foi filmada com tanto apuro como aqui. A precisa geometrização arquitetônica das composições reforça esse caráter de um palco para um jogo de forças em conflito organizado de maneira lógico (mas às vezes, ao fundo, há algo de inquantificável, e as folhas das árvores se mexem).
Essa ordem geométrica da ordem social que vai rumo a uma abstração é representada simbolicamente de maneira extremamente concreta (e igualmente geométrica) na pirâmide de copos que o chefe da máfia usa para explicar o funcionamento da sua organização.
Uma cena: a mãe na delegacia. Ela, em negação, sugere que talvez houve um engano, talvez a filha ainda esteja viva. Sem dizer nada, o delegado levanta o vestido da vítima, e prova visualmente que a mãe está errada. ""Die Wahrheit is Konkret""!

Era um princípio com Brecht, e o único com o qual concordo plenamente: no momento em que a emoção interrompe o curso do pensamento do público, o diretor fracassou.

"The manhunt is rendered mostly in abstract terms, the city as a formal trap ready to condemn the killer with Losey making very good use of his more low budget spareness. The emptier it is, the more the formal severity works. The movie is much stronger in the killer passages, despite some clunky writing early on, than in the surrounding forces. It is amusing to finally get to this, and observe how much While the City Sleeps feels like a very belated angry riposte from Lang.",3.5

"A forlorn remake which flounders messily between police procedural realism and theatrical fabulism, failing in both registers. Joseph Losey's direction is flabby and the script only works when it directly mimics Fritz Lang's original. The underworld is dopily Runyonesque and, despite two effective speeches by David Wayne and Luther Adler, the finale is conspicuously fumbled. M's only recommendable aspect is some interesting location photography and its use of LA's iconic Bradbury Building for a major sequence, the setting proving considerably more dramatic than the events taking place inside it.",2.5
"Losey and crew change things up in a way that locks the movie into Hollywood narrative conventions, ramping up the action with set-pieces that make the film shallower and easier to read... but he also tweaks the premise to express a different set of political concerns as subtext. Because duh.
I'd like to think that the lawyer's closing speech was in service of an insight by the character into the possibility of dismantling the whole apparatus of generational trauma that perpetuates patriarchy, but that's probably a bit of a stretch.",3.0

"— As cidades, em todos os seus filmes, são um prolongamento exato dos interiores do mundo.
— Claro. Nem sempre é consciente; mas assim que você começa a trabalhar em um filme, assim que começa a buscar um estilo para ele, é bem óbvio que ele vem, aos poucos, carregando em você como um conceito que vai te guiar especialmente para os cenários, e às vezes você estará bem ciente disso. Para mim, o visual, falando tanto do cenário quanto da composição ou dos movimentos, é muito importante em um filme. No caso do M por exemplo, assim que vi o prédio comercial – e já tinha visto não sei quantos outros prédios antes – soube que era o certo. Sem poder explicar o porquê de uma forma muito precisa. Da mesma forma para a casa do assassino, para a velha vista de Los Angeles esparramada atrás do banco em que David Wayne se senta... Todas essas decorações tinham algo em comum, deveriam ter algo em comum, porque um estilo era já determinado, e não estava querendo ""colar"" o filme à força nas locações, mas sim encontrar cenários naturais que correspondessem à ideia que tive de qual deveria ser o estilo do filme.""

"Not a half bad Americanization of the German film, but the lead just isn't as compelling a figure as Peter Lorre which means the ending sequence doesn't ring out as much as it did in the original. I wanna say other than that, this does a pretty good job of pairing down some of the excesses of the German original and being more of a B movie noir version (complete with Raymond Burr as the head of the gangsters who want this child murderer snuffed out so the cops can dial the heat back a bit) (and Jim Backus as the mayor!) It's more than watchable but again the central figure just isn't as amazing as Lorre was in the original (and really who could be? That's a helluva performance you're asking someone else to replicate here as if it could be so easily duplicated) Anyways this is fine and it chugs along nice enough, but that ending lacks the sheer intensity of Lorre's insanity which is ultimately why the original still endures if I had to take a guess.",2.5

"A propósito de Whirlpool (1950), o crítico de cinema Bruno Andrade refere num texto sobre o filme, uma ideia interessante acerca do cinema de Otto Preminger: que este consegue ser, ao mesmo tempo, “a coisa” e a “crítica da coisa”, o “cinema e [a] reflexão de cinema”. Esta ideia nasce no dito texto sobretudo de uma relação entre continuidade e fragmento, entre linearidade e descontinuidade, no qual é no contexto clássico que está já, em potência, a ruína do clássico.
Penso que esta é uma interessante pista para olhar para este M (1951), de Joseph Losey, como eco de uma outra origem, de duas décadas antes. Em concreto no argumento de Thea von Harbou, Egon Jacobsohn e Fritz Lang e na realização deste último no filme homónimo de 1931. Que relação se estabelece entre estas duas obras – possivelmente a de uma continuidade subterrânea e uma ruína à superfície? Já lá iremos.
Como se sabe esta é a quarta longa metragem de Losey, do mesmo prolífico ano de 51, onde lançaria The Prowler (aquele estreado um par de meses antes deste) e ainda The Big Night. Dois acontecimentos, interligados, marcam também este filme: a perseguição aos comunistas em Hollywood, e o consequente exílio do realizador na Europa na qual iria fazer a restante carreira. Digo marcam pois, por um lado, é possível ver a paranóia de perseguição aos “reds” como uma possibilidade de atualização simbólica na passagem da Berlim dos anos 30 para a Los Angeles dos anos 50, por detrás da procura do pedófilo criminoso, centro de ambos os filmes.
Por outro lado, como se sabe, o Losey europeu será muito mais marcado por uma ideia de angústia existencial, de prisão interior e isolacionismo, onde o espaço devém metáfora de confinamento e angústia. E tendo essa trajetória em conta, talvez seja possível ver como, perante a obrigatoriedade por questões de censura de manter a história original de Lang — que desagradou a Losey, assim como a Douglas Sirk que teria sido sondado para este projeto; tendo ambos vontade de contar uma outra história sobre um assassino de crianças — a estratégia fosse a de remover uma certa lógica conspiracional, de mise-en-scène em estúdio que servia uma lógica de mistério e avançar antes para uma “escrita” mais plana, sequêncial, de planos abertos, de exteriores, e com profundidade de campo onde se joga a relação (moderna?) entre o indivíduo que ora invade ora se dissolve no espaço da multidão e da cidade.
Essa diluição, que com frequência foi lida como uma ideia de abstração, impressionou a crítica macmahonista. Há como que uma dissolução documental da ficção que parece afinar com uma ideia utópica, de uma mise-en-scène quase sem mise, ou pelo menos sem colocação carregada; também uma hipnose (para trazer ainda o imaginário de Whirlpool) que faz da crueza dos espaços, dos movimentos, dos objetos aquilo que há, verdadeiramente, a reter.
A Losey, em M, não interessa a premissa do thriller, nem sequer a leitura simbólica de objetos que são apenas o eco dos anteriores (o balão, a letra, a bola), nem ainda o tema Lang — a culpa e a conspiração, como teia como relação submundo/superfície. Talvez até o momento onde a leitura, freudiana, nos surja mais à flor da pele seja no emotivo e excepcional monólogo de David Wayne no final do filme. Onde Lang encenava um julgamento social, Losey procura a intencionalidade brechtiana e teatral de uma confissão. Na boca de Peter Lorre, o “I can’t help myself!” é um argumento de defesa; mas as mesmas palavras proferidas pela personagem encarnada por Wayne são uma tragédia pessoal, uma derrota que nos deixa derrotados.
Em conclusão, e retomando essa oposição “continuidade subterrânea” e “ruína à superfície”, arrisco a argumentar que neste seu M, Losey procura cavar uma distância, um estranhamento face ao filme de Lang. A reflexão sobre a culpa devém antes um pensamento bruto de como o indivíduo e suas ações/desejos se diluem no espaço e como este as acolhe, a partir de um súbito choque e/ou imprevisibilidade.

"A child killer is never a problem for the organized crime world until it affects their business and then he becomes a possibility to be used as currency in dealings with the law. It's clear that the criminals in this film are also businessmen, part of the capitalist world whose criminal status is just a better way to have ""unlimited"", neoliberal freedom in their dealings. Underworld is just a continuum to the ""surface world"" but it is no more restrictive than the ""lawful"" side of capitalist society - even when they are forced to operate in shadows. If the criminals succeed, they'll be let in peace and even gain a respectable status in the eyes of the public.
To me, this is a film about two worlds in the same, liminal space. Both the cops and the informers play a similar role as observers. They are watchdogs and even sometimes these two are overlapping (as seen in the portrait of a corrupt cop who breaks the shop window in a darkly hilarious and revealing scene). There are no heroes in this nihilistic film. The killer itself is a strange variable that comes to reveal the way these two worlds are in contact and how they deal with each other - all the time.
Losey knows that the killer must get caught so his concern isn't so much in how it happens but how these worlds tauten and overlap. That is not to say that there aren't any individual concerns, the killer's psychology, his frustration is tangible, and in one of the most shocking scenes, Losey leads us to his lair (where the killer chokes play-dough child with a lamp strip while the photograph of a mother watches and radio roars). The moral is lost in this (American) society and catching the killer is a moral concern only to the public - to authorities, both from the surface and underworld, it's just a matter of business.",4.0
"Esta refilmagem de ""M"", do Fritz Lang, pelas mãos do classudo do Joseph Losey é bem boa e traz outros contornos para a história. O mais interessante é como, ao trazer a trama pros EUA - é um noir clássico -, ele adapta a perseguição ao assassino para a paranoia macarthista, nas fuças dos caçadores de comunistas que nem devem ter percebido. David Wayne tem seus momentos, mas não chega aos pés de Peter Lorre.",3.5
"Perfect idea of Losey to go in pretty much the opposite direction as Lang in how he presents the child killer at the centre of M, maybe even a more radical approach in how he presents him that very much aligns with Losey's humanistic style (and politics). Maybe not as sharp of visuals as Lang can conjure up (although Losey is certainly no slack, especially with the help of Ernest Goddamn Laszlo), but it definitely leaves its own impact.",4.0

"“What does he mean the kids were neither violated nor outraged? What's the difference? He killed them, didn't he?”
Losey shedding the anime training weights of studio message movie projects and finally just doing an Expressionist pulp crime noir like he was clearly jonesing to do ever since his career began, smartly preserves most of Lang’s bulletproof narrative framework while productively iterating visually from there - gets a lot of mileage out of the shift from pure theatric setbound artifice to lush LA location shooting (love the use of the Bradbury Building and its elevators in this, and the opening credits montage of the killer stalking various children in little Venice Beach vignettes is pretty choice).
Not quite as thrillingly austere and angular and Lang but Losey still makes this a real formal playground, the long take that reveals the killer for the first time and the long take where he spills his guts in front of the court of criminals are both real showstoppers, and the general sense of composition and camera movement is just plain sturdy. Also pleased to report a smart little ideological maturation over Losey’s previous film, The Lawless, with a great depiction of evil cops here, who are constantly begging to find someone to torture and frame for the killings sans lawyers/judges - can also attribute some of that extra hard boiled crime feel to additional dialogue by Blast of Silence narration scribe Waldo Salt (see above).
Does wobble a little at the very ending (strange change from Lang’s finale which I am kind of baffled by - did the censors step in or something?) but I think for the most part this has a pretty shocking amount of creative integrity for a Hollywood adaptation of one of the great Expressionist films, ends up the first real must-see of Losey’s career.",4.0

"Douglas Sirk was apparently offered this by Seymour Nebenzal and would only take it if he could make it a psychological thriller from the killer's perspective---can you imagine? Not to make pronouncements about the genius of Sirk but that would've been more interesting than what we got. Seymour would pass this idea on to all his German emigré friends for years... He fled Europe shortly after producing ""the child killer movie"" and kept thinking about how much of a hit it would be in America. Anyways it wasn't and because it's the 50's the plot had to be beat for beat the same as Lang's original or else the censors would tear it to shreds. Gun-for-hire Losey would rather shift focus onto the alcoholic criminal lawyer but what have you. 80% of this is just fluff just scenes---if you're into neorealism and its American strain I'm sure you'll get something out of this.",2.0
"I watched the original M a year ago so I definitely remember it, but it's not enough to compare the two in-depth, so don't expect too much from this review. In general I think that it's absolutely unnecessary to remake M because it's one of the best films of all time and still holds up even to this day, which is over ninety years later. Considering that, I actually liked this movie more than I expected. On the other hand, how bad can a movie be when it's based on one of the most amazing screenplays of all time.
The plot of this remake is basically the same as in the original. As far as I remember it focuses more on the work of the police rather than on private people who are looking for the murderer on their own. It has some very nice 50s vibes that I really liked. One thing from the original that will definitely stay with you is Peter Lorre who played the villain, and the actor who plays that role in this version is nowhere near as good or characteristic. He had some big shoes to fill here and I just don't think Peter Lorre's performance can ever be topped anyway, but still I was a little disappointed by this casting choice.
Another thing I remember very vividly from the original M is the last sequence in which the mystery gets solved and the antagonist's psyche gets explored very deeply, which I found very unusual for its time. They did a similar thing here and it's still not very common to address psychological issues in the 50s, so I appreciated that. Overall it was not as good as the original scene though. And honestly that's something that applies to the whole movie.",3.5

"M (1931) was a classic crime film from Fritz Lang, the director of Dr Mabuse, The Gambler and Metropolis, among others. Lang had gained fame during the silent era and was one of the key figures in the classic period of German Expressionism. M was Lang’s first sound film, based loosely on the notorious Peter Kurten child murders in Germany during the 1910s-20s. Subsequently, Lang went on to build a successful Hollywood career specialising in crime and spy films. This was the Hollywood remake of M – although neither Lang nor wife/co-writer Thea von Harbou are credited anywhere on the remake. Apparently, Lang was initially approached to direct the remake but spurned the idea.
The director of the remake was Joseph Losey (1909-84). Losey had emerged out of theatre and had begun directing in the 1940s. Shortly after M was made, Losey came under the eye of HUAC as a member of the Communist Party during the McCarthyist witch hunts. Rather than deal with this, Losey left the US and relocated to England where he enjoyed a successful career for a number of years making Hammer’s The Damned and acclaimed non-genre works like The Servant, Figures in a Landscape, and The Go-Between.
The remake is extremely faithful to the original. All the elements of the 1931 film are there – the blind balloon seller who recognises the song the killer whistles; the letter M placed on the killer’s back by petty criminals as they track him through the streets; the climactic trial held by the underworld. At the same time, the film has also been translated to 1950s Los Angeles. Now the killer gets some motivation and the script briefly delves into him having a history of mental illness.
I had heard mixed things about the remake. This made getting around to actually seeing it a considerable surprise as I was expecting a so-so film and found something a great deal more than that. The black-and-white photography looks stunning in the dvd restoration. It is one of the few 1950s films to take the camera out of studio-bound sets to go and shoot in the streets and rooming houses of the day, which gives it a look quite unlike most other films being made at the time.
Losey and cinematographer Ernest Laszlo fill the film with visually striking shots – like the mother looking up/down a tightly wound curve of a stairwell; or the image of David Wayne’s killer sitting in his apartment, his face (which we have not seen at this point) in darkness and all that we see of him being his hand tightly tensed around a lamp cord and then his going over to a clay figure and tearing its head off. It tells us all we need to know about the knotted tensions within his psyche.
The most sustained and visually striking set-piece is the one that takes place at the L.A. landmark of the Bradbury Building, which also served as a location for Blade Runner. Losey and cinematographer Ernest Laszlo make maximum use of the building’s designs with a multi-level atrium and wrought-iron filigree grillwork and stairs, even two open wrought-iron elevator cages. The scenes with the gathered criminals moving through the building, up and downs the stairs, with tight angles looking down from the upper balconies, all contrasted with the sweaty tension as David Wayne is trapped in a store filled with mannequins and tries to get out, is visually enthralling. The set-pieces from the 1931 film – the pursuit of the killer by the gang and the climactic trial – are not quite as vivid in this version but Losey more than compensates in other areas.
Police Procedurals of this era – particularly those dealing with psychopaths – leave you mind-boggled as to some of the things that police are able to get away with (which were presumably reflective in some degree of actual policing methods during the era). One notorious example of this era is The Sniper where gay men and crossdressers are lined up as suspects in a murder and laughed at by police. One of the methods police here employed to find the child killer is to conduct a shakedown of a bar where some of the clientele are carousing with what is implied are hookers. Here the police also investigate everybody with a psychiatric history, including one scene where a psychiatrist tries to determine guilt based on giving the suspects a word association test to do with strangling and shoes.",4.0
"I just revisited Fritz Lang's original a few months ago, and still can't find my way to seeing it as one of his best. Losey follows it almost beat-for-beat, but right away, in its opening shot, establishes far more distinct interests. Whereas Lang's stage-set city seemed destined to close in on the killer, Losey's on-location shoot makes clear just how massive and sprawling the city is, how impossible it is to find one man, and how immense the resources that eventually track him down are.
The climactic search for the corner criminal, here set in the Bradbury building, and the mock-court confrontation in a parking garage, make this a distinctly Los Angeles film. It's not just that the Bradbury is such an iconic local landmark, or that the garage is such a familiar location for the local commuter. They connect two ends of Los Angeles, the high design with the mundane, visually demonstrating the vastness of the city and the depth of the mob's reach. To say nothing of how the Bradbury works as an externalization of both the killer's twisted psyche and the rigid organization hunting him (it must also be noted that David Wayne's work is extraordinary, itself distinct from Lorre's while working from a similar base).
This location work, spread out across so much of the city, also sets the stage for future crime epics like THE FRENCH CONNECTION and HEAT, and outside of THE NAKED CITY, I'm hard-pressed to think of another film from this era that expresses how large these cities are.",0.0
"This was the last thing I was expecting, but this did an amazing job of evoking the feel of the original and still managing to add something new. It replicates a kind of minimalism that makes the original so fantastic; the acting, sets, and the story itself feel kind of spare-in a good way. The only real problem, and it’s a big one, is that the murderer himself is incredibly underwhelming. It’s impossible to live up to Peter Lorre, but I think the murderer still has to have something memorable or different about him. David Wayne ois servicable in the role, but in a story where the murderer is really the only lead character, it kind of reflects poorly on the movie when that falls short. That said, the ending is very effective, and it really carries a lot of the same weight from the original in a smaller package. I was very pleasantly surprised by this, considering that the original is one of my absolute favorite movies, and if you’re also a fan I’d recommend giving this a watch (if you can track it down).",4.0

A shockingly good L.A. noir remake of Fritz Lang's original killer thriller, this could've gone terribly wrong, but instead gradually finds its own voice. David Wayne's child murderer, striking panic into a city and pursued by not only the authorities but also the criminal underworld, manages to elicit sympathy despite his horrible actions, and his everyman demeanor may actually make his characterization more realistically terrifying than Peter Lorre's bug-eyed original.

And the amazing cast of character actors jammed into this thing. There are a couple of notable names, but all those faces and personalities that make up the City of Angels’ mobs.

Powerfully dark stuff. Fernando Croce said recently that on one side of cinema sits Jean Renoir and on the other Fritz Lang. Basically one is a painter, the other a machinist. I'm paraphrasing, but it's a beautiful piece of shorthand I never would have thought of.

"Sarris's ""Far Side of Paradise"" entry for Joe Losey in The American Cinema (1969). ""Far Side of Paradise"" refers to ""the directors who fall short of the Pantheon either because of a fragmentation of their personal vision or because of disruptive career problems.""
Joseph Losey may not actually thrive on controversy, but he seems to arouse it on every level, from the most vulgar to the most esoteric. Originally an exile from the Hollywood blacklist he seemed by all indications to belong to the committed Left. In quick succession, he was embraced by a rightist faction in Cahiers du Cinema, enthroned by Movie, and repudiated by Sight and Sound. Realist critics have always resisted the intensity and sweep of his style, the steady hysteria of his actors, the violence of his plots. By any standards, Losey's is a technique that calls attention to itself or, more properly, to the personal feelings of Joseph Losey.
Losey has spent most of his career on commissioned projects that mixed melodrama with social significance. The movies of his Hollywood period—The Boy with Green Hair, The Lawless, The Prowler, M, and The Big Night—have gained in interest over the years as the exaggerations of a style have become more expressive of an era. The stage director of Charles Laughton in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo and the screen director of Harold Pinter's scripts for The Servant and Accident, Losey seems always to have aspired beyond the presumed limitations of genre movies. The High Art Game is an understandable temptation to the movie director, particularly in the culturally beleaguered Anglo-American cinema. Indeed, The Servant and Accident have done more for Losey's general reputation than all his other pictures put together.
Ironically, Losey's personality comes through more clearly and forcefully in such relatively neglected works as Time Without Pity, Chance Meeting, The Concrete Jungle, King and Country, and Modesty Blaise. Like many directors, Losey seems more effective when he transcends conventions than when he avoids them altogether. Genre movies give him the distancing he needs to writhe expressively on the screen. By contrast, movies about Life and Time and The World seem to make him relatively subdued, functional, and impersonal. Losey's dilemma is not unique. With Accident, Losey has escaped the clutches of the cultists to fall into the hands of the snobs. Certainly, nothing could be more fashionable than serving as the house director of the Burtons after Mike Nichols and Franco Zeffirelli. Only time will tell if such fashion will be fatal to Losey's artistic personality. Losey's best performers are almost invariably male—Van Heflin in The Prowler, Dirk Bogarde in The Sleeping Tiger, The Servant, King and Country, Modesty Blaise, and Accident, Stanley Baker in Chance Meeting, The Concrete Jungle, Eva, and Accident, Michael Redgrave and Leo McKern in Time Without Pity, Patrick McGee in The Concrete Jungle, Oskar Werner in Chance Meeting, James Fox in The Servant, Tom Courtenay in King and Country, Terence Stamp in Modesty Blaise. There are pleasant enough feminine portrayals in Losey's oeuvre; Gail Russell in The Lawless, Evelyn Keyes in The Prowler, Sarah Miles and Wendy Craig in The Servant, Viveca Lindfors in These Are the Damned, and Vivian Merchant in Accident come immediately to mind. But the feminine role in Losey's world is strictly subordinate because of the histrionic hysteria of his actors. Men simply cannot cope with their lives and social institutions, and they crack up with very lyrical results. Meanwhile the women stand by to pick up the pieces. They cope because of their ability to compromise with reality, an ability Losey frankly admires. Unfortunately, the best roles are the least stable. Hence, Losey's actresses are usually denied the great scene-stealing moments of psychic dissolution.
Losey has been criticized for the precision and fluidity of his camera style, but it is through his excesses that he most successfully projects a redeeming sense of humor. When Stanley Baker is jilted at the door by Jeanne Moreau in Eva, Losey's steep overhead camera angle makes the humiliation deliciously funny in a nonsadistic way. Losey is playing a joke on his own portentousness. Conversely, Modesty Blaise is a more serious enterprise than it seems precisely because of the strenuousness of its levity. Losey is joking about matters concerning the relations of men and women, relations that affect him deeply. There is also in Losey's films time and again that psychic spasm, that futile gesture a character makes to register a personal protest against Cosmic injustice. In Losey's world, both sex and politics are out of joint, and if Losey's style is baroque or expressionistic, it is a very nervous baroque or expressionistic. With the disintegration of the male, Yeats's center cannot hold, and anarchy is loosed upon the world.",0.0
"2019 Entry 108:
I started watching the 1931 first and was telling Ben about it as I hadn’t finished it yet. I was willing to start it over, but he wasn’t in the mood for subtitles at the moment, so we watched the American version. This was on TCM with an intro from Eddie Muller and was set to expire from the channel app- so it had to be watched! 
OK - this is not a terrible film buttttt if you’re gonna watch a version of M, don’t pick this one. The intro from Eddie was great because it put into context what the director was trying to accomplish with the making of this film. COMMUNISM. Definitely a film of its time - there are many references to the hunt for the child killer being similar to a witch hunt. The same way many felt regarding their political beliefs at that time. 
Favorite things:
-the guy, David Wayne that plays Martin the child killer, he is great. Gives a wonderful performance. 
-you never see any of the murders or acts, it is all just implied. It’s creepy seeing him buying the kid balloons 🎈 or candy 🍬. Very unnerving and the idea of not showing what happens to the kids makes your imagination run wild.

"I've rated and reviewed this one before, but I thought I'd mention some more specifics this time.
I really appreciated the performance of David Wayne as the killer. Powerful and intense! I wonder if Peter Lorre ever saw it. I also quite liked Martin Gabel's cool-headedness as the head of the crime syndicate, and Luther Adler as the disgraced lawyer was also memorable. Honorable mention to Raymond Burr's voice in this, which was very rough! Almost certainly a put-on, but boy, what a put-on.
Another specific is the cinematography, which has a ton of stylish shots and makes great use of space and interesting locations, such as the beautiful Bradbury Building in the last third of the movie. Other reviewers have said it's like another star in the movie and they're right!
Again, I have to say this is a very worthy successor to the original. I watched the intro and outro as done by Eddie Muller on TCM and now understand how when the producer of the original M wanted to do an Americanized remake since he still had the rights, no one wanted to touch it, as the original was considered a masterpiece. But thankfully, Joseph Losey took on the task and did a great job.

"A child killer is on the loose, the police are stymied, the public is outrages and even the criminals have had enough. The big problem is that this one is a remake of the Fritz Lang film. Fritz Lang is arguably the most influential pioneer of the silent era, and M may be his masterpiece. This one was never going to be as good. That said, it’s not terrible either. There’s a creepy perversion to this one, with David Wayne being much more normal and insidious looking than bug-eyed Peter Lorre (who was PERFECT in the original). A strong cast and some solid set pieces make this one worth checking out.",3.5
"I've always admired rather than loved Lang's original (heresy!) and find Losey's take to be equally strong but nudged ahead in my estimation by some great character work from the ensemble cast and some wonderfully photographed LA locations. Not least, possibly the best use of the Bradbury building I've seen on film (Blade Runner being the other obvious candidate).
Edit-
I had written, with a certainty possessed only by those who are 100% incorrect, that there was a link between this film and the previous year’s Woman on the Run, which I had watched earlier in the day. My contention was that Norman Lloyd who appears in M also directed that film and there was a specific visual reference shared by both pictures, which I attributed to Lloyd’s involvement.
Of course I was getting my Normans confused and it is Norman Foster who directed Woman on the Run. A confusion caused not just by the name Norman but due to both being collaborators/protégés of Orson Welles.
Still there is then an, albeit tenuous, Wellesian link between the pictures. In any case the real reason for the comparison was the presence in both films of a grotesque carnival marionette/automaton which cackles at key parts of the action- the first abduction in M and, prominently, as the final shot of Woman…
They’re identical although one film is set in LA and the other in San Francisco. I can only assume that they were commonplace at fairgrounds in the early 50s and were sinister enough to be a useful visual shortcut in creating unease.
If anyone has some insight into any greater significance, I’d be interested to hear.",4.0

"REMADE IN USA
(Cahiers du Cinéma No. 11, April 1952)
The practice of the ""remake"" counters the unanimous criticism. Yet the indignation expressed against it is not unfounded, first and foremost due to some confusion, and it conceals an aesthetic paradox that deserves a detailed analysis. Indeed, the ""remake"" has been a constant throughout the history of art. The notion of plagiarism is relatively recent, and even more so the disgrace attached to it. It was Edmond Rostand who criticized Molière for the ""what was he doing in that galley,"" not the true Cyrano de Bergerac. The slow evolution of visual and literary arts is based as much on copying as on invention. How many fundamental works are known to us only through one of these copies and the variations it has imposed on the original (if the notion of the original still holds any meaning in this system of avatars). Absolutely recent as an art, but one that can be considered in its aesthetic ontogenesis as still primitive, cinema spontaneously repeats the historical behavior of other arts. True masterpieces are rare, the laws of success and the scale of values are still entirely pragmatic. The producer who decides to buy the rights to Pépé le Moko or Daybreak to have the film copied by one of his scribes is fundamentally behaving like a copyist from the Middle Ages or a pharaoh of the third dynasty.
Unfortunately, it must be acknowledged that the results are not the same. Although in painting and literature we have long since made an exclusive choice from a far more vast historical material. Statistically, the failures of the ""remake"" are perhaps no less frequent. But it is true that there is not a single just man to save the Hollywood Gomorrah.
Yet we must distinguish. The term ""remake"" too often confuses very different processes. Certain scenarios have been or are subject to periodic adaptations. Doniol-Valcroze pointed out the multiple Last Days of Pompeii. How many Quo Vadis have there been? The Japanese version currently being filmed will be, if my calculations are correct, the tenth Misérables since Capellani's in 1912. Yet this practice is perfectly justified and the results prove it. The Miserables by Henri Fescourt (1925) are certainly better than those of Capellani and if the talking version by Raymond Bernard (1935) is not as good as Fescourt's (which I ignore), it is an incidental fact. The compared values of The Lost Atlantis by Feyder and Pabst have nothing to do, at heart, with their chronology; it is true that the latest version by I forget who with Maria Montez is probably inferior. But would it be better if the first two did not exist?
This variety of remake is founded, on one hand, on the copying of sources and not the works themselves, and on the other, on the evolution of cinematographic technique. From fresco to oil painting, the repetition of a subject assumes a profound transformation of its valorization. For traditional arts, we have a historical judgment that allows us to consider that a scene depicted in fresco is not ""inferior"" to the same theme painted in oil. The application of perspective or chiaroscuro no longer seems to us an intrinsic superiority. But this is an eclecticism that we have only been capable of for a century. Even Victor-Lec-Duc, under the guise of restoration, forced the Middle Ages into romanticism. For true contemporaries of an evolving art, eclecticism is an unaffordable luxury of the spirit. A work technically outdated naturally empties itself of aesthetic value; a painting becomes nothing more than a canvas well glued on which one can repaint. A film: a certain weight of celluloid that would be better used as heels for shoes or as hair combs. Cinema is the only art of which we are truly contemporaneous, developing and aging with us. It is therefore futile to be surprised that the public loses interest in a film — even a masterpiece — when its aging becomes perceptible. And the signs of obsolescence are multiple. Beyond the most obvious, such as the transition from silent to sound, from orthochromatic to panchromatic and, currently, from black and white to color, with all the intermediate nuances of technical refinement, one must take into account the mode of narrative (history of editing), the style of photography and, finally, the innumerable temporal references of the image itself: fashion, makeup style, interpretation style, etc... In relation to these latter agents of aging, cinema is no different from the theater where the act of remounting a play essentially constitutes an adaptation to the taste of the day of an immutable text, but which staging modernizes. It is true that this situation has rapidly evolved in recent years, as we have reported here (« On the topic of reissues », Issue 5). With the creation of Cinematheques, the multiplication of Film Clubs, and the emergence of an ""elite audience"", a phenomenon that is increasingly spreading to the general public, old cinematographic works regain value. An eclecticism in time is emerging, which already allows certain films to no longer age and confers upon them the eternity conquered by the products of traditional arts. It remains to be seen to what extent this evolution of the public will interest the film industry, whether it constitutes a marginal but commercial phenomenon, or whether it will truly integrate into the general economy of production as is the case in painting for example where the antiquity of works does not in any way depreciate their economic value.
But from this admissible process, as old as cinema itself, we must distinguish a very special modality peculiar to Hollywood. In this restricted sense, the ""remake"" is not temporal but geographical. Aging plays no accidental or optional role in the adaptation of the original film. Pépé le Moko had not yet aged when it was made into Algiers, nor had Daybreak or even more recently The Raven. Moreover, and this is the fundamental difference from the other practice, it is not the scenario that is taken up but the film itself that they strive to copy and as if to stencil. Everything happens as if the producer thinks that the success of the original, both its artistic and commercial excellence, lies in the final aspect of the work and that by staying as close as possible to this aspect he would logically and automatically reproduce its success. The infantilism of such reasoning, from an aesthetic point of view, would not escape an idiot from Las Hurdes¹. In principle, it proceeds from a prelogical mentality still determined by magical analogies. Whatever one thinks of producers, even those in Hollywood, it is difficult to hold them subjectively entirely responsible. They must be seen as merely passive agents of a sociological phenomenon. But I do not distinguish exactly which one. Perhaps it is the Americanization of cinema. Take, for example, Daybreak. Its commercial success was honest but not satisfying, whereas its critical success was immense abroad, more so than in France, especially in Sweden, Italy, and England. With the French film's penetration into the U.S.A. being insignificant, we are thus witnessing this economically absurd phenomenon: a prestigious film whose prestige does not pay off. In short, everything happens as if Daybreak was opening a market that it was unable to supply not only because French film is poorly distributed abroad, but also because it is truly appreciated only by an international elite, the general public being conditioned by the American style. That's when the Hollywood producer intervenes: he objectively notices the huge loss of exploitation compared to the prestige gained and tells himself that the reason is simply that the film is not American. He therefore buys the manufacturing license, remakes the object in his factories, and relaunches it on the market as a U.S.A. counter-brand, thus multiplying the prestige of the original prototype by the sociological penetration force of the American film to which half the world — starting obviously with America — is accustomed. This is somewhat what happens in fashion when a great Parisian couturier sells the reproduction rights of a model to a New York manufacturing house. Unfortunately, the analogy stops at the sociological level. Aesthetically and economically, the copy of a dress poses all other problems than that of a film. This explanation is worth what it's worth, it seems to me, however, to have the advantage of resolving three irritating questions:
1°) The impossibility of believing that there are producers stupid enough to be driven by the idea of tracing the quality of a film starting from images and not from the scenario. The existence of such an individual becoming imaginable, if not tolerable, the moment we assume that he is merely drawing the economic consequences of the sociological privilege enjoyed by the American film.
2°) The fetishistic fidelity to the original that goes as far as copying it shot by shot and reproducing as many details as possible. It is about giving the public the illusion of the copy. An illusion that they precisely come to seek in the American counter-brand.
3°) The fact that the remake is practiced in this form only in Hollywood. It is indeed conceivable only in the sense of qualitative to extensive.
The form of exchanges between French and American cinema becomes clear in the case of Pépé le Moko, for example.
At the origin of the film by Duvivier, there are obviously American gangster films, and precisely Scarface by Howard Hawks. This influence is taken into account in the character of Gaston Modot, whose bilboquet mania is taken from Georges Raft's tic of constantly playing with a dollar. But Pépé le Moko is the prime example of a beneficial influence that has been deeply assimilated and transposed. From American social mythology, Duvivier retained only the universal schemata, a certain tragic romanticism of the bandit in the city. The scenario, dialogue, and characters are rethought within the French sociological context. More precisely North African, but of a conventional, stylized North Africa that combines exotic displacement, the tradition of Marseilles banditry, and Parisian mythology. The inaccuracies of Pépé le Moko offend the people of Algiers, but that's a good sign, it is the opposite of a neo-realist film about the Casbah.
However, taking up Pépé le Moko whose source is American, Hollywood ingeniously keeps its Algerian alibis. In John Cromwell's version with Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr (since there is a third one by John Berry with Tony Martin and Yvonne de Carlo) a number of shots are copied exactly and all the effects are carefully preserved. Better yet, they found a doppelgänger for Gaston Modot's character, costumed almost in the same way and also playing with the bilboquet. Thus, the man with the dollar from Scarface, freely interpreted by Duvivier, is found in Algiers under the avatars of a grotesque plagiarism of a French film. This detail gives a measure of the aesthetic value of the ""remake"" in the narrow sense in which only Hollywood practices it.
The film by Joseph Losey sadly illustrates once more the misdeeds with M Le Maudit, based on the famous masterpiece by Fritz Lang. This new example, however, presents some instructive variations compared to Algiers.
Firstly, the process of Americanization is explicit since the action is transported to America, to an unnamed city which is obviously Los Angeles. The same was done with Daybreak and The Raven. This would be, at first glance, a commendable and sensible measure. The equivalent of German or French social realism can only be, in America, American realism. Unfortunately, it is in radical contradiction with the formal fidelity to which, on the other hand, the staging and the script (fidelity which is not without limits as we will see) strive. The film is not exactly copied shot by shot, but sequence by sequence with each time we can recall the precise original shots, for example, that of the balloon in the telegraph wires. The development of the plot and the characters are the same (the red balloon vendor), all the key scenes are there with their incidents (the manhunt in the building with the night watchman's glance, the panic of the assassin who locked himself in a kind of attic and the ceiling breaker who was forgotten in his hole). But let's look at the differences. Firstly, they are curious. Joseph Losey seems to have wanted to modernize the style according to the neo-realist fashion. While Fritz Lang did everything in the studio, Losey makes extensive use of exteriors. These are, when isolated from the whole, the good elements of the film, through which this young and vigorous director proves he deserved a better fate; one feels that if the script allowed it, he would ask nothing more than to make a good film in a quite personal tone. But at the same time the imperatives of the remake impose on him absurd returns to expressionism, a falsely German style of decor and photography, completely heterogeneous to neo-realism: for example in the clutter where the assassin is locked up with mannequins and a forest of wax legs. Let's pass over the music whose role in Fritz Lang's film was essential — it was claimed to be preserved by drowning the famous motif in a musical pathos that obviously deprives it of any dramatic effectiveness — and let's get to the modifications of the script that allow us to fully grasp the absurd process of the ""remake"". We remember the role, crucial in the story, of the bandits and their leaders who decide to mobilize the entire underworld of the city to substitute for the impotent police. This court of miracles turned into a court of justice will ultimately judge the despicable Peter Lorre. In Fritz Lang's film, the idea and its development were admirable and were part of a very particular poetry of banditry, following The Threepenny Opera² and the social history of Germany in 1930. That the picturesque and romantic thugs become gangsters and shoe shiners and everything collapses. The characters of D. Hammett or J.H. Chase are not those who are indignant about the violation of little girls! Moreover, the hero himself loses all his horrible plausibility in this context. In Fritz Lang's film, his guarantee was the authentic story of the vampire of Düsseldorf. American sadism is not German or English sadism. Even if there are bloodthirsty satyrs in Los Angeles, their crimes do not acquire the exemplary aura, the mythical resonance that justified the terror in Fritz Lang's film throughout an entire city.
But where the Americanization of details completes the disintegration of the film is through the intrusion of psychoanalysis. The police investigation, indeed, and especially the parody of the final trial in the garage, are an opportunity to explain these crimes through an embarrassment of the Oedipus complex: It would be wrong to merely smile at it. If Freud has become the deus ex machina par excellence of American films, even those that could be good like Fourteen Hours, it is much more than a somewhat childish fad. The psychoanalytic explanation now imposes itself on Hollywood as imperatively as an article of the Hays-Johnston code. We already knew that the criminal could not escape justice (which is why, in particular in Algiers, Pépé is killed by the police because suicide would be a way for him to escape them). Later it became necessary that the criminal hero had fallen on his head. I am not joking; between the years 1940-45, it would be hard to find an assassin who is not specified in a line of dialogue as having suffered a bicycle fall at the age of five (cf. for example, a film on the other hand without concession: Shadow of a Doubt, by Hitchcock). This precaution responds to the concern to consider criminal instincts and more generally asocial traits as pathological in advance. The more attractive and apparently normal the criminal is, the more indispensable it becomes to affirm the existence of a hidden flaw. But affirming is not yet explaining. Psychoanalysis offers the screenwriter a universal panacea widely used today. Freud's psychological truth is not in question, only the meaning of its permanent and systematic use in the denouement of nine out of ten American films. Moreover, today when the triumph of justice imposes the negation of the human mystery posed by crime. The true crime of the criminal, the one that must be suppressed above all, is his difference from the average and ordinary American man. Even before common sense, the Oedipus complex being the most widely shared thing in the world, there are no odious monsters that cannot be reduced to a particularly nasty variant of said complex. Thus everything returns to order, the moral universe becomes mystery-free again, the homo americanus can continue to live in a mental world where everyone has fundamentally the same chances of happiness and social integration. This fear of psychological mystery is perhaps doing more harm to American production than the establishment of meticulous censorship on eroticism. Indeed, it is nothing more than the manifestation of a new censorship: the Devil is not American.
Well, have I strayed too far from my subject again? Not so much. I was saying that the psychoanalysis of [Losey’s] M would demolish everything if there was still something standing of Fritz Lang's work. Peter Lorre begs his judges, he even draws tears from them but what he inspires then is pity, not a vain psychological understanding that can be bought in any drug-store.
Thus, the film by Joseph Losey clearly reveals the absurd mechanism of the ""remake"" which consists of copying the detail while betraying the essential. This formal fidelity, entirely external, is the alibi that allows a new film to be launched on the market as the exact replica of a prestigious original. But at the same time, efforts are made to correct in the model everything that stands out in the Hollywood cinematographic mythology. They even go as far as to change the social context in which the events are inscribed. It is evident that the better a work is, the more its details are charged with meaning and the more their interdependence is rigorous. The furniture in Gabin's attic room in Daybreak is not an interchangeable decor, the tragedy is hidden as intimately as in the hero's heart. It would be impossible to touch it without also modifying the drama, the characters. The only way to remain faithful to them and possibly equal the original would be to start again from the source and follow the natural course in a new historical and social relief.
But whatever we say, despite its monstrous absurdity, the practice of the ""remake"" is still doing well.

"I feel like I keep saying that films are ""fascinating,"" but this is kind of the quintessentially ""fascinating"" film to me, because it's hard to love it by virtue of my extreme familiarity with its source material. Fritz Lang's 1931 film by the same name is one I've watched and taught dozens of times, so Losey's 1951 version is, first of all, just very weird. By around the halfway point I stopped trying to hear sonic innovations (which are so pleasurable in Lang's film) and was able to start appreciating the different project that constitutes this one. There's the moment from which Kubrick draws inspiration in Killer's Kiss, which I hadn't known about until now. And there's Hollywood-style character development paired with overt homages to the German film that made my head spin. The latter is not really at all about individuals; even the individual who is the perpetrator is not singled out so much as he represents a sickness within society. Sure, this version goes there, too, but not before a lot more soapbox speeches and soliloquies and closeups that you just don't see in Lang's film. The way they adjusted the ending is actually quite brilliant, and some of the shots work both as throwbacks to Lang and also ingenious examples of framing in their own right. I paid like $9 for a very poorly-made DVD of this, and that's an injustice because it deserves better.",0.0
"Vemos, por ejemplo, con las dos versiones de la historia de amor de McCarey, Love affair y An affair to remember, cómo variaciones casi puntuales, a priori señala les o controlables, afectan al total de la película: rodarlo todo en panorámico y color hace a la película distinta del color cuadrado, igual que no es lo mismo un actor que otro (aunque repitan las mismas líneas de diálogo, un chiste puede ser o no gracioso dependiendo de quién te lo cuente) o añadirle una escena con principio y final a una película ya hecha. Cada parte afecta al todo, cada yo juega un papel en su circunstancia, y queda esto también claro comprando ambas M, la de Lang y la de Losey. No es igual una cinta en alemán que una en inglés, ni es igual una escena cuando cambias la posición del objetivo o el foco de luz. La película de Lang aísla a los personajes en un mundo terriblemente hostil en el que el terror nace de conseguir, en gran medida, entender a tremendos mamarrachos, la posibilidad personal de pensar cómo ellos basta para obligarlo a uno a ser más consciente de su forma de actuar y de razonar, pues en la contradicción de ver la lógica detrás de algo y, al mismo tiempo, darse cuenta de que está mal, se encuentra el germen de la actitud crítica de Lang que puede verse también, por ejemplo, en Beyond a reasonable doubt. La de Losey, en cambio, parece poner su foco en cómo unos individuos afectan a otros, en las repercusiones de una orden o una alianza, en cómo la fuerza de muchos puede ser infinitamente mayor y esto no la hace mejor ni valida la consecuencia de su uso. Y esta película repite casi cada escena, casi cada objeto presente en la de Lang (siendo más corta) sin pudor (posiblemente Losey no lo considerase mejorable) desde una actitud que parece dejar claro no que una lectura de la realidad pueda ser incorrecta, sino múltiple, y persigue así enfrentar al espectador a todos esos conflictos en los que Lang podría no haber reparado.",5.0

"A remake of Fritz Lang's M is a difficult proposition, but not entirely outside of the realm of possibilities. Douglas Sirk knew as much, I suspect, when he was first asked to do it. His demand was to essentially throw everything out except for the premise of a child murderer. Joseph Losey, who ended up directing the film, had the same idea. With such freedom, Fritz Lang himself could have done it, especially since many of his Hollywood movies carried with them traces of M already, and two of his 50's films - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and especially While the City Sleeps - were closer to actual remakes of M to begin with. While the City Sleeps updates Lang's vision of an early 30's nightmare-Berlin to a jacked-up urban jungle of corruption; if M was a closed down underworld, a world already dead and haunted, While the City Sleeps takes place in the American metropolis (as it were) of fragmented values, distracting pop culture and shallow attention spans. From over-ideology to under-ideology. It's a fascinating development.
So, at the very least, something interesting could have been made of this project. Funnily enough it was the PCA (i.e the feared ""code"") who demanded that M be written and produced as a remake of a classic. Presumably as faithfully as possible. And here, obviously, we reach a dead end. I cannot say it better than Swedish film legend Harry Schein (my translation) who noted:
It is not just conservatism to be skeptical from the start of this attempt to revive a story that is unreasonable in an isolated context and that gains and gained its significance only in the German environment, where the population, the police, the murderer and the underworld had their thinly disguised but otherwise highly realistic equivalents. But a modern American metropolis? No, it is as impossible as the ""The Threepenny Opera"", which is as German as anything could possibly be, however English it may appear. [The conflict] dominates in ""M"". The pathos of the lawyer is phony in English, the gangster leader is taken from a German chapbook and his toughness would be laughed at in an American kindergarten. Etc.


For me, these two M movies form a colossal, textbook example of how any movie is more about an aesthetical whole than mere ""storytelling"". Cut from its origins, the 1951 M lives like a plant in a pot, rootless and pathetic, destined to whither. But it's not just a question of that nebulous thing known as ""historical context"" or ""signs of the times"". Lang's film was factual and technocratic, more about Nazi-Germany than any documentary, yet it was also a complete fantasy. More than anything else it is a visual, yet totally physical, depiction of a world; Berlin, as depicted in the film, is indeed the protagonist of the film. Everyone in the story are supporting cast trying to lay claims on her, without seeing they are living in a painting by de Chirico; the human world is over, what is left is architecture, the stones and the concrete is more alive than the people, the shadows more real than the bodies casting them. It is not only an incomparable work of art, it is the unique result of its components, each and every one significantly tied to the circumstances in which it was made. It's not Mr. Arkadin, there will be no special edition. M is as fixed in history, as irrevocable, as Hitler entering Poland.

And that movie cannot, indeed, be remade. The 1951 film only works to the extent that it does because of Losey's professional craftmanship and the moments when he seems to at least glance at some new ideas (one can, for example, draw several parallels to the communist witch-hunt going on at the time) but just as often the whims are confused and diffuse; the classic final scene, for example, drops the ball in a series of anxious moral maneuvers and other unwanted compromises.

"Talvez a única certeza ao reproduzir uma fórmula que já existe, é que você não vai fazer uma mudança significativa (do que já existe). Isto é, se você não tiver uma técnica de aprimoramento que supere a composição original, como a exemplo de efeitos visuais, som, fotografia, dentre outros...
Nesse caso, esse remake concede um defeito em sua execução, seja a forma como Losey conduz a trama, não querendo necessariamente elevar o patamar do filme original, mas apenas mastigando todos os acontecimentos de uma forma singela, sem muita perspectiva ou ótica de acentuar a possível trama em um eixo discrepante da fórmula original. 
Talvez a pauta do filme ser ruim nem seja os recursos dele, não é o que deve ser levado em consideração, mas claro, com um excelente trabalho em equipe isso deve facilitar pela razão que depende que um filme seja necessariamente bom, não pelo filme, mas por aquele desempenho em específico, e talvez uma marca que faça o filme ser lembrado, não por ser um remake, mas uma tentativa boa de recriar uma fórmula boa. Mas não, não estou enfatizando nenhum ponto bom desse filme, apenas possibilidades que justificaria a razão de extrair algo de bom dele. É tudo feito com muita dificuldade, até mesmo em conscientizar a população que há um assassino à solta, todos parecem agir mais por conveniência do roteiro, do que pela verossimilidade do papel, a que deve ser levada em consideração em um filme de ficção. Tudo muito ingênuo, desde a tentativa de encontrar o assassino no local (cena bastante desenvolvida no filme original), até a sua conclusão final. 
Final que também tem domínio de uma pobreza evidente, onde o diretor decide o que ele faz, justapondo sua ótica em razão do filme que ele resolveu adaptar, como a razão pro assassino ser um assassino em decorrência da sua infância e traumas, não pelos problemas mentais, não pela grande cena do filme original onde há a presença de um psicólogo julgando o que seria ideal pro assassino em função da lei. 
Infelizmente a única coisa que salvaria o filme de ser um ato falho, (além do que talvez seja o único ponto a ser ressaltado, não em comparação ao original, porque tende a ser melhor em sua adaptação inicial, sua fotografia), é justamente a cena do ""julgamento"", a qual foi alterada pelo autor que trouxe um filme, até então, dentro do possível, com cenas ou tentativas de chegar próximo ao notório filme de Lang.",0.5

For example we really only see one big crime boss in this film instead of feeling like the whole criminal underworld if a nation is looking for this guy.

Better than the Lang,4.5
"I'd seen this film before, but finally tracked down the recent restoration, which is remarkable work. I feel this film is superior to Fritz Lang's 1931 original. Heresy? Perhaps. But Joseph Losey's re-make is more of a re-invention. He transfers the locale to Los Angeles of the post-war period, with an emphasis on the lost-to-time Bunker Hill area. The basic story is the same--a mentally disturbed lost soul, released by bureaucratic oversight from an asylum, roams the streets, living in a shabby rented room and pursuing little girls, whom he befriends and murders. He saves their shoes as souvenirs of his obsession. As played by David Wayne, he is not the pop-eyed, obviously evil figure portrayed by Peter Lorre in Lang's original (which is a great film, without a doubt). Wayne's ""M"" is a miserable mess, and we feel he is seized by mental problems, rooted in a brutal childhood, that drive him towards his horrific crimes.
One of the best casts in a Hollywood film noir includes Howard da Silva, Jim Backus, Raymond Burr, Luther Adler (in an unforgettable turn as an alcoholic ex-lawyer who tries, like the ship's doctor in 1940's The Sea Wolf, to retain his trampled dignity), Steve Brodie, William Schallert and even George Barrows of Robot Monster infamy. Ernest Laszlo's cinematography captures all the grit, soot and sweat of this worn, withered world, and animator John Hubley did some developmental work on the look and feel of the film.
Unlike most Americanizations of European cinema, Losey's M has a reason to exist. The fear-mongering attitudes of the time--when various witch-hunts covered everything from Communists to comic books--adds to the tension of this version. The sunny, shabby terrain of Los Angeles offers a stark contrast from the darkness and turmoil of David Wayne's character, the weary, overworked cops who try to track him down and the jaded denizens of the underworld who decide that they're better than this helpless child killer.
One of the best film noirs, Joseph Losey's M might be regarded with suspicion as ""just a remake,"" but it is a disturbing, rewarding and intelligent new version that follows the narrative of the Lang original but alters its viewpoint with significance.",5.0
"Remaking an all-time cinematic masterpiece into an solid film noir could be viewed as a major drop in quality, but I prefer to see this as a real achievement.

It's clear the filmmakers were taking notes. The plot is reasonably faithful to the 1931 original, and while it obviously can't compare on the level of technical perfection, its handsome looking and well-constructed, with a few stylistic nods to German expressionism to add some flavor. I thought the room full of mannequin parts, a new addition for this version, was an especially nice touch. It even has an inexplicable automatically rotating table with legs sticking straight up out of it, which can't have served any practical function, but looks weird as all hell.

"Well, from going not knowing this existed to being surprised by how solid a remake this is (not quite Wages of Fear/Sorcerer but pretty good). It does what a remake should do, gets the gist of it while still being it's own entity. This David Wayne guy, as the child killer, was pretty awesome, whoever the hell he is. Sorry David Wayne.",3.5

"An Americanized remake of the classic Lang noir directed by Joseph Losey that really loses its way thematically and character-wise owing to some ill-advised deviations from the original script. David Wayne puts in a decent enough performance as the killer, but is not going to make anyone forget about Peter Lorre's star-making turn. Losey's direction is similarly adequate but unfortunately serves as a reminder of just how superior Lang's was especially in the final chase and faux courtroom scenes. On the plus side, it's always good when Howard DaSilva and Raymond Burr show up on a noir, and Ernest Laszlo's cinematography is superlative - easily the film's greatest strength - plus no one has ever gone wrong using the Bradbury Building as a setting. Overall, however, the many minor changes to story and character work to the films detriment making it merely a serviceable redo that pales in comparison to its progenitor.",3.0
"Films about child murderers are reasonably rare perhaps because the subject of child murder is so repugnant. The definitive movie about child murder, (Fritz Lang's ""M""), kept the killings off-screen and concentrated instead on the psychopathology of the killer, (a superb Peter Lorre), whose final speech, (""I can't help myself..I have no control over what I do...""), brought the nature of his actions into sharp focus. Like many great movies, then, it seemed inconcievable that anyone would want to remake it, particularly in view of the subject matter, and yet in 1951 Seymour Nebenzal, who also produced the Lang version, decided to do just that.
The 1951 version of ""M"" was not a success. It dealt with a subject much too dark for an American audience and, furthermore, its director Joseph Losey was on the cusp of being black-listed and yet I think it is as much a masterpiece as the earlier German movie. The setting was moved from Berlin to Los Angeles, (superbly shot and making great use of LA locations by Ernest Laszlo). The plot remained very much the same with a few noticeable changes, (both the police and the criminal underworld are more 'enlightened' here), while the pivotal role of the murderer, seen for most of the picture as a mostly silent, shadowy figure was given to David Wayne, who up to that time was seen as a light comedy actor.
Casting Wayne may have been a risky strategy but it certainly paid off. There was something simple and unobtrusive about his presence, the ease with which he moved about children easily explainable as he seemed so childlike himself. When finally he is tracked down and brought to a large underground carpark for 'trial' his fear and panic are palpable and, like Lorre's, his long speech direct to camera is heart-breaking as well as a stunning example of the actor's art. If in the end there is the tiniest touch of melodrama introduced into the climax, it is forgiveable in view of all that has gone before. This is an ""M"" for the McCarthy age, a genuinelly frightening picture of an America where even the murder of a child isi viewed as collateral damage in a society where criminality is corporate. It's failure is both understandable and troubling; it is certainly Losey's best American film and one of the finest things he was ever to do. It is long overdue a re-release and a reassessment.",5.0

"The LA Police Department and criminal racketeers are looking for a serial killer in the Bunker Hill neighborhood of Los Angeles. While the story seems simple enough, this is a good examination as to how and what makes bureaus and organizations move and react to pressure and stress. A vain mayor is feeling pressure from the press and citizens, the police are overwhelmed and swamped while a crime organization are losing men the through police busts and round ups. It features a search at the legendary Bradbury building and a conclusion of a mock trial for the killer in a parking garage.
A remake of the Fritz Lang classic of the same name, for years this was deemed as inferior without having really been seen by anyone. The current story, after its recent restoration, is that the movie was suppressed for a combination of legal reasons as well as its association with Communist sympathizers.  One could find tepid reviews in various movie review books but, it never showed on TV. One was more likely to find in the “grey market”. Still, it must have circulated for a while for writers of reference books of a certain vintage.
As it is this is a very good movie: very good. It may not be the well-crafted design piece that the Lang’s 1931 opus is but it’s still good. It features plenty of virtues that you can’t find in the original. Also of interest is seeing how Politicians and Criminals will try to use the apprehension as a way to boost their image to outside parties. It’s really the police that seem somewhat more concerned and focused with the tasks at hand. Yet even they are dealing with hot tempers and zeal among their own in their departments. One moment that actually improves on the original is the demonstration of the work flow among the criminals with its use of glass cocktail tumblers shaped as a pyramid.
Before becoming a filmmaker, Fritz Lang had studied to be an architect. It explains and informs some his designs and compositions. While his version of M is great, the buildings are shown as much more brutal and depressing. One of the ironies of the remake is that is a treasure trove of early 1900s Los Angeles architecture. Life thrives among the buildings here, making it a good comparison to the likes TOUCH OF EVIL or a contrast with MEAN STREETS or even THE OMEGA MAN. You will find West Coast equivalents of slums house, tenement apartments; this is the world that Raymond Chandler was writing about. A once more beautiful city that is now more corrupt and dissipating. Filmed in the now evaporated Bunker Hill, much of what you see in this movie is no more. Staring the in the 1960s, the infinite wisdom of the Los Angeles City Council gave liberty to the decimation of the Victorian Castles, Craftsman bungalows, and French and Spanish influenced business buildings to make way for monolithic skyscrapers that nobody waxes about. The house of the child killer was quite popular for being known as the Max Heindel house. Heindel was some sort of arcane Christian spiritualist. M is sort of the architectural equivalent of LOGAN’S RUN; where no building over 30 years survives. Okay it’s a bit of hyperbole on my part. The Bradbury building still stands but denizens of Los Angeles will get it; meaning Angel’s Flight is no longer in operation….again.

It isn’t just the buildings, it seeing the life teaming in these neighborhoods. You‘ll bear witness to kids playing in streets, populated corner markets, garages, arcades, and mini-carnivals which seemed to be all over the place in those pre-Disneyland days. While too noir like to be seen as Neo-realism, it’s not Romantic either this capture of LA Downtown living. Shakedowns and drunks are a plenty. Distrust between families and strangers are in no short order. You’ll get a grasp of why people moved to the suburbs of San Fernando Valley, City of Paramount or Downy. For those seeking out seeking out the kind of neighborhoods seen in M you could visit parts of Boyle Heights, the USC campus, and sections of Echo Park and Lincoln Heights. You can learn more about the neighborhood here www.onbunkerhill.org/. Also to make it more interesting those “newer” mid-century homes have also aged a plenty of the years looking as drab as anything found in 1931 version of M. What is new is now old again.
Surely, the visuals are due in part to the Director of Photography; Ernest Laszlo. He was the man behind the camera on D.O.A, (which also used The Bradbury), KISS ME DEADLY, WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS (Fritz Lang’s semi-remake of M), and the aforementioned LOGAN’S RUN. Of all the movies that have used the Bradbury, and I know BLADERUNNER and D.O.A. has its share of admirers, but M is the best. I’m not even sure how they pulled of some of the shots but they did. You can see it for yourself. While the criminals are looking for the killer in building, he is locked in a room, full on mannequins and a kidnapped girl, trying to pry the door open with a nail. It is a tense sequence. With the intent of the characters and the symbolism of the mannequins as props, the whole building looks like a perverse home invasion of the personal space of the killer.
Clues and storytelling are represented with letters, trinkets, and newspaper s. The movie movies at a good clip, almost like a moving tabloid magazine. This is made emphasized all the more as the Classic Bunker Hill can now only be experienced through photographs. The use of shoes in this as fetish for the killer almost has holocaust edge to it.

It is downright impossible to write about the movie and not mention the McCarthy Blacklist. So many people involved with this movie are a part of it. Directed Joseph Losey often alternated between brooding dramas (THE SERVANT) and absurd camp (BOOM!). He had a collaborative relationship with Harrold Pinter. Losey was blacklisted doing most of his work in England. While not usually known as a filmmaker of visual panache he does so quite well here.
The movie was written by a gang of writers. The initial story is uncredited to Fritz Lang, who left Germany, and Thea Von Harbou, who joined the Nazi party. The screenplay is credited to Leo Katcher and Norman Reilly Raine (LIFE OF EMIL ZOLA and THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD). One of the writers, Waldo Salt, is credited for dialogue. Blacklisted, like a lot of other people associated with this movie, also wrote for THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD but for television. He is perhaps best known for his scripts for MIDNIGHT COWBOY and SERPICO.

On the surface, the cast are a bunch non-stars but it’s still an incredible collection of character actors. David Wayne plays the child killer. In the original movie, Lorre plays the part as big scarred kid. While there is certainly some of that, in the 1951 version, this is not an imitation. Wayne plays it more like someone going through Combat Shock and medicine withdrawal. It does attempt to show some sort of back story but not too much. You just know that something happened to him. He has been trying to treat it. He has run out of options.

Best known for portraying Benjamin Franklin from 1776 and as the bartender from THE LOST WEEKEND, Howard Da Silva (also blacklisted) plays the Inspector looking and researching for the killer. He plays it just right as both a man of sympathy and cynicism. Steve Brodie is his partner and the “bad cop”.
The real stand out are Martin Gabel as the crime boss and manipulator. Luther Adler is the lawyer and alcoholic representing the Organization and later for the killer in the mock trial. While the mock trial is a bit overblown you can’t really blame it on the actors. It’s the only part of the movie that seems a bit obligatory. Still, they make it work and it could have been atrocious. It still features plenty of compositions, emotions, and tempers to keep it from turning into a Charlie Chaplin speech. Yes, this movie has a better ending than MONSIEUR VERDOUX.
You also find in the mix, Raymond Burr, Norman Lloyd (a collaborator of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock), and Glen Anders, the grinning murdered victim from THE LADY OF SHANGHAI. Burr is partially creepy in this, a sleaze and a bully. The big fun was seeing Jim Backus as the mayor. He is as oily as Gabel, almost as sleazy as the criminals. I mean this is giallo territory. If this had been made by Italians, we would be calling this THE LOS ANGELES RIPPER.

Produced by Seymour Nebenzal, he was German producer who fled German after the Nazis gained control. He had a hand in the European careers of Max Ophuls, Robert Siodmak, Billy Wilder among others. Being the producer of the original M, Nebenzal also owned the rights to the remake of M much to the dismay of Fritz Lang. It is well known that M is a bit of companion piece THE TESTAMENT OF DR. MABUSE as there share the same investigator, Inspector Lohmann. The remake of M shares some qualities to another film noir produced by Nebenzal: THE CHASE (1946). While in terms of style, these two movies are very different. Yet both movies feature score from Michel Michelet. Not that popular anymore. He is perhaps best known for his score of DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID. For both M and THE CHASE, make use of a piece of Rachmaninoff type of concerto music pours forth from a radio while David Wayne waits for his fate in M and Robert Cummings ponders his in THE CHASE. To top it off THE CHASE features Peter Lorre, the child killer in the original M, as the second villain.
Nebenzal’s son, Harold, is the reason the M remake has been restored and circulating as of late through TCM and Revival theaters. You’ll find his filmography is sparse but fascinating. His name is affixed as producer for FEDORA, CABARET, and GABRIELA. He is still alive, well into his 90s.

There is a lot of talent on display, and never is the movie lazy. While it is speculative and questionable to see Organized Crime being that vested in the apprehension of others like serial killers in the real world. I appreciate the update, and not just the vintage LA settings. It shows how reckless and opportunistic can people, who it bring out their worst. As it stands, M is an excellent movie on its own terms. M works a police procedural, a gangster film, an example of noir, and a serial killer movie. M also shines a light to unrepresented people, people living to get through it all.",4.5
"Out of circulation due to legal matters, Joseph Losey's 1951 version of Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece is a solid remake. While not at the same level as Lang's masterpiece this American remake has a lot going for it including excellent opening and closing sequences as well as a fine performance by David Wayne in the role that made Peter Lorre famous.",3.5
"Out of circulation for a number of years due to rights issues and its terrible reputation, Joseph Losey's 1951 American remake of Fritz Lang's 1931 classic M was recently aired in a restored print on Turner Classic Movies. It's a mixed bag, nowhere near the fiasco it's been believed to be for so long, but not quite the undiscovered gem that many are be calling it now. Losey and the screenwriters (among them Waldo Salt) abandoned Lang's German expressionism for a postwar L.A. noir approach, making terrific use of distinctive locations around the city. David Wayne, a Tony-winning stage actor whose early movie career was concentrated in musicals and light comedy roles, is cast very against type in Peter Lorre's breakthrough role as a child-murdering serial killer. Wayne sometimes resorts to Broadway tendencies of playing to the back row, but he has some effective scenes, especially when his plans for killing a little are thwarted by the surprise appearance of her mother and he starts having a sweaty, blubbering anxiety attack. Like Lang's original, Losey's M also focuses on the cops (led by the ever-blustery Howard Da Silva) and the city's crime kingpin (Martin Gabel) conducting separate hunts for the killer.
M '51 goes more into the tortured psyche of the killer (a victim of child abuse), and while Wayne completely throws himself into a big speech at the end and an impromptu kangaroo court where he's pleading for his life, with Losey leaving the camera right on him for several minutes, it plays as overwrought and just too much. And it's hard to know what to make of Luther Adler's drunken mob lawyer, who seems to spend more time rehearsing his closing argument punchlines (""I have a more important case...a case of scotch!"") than he does practicing law. Definitely worth seeing for curio value, but it's hardly Losey's best work and certainly not an unearthed masterpiece.",2.5

"Film #16 of The December Project 2013.
I've been wanting to watch this one for years. It's a mostly forgotten American remake of Fritz Lang's M, that I've heard good things about. I guess you could call it a cult movie.
It's actually a really good film, although it doesn't hold a candle to the original which is vastly superior. This version takes many of the elements of the original, doesn't use them as well of course, and also skips over the masterful build up of the original (this version is a half hour shorter than the Lang film)... but what makes it pretty great is the use of locations, notably Bunker Hill and the Bradbury Building. I also liked the actors' performances for the most part. Fairly solid, considering what it could have been.",2.5

"Packed with a haunting melody that leaves my ears ringing in the silence, Losey’s iteration of ‘M’ diverges from the original in many ways.
As an americanized reworking of what may be considered Fritz Lang’s magnum opus, the narrative seems to endow a human quality to the child killer.
Most notably, the defense counsel in this film plays a much larger role, and appears earlier on as well. In the final moments of the film, the washed-up lawyer—Dan Langley—is given more dimensionality. Yet, he also acts as a foil to the head of the syndicate, to the murderer, and the mob of vigilantes. Sent to appease and entertain the mob with a play defense, he instead places a guilt of conscience over them. How should this person they refuse to acknowledge as a man be dealt with? And is he any different from this mock jury in the first place? 
I have to admit, that in these scenes, Luther Adler’s portrayal of Langley seems to swallow up David Wayne’s interpretation of the murderer, Martin Harrow.  And comparing the latter performance alongside Peter Lorre’s ‘Hans Beckert’, this film explores the aftereffects of childhood trauma as a drive to the murders instead of a compulsion that voids responsibility; pathologizing him.
Lang’s film seems to direct you into praising the initiative of the criminals that do things right by themselves… however, Losey appears to have you bear in mind that these questionable efforts to make ‘right’ do not come with intentions to upkeep the interests of the public good.",3.5
"Today is day 7 that I don’t buy video game . Also I don’t watch bad site and m…..
- James Cage White
It doesn’t not make sense to remake M, given that there’s a long lineage of films about mobilized mass hysteria (ranging from Murnau’s Nosferatu to Jonathan Glazer’s The Fall), and the original film provides a pretty malleable framework to play around with. Which this film does by localizing it to LA and updating the network of tramps with the mob. When discussing Lang’s M, I always remind people that a good chunk of the film isn’t focused on examining the pathology of a killer as much as it is about tramps doing elaborate silent era stunts and gags and without those the film wouldn’t really be M (unrelated but it’s a similar thing with Blade Runner 2049 vs the original, how faithful of an approximation is it if it lacks funny robots doing flips). And in this case the best moments are when its not trying to be M and the worst accordingly are when it is, which is unfortunately the entire third act. Notwithstanding that the last sequence is filmed in the gorgeous, historic Bradbury Building (home to Blade Runner and to the less observant, LA Plays Itself). Another important thing to note is that like the original there is no one protagonist, which is incredibly unlike the studio system and more so reminiscent of Soviet cinema, which in the midst of all of this, isn’t insignificant!",3.0
"Pales in comparison to the original. Lang’s version has such a cruel, cold, artificial approach that completely trumps this. This feels too glamorous and lacks the discipline that Lang has to present a character or frame a shot. Was sad to find Losey omit the cross cutting between the gangsters and the police whilst they plot how to catch the killer. It would have been a blatant rip off but it just works so well. To be fair, stylish and slick in places - maybe if the original didn’t exist I would like it more.

"Every serial killer film should have a scene where the killer gets chased through the city streets, something Fritz Lang also does in While the City Sleeps. Recently a new Night of the Hunter remake by Scott Derrickson was announced and while he’s an inept hack, I think remakes are an essentially great concept. This film proves it effortlessly and I’m very much looking forward to Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s upcoming Serpent’s Path remake. David Wayne is pretty much just as good as Peter Lorre, and his final monologue almost makes you sympathize with the man. Major part of the film takes place in a sick looking shopping mall, the real life Bradbury Building (also appearing in Blade Runner), that looks like Ra’s al Ghul’s ridiculously cool lair from Arkham City. If Lang’s M captured fears of Nazi repression, then Joseph Losey’s does the same for the Red Scare anti-Communist repression of the 50s.
Apparently Losey and Nicholas Ray were in the same class in high school, which is just insane.",5.0

Losey was Under the Fascist Microscope of the “House on Un-American Activity Commission”, Suspected as being Influenced by and a Member of the Communist Party while Working in Hollywood.
So Losey, Like Lang Before Him, Chose Self-Exile to England Rather than Letting Congress Dictate His Future by “Blacklisting”, He Chose “Freedom” on His Own Terms.

"Knowing that it would be foolish to imitate Lang's Berlin, Losey creates his own unique language for Los Angeles. Exquisitely composed and blocked, claustrophobic angles immersing you in the turmoil of the city and its inhabitants. David Wayne has a quiet malevolence, using his hands as an outlet for his compulsions much in the same way Lorre used his eyes. Howard Da Silva doesn't seem right as the cop, and I feel it might have worked better if he and Raymond Burr switched roles. As is, they're both parodies of their respective professions.

"The thought that anyone would try to remake Fritz Lang's classic worried me, but this definitely succeeded. David Wayne (the Mad Hatter from the campy ""Batman"" series) is extremely effective as the child murderer with a shoe fetish. The cops, led by Howard Da Silva, are stumped so they do a lot of underworld raids for show. This does not sit well with mob boss Martin Gabel. He uses his network of low-lifes to spot the killer and capture him. Da Silva finally consults a psychologist, leading him to investigate recent asylum releases. Both lead to Wayne, but Gabel gets him first. Wayne is definitely creepy and pathetic. Luther Adler is a standout as the once prominent attorney whose career was killed by booze. With Jim Backus as the useless mayor, Raymond Burr, Steve Brodie, John Miljan as the unlikely witness, Madge Blake, and William Schallert. The anti-lunching subtext remains intact, though it also takes on the anti-Communist hysteria as well. Directed by Joseph Losey (who would soon leave America after being blacklisted). Worth a watch.",4.5
"It’s well directed enough, but it’s such a stale imitation of what made Fritz Lang’s M work it’s not even funny. All the atmosphere, suspense, and haunting visuals are replaced with a formalist approach that’s too clean, too drawn out, and too workmanlike. Even when it lifts a shot beat for beat from the original, it lacks all the elements that make that moment work. You know that shot where the one criminal is caught by the cops in that drilled hole as he looks up? Get ready to see the most lame version of that shot you could think of. Honestly, that whole department store sequence really details what doesn’t work about this remake.
The filmmakers for some reason figured the scene wasn’t intense enough in the original, so they throw a child into it to try and build new tension that doesn’t go…anywhere. There’s no sense he’s going to kill the kid during the sequence, or that the kid is in danger, because the kid just stands there while it all happens. It clearly is doing it to in some way up the stakes, but it then doesn’t. So what was this choice besides just doing…a new choice? What does it add to the ideas of the original?
The movie does at least attempt to focus more on themes of the original, playing into the Red Scare a bit with the paranoia each city-person feels too each other, but it goes off the rails by the kangaroo court scene which is a fascinating mess of a thing. They add a new motive to why the murderer kills the children that deals with parental abuse and I just…I hate it. The performance given by David Wayne can never compete with Lorre’s but the whole Murderer’s speech is whack and it convolutes and confuses the whole thematic question asked in the original. 
How do we treat a murderer? Should we allow them sympathy, especially if they are mentally unwell? M never set to answer it, but it understood it had to be careful and precise in what it was saying, which this one bulldozes through without a care in the world. It’s baffling and frustrating to watch, frankly. The sad thing is aside from the butchering of the original’s second half, the first half is just a more drawn out and copy-paste version of the first half. Even MORE scenes of neighbors turning on each other and the murderer being sad he can’t kill, which feels so fitting to what this is. It’s trying to be a decent and “better” version but it’s so careless and standard in its choices that it only leads to one outcome. That being that this time, M stands for mediocrity.",2.0
"Losey after Lang: Los Angeles with all the glamour sucked out, a cracked low-rent city with long grass growing from the broken pavements. Unseen but widely talked-of is the world of illicit gambling and slot machines, a whirlwind of legitimized rackets and police brutality that devours young victims as coldly and promiscuously as the child killer demanding that the world of men be crucified. Everything ends in a shrunken Hell beneath the city, a deserted car-park the embodiment of desolate modernity, where the big-time boys try to take the moral high ground, and the low-down murderer begs for understanding. ""What are ya, a communist?"" a hoodlum demands of an old woman who swears a blue dress was red; after turning out four noir portraits of a damaged and hysterical land of broken dreams in two years, Losey would be in Italy by 1952, and Britain by '53, exiled from the country he condensed and swore off in films such as this.",4.5

"A worthy enough idea to attempt to remake a classic for an American audience, but this pales in comparison. It's nowhere near as claustrophobic or grim (as fun it is to see, the LA sunshine is no help), and the cast of soon-to-be TV superstars (Thurston Howell III! Perry Mason! Various Twilight Zone people!) are a constant distraction.

"Is it better than the original, no. Is it better than it has any right to be, undeniably. Losey hijacks what would otherwise have been a passionless studio cash grab with help from Waldo Salt, and turns it into something more sly than just a stripped down Californiaized version of the original, a telling reflection of the red scare that would soon send him over to Europe for the rest of his career and leave Salt to wallowing in penniless…",4.0
"A child killer is on the loose. The police have very little to go on and the gangsters, tired of the disruption of police raids, are on a mission to find the killer first. Joseph Losey directs the American remake of the Fritz Lang German 1931 original. This version maintains much of the original's story beats, but plays them out against a backdrop of 1950s Los Angeles. The opening title sequence shows the killer taking the Angel's Flight funicular. The long vanished Bunker Hill area and the still existing Third Street tunnel are featured. We also see the now gone Ocean Park pier and have a whole sequence in the famous downtown Bradbury building.
This time out David Wayne (from the Twilight Zone ""Escape Clause"" episode) is in the Peter Lorre child killer role. Instead of whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"", he plays a different tune on a little flute. Howard Da Silva plays the head cop on the case and Martin Gable (Director of The Lost Moment) is the top gangster who organizes the criminals' effort to catch the killer. Glenn Anders, the really weird guy from The Lady from Shanghai, makes an equally weird appearance here as a gangster. Raymond Burr and Norman Lloyd are also in the gang. Luther Adler (from the Twilight Zone episode The Man in the Bottle) plays a drunk lawyer working for the mobster, Jim Backus is the blowhard mayor, and William Schallert shows up in a tiny part.

"Det finns en beröringspunkt mellan Billy Wilders ”Sensationen för dagen” och Joseph Loseys ”M”. Båda filmerna är till det yttre realistiska och båda tappar verklighetsförankringen i sin sökan efter en verklighet som inte är deras.
Mest ursäktad är kanske Losey som har haft den hopplösa uppgiften att göra en ny amerikansk version av den gamla tyska paradfilmen ”M” om barnmördaren som polisen inte kan få tag i och som stadens undre värld, besvärad av alla polisrazzior, själv börjar jaga. Det är inte bara konservatism när man redan från början är skeptisk mot detta försök att återuppliva en historia som är orimlig i isolerat sammanhang och som får och fått sin betydelse endast i den tyska miljön, där befolkningen, polisen, mördaren och den undre världen hade sina svagt dolda men annars högst verklighetsbundna motsvarigheter. Men en modern amerikansk storstad? Nej, det är lika omöjligt som ”Tolvskillingsoperan” som är hur tysk som helst hur engelsk den än skall vara. Konflikten stör inte på teater, den störde i Forsts film och den dominerar i ”M”. Advokatens patos är falskt på engelska, gangsterledaren är tagen ur ett tyskt skillingtryck och hans toughness skulle väcka löje i en amerikansk kindergarten. Etc.
”M” är ett skolexempel på filmens bundenhet till tid och miljö, på hur en riktig filmidé förlorar sin substans om man skär av dess rötter. Med dessa förutsättningar har Losey dock gjort det bästa möjliga, han håller spänningen vid liv, han har en fin känsla för gatornas ansikten och han har ibland god hjälp av David Waynes mördare, en prestation under, men inte mycket under, Peter Lorres uppvisning i originalversionen.",0.0

"Hochinteressantes Remake von Josoph Losey des Fritz Lang-Meisterwerks über einen Kindermörder. Nicht nur wegen der tollen ""On Location""-Darstellungen von Los Angeles (etwa der später oft benutzten Kulisse des berühmten Treppenhauses, das auch in ""Blade Runner"" Verwendung fand), sondern auch wegen seines politischen Inhalts.
So lässt sich der Film durchaus auch als Parabel auf den McCarthyimus lesen, dessen Opfer ja bekanntlich Losey , aber auch einige Darsteller wurden. Auch der Film von Fritz Lang lässt sich ja durchaus auf den damals heraufkommenden Nationalsozialismus Anfang der 30er lesen.

¿Me creerán que pequé de ingenuo y no sabía que iba a ver una remake de la peli de Lang? 🙈
El título es evidente, pero no le presté atención al detalle hasta la primera escena, la historia de un hombre buscado por las autoridades por secuestrar y asesinar niños.

"Joseph Losey asume el desafío de hacer una remake a la altura del clásico de Lang y toma un montón de decisiones ganadoras para distanciarse y hacer su propia película. Si las cosas más memorables de la M original son los encuadres y el uso del leiv motiv en un sentido narrativo (la melodía que es la pista para rastrear al asesino), Losey aprovecha los veinte años de desarrollo tecnológico para narrar en planos mucho más largos, con muchos movimientos de cámara (hay un travelling in del asesino enredando la mano en una lámpara que es una cosa impresionante). También el uso del sonido se expande y diversifica: en lugar de silbar, el asesino toca la melodía en una flauta, convirtiéndose en una especie de flautista de Hamelin del crimen.
También es brillante la elección de David Wayne como asesino. Si Peter Lorre era la perfecta encarnación de este ser humano casi bestial, el physique du rôle de Wayne es mucho más parecido al de Peter Kürten (el auténtico vampiro de Düsselforf). Un hombre mucho más ordinario y de a pie, que puede ser uno más de esa Los Angeles mega podrida.
La escena de la kangaroo court -acaso el riesgo más grande de patinar haciendo una remake de un clásico- es sensacional y traza un paralelismo entre el abogado y el asesino que es una invención completa de esta remake. El final es terrible, pesimista al mango (en pleno macartismo) y te deja tratando de recuperar el aliento.",4.0
"If a film opens up with a shot of Angels Flight in Los Angeles’ old Bunker Hill neighborhood, you know it’s gonna be noir gold. And, on top of that, the Bradbury Building plays a large part in the film’s third act. I’m here for that, baby.

"I can't speak to how it compares to the original, which I have not yet had the pleasure of, but it's certainly not an embarrassment.

As a remake, it may be superfluous, but I can't argue with the results -- a taut, dark fifties noir.",4.0

"While this lacks a talent like Peter Lorre at it's center and the depth and terror of Fritz Lang's clinical direction, Joseph Losey produces a worthy remake.

Talvez para quem não viu o original, este aqui seja melhor aceito e mais fácil de se sentir envolvido e tenso. Vejo problemas no modo como é retratado o assassino (sem um pingo da força de Peter Lorre), o advogado alcoólatra, e também o próprio líder da máfia, sem aquela pompa de grande vilão do filme de Lang. De todo modo, não deixa de ser interessante também uma abordagem mais realista desses personagens, aproximando-os de pessoas comuns; aproximando o assassino de alguém que pode estar em qualquer lugar, ser o seu vizinho etc. Prometo que vou estudar um pouco a obra de Losey no futuro.",3.0
"As far as remakes go, Joseph Losey's remake of Fritz Lang's 1931 thriller is an excellent example. Though I can say with little doubt I prefer the original, Joseph Losey's Americanization and noir-ization of the disturbing Weimar-era story is exceedingly well done.
David Wayne as the killer captures the same kind of pathetic, primal fear that Peter Lorre does in the original, but ultimately fails to come off as creepy anywhere near as effectively as Lorre does.
Losey's M is part noir, part police procedural, and part psychological thriller. Losey's M, however, takes place primarily during the day in downtown Los Angeles, whereas Fritz Lang's makes ample use of dark, rain-slick streets of Berlin.
Losey's use of L.A. landmarks such as Angels Flight, the 3rd Street Tunnel, and the Bradbury Building gives the film a sense of time and place and, as a lover of Los Angeles history, I relish every frame of films shot on-location in the city.
Losey's M has far more moralistic overtones than Lang's, and the film ends with a police intervention (just as Lang's does) that feels more like an unambiguous victory for the American justice system than a victory for the menaced people of Los Angeles. Somehow, Lang's manages to be both a victory for the rule of law (certainly an important facet of society in Weimar Germany) and for the menaced people of Berlin.",3.5
"A scene of a high ranking gangster spinning a barber shop chair leads to a jump cut from the interior of a spinning car being driven by a member of the same organization, keeping a continuous motion and suggesting the tight connectivity of this underground network. The cops and criminals are working parallel to each other in trying to catch a child killer on the loose, whose presence has thrown off the delicate balance of this social ecosystem. The mobsters have cornered the predator, Martin (David Wayne) in the Bradbury Building, with every inch of architectural glory lovingly captured by Ernest Laszlo’s camera. Interestingly, Martin’s last stand in a room full of half mannequins creates a bridge to the climax of Blade Runner. 
Updating the urban environment from Berlin to Los Angeles, director Joseph Losey retains a lot of the same story structure, themes. and motifs from Fritz Lang’s well regarded classic. What Losey brings to the table is a keen visual sensibility and turning the mob mentality into an allegory for the HUAC communist hearings. This film does justice to the source material; retaining the same level of technical excellence, searing performances, and moral ambiguity. It belongs on a shortlist of American remakes of European films that honor the original’s spirit while finding their own unique groove to play in (Sorcerer, Breathless, 12 Monkeys, and Solaris spring to mind).",4.0

"Twenty years later and the insight into insanity isn't advanced at all, but the editing certainly had. Losey and the screenwriters suck out most of the whimsy (In the Hall of the Mountain King) and satire (robbers as cops) from the 1931 film, turning a jaundiced noir eye to the story with crafty criminals and hard working gumshoes. That cuts both ways since we lose the ponderous exposition but also lose the central quandry of the story. In streamlining the plot, we also lose the gravity or foundation of the murderer's psychology. By the climax, he's probably the fourth most interesting character. That could be for several reasons, but it definitely saps the film of direction, which is pulled in four separate and not wholly satisfying directions.
Ernest Laszlo's cinematography is a standout",2.5
"Well, shit.
Fritz Lang's ""M"" is noteworthy for a slew of reasons, including it being Lang's first film of the sound era, the brilliant career-launching performance of Peter Lorre, the eeriness of its sound design (almost entirely silent save Lorre's haunting whistle), and its unusual role in scriptwriting history (""M"" was one of the first films to structure itself not around characters and their arcs but an event, in this case a series of child murders. In consequence, the film has no clear main character and no character arcs. Instead, it is the investigation into the crimes itself which is the main character of the film, and the only thing which morphs, changes, and learns over time. This is some top-level heady screenwriting stuff, and not a structure easily mastered even by the best of writers).
By contrast, the only thing Joseph Losey's 1951 remake has going for it is that it's a better movie.
It's not just Losey's expert use of the Bunker Hill locations (a legendary Los Angeles neighborhood that was razed literally down to the ground a few years later), though those certainly shine. And it's not the fact that Losey's active sound design captures an entirely different kind of bustling menace to the City. It's that Losey seems to have learned from Lang's original and pared down the story to its most essential beats, and when combined with A-level cinematography and a different kind of harrowing performance in David Wayne's strangely empathic child killer, it becomes more involving, almost a Greek Tragedy. There are no heroes here, with only a drunken, corrupt mob lawyer to provide any semblance of moral reasoning.

Losey doesn't have to transform the film into his own (much of it is directly taken from the original) but he does a fantastic job and the performances here are all great and this not Blade Runner is the best use of Los Angeles' famous Bradbury Building.

"A child killer is stalking the streets and soon the police are everywhere trying to catch him. This means that the police are stalking the low-life criminals and the crime bosses grow tired of it because it's costing them business. In order to get their business back, the crime bosses set out to catch the killer.
Fritz Lang's 1931 film M is without question one of the greatest and most disturbing movies ever made. This 1951 remake from Joseph Losey went decades without being seen but a recent restoration has it available for fans to finally catch. Is it a worthy remake? It absolutely is a winning gem. Some people have called it a film noir but I really don't agree with that. The film is very much like the original in that it has you who the real monsters are out in the world.
This film really shocked me on a couple levels. For starters, this was made in 1951 and I was shocked at how suggestive the material was. The early scenes show the killer stalking various little girls of all ages and race. The film certainly puts it in your face that this is a pervert and it doesn't shy away from this guy being attracted to them. Unlike the first film this one tries to explain why the killer is this way and of course it's the hatred of his mother.
The cinematography is a major plus and there's no question that Losey has great control of everything going on. There's a very long sequence inside a shopping center where the criminals are searching for the killer and the way this sequence is edited was just flawlessly done. Another major plus were the performances with everyone from a large role to a small one doing a great job. David Wayne plays the killer and brings a certain coldness to the role as well as a creepy undertone.
M has been forgotten over the years due to it being unavailable but now that it's making the rounds I can't help but think that it's reputation is going to improve. It's certainly not on the same level as the Lang film but it's still quite impressive.",3.0

Not really bad remake of the German classic from Joseph Losey before his blacklisting and exile can't help but suffer from comparison and since it can't hold a candle to it comes out all the worst.

"Fritz Lang's M is one of the preeminent proto-noirs, so it's only natural that a decade into the cycle a straight-up Hollywood remake would be attempted. Initially, producer Seymour Nebenzal wanted Lang for the job, but when that couldn't be arranged it fell to Joseph Losey, who only had two features to his name at the time. Working from a screenplay by Norman Reilly Raine and Leo Katcher that hews closely to the template laid down by Lang and Thea von Harbou, Losey does his best to emulate the look and tone of the 1931 original without making his M a total carbon copy. The main differences, then, apart from the change in locale from Berlin to Los Angeles, are the ways the story has been streamlined by Raine and Katcher, and their grasping attempts at psychoanalyzing the child killer (aided by Waldo Salt, who's credited with additional dialogue).
The child killer, incidentally, is messed-up mama's boy Martin Harrow (David Wayne, who won't make anyone forget Peter Lorre, but puts his own spin on the character nonetheless), whose psychosis manifests itself in the way he keeps the shoes of his young victims. The top cop on the case is Inspector Carney (Howard Da Silva), who's under pressure from the mayor (Jim Backus, who livens things up in his one scene) to bring Harrow's extracurricular activities to a halt. Accordingly, Carney and his lieutenant (Steve Brodie) spend their days chasing down leads and their nights raiding the establishments of crime boss Charlie Marshall (Martin Gabel), who figures the best way to get the heat off him is to put his people to work and find the killer themselves.
One aspect of the story that Losey and his writers don't hit as hard as Lang and von Harbou are the parallels between the police investigation and the one carried out by the various arms of Marshall's organization, headed up by such heavies as Raymond Burr and Norman Lloyd. And after Harrow is cornered in the Bradbury Building (inside the office of a mannequin company, prefiguring the climax of Kubrick's Killer's Kiss) and the criminals extract him (while making sure his last victim gets home safe and sound), they're ready to forgo the kangaroo court and skip straight to the lynching. This forces Marshall's lawyer, dipsomaniac Dan Langley (Luther Adler), to hurriedly improvise a defense for the mental case, who's fully prepared to pay for his crimes. He'd just rather get handed over to the proper authorities first.",0.0
"The local hoods decide to take action when a child murderer terrorizes the streets of L.A. This is a really useless remake. 1951 Los Angeles pales in comparison to a politically-heavy Germany which makes for an even stronger film when you take a step back and examine the film to when it was made.
The performances aren't particularly great with David Wayne splaying himself about as if he's forgotten you don't win Oscars the same way you win Tonys. He moves about like a mermaid at film's end, and it's really bad. Even Luther Adler doesn't save the movie from mediocrity. The film doesn't try to do anything remotely interesting with the cinematography. It's far too light and uninteresting. The occasional shadow passes by our characters, but they're never used to signify anything special.
And you figure they'd do that because the film spends so much time trying to analyze the murderer that it comes off as perfunctory and presents itself as another miscarriage of Hollywood's psychology obsession of the late '40s/early '50s. For all the time they spend talking about his psychology, we never get to see any of it at action. We're simply told at the end how bad Wayne feels on the inside. And what is film if not a medium for showing not telling?
And the film spends way too much time pairing Wayne opposite a potential victim. I'm not sure if it is supposed to humanize or dehumanize him, but the girl seems to have been thrown in just for the hell of it. There's no immediate threat presented. He's not trying to kill her when they're locked in a warehouse, he's not trying to kill her when they're in a tunnel. He drags her around like a love interest in an Indiana Jones film.

Granted, it's hard not to be obscured by the long shadow cast 20 years earlier by the Fritz Lang version and admittedly the film is weakest when it tries to stylistically ape some of the German Expressionist visuals.
That said, the most striking aspect of Losey's version is his neo-realistic use of street-level Los Angeles and its unique architecture in relation to individual and mob psychology, which also makes it hard not to consider the film against the historical moment of its production, given Losey's eventual blacklisting in 1951.",4.0
"Fritz Lang's classic 'M' back in the 1930s is a well-regarded classic, which brought Peter Lorre to prominence and a career in Hollywood.
This film, made twenty years later by Joseph Losey, starred light comedian David Wayne as the child-killer, and has much of the same storyline and set-pieces as its predecessor. But is it any good?
It has its chilling moments - notably the ones involving the plasticine figure and the bird at the cafe - and Wayne, in a largely silent part, is surprisingly good. But much of the film is a copy of the original, and this lessens its impact. Also, the character of the lawyer who has gone to drink is too prominent, and the underworld search for the murderer who threatens their operation doesn't quite fit on the mean streets of LA, where it did in Germany.
Not as bad as I'd heard, in fact this film is really quite good, but some bad editing decisions (acknowledged at the time of its release by Losey) have done damage. It deserves a nod for unusual casting though.",3.5
"Not bad for a blatant B-movie. Losey makes it visually interesting, although it's been years since I've seen the original, so I couldn't say how many shots he cribbed. The main problems lie in the casting - David Wayne sure as hell is no Peter Lorre - he is more of a blank character and a worrier than Lorre's obvious creep. But otherwise, some solid casting, with Raymond Burr and Jim Backus showing up, as well as Glenn Anders, the ""doing a little tarrrrrrget practice"" guy from The Lady From Shanghai.
Still, the movie does still creates some terror especially early on. By the end, however, everything falls apart. A pair of big speeches towards the end don't really land, especially when you realize one character exists solely to deliver that speech.",3.5
"Full disclosure: I haven't seen the Fritz Lang original. If I do, I might be able to come back and adjust my review (if I remember when the time comes).

This is one of those “you cannot avert your eyes” films, so consider yourself warned on that front.
Totally worth it, of course. Absolutely no question there.",4.5
"Much funnier than it’s original counterpart. Losey definitely adds humour more than Lang would’ve ever tried. Lang wanted a dark brooding and brutal film, he achieved that, Losey took that and westernised it (which isn’t always a bad thing) and added humour and political commentary that the west was dealing with at the time. While certainly not as iconic and engrossing as Lang’s M, it’s still worth the watch.",3.5

"In 1931 the German narrative Fritz Lang directed ""M"". A crime thriller focusing on the Mobs attempt to catch a serial killer whose killings bring unwanted scrutiny from the police. It's important to note that ""M"" was one first films to have spoken (sound) dialog, due to this fact the movie still realize heavily on visual cues and it's (beautifully dark and Noir)
cinematography to tell the story.
Twenty years later in 1951 the Wisconsin native Joseph Losey directed a remake of Fritz Lang's ""M"". The 1951 film shares much with its 1931 predecessor as far as story and plot go. However the biggest departure comes from the film's cinematography (it's very bright) and it's more blatant Pro government stans (police good! Mob bad!). As well as a less complex take on human nature as it relates to good and evil and innocent and guilty, as further demonstrated by the films less dark ending (although that may have been a censorship thing).
Looking at this film (""M"" 1951) on its own it still does a good enough job at telling an excellent story. Although the dialogue is clunky, drawn out, and melodramatic. As far as visibly and audibly the film is quite a bore (to the point that I started writing this review while still watching the movie).

"While it is good at being a well directed remake of one of the greatest thrillers ever made it’s just sorta strange that this exists at all. M(1931) didn’t need an English remake, it already had an English dub which was pretty popular in the States?? Not to mention it starred one of the most iconic horror stars, Peter Lorre and he was still alive and making horror movies so I don’t see why they didn’t cast him again.",3.5
"It's been years since I've seen Fritz Lang's original M which might have helped me appreciate Joseph Losey's version on its own terms. This is very much a Los Angeles noir, one that builds on the noir fixtures of isolation, persecution and moral ambiguity to encompass a commentary on mob justice and the nature of guilt. There are also some great shots of postwar LA, including a great sequence at the Bradbury building. The final scene is pretty extraordinary, with…",0.0

"Unfounded Revenge

I want to at the very least preface with the fact that I adore the original ""M"" movie. The German expressionism, that film noire style, the scenes that make your mind wander, the list could go on. But I have been trying to track this movie down for some time, but I never really had much luck. YouTube may be one of mankind's greatest invention, hands down.
I found it there while doing my film challenge of ""Monster Madness"". While technically not a horror movie, it has a majority of the elements.
Besides, the original film is probably in my top 30 favorite films of all time. Maybe some day I will make that list, but I digress. Often times, it is very tough for me to watch remakes. Especially when I hold them in very high regard. One shouldn't always compare scene for scene, it can lead to poor expectations. It should be viewed as its own entity. The character who is dubbed ""The Baby Killer"" lacks the charm of a serial killer, he genuinely looks disturbed. In fact, he is down right manic in certain scenes. It paints a much better picture of how sick and deranged he really is. It comes off as a solid albeit lackluster when compared to the original. You see a lot more of the hysteria that surrounds a town trying to track an unknown entity. The biggest gripe that I have with this one is the flute. I know I keep comparing the two, but the killer in the 1931 version whistled ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" before committing his crimes, which ultimately leads to his downfall.
Here we have a man who plays a flute intermittently. In comes right the fuck out of nowhere, and I was expecting some sort of exposition in some slight way. But nothing. It goes nowhere, and I would rather not spoil the ending but the pay off is satisfactory.
If it is still on YouTube, check it out. Not a superior remake, but a solid entry in its own right. Worth a watch for sure. The scenery oozes charm with those shots of California just existing in the background. I could stare at stuff like that all day man.",3.5

Though it is fun spotting the familiar faces.",2.0
"I’d read this Joseph Losey remake of the Fritz Lang classic was actually quite good, and it is. Losey, or possibly Ernie Laszlo, seem to have a real fascination here with differences in elevation, the movie starts on a funicular and includes shots ascending and descending stairways and elevators and ends in a parking garage with the murderer elevated on a ramp, and also repeated architectural patterns. 
It has been so long since I saw the original M that all I can remember are the major ideas, and they all seem more or less captured here. This M isn’t as stylized, at least not overtly. David Wayne is no Peter Lorre but his monologue is compelling. It captures the main ideas of M and brings them to the US and updates them 20 years. Which, I don’t know that needed to happen. 
It’s a good remake. Did anyone need to remake M? No. Is this essential viewing like the original M? Also, no. But it is still good.",4.0

"M
AKA Joseph Losey’s “M”
I guess it was only fitting to remake Fritz Lang’s M, a German Expressionism precursor to American Noir, into a full blown noir by a director who would spend the 1950s making films almost exclusively in the genre. 
This moves the serial killer classic from Germany to LA with what is now one of my favorite opening credit scenes of all time as you read the killer’s headlines and then ride up the original Angels Flight which reveals the night skyline. The rest of the story is roughly the same as the original, but it’s impossible to replace Peter Lorre’s singularly iconic main role. 
If you liked the original Lang masterpiece, you’ll find new stuff to like here especially the penultimate scene of the gang of career criminals searching for the killer in the most iconic of noir buildings, The Bradbury. While the original takes more time to develop the killer, this leaps right into things and never stops which makes for a fast thriller. Also, while Lang was obviously the better director, Losey used every modern trick possible to make his version something new, so there were many times I wished I could have chosen a scene by scene mashup of the two movies. 
If they could have somehow managed to convince Peter Lorre to revive his role for this remake, I dare say this would be considered one of the best movies of the 50s. Without his harrowing and convincing performance, this feels a bit overwritten for a sulking and often nebbish David Wayne. Other than that, Losey put together a “who’s who” of noir B actors and top notch crew members that rivals the best of the era.

For one thing, it didn't have anything new or different to offer, let alone any improvements.

The final scene, while not at all bad, really sapped a lot of the tension that precedes it. It's long, stagey, & talky, yet somehow the very end seems abrupt. The PREVIOUS series of scenes, however, in LA's famed Bradbury Building, are terrific & should fascinate fans of ""Killer's Kiss"" (1955).

"Fritz Lang’s original, about a city’s response to a serial child murderer, is one of the greatest films of all time; I assumed Joseph Losey’s 1951 American remake would be a pale imitation. I was wrong; it’s excellent. The script doesn’t stray far from the original, except to move it from 1930s Berlin to 1950s Los Angeles. Which means it changes the subtext from rising Nazism to rising McCarthyism. Since Losey was being investigated by HUAC and about to be blacklisted (as were a couple of the film’s actors), its scenes of mob justice and the harassment of innocents feel pointed. Although the film echoes some of the famous shots of the original, like the released balloon, it has a strong visual style; kudos to cinematographer Ernest Laszlo. David Wayne, as the killer, fortunately doesn’t try to mimic Peter Lorre’s iconic performance; instead, he plays him as a bundle of nerves who is always on edge. I like how Losey and Laszlo keep his face hidden, either filming him from behind or in shadows. Unfortunately, the attempt to psychoanalyze the killer feels pat and unconvincing; the nearby framed photo of his mother while he’s nervously strangling a doll seems a cliché now. But the location filming in L.A. adds a layer of authenticity, and the supporting cast, especially Martin Gable and Howard da Silva, is convincing. Nice touch: the mob lawyer is named Langley, a merging of Lang and Losey.",3.5

"I did not expect this to be...kind of good? I don’t think Wayne is as good as Lorre was. I also don’t think 50’s LA is quite as good of a setting, but it does mean some cool locations.
Also, I want 100% more Raymond Burr and whatever throat infection he had that made him sound like that. He should have been the boss.",3.5
"A well-done remake of the 1931 German thriller by the same name: M. David Wayne, who is usually a good guy and pal, does well as the killer of children.
Loads of character and B film actors: Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III, as the mayor); Howard Da Silva and Steve Brodie as the cops; Raymond Burr, when he was still playing bad guys; Norman Lloyd... and more.
Cinematography is well done, with some great LA street scenes",4.0
"A very interesting and unusual film that is part theatrical and at times it seems part documentary. Definitely not your average 50s era crime/mystery fare and the actual killer is portrayed in an unnerving way. While the film at times seems like it may veer off in another direction, it always comes back to its course and towards a strong ending. If you're a fan of the 50s murder mysteries, then this should be on your watch list.",4.0
"Very tense, haunting. Great cinematography and use of Bradbury building. The third act loses its way pretty badly, but the chase is very tight.",3.5
"It's very fine. The only reason you should watch this one instead of the original, is if you don't want to read the subtitles. If that doesn't bother you, find the 1931 version.",3.0

"A most under-rated film when it came out in 1951, ""M"" is a visual American noir that, as the poster says, grips the viewer with sights that showcase the directioral skills of a top notch film maker. LA in 1950 had the look and ""M"" gives it to you in fine fashion. Excellent acting from all, this flick is just a notch below a masterpiece, even if it was panned in the 1950s. I would like to see a modern third remake of the story with Tom Hanks as the child murderer. Viewed on TCM and do not have the movie in my collection.",4.5

"Started the movie thinking it was the original; but quickly realised my mistake (duh) and wanted to turn it off when something happened on screen that peaked my interest: 2 men waking arm in arm on screen in an 50s movie and decided to stay.
And after the initial struggle with the way police was portrayed I got slowly in the movie and actually found it an ok watch.
The use of the hide out building and the area was particularly well done. The acting was a bit over the top by some and underwhelming by others.
Now hopefully I can watch the German original to compare quickly.
Came back after seeing the original to take a star of my review, forget about this and watch the Fritz Lang version",2.0
"Joseph Losey's take on Fritz Lang's 'M' works well for most parts. Although not as threatening in atmosphere, this 1951 American version is still interesting and stands on its own. A child killer seems impossible to catch, so the criminal part of Los Angeles takes over with interesting results. David Wayne will never be a Peter Lorre, but does an efficient job as the child killer. Nice to see a good role for Steve Brodie (Out of the Past, Crossfire) and everyone's favourite noir bad guy Raymond Burr is on hand as a heavy to add to the building tension. Good use of LA external locations. All in all a solid re-make that makes me want to re-watch the original, which I will do now. Great print.",3.0

"A worthy remake of a German classic by Fritz Lang. The location is Los Angeles instead of pre-WWII Germany.
There are notable differences towards the end. In the Lang version, there are two trials, a kangaroo court trial followed by a real one. In the Losey version, there is only a kangaroo court trial with a murder added during the trial.

"An odd film that benefits greatly from the locations in and around Los Angles and particularly a large sequence shot inside the famed Bradbury Building. The quality of the filmmaking and acting varies wildly with some scenes feeling like a poverty row production, others looking quite nice. Several of the performances are way over-the-top with Jim Backus being the most egregious. Raymond Burr plays a heavy (in more ways than one) with a very strange and magnetic affectation.",3.0
"Before seeing this in theatre, I wasn't actually aware that there was a remake of Fritz Lang's 1931 M. Set in LA, it was made in the US; Lang was asked to direct it and allegedly said ""why remake a masterpiece"" and after watching this version of M, I think Lang made a very good point.
It follows the same structure as the original movie, and indeed, quite a few shots are nearly identical. One of the ways it does…",2.5

"Ausdrucksstark bebildertes, bisweilen pseudo-dokumentarisch anmutendes Remake, das der expressionistischen Bilderwelt von Langs Original die scharfkantige Grobkörnigkeit des Film-gris und die düsteren Schattenwelten des Film-noir entgegensetzt, wobei der Mörder konsequent als Produkt einer roboterhaft konformen, bigotten Gesellschaft gezeichnet wird.
In seinen Anleihen bei psychoanalytischen Erklärungsmustern, mit ihren totalitären, schwülstig anmutenden Verklärungen der menschlichen Psyche, erweist sich der Film dabei, trotz allem Realismus, als Produkt seiner Zeit, was dem Verhalten des Serienkillers mitunter etwas unfreiwillig komische Züge gibt.
Am Ende bleibt ein cinematographisch eindrücklicher, atmosphärischer und solide gespielter Thriller, der erst in der allzu pathosgeladenen Auflösung an Eleganz und Spannung verliert.",3.5
"I haven't seen Fritz Lang's original, but I would gladly say that Losey's M stands tall in its own right. Through chilling sound motifs and insidious, creeping cinematography -- the eerie close-ups of the mother's portrait, the shots of the balloon floating away, the mannequin room -- Losey still finds ways to exploit the intense hopelessness, questionable morality, and horror that humanity can invoke. It's subtle, quiet, and clean.",3.0

"A solid Cold War update to Fritz Lang's seminal crime film. I prefer the sparse desolation of the original (owing much to Lang adjusting to early sound tech) but if that and the language barrier is a little to much, this is still a gorgeous and evocative way to experience this story for the first time",3.5
"If we don’t compare this with the original Fritz Lang masterpiece, it’s amazing. The stunning black & white cinematography of Ernest Laszlo, the bygone era Los Angeles locations, the truly unsettling camera angles, and the bevy of character actors all in top form. The dialogue is dumbed-down American at times, but has some stellar monologues. Raymond Burr is doing a weird tough-guy voice, but I suppose it landed him the lead in an actual Fritz Lang movie, The Blue Gardenia. Oh, and they replaced Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King” with something altogether less sinister. So yeah, 1951’s M can’t compete with the Lang and Lorre original, but it’s still really good.

"I’ve waited years to see this, knowing full well how difficult separating this from Fritz Lang’s original classic would be. Well, it was even harder than I imagined. My summary? Despite some fine performances and awesome camera work, Joseph Losey’s M is a pale imitation. All of the “political undercurrents” surrounding this can go to hell. Anyone even mildly interested in this genre probably knows what Losey’s politics were, but those politics doesn’t make for a better or somehow more nuanced film.",3.0
"This is the Hollywood/English language remake of the classic German film. The plot is basically the same: A serial killer that preys on children is on the loose and he is captured by a group of criminals. Yes, well, it goes without saying this is nowhere near as great as the original. There's a bit too much padding for it to get to feature length and for it to get to its version of the kangaroo court which is, by the way, the best part of the film. I give it points for trying to be different. Though David Wayne is definitely not Peter Lorre, he gets points for almost coming close. It's not a bad remake but the original is far better.",3.0

In this pre-blacklist Losey film, there is a Freudian explanation for the baby killer's motives that predates the one in Psycho. It's Zodiac meets The Ox-Bow Incident.",3.5
"Of course it pales in comparison to the original. but director Joseph Losey turns the remake into a nice little film noir, that benefits from Los Angeles locations, some very nice shadowy cinematography and a large cast of recognizable character actors. David Wayne has the thankless task of filling Peter Lorre's shoes, and though he tries to come across as a distraught crazy, he just can't come across as creepy as Lorre",3.5

Super straight forward. Takes the audience fro idiots and has to slowly explain piece by piece what is happening. Doesn't leave anything up to the imagination.

"It's hard to avoid comparing it to the greatness of the original, but it works quite will by changing a bit of the focus and style. It trades the longer evocative shots, visual creativity and Lorre for a quicker paced story and slightly more developed secondary characters.

"Long-unavailable remake of Fritz Lang's classic is surprisingly a near-classic in its own right. Directed by Joseph (THE SERVANT) Losey just before he was blacklisted, he gets the mix of what to change and what to leave the same just right. David Wayne's psycho is harrowing & more sympathetic (!) than Lorre's. The location shooting in L.A.'s long-gone Bunker Hill neighborhood is stunning. Trading sun-drenched days for Lang's inky night works perfectly. The Bradbury Bldg, where Wayne holes up, is used to great effect. I love the touch of him keeping the shoes of all his victims. 9/10",4.5
"Not the classic Lang original, this is the American remake from the 50's. Pretty good in its own right, but just can't compete with Lang's knack for expressionism and the fact that David Wayne, despite admirable efforts, is no Peter Lorre. Still really enjoyed it though.",3.5
"Having not seen the original in a LONG time, I could get past comparisons (though a lot of it felt fresh even with the identical plots). I liked that the killer was more ordinary looking than Lorre. The grim view of the ""mob rule"" herd mentality of a community in 50s USA is interesting coming from a filmmaker who was a victim of McCarthyism. Sometimes simulating a story to another culture can be interesting.",4.5
