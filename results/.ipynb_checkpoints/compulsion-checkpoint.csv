"Two young men one day decide to commit a heinous crime for leisure. Now it is a lawyer's turn to find some humanity in an inhuman case.
This is, in many respects, a straightforward courtroom drama. Good framing helps us understand the characters' inner lives without calling attention to the camera or editing, which both remain unobtrusive.
Speaking of performances, everyone does a terrific job, especially our crooks, capturing the sociopathy and even the tragic end result of one of the parties. While Orson doesn't have a huge role, his closing monologue is not only thoughtfully crafted but also performed brilliantly in a manner that's in keeping with the rest of the movie's understated yet powerful manner.
All in all, in many ways, this is a hidden gem that fans of legal dramas will certainly enjoy.

"So before we start, I am watching this on a sublime looking blu ray. The old Fox restoration department had done amazing work on their library, I will be honest, i prefer black and white stock, and the shading and tone looks beautiful here, like most of the old b&w films i have from that studio. Hell the definition of image is so strong you can see the make up blotches on Dean Stockwell's cheeks.
So I have seen Rope and Swoon, but i have always preferred this one, it seems the middle point between the two, where there is enough nudge nudge wink wink for the time, to imply the relationship between the two, hell even a load of hooded KKK members turn up to burn Welles lawn for taking the case (or his previous civil rights cases but Welles is meant to be playing Clarence Darrow here).
Also this has the 20 min plus Welles masterclass monologue on ""Justice"", which echos the narration from The Trial. This was based on the apparently eight-hour summation, which Welles doesn't miss or real take any hostages on his delivery of it.
Dean Stockwell should also gets props for being such a cold calculating psycho at that young of an age.",4.0

Even though, i wouldn't say Orson Welles is actually starring in this movie his performance certainly left the biggest impression on me.

For a more compelling argument against capital punishment, I would actually have to read Camus or Dostojewski again and I have decided quite a while ago that ""movies are more of my thing than those so called books"". Bradford Dillman is haunting and Dean Stockwell compellingly gullible and smart at the same time. I don't know how he does it.

"Quase um filme-ensaio, e estou falando do tipo que fazem Farocki e Andersen mesmo. Para perceber isso basta observar a forma como Fleischer desloca o protagonismo da narrativa das personagens dos dois rapazes para a do advogado que os defenderá no tribunal e, em decorrência disso, imaginar o filme com o título das forças em embate: Séc. XX (na figura de Welles - isto é, do cinema, da ciência, da justiça que afloram, se consubstanciam e se sedimentam após a 2ª Guerra com a tomada de consciência sobre os limites do homem potencializada pela reflexão sobre o holocausto) X Séc. XIX (na figura de Dean Stockwell e Bradford Dillman e do promotor interpretado por E. G. Marshall - isto é, o caso Leopold-Loeb e os últimos estertores do romantismo, do fanatismo, de um pendor elitista e proselitista, um anti-humanismo que ainda sobrevive nos nossos dias, como bem se vê).",4.0
"The only problem I had with this fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb trial is that the murderous duo, despite their infamy, are just not that interesting once you examine them in any depth. Hitchcock’s Rope, which used the same crime as much looser inspiration, made up for that by placing the emphasis on situational suspense, adding an immediacy to its drama. Richard Fleischer’s film, however, has more philosophical ambitions, which sometimes proves to be a detriment. 
For the first half of the film we focus exclusively on the pair of killers—named Steiner and Strauss here—and the perverted Nietzschean philosophy used as justification for their crimes, which is just too superficial to be provocative in any real way. Their unspoken fear of masculine inadequacy—one’s a mama’s boy, the other sexually repressed, both probably gay—cuts a bit deeper on a cultural level. It forces us to wonder if their attitudes would’ve turned so toxic had the world been able to accept their nonconforming natures. But the psychology behind these characterizations still feels a bit trite to me. The dominant/submissive roles they play in their relationship is an intriguing wrinkle, but one that goes largely unexplored in any meaningful way. 
Arriving in the second half to save the day is Orson Welles as the fictional Clarence Darrow stand-in. It’s here where the film turns into a thoughtful rumination on the role of the defense attorney in the legal system. His final summation at the trial is unavoidably didactic in its critique of capital punishment, but what struck me more deeply was the compassion in his words. His argument is not a defense of their actions—which are indefensible—but a defense of their civil rights—which, in his mind, should be undeniable. It’s an act of selfless solicitude that his loathsome clients are neither worthy of, nor grateful for. Yet it is necessary, if only to keep the courts honest.",3.5
"Nuestros protagonistas cometen un crimen motivados por la convicción de un orden moral alternativo en el que su superioridad intelectual legitima el obrar contra aquellos que no están a su altura. Es, a simple vista, un concepto similar a rope de Hitchcock, cosa ineludible al inspirarse ambas en el mismo crimen acontecido en la vida real.
A medida que avanza, sin embargo, se aleja de la obra de Hitchcock separándose de la noción de thriller mientras se aventura como drama judicial con la llegada de un Orson Welles que se roba el show. El discurso final es el verdadero punto de esplendor de una película que es en sí lo suficientemente efectiv",3.5
"1st Richard Fleischer
The first of Fleisher's three films based on a true crime story (The others being The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place), Compulsion is a serious, slightly dour film with three excellent central performances. The film is adapted from a novel based on the Leopold and Loeb murders of the 1920s. Here, two young men kidnapped and murdered a teenage boy, simply to see if they could, judging themselves to be 'morally superior' to him. Like all iconic murderers, the fascination here comes from the duality of their crimes- the brutal savagery contrasted with their apparent intellect (Loeb spoke 15 languages) and their privileged upbringing.
The film is a fictionalised adaptation of their case, and while it makes some good points as to the historical context, especially in terms of their immense wealth, it never really gets to the heart of WHY the two men were so bound together. There's the subtle suggestion that Stockwell's character may be homosexually bound to his compatriot, but it's never really explained. The two of them remain rather glassy figures, though the performances by Stockwell and Dillman manage to convey a certain arrogance and smugness in their performances. Welles also is on near-top form, not as good as when he's Harry Lime or Quint, but still excellent in his final monologue. The use of music is sparse but effective, and there's some nice visual tricks involving a pair of glasses. Overall, not half bad.

"COMPULSION is a tour de force by a director, Richard Fleisher, who has a remarkably strong filmography. Retelling the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case, who murdered a boy just to prove they could, the film is set in two separate acts. The first half looks at the actions and motivations of Steiner and Strauss, renamed, as they try to manage the whirlwind of police activity, with Strauss involving himself upfront in the investigation and Steiner battling his own Nitzschian empowerment against his own moral qualms of guilt.
Both Stockwell and Dillman give powerhouse performances. Stockwell as Steiner has the trickier role of presenting us with a man who wishes to be submissive to his friend (a great moment comes when he is goaded into attacking a romantic interest by Strauss saying ""you want me to order you to do it""), but still has some humanity inside. It appears painful to him when he realizes that he may not be the ""superman"" that he thought he was.
Dillman has the showier role of Strauss, giddily taunting all around him by flexing what he believes to be his superior intellect, yet there is something stunted in him. His childlike enthusiasm, his lack of thinking of consequences, his attachment to his ""mumzy"" all present themselves. Both are petulant and entitled and as such they are dangerous. The way the actors keep blurring the power that the characters hold over each other is engaging to watch.
The second half comes alive when Orson Welles hits the screen as the defense attorney hired by their families. Based on Clarence Darrow, he is a strong civil rights advocate and his taking on the case of two privileged men, clearly guilty of the crime, seems to be of no concern. In his eyes all people deserve their fair fate.
At first I was impressed by Welles' subtleness in this role. Trading quips with reporters and looking slovenly and ill-kept, he underplays the part. When it comes time for his final summation to the judge, he sparks alive, giving a lengthy soliloquy that is dynamic and moving. It is clear that this was why he took this role.
Apart from the lurid opening sequence placing this as yet another hip late 50's b-movie, Fleisher ably directs this. The momentum is good and the few stylistic flourishes are welcome, though the superimposed glasses over the final moments was a bit over the top.
This was a top-notch film, better in my opinion than Hitchcock's ROPE which took a different look at the same story a few years earlier. It is not often that a movie can impact my beliefs, but the speech at the end made me view capital punishment through a different light. For any work of art to be able effect change is a welcome relief, especially in the times we are living through now.",5.0
"You would think a film about the infamous Leopold and Loeb killing would make for a compelling film, right? For Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation ""Rope"", it certainly did. But this version, although more accurately reflecting the actual case, is slow, talky and tiresome. Even Orson Welles showing up midway through to channel Clarence Darrow for the courtroom section doesn't help.
The case itself - two wealthy Chicago youth plotting and executing ""the perfect crime"" and the subsequent trial - created a national media frenzy in the 1920s. This film is based on a 1956 novel by Meyer Levin who himself interviewed Leopold in prison (Loeb had been murdered in prison by another inmate in 1936). The film never shows the pair murdering the child but details their strange master-slave, homoerotic relationship and their Nietzschean sense of superiority.
Bradford Dillman (as Artie, the Loeb character) and Dean Stockwell (as Judd, the Leopold character) are good. Stockwell as usual excells in playing vulnerable, sensitive characters. Although both are disturbed, Loeb is the more sociopathic of the two. There's an unfortunate side plot involving young Martin Milner and Diane Varsi, as university classmates of the two that doesn't add much, and Varsi in particular is quite wooden in her acting.
I'm likely an outlier in that I disliked Welles' performance here (He won the Cannes Best Actor award for this performance). He plays the boys' lawyer (who in real life was Clarence Darrow) and gives long impassioned speech near the end which is basically a condemnation of capital punishment. Darrow did the same in the real trial speaking for 12 hours (!) But to me, Welles was distracting. He's sloppily dressed with a bad haircut, speaks with a long drawn-out drawl and seems more of an odd duck - eccentric but smart - than a masterful attorney.
Anyway, for a better film adaptation, watch either Hitchcock's ""Rope"" from 1948 or the 1992 indie queer film ""Swoon"" by Tom Kalin. And fun fact - the 1970s thriller ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" is a very loose imagining of what might've happened to the mothers of Leopold and Loeb after the sensational trial.",3.0
"Summer of Scam 2: Criminally Insane
I'm a huge fan of Richard Fleischer and he's certainly, for me, one of the most ridiculously under-appreciated directors possibly of all time.
But there are a few things not quite right about Compulsion, despite the many positives it also has in its favour. It particularly falters during its latter stages, where I actually think that maybe Fleischer's personal politics get in the way rather.
I am absolutely and totally against capital punishment, and I would not be swayed an iota from that belief. Yet I think Fleischer totally overdoes his anti-execution message here, and quite possibly gets carried away at the prospect of Orson Welles delivering a technically flawless monologue arguing against Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman being killed by the state.
You can understand why that might be. It really is a brilliant piece of heartfelt acting and direction. I just think it turns things in the wrong direction here. Fleischer does mostly really good work in the first three-quarters of Compulsion in showing what an unpleasant and unrepentent pair these two were, yet his mistake with Welles' involvement is that he risks leaving us sympathising with them.
I admit it's a *very* hard balance and Welles' message of love, tolerance and understanding is completely laudable. Yet there's only a brief message about the boy they murdered. There should have been a greater emphasis on this - it's already glossed over enough by the fact that Fleischer chooses not to film his murder or any of the immediate build-up or aftermath as it is.
At the very least, Fleischer should have chosen which film he wanted to make here. The two just don't fit together. There are problems early on in that Dillman and Stockwell can't be nearly as intelligent as they claim to be if their performances in denials are so clearly rehearsed and contrived that surely nobody would believe a sodding word they were saying right from the get-go. If it wasn't for E.G. Marshall occasionally noting that he's not sure they're guilty, it would be like an episode of Columbo.
Fleischer is excellent at framing their privilege, however. He doesn't push the financial envelope too far but it's clear what he's getting at. These two are clearly of the mindset they're above all others as much because of their wealth and social status than their book smarts. Their arrogance towards anyone 'beneath' them, which is almost everyone, is the very epitome of upper class white status.
Additionally, the relationship between the two leads is very well played, thinly veiled with its sexuality subtext although disappointingly not doing more with Stockwell's need to be dominated by Dillman. I'm surprised, really, this is such a mixed bag but it's more in how it's a mixed bag that it's most disappointing of all.",3.0

"based on the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder case, explores the chilling minds of two wealthy, intellectually gifted young men, played convincingly by Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman. Their characters, inspired by real life killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, believe they can commit the perfect murder simply to prove their intellectual superiority.
unfolds with a meticulously planned crime, as these young men abduct and murder a young boy solely to test their intellect against society norms. What follows is a gripping courtroom drama, where their defense attorney, brilliantly portrayed by Orson Welles, fights to save them from the death penalty. Orson Welles delivers a powerful performance, capturing the complexity of his character and adding depth to the film. The screenplay, adapted from Meyer Levins novel, provides rich dialogue and beautiful monologues, enhancing the film's intellectual depth.
The courtroom scenes are skillfully crafted, adding depth and tension to the narrative. In these scenes, viewers witness the clash of legal titans as Orson Welles, playing defense attorney Jonathan Wilk, faces off against the prosecution in a battle for justice. Orson Welles delivers a commanding performance, portraying Wilk as a brilliant and charismatic lawyer who is determined to save his clients from the gallows. The courtroom sequences are marked by compelling dialogue and gripping cross examinations. Compulsion raises a perfect questions about the nature of justice, the limits of intellect, and the responsibility of society in shaping the actions of its individuals. The tension in the courtroom is palpable, making these scenes some of the most memorable and impactful moments in the film.",4.0
"80/100
Second viewing, last seen 2004. There's a fascinating paradox at work here: Compulsion abruptly turns into a different film about ⅔ of the way through (and surely must hold the record for Latest Entrance By A Movie's Top-Billed Star, with Orson Welles first appearing 68 minutes in), making it feel disjointed and incoherent...but, at the same time, pseudo-Darrow's lengthy, impassioned argument against the death penalty gains tremendous power by arriving from out of nowhere, as the unexpected denouement to what had been a true-crime thriller told exclusively from the murderers' POV.

"You seem so sad.
That’s a sentimental term. There’s no such thing as sadness. Only the reality of things happening.
RIP Dean Stockwell – his performance here is so layered and compelling, with the nervy snottiness and spiky desperation he lends Judd telegraphing so much. I love the way he moves – small, measured and creeping. The film's stark lighting highlighting both his beauty and its scars and imperfections. His boyish pomposity and how easily it crumples inwards. A ""powder-puff"", pinched and nasal. The desire stewing under the surface for Strauss; how he's under his thrall. How much he enjoys that; how much it scares him.",3.5
"A few months ago I went on a deep dive on a famous trials website and read up on the Leopold and Loeb case. I was fascinated by it for a short period of time and in particular found this letter from one of Leopold's coworkers from after he was released from prison to be very striking. I knew I wanted to see the fictionalized film adaptation of the case at some point and I finally got to it today. I was surprised by how faithful it was to the real life case: the focus on the glasses and the hinge, the testimony of the chauffeur breaking the case wide open, Leopold's interest in Friedrich Nietzsche and bird watching, all of this was just like the actual murder case. I liked the accuracy. I also found Dean Stockwell's performance to be of note. He reminds me of a doll version of Monty Clift; he doesn't quite have that embodied sadness and pain that makes Clift's acting so special to me but his doll-like essence really works for Steiner: he looks ready to crack like porcelain as the pressure mounts. I also wish more attention had been drawn to the sadomasochistic gay relationship between Steiner and Straus the film hints at but for 1959 they were probably already pushing the envelope with what they did show and imply.
Of course, with all the attention to accuracy that most of the film has, the editorializing is made even more glaring. From what I have read, Leopold (Steiner) did not attempt to rape a woman, Ruth in the film, at Loeb's command (though if this did actually happen please let me know) and the way the film handled Ruth's character and the aftermath of the attempted rape felt very strange to me. The scene felt unnecessary in the grand scheme of the story, as if it was only there for sensationalization (which again feels unnecessary since the murder is already shocking is it is) but I found the way the movie handled Ruth after the attempted rape to be very upsetting and strange. She was extremely sympathetic to Steiner and even testifies in his defense at the trial. I don't want to invalidate complicated or even sympathetic feelings a survivor may have for the perpetrator after that type of trauma but it didn't feel like Compulsion was trying to portray that type of complicated and somewhat 'unexpected' reaction to an attempted assault and instead it felt like the film made Ruth's traumatic experience all about Steiner's feelings. It seemed like the only reason for the rape scene was to make Steiner more complex or sympathetic (??????) as a character. It made me uncomfortable and confused.
I also found the ending to be far too moralistic. Orson Welles (looking like a melting candle, God bless him) as Clarence Darrow gives a very long closing statement chastising the court and prosectors for frothing at the mouth in their attempts to get the boys executed for their crime. A lot of this statement is apparently taken from what Darrow actually said, but in the context of the film it feels unnecessarily long-winded and condescending. Darrow in real life needed to convince the judge to not have the boys executed but he did not need to convince me. This very long speech that includes baffling lines about how everyone makes mistakes in their teenage years feels doubly frustrating because while the killers are given ample time to be humanized both by this speech and by the rest of the film the young boy they killed is never shown on screen. I thought the decision to not portray the murder itself was a good one, but by not showing the boy at all Compulsion robs him of being a person instead of a bodiless concept. The painful truth that a little boy was killed for no reason is buried. His family is not given any screen time either.
I also think it could have been interesting to explore the unofficial 'death penalty' Loeb received in prison when he was murdered by another inmate. Was locking the two boys up that much more of a kindness? I know there are other films about this case from decades later than Compulsion and I wonder how they handle the gay relationship between the two men and the aftermath of their lives in prison (and for Leopold) adjusting to life back in the world. I'll probably check out Swoon (1992).",2.5

"Aside from being (rightfully) regarded as one of the best courtroom dramas of all time, Richard Fleischer’s often forgotten masterpiece Compulsion really stands more fitting classification as a pure Noir movie within in its foundations. Making a throwback for the director’s B Noir films period, but now taken here to a whole other dramatic spectrum of sophistication. Just another huge illustrator of how Fleischer was exponentially, decade by decade, he was there often changing and reformulating the police thriller different edges in American cinema, from the B Noirs early in his career to the cop thrillers later in the 70s. Resulting in competently realized films on the surface, but deeply human character reflections of the blurred lines of good and evil present in their sublime interior.
Compulsion being one of his easy landmarks made at the height of his craft, but more specially for being a recognizable twin cousin film of Hitchcock’s Rope. Though far apart of huge laps of nothing to do with each other, but while Rope got Inspired by the 1929 play of the same name by Patrick Hamilton, and Compulsion adapts directly from the novel of the same name from Meyer Levin; both inspired by the real-life murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks in 1924 by University of Chicago students Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb – here named as Artie Strauss (Bradford Dillman) and Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell). Tackling the sickening story of two deranged minds who sought to achieve “the perfect crime” as a demonstration of their ostensible intellectual superiority, and pay the price for it.
But as this won’t going to be a text that will be based only on the comparison between both films (though Compulsion is arguably better…), and how immensely different they actually are. Hitchcock’s is a theatrical suspense dark comedy thriller, while Fleischer film is much more a straight Dostoevskian Noir, using the plot at hand to directly explore the dark side of human psyche, just by following the up close perspective of the two protagonists and their deranged minds point of view. Leading close with the villains of their own film it might have been a dream coming true, as the favorite kind of protagonist of Fleischer were always the morally shady ones. Richard Murphy fantastic script provides him just that by not holding back at all at portraying the behavior of both characters, and their so well behaved sadism directly in the audience’s faces.
Exploring every inch of their personalities and ideals that led them to the ideas that drives them and the later actions they commit with extreme narrative precision. And much like Rope it messes with the Nietzsche's superman theory, though much more directly and put at plain sight here, as the characters themselves describe themselves as “perfect beings”, exempt from any feelings considered ""minor"" such as greed, lust, hunger for power. And by putting that nature into subtle analytical questioning, the movie also goes to explore the roles of culpability and evil itself within the human mind and nature of act through the roles of the considered psychotic, the “villains”, and later, the nature of the punishment they must endure.
But, for being a clear Noir film, the Freudian reading that can be made here is pretty stronger. If both characters say to stand above everything and everyone for their actions not deserving of punishment, the same behavior, and nature, comes from inner desire (in this case, clearly homosexual) resented and left to be implied between both Artie and Judd, as the primary motivational energy of the what we can classify as the psychopath that they both share. Animals that are endowed with imperfect reason and influenced by their desires and feelings that repress because they think they are better than that, for their wealth, status, but mainly ""intelectual superiority"", but only embracing a real sense of cruelty.
Though while one faces it almost obliviously like Artie, Judd is the one who slowly breaks in guilt even if tries to repress behind an untamed furious bitter ego. But their own motivations comes to show the blind hypocrisy of their life philosophy for how much they are lead purely by the same emotions they refute. While Artie is portrayed as a pampered looking for attention among his fellow students and his own parents for the things he does and the knowledge of the said things, before he gets caught, while Judd is the weirdo loner easily influenced by Artie’s idea of emotional and psychological superiority to everything and everyone, but in a self-crisis for the little remnant of humanity still within him.
Splitting the film between this more psychoanalytic first half than the final, and surprisingly, humanistic send off, exactly when Orson Welles shows up and literally sucks the whole movie for him. If the first half was Judd and Artie’s Noir of escaping persecution the culpability of their horrendous crime, Welles segment as Jonathan Wilk, the lawyer of the two is not one of an anti-hero looking to prove their innocence, rather how to pledge their guilt but try to save their lives from the death penalty. And after treading a path that seems imminent and doomed to failure and mortal punishment for the two young people, it is when the human spirit within the figure so unpredictable and fat, sadden depress decrepit of the character of Welles that reveals a bigger heart than everyone who watches it.
Ending his defense in a shout for life, against death, because more hatred will not extinguish the hatred the cause the atrocities that they committed or solve none of the world. If the same cruelty, or lack of the very feelings they despise in their lives created who they are and caused the death of the innocent boy, the more lack blind of it in the decision of their faith will solve nothing but leave this case exactly how evil survives it, by seen as simple nothing. In what is easily one of the most powerful speeches in cinematic history that hits the characters hard just as the audience, for those willing and open to really grasp what he’s saying.
Maybe the semi-“altruistic” (and quite reflexive) send off that the film leaves may prevent it for being classified of how could’ve easily had been one of Joseph Losey’s late Noir dramas, visually walking in the same veins as films like The Criminal. With William C. Mellor’s stellar cinematography shares some similar textures with the outcasted poor devil director, as for the story that carries an tangible audacity that both directors could easily be seen sharing. Much of it though may have to do how this was early envisioned to be directed by Welles himself, before he lost the reigns over Fleischer because of Touch of Evil’s flop at the box office in the prior year saw to that.
Still, he guarantees a role here and completely knocks off one of his most memorable and strongest performances ever. And though completely stealing the film for himself in the later half, Stockwell and Dillman segment are equally superbly strong, take in the performance layer, specially Stockwell who goes from blind cruelty to immensely repressed guilt, and unnerving unpredictability that he ranges between with brilliant tenacity. As for Fleischer actually making, even if the slightest microsome, sympathize with both personas, as hope for the non-lethal punishment set for they to endure, and maybe bring some slight trace of good out of it.
Hard to chew on in many stances, but brilliantly achieved by a director in control of every department that gets its shine on the screen, and from the camera, to the actors, he lets and puts to life the most important thing to lay the movie to have strong punch of remarkability: the strong complex hard and story it packs and delivers in a unique experience to sit through. I say this a lot but the hell with it, this is a criminally underrated must-once in a lifetime-watch!",5.0
"Without knowing, when I started Richard Fleischer's 10 Rillington Place earlier this year, I embarked on watching the directors portraits of murder in reverse. Starting with his most explicit in both murder and character portrait and then working my way back through his brushes with the censors. I think it'd be quite compelling and fascinating to go sequentially, while reading up on all the MPAA changes, from Compulsion to The Boston Strangler to 10 Rillington Place and how he grew to show more but also be a little disgusted by how much he could show; law enforcement/the courtroom wasn't needed anymore by the time he got to Rillington, just the facts played out as they were in front of an audience.
10 was my first Fleischer film and as such I didn't know that this was something that I'd end up doing by the end of the year. If you've not seen any of these movies, I'd highly suggest watching them sequentially. They all concern true crime cases and it's pretty fascinating how each decade shows a loosening of morals and codes when it came to cinematic storytelling. Now even though the characters have different names, Compulsion concerns the famous Leopold and Loeb case that shocked the nation: two bright college educated boys killed a boy together to prove that they understood that emotions are meaningless, reckless, and constrain the true human condition. They also might have been in love with each other. They were famously spared the death penalty due to a fancy argument by their famous ""Atheist"" lawyer, one Clarence Darrow, who was known for the Scopes Monkey Trial (which took on teaching Creationism in schools under Tennessee law).
Compulsion was released one year prior to Psycho and thus the murder takes place off screen (again, part of the reason a trilogy viewing in order would be best). Fleischer instead has two halves of a film that involve a thesis. The first is the young life thesis of the killers (baby Dean Stockwell! and Bradford Dillman) and the second is the anti-capital punishment thesis of their lawyer (Orson Welles); that thesis is that lawyers who try to get the death penalty qualifies as State-sponsored premeditated murder that's similar in passion to the actual premeditated murder in question. Thus, two wrongs don't make a right—a life sentence is more just than a government sanctioning murder in response to murder.
Stockwell and Dillman are magnificent as the sociopathic killers, Dillman being the leader and Stockwell, turned on by theoretical thought, follows with his mind but struggles with his body in carrying out what's ordered of him. And Welles shows up to do his Welles thing at the time, meander through a courtroom for one massive scene, looking and sounding like a bulldog who's been in too many fights to count, but knows that a draw is frequently the best outcome. (Welles did the role for a paycheck that was immediately seized by the IRS for back taxes and it's one of those classic he-was-hell-to-work-with-but-he-got-it-done-and-added-importance-to-the-whole-proceeding roles).
It's a handsomely made old fashioned shocker before Hitchcock came in and ripped the side door off of all cinematic expectations and decency. Now where Fleischer went after Hitchcock was much further than the Master of Suspense ever went himself. It's as though Fleischer himself had the compulsion to explore the mind of serial killers. With his first two such films he was protected by a rating system that made him invent workarounds on the worst bits and then he finally ended up making the first true portrait of a serial killer. After scratching that itch perhaps a little too hard, Fleischer just made popcorn movies for Schwarzenegger and Heston. So far this trilogy plus Fantastic Voyage has been all I've seen from the journeyman director, but I've been impressed by all of them and I look forward to seeing more. And maybe perhaps revisiting these three films in proper order again as I'm a junkie for movie censorship rules, regulations, and shifts in societal mores astride them.",3.5
"I still prefer ""Rope"", but this other classic film take on Leopold and Loeb, ""Compulsion"", is compulsively watchable thanks to sociopathic Dean Stockwell, operating-from-a-different-planet-altogether Orson Welles, and some stimulating suggestions about moral relativism. Bradford Dillman (as Stockwell's partner in crime/hinted-at gay lover) and E.G. Marshall as the prosecuting attorney deserve mention too. As a forensic study of how the investigators closed in on these boys, this is pretty involving; unfortunately as a psychological examination of unrepentant homicidal intellectuals, it doesn't delve deep enough, and as the courtroom drama it chooses to become in its third act that I was expecting to be the highlight of the whole show, it seems to steer wildly off-topic into a laughable soapbox tirade about capital punishment.
Seriously, this movie ends with Orson Welles delivering a summation speech that goes on for nearly 15 straight minutes, uninterrupted. Apparently in the actual case, Clarence Darrow went on for 12 goddamn hours! So I guess we movie viewers got off easy. What judge would tolerate that?? Since when is wearing down everyone's patience through filibuster a credible tactic in court? The facts makes you respect our judicial system even less. Anyway, Orson's performance is impressive but the writing overwrought to the extreme, and doesn't seem to possess a second layer of self-awareness about how ridiculous a strategy this is. It could be a parody of closing arguments. He's making what sounds like the most important plea for mercy in human history, but it's in service of these two perfectly unsympathetic fuck-face goons who killed a person just to see if they were clever enough to get away with it, aka two people who by no measure deserve leniency (if the movie had to end on a gratuitously long monologue, I would've been more interested to hear a psychiatrist's analysis of human nature as it pertains to these men), and yes it would be audaciously chilling if this was intended to show how a smart enough lawyer can score even the devil himself a good bargain, like how warped justice can be, or even an ironically empty grand gesture considering double life sentences could be construed as equally cruel as hanging them would be (it's debatable, at least), but it's pretty clear that the movie supports his anti-death penalty thesis and considers life in prison to be the humane option. Ooookay.
But however you feel about that particular issue, it just comes out of nowhere after 2/3rds of a movie that was dealing with other matters entirely (unless the facile point is to show that while these 2 men don't value human life, our courtrooms do! Give me a break), and it's treated with all the elegance of the original ending the studio vetoed, in which Orson Welles bursts into court and opens fire with a machine gun, then furiously jerks off onto the judge's corpse while the camera irises in on his other hand saluting the American flag. I may be remembering some aspect of that wrong, don't fact check me.",3.0
"Phenomenal for the first 3/4 or so and impressively dark for the 50s. The two degenerate teenagers are portrayed convincingly--one of them by Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet, To Live and Die in L.A.) It did lose me a bit in the final act when Orson Welles shows up and literally takes over proceedings. It also got a little too preachy imo but still gets 4 stars for the greatness that came before.",4.0

"Part of my 5 Directors x 5 Unseen Films (15) challenge.
Adapted from Meyer Levin's 1956 fictionalized account of the 1924 Leopold & Loeb murder case, this film from director Richard Fleischer was promoted as the cinematic portrayal of ""the crime of the century."" It features Dean Stockwell as grad student Judd Steiner, the thinly disguised persona of former child prodigy Nathan Leopold, who was said to have an I.Q. of 210, and Bradford Dillman as Artie Strauss, based upon the exceptionally intelligent but lazy and unmotivated Richard Loeb, the University of Michigan's youngest graduate at age 17.
The story opens in Chicago in 1924 with Steiner and Strauss burglarizing Artie's Sigma Chi Epsilon Fraternity house for $67 and a secondhand typewriter. As they make their escape by car, it becomes clear that Strauss is the leader of the two. He orders Steiner to run over a drunk in the middle of the road, but Judd misses him and later explains he wants to do something criminal, but smart -- something dangerous and meticulously planned, not a meaningless hit and run. Artie, by contrast, just wants to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and for Judd to obey him.
Judd's older brother Max (Richard Anderson) tries to get him to steer clear of Strauss, but that only infuriates the precocious sibling. At school, we met some of the guys' other acquaintances such as law student Sid Books (Martin Milner) and his girlfriend Ruth Evans (Diane Varsi). Steiner seems to get a high from baiting his professors, while Strauss is happiest being the center of attention among undergrads. Both are the sons of millionaires and believe they exist above the rules of schools and common society.
Brooks works evenings for the local newspaper with a reporter named Tom Daly (Edward Binns). In the course of running down some leads, he discovers that a young boy who presumably drowned was actually a kidnap victim, Paulie Kessler, hit over the head and killed with a blunt instrument. When Artie and his entourage hear of their friend's role in breaking the story, they want to celebrate. But when Sid confides that a pair of glasses were found near the body that didn't belong to the victim, Strauss gets enraged and Steiner starts looking worried. Guess who lost his glasses?
Just for the fun of it, Artie befriends Police Lieutenant Johnson (Robert F Simon) and feeds him information to misdirect the investigation to deadends. Judd comes up with a alibi for losing his glasses and being with some girls they picked up the evening of the murder. But it all starts to unravel as clues crop up and lies are revealed. It's just a mater of time till the ""perfect crime"" becomes the ""perfect mess.""
While watching this, it's impossible not think of Hitchcock's ""Rope"" (1948), which also has roots in the Leopold-Loeb murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks -- two super-smart, wealthy college students trying to pull off the ""perfect crime."" But this version goes far beyond two brainy kids and a caper to focus on the trial, with Orson Welles playing a Clarence Darrow-like character, defense attorney Jonathan Wilk, and E. G. Marshall as District Attorney Harold Horn, modeled after the real-life prosecutor Robert Emmett Crowe.
This was long before the Miranda Act (1966), of course, and the confessions and evidence obtained by the State would never be allowed in court nowadays. Nevertheless, we get a glimpse of what justice might have been like in the early 20th century. It's a case study in the nuances of the ""insanity defense"" and the pros/cons of capital punishment. For those who like trial movies, this is certainly a must-see.
At BAFTA, the film was nominated as the Best Film from Any Source, while at Cannes it got a Palme d'Or nomination and won the Best Actor category for Stockwell, Dillman and Welles collectively. Welles is such a dominating presence on screen that he commands every scene he is in. His final line here is a keeper, so hang on to your seat and expect to be dazzled.",4.0

I’ve never seen this Orson Welles performance so I was glad this film showed up on my ’59 marathon list. He doesn’t disappoint. It’s even better when you learn that behind the scenes he was bitter about not being allowed to direct and the IRS was garnering his wages from this project. He eventually fled the looping session and the country leaving the director to have to stitch together bits of his speech using out-takes and other audio tracks.

Seriously though the opening title card drop as Bradford Dillman throws his head back in carefree villainous laughter after explaining that he almost just hit a man with his car because he “damn well wanted to!” I don’t think Anthony Perkins could’ve played this role but I stand firm in my belief that Bradford Dillman is like if Anthony Perkins got more protein and had the energy to be really full-body sinister and weird.

"The first half of this movie is so dark, gay and horny. Absolutely digging it. Really this has it all over Rope in that department. The sexual compulsion that defines the relationship between these two men is made very clear.
Unfortunately they wussed out on showing the murder and wussed out on dragging Judd's need to be ordered around into the courtroom via Ruth. Would have pepped up the second half considerably, which is valiant but talky.

"The mysteries beyond nihilism. A moral diptych: the first hour is a psychological thriller concentrated in two psychopathic children obsessed with reason and the suppression of emotion, and the second a moral speech on the value of life, exposing the intrinsic emotional aspects of reason that were previously ignored in the film’s rhetoric, masterfully delivered by Welles’ imposing presence. Reminded me a bit of Damasio’s ‘O Erro de Descartes’. Fleischer’s entire career was concerned with the examination of evil, and this investigation might find in this film’s one of its most daring statements. I wish the second part of the film was a little less rushed, but this is gripping from beginning to end, and that brief final confrontation between Welles and Stockwell is phenomenal.",3.5
"Compulsion is an unusual film, and not at all what I expected. Not that I even knew what to expect, but for some reason I thought this was a crime thriller that might cross over into the horror genre a bit. I misunderstood on that count.... nothing of the kind there.
But this is a neatly packaged account of an actual criminal case, probably repainted somewhat with artistic licence, but still rather compelling. It's the story of two rich young law-school students who are on trial for murder. We the viewers are complicit... we know what's going on... but the real trick comes over halfway through the picture when Mr. Orson Welles, attorney, takes on the defendants and delivers the usual impassioned Hollywood courtroom speech.
Director Richard Fleischer, responsible for dozens of notable films over the decades, handles this story with some shifty moves. He creates scenes that sometimes feel too obvious, but there is often an element of uncertainty chewing at the viewer's confidence in what he or she is seeing or hearing. A young Dean Stockwell plays the more unbalanced of the accused pair, assuming a rather sociopathic identity and playing it to the hilt... entertaining, but sometimes a bit much.
Fleischer sort of pre-dates Hitchcock's Psycho here, with some taxidermy and the innocent-looking nut-job. Initially I wondered about that - and wondered what year this film came out - but I was surprised to see this was released a year before the Hitch classic.
An interesting movie that keeps you guessing. Welles has done better, but he does tend to dominate any scene he's in, regardless of how well he delivers. Some fun.",3.0
"(7.6/10)
Right, wrong, and something in between. Similar to Fritz Lang's M, Compulsion also tested my moral compass of good and evil and grey, especially when it comes to terms of criticizing the death penalty sentence that in all sense is rather pointless and more vengeance than justice.
Compulsion stars a contemptible crime committed by two mentally ill rich college boys, in which one is a paranoiac and the other one is schizophrenic. Maybe it's easy to despise the acts…",3.5

"For a movie I was expecting Orson Welles to star in, you can imagine my disappointment with him making his first appearance an hour and seven minutes into the film 🥴 he showed up in the last third of the movie. 
But besides that, Compulsion was still entertaining enough. I thought the two young men gave good performances, especially the actor for Artie. The movie has similar vibes to Rope (1948), which I liked. I also liked watching the process of the lying on the defendants’ part and the detective work on the prosecutor’s end. It’s not a story of finding out if they’re guilty or not; we all know they’re hecka guilty. It’s really about the verdict and how Orson Welles will defend them. 
I appreciated seeing some 12 Angry Men veterans (Juror #4 and #6) and some pre-Twilight Zone stars. When Orson Welles did come into the movie, I thought he was memorable. His eye makeup was awful, but he did a great job in his speech to the judge. Compulsion is a good movie, but it feels like it’s missing that one big thing to make it great. And I don’t know if it could’ve had more suspense? More uncertainty? Better supporting performers? More Orson Welles? Regardless, it is a good movie. But shy of being great.

P.S. yes, I’m still doing the Bogdanovich Challenge 😂 I’m just about a month behind. Bogdanovich suggested I watch Magnificent Ambersons for one of the weeks, and seeing as how I’ve seen all his directed films, and didn’t feel like rewatching any, I just chose a different with him in it.

"""Compulsion"" is elevated by the commanding presence of Orson Welles. He delivers a standout performance, with the film wisely building anticipation prior to his dramatic entrance (the Welles speciality), that showcases his trademark panache. Welles's restraint in this role is a surprise that showcases his versatility as a performer. Dean Stockwell also shines as the cocky, unlikable delinquent, but it is Welles who truly steals the show, even though it takes an hour for him to enter stage left.",3.5
"En Corto/In Summary
I came to know Dean Stockwell's work in the last stage of his life. ""Paris, Texas,"" ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Quantum Leap""....
I came across Compulsion (1959) on streaming, and if you add Orson Welles, I'm willing material.
In his 20s he projected a great intensity of emotion on screen, screaming the homosexual subtext that the script could not express.
The desire for acceptance, for validation that Judd (Stockwell) deposits in Arthur (Bradford Dillman) brings him to the point where when he threatens to rape Ruth (Diane Varsi), it is no longer clear whether the anguish and desperation is for seeing himself about to become a rapist, or for the possibility of intercourse with a woman.
His on-screen emotionality may sometimes be too much, but in addition to his youth, he comes from having played the same role in the theater, and there even the viewer in the back row should be able to see and feel what the character is going through.
Welles has a role relatively brief in length, but oily in its alcoholism, and brimming with intelligence and wit. The director, Richard Fleitcher, had a handle on close up, slight angle changes on the horizon, and other editing tricks, which ensure that the audience feels more and more involved in the action and the characters. All of this he would put to use in many later genre films, such as ""Soylent Green"", ""Tora, tora, tora"", ""Conan the Destroyer"", and ""Fantastic Voyage"".
Definitely a worthwhile find.
En Corto/In Summary
Yo conocí el trabajo de Dean Stockwell en la última etapa de su vida. “Paris, Texas”, “Blue Velvet”, “Quantum Leap”…
Me encontré Compulsion (1959) en streaming, y si le agregamos a Orson Welles, yo soy materia dispuesta.
A sus 20 años proyectaba una gran intensidad de emoción en pantalla, gritando el subtexto homosexual que el guión no podía expresar.
El deseo de aceptación, de validación que Judd (Stockwell) deposita en Arthur (Bradford Dillman) lo lleva al punto en que cuando amenaza con violar a Ruth (Diane Varsi), ya no se sabe si la angustia y desesperación es por verse a punto de convertirse en violador, o por la posibilidad del coito con una mujer.
Puede que de repente sea demasiada su emotividad en pantalla, pero además de su juventud, viene de haber hecho el mismo papel en teatro, y ahí hasta el espectador en la última fila debe ser capaz de ver y sentir lo que sufre el personaje.
Welles tiene un papel relativamente breve en tiempo, pero aceitoso en su alcoholismo, y rebosante de inteligencia e ingenio. El director, Richard Fleitcher, tenía un manejo de close up, ligeros cambios de ángulo en el horizonte, y otros trucos de edición, que aseguran que el público se sienta cada vez más involucrado en la acción y los personajes. Todo esto lo pondría en uso en muchas películas de género posteriores, como “Soylent Green”, “Tora, tora, tora”, “Conan the Destroyer”, y “Fantastic Voyage”.
Valió mucho la pena el hallazgo.",4.0
"An excellent courtroom drama that works magnificently as a Social Problem film while perhaps falling a bit flat as a psychological thriller. Dean Stockwell really is just exceptional here, pretentious and terrifying while garnering an astounding amount of empathy for a literal child murderer. Stockwell owns the first half of the film and really elevates his performance above the somewhat obvious story. Despite this great performance, it’s Orson Welles appearance in the second half of the film that walks away as the real MVP with a jaw dropping final monologue that simply couldn’t be better. Absolutely love the ending here, makes for a far more complex conclusion than I expected

"A dramatization of the Leopold and Loeb murder in Chicago in 1924. Perfect example of why rich white boys reading Nietzsche are the worst.
The cinematography is gorgeous black and white paired with realistic looking studio locations. The opening sequence features the best shots in the film--a car sliding around a road in darkness. Only the headlights shine and the small reflection on the pavement. It weaves to and fro--manic and untethered to law like the two men in the car. It's only rival is a transition focused on a pair of glasses--the most important item in the film. As the shot switches from light to dark--day to night--the reflection of an interrogation ills the glass in the frames. Aside from these two moments the cinematography altogether is the best aspect of the film. Even in the simple moments the frame takes on a slight dutch angle--nothing too dramatic but enough to make the audience feel unsettled.
It's storytelling is very intense and at the same time too talkie. the script litters into too much exposition and too many ""true crime"" facts of the real murder. The two--almost identical--leads Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as Judd Steiner and Arthur ""Artie"" Straus respectively play off each other well. Dean plays Judd's tortured nature and slightly obsessive homosexuality to an extent it was likely unseen at that time. Still it felt more gimmicky and inconsistent especially in contrast to Dillman's charming, sociopathic decisiveness.
The film can be a bit silly and contrived at times. It features subplots that are, for lack of a better word, daring for the time--like the attempted rape of Ruth by Judd. The scene's depiction is more revlutionary as I don't recall seeing many attempted rapes or rapes discussed so plainly in a film from this time. The actual function of the scene is a little cringe-worthy. It is used for Judd tp prove his sociopathy matches Artie's. Spoilers.... it doesn't. As Sid says, ""I don't understand you, Ruth. He tries to rape you and you defend him."" Me too, Sid. Me too.
It is my understanding that Hitchcock's Rope is gayer and about the same thing so my completely biased and uninformed opinion is that that one is probably better.",3.0
"Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman play smart, rich and bored college students looking for thrills.
Thinking themselves too smart they kidnap and kill a local kid, but a clues eventually lead detectives back to the two. Slight mistakes and thinking themselves too smart for the police the guys find themselves being tricked into confessing.
The film time period is the 20's.
E.G. Marshall plays the DA who is looking to lynch the guys. But the parents of the guys call in the ace defense attorney played brilliantly by Orson Welles.
Look for Richard Anderson of the Six-MIllion Dollar man fame in this one.
There are some great camera shots in this, I especially like the scene where the glasses are the central figure and the guys show up in the lens.
A fantastic twist by Welles changes the defendants verdicts from not guilty to guilty hoping to get the guys sentences reduced from the death penalty to life since there was no possible way the guys where getting off due to their confessions.
This movie features a 15-minute oration by Welles selling the judge on why his clients should be spared life as opposed to the death penalty.

"Clearly inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case of 1924, Richard Fleischer's Compulsion is further heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film, Rope. Bradford Dillman gives a performance similar to that of John Dall, and Dean Stockwell of Farley Granger.
However, while these are clear similarities, the reaction and outlook of Orson Welles' lawyer in Compulsion, and Jimmy Stewart's professor in Rope, to that of the crime committed in both films, could not be further apart.
Seeing how two people from positions of authority react, to the most part, to the same crime in such contrasting ways makes for interesting viewing.",3.5
"Watching a Leopold and Loeb movie from 1959 is weird, because the censors wouldn’t allow so much of the facts of the case. Especially the homosexual aspect. Obviously they had to change a lot, and they did. But the gay subtext was unmistakable. Especially Dean Stockwell’s performance. 
“There’s no such thing as sadness. Only the reality of things happening.”

"""Compulsion"" is a serviceable old-fashioned courtroom drama, worthy of neither accolades nor scorn. It's inferior to a spate of classic films in the genre that came out around the same time: ""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" ""12 Angry Men."" Inferior in all ways but one - Dean Stockwell's amazing performance. Everything about him as an accused murderer with an intellectual superiority and emotional inferiority complexes is completely believable and fascinating. The gestures, the speech pattern, the movement are all aligned perfectly - even when he's in a frame's background. Rich with multiple subtexts, this is acting at its finest and, with two additional small nods to Orson Welles and E.G. Marshall's fine character roles, is the only reason to seek out ""Compulsion.""

"The case of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, two wealthy (and, it is said, gay) university students who murdered a 14-year-old just to see if they could, provided the inspiration for two important and widely divergent works of cinema: Alfred Hitchcock’s 1948 film adaptation of the stage play 'Rope,' and Tom Kalin’s 1992 New Queer Cinema touchstone 'Swoon.' Between them came this 1959 drama from director Richard Fleischer ('The Boston Strangler,' 'Soylent Green'), which doesn’t have 'Rope'’s technical wizardry or 'Swoon'’s explicitness (though there’s juicy subtext in lines like “You said you could take orders! You said you wanted me to command you!”), but is a gripping thriller nonetheless. Fleischer keeps his camera in uncomfortable proximity to his killers (played by Bradford Dillman and a very young Dean Stockwell), waiting for them to get caught, and knowing they’ll probably crumble when they do. Some of the supporting performances are a little stiff – or maybe they just pale next to Orson Welles, who doesn’t appear until 68 minutes in but unquestionably earns his top billing. 'Compulsion' capitalizes on his wonderful way of being both natural and theatrical; he has a stylized way of letting you see him thinking, particularly in his lengthy, masterful, climactic courtroom speech, which is equal parts searching oratory and calculated performance.",4.0
"Chicago, 1924. Thievery by two students with higher ambitions. Murder. The perfect crime. Why? Because they think they can. Because they feel like doing it. Fleischer's take on the Leopold and Loeb case is a film with different faces. The first hour consists of a police investigation on the one hand and a look into the warped psyche of the two murderers on the other. Cocky bastards coming from wealthy families, talking Nietzsche. Übermenschen, intellectual superiority, but they underestimate bad luck and the District Attorney. Well acted by both the boys and E.G. Marshall as the D.A. Quite fascinating and rather disturbing as well with these rich kids and their motive. It makes you wonder what Fleischer has in store for the third act. It's Orson Welles. Mountain of a man with a phenomenal screen presence. Every word he utters has gravity. His closing argument is, granted, way too long, but also spellbinding. I couldn't agree with him more.",3.5

"Kino Blu-ray
Fantastic crime film told in two parts, first is the character introduction and aftermath of the crime and the second is the court room scenes. It sort of feels like a Columbo episode, in that the audience knows who did it and what happened but it is figuring out how they will get caught. And then thinking about what the punishment is going to be, or what it should be.
Orson Welles just shows what a fantastic screen presence he is, because he doesn't show up for the first hour of the film, but when he finally makes it he owns the whole thing. All of the major players are memorable, each one playing a distinct role in the story. It is based on a true story, one that was the plot of Hitchcock's Rope and a couple movies later after this one too.
The story was only able to hint at things, its actually pretty amazing how the very next year we have Peeping Tom and Psycho and then a few years after that get In Cold Blood. They all delved deeper into the mind of the criminal, slowly getting to show more and more perverse things.
Of course once New Hollywood and modern cinema happened you can basically show and do anything that you want, so it does feel dated in that sense in how much they had to dance around the subject.

For quite a while in my life I've watched nothing but gems of the 20th century, black and white films, the ones that only one can imagine of witnessing on the big screen back then, among the film buffs, those whose souls are seeking nothing but art.
I came across this hell of a film randomly and the reason why I watched it at first is because it's starring one of my all time favorite actors Orson Welles not to mention that all the actors were perfectly on point and delivered great performances.
Welles' portrayal of Wilk is both charismatic and morally complex. He brings an air of sophistication and manipulation to the character, making Wilk a formidable adversary in the courtroom scenes. His performance adds depth to the film's exploration of the ethics of the legal system and the motivations of the characters involved.
""Compulsion"" examines how individuals who appear outwardly intelligent and successful can still commit heinous acts. It questions the notion of evil hiding behind a facade of sophistication and privilege.
The most explicit representation of death in the film is the murder committed by Judd Steiner and Artie Strauss. The film depicts this act in a chilling and cold-blooded manner, emphasizing the brutality of the crime and its impact on the victim's family and the community. The murder itself serves as a central plot point and a catalyst for the rest of the story. Death is also symbolically represented through the legal proceedings that follow the murder. The trial is a key element of the film, where the characters must confront the possibility of the death penalty. The courtroom becomes a battleground where the question of life and death is debated.
Your Honor, I can only think now of taking these two boys, 18 and 19, penning them in a cell. Checking off the days and hours and minutes, until their wakened in the gray of the morning and led to the scaffold, their feet tied, black caps drawn over their heads, stood on a trap, the hangman pressing the spring. I can see them fall through a space. I can see them - stopped by the rope around their necks. It would be done, of course, in the name of justice. Justice. Who knows what it is? Do I know? Does Your Honor know? Can Your Honor tell me what I deserve? Can Your Honor appraise yourself and say what you deserve? Do you think you can cure the hatreds and maladjustments of the world by hanging them?",5.0
"When I first saw Compulsion it scored a perfect five. It would be nice to award it that again, but I find myself unable.
Don't get me wrong, Compulsion is still a fantastic film and it would be an insult to rate it lower than a four. For the first three quarters of the runtime, Compulsion is immensely engrossing. The mindset of the killers, what drove them to kill and why is set up nicely and watching them try to stay ahead of everybody else all the while thriving on the how they're able to decieve and manipulate is always fascinating.
It's clear Richard Fleischer was against the death penalty. To the best of my knowledge, he explored the topic twice. In this and in another true crime classic, '10 Rillington Place'. I find the latter to be much more nuanced in execution. He is still very much anti-death pentalty in that film showing how mistakes can be made and innocent people can be taken along with them. However, he pushes the viewer, showing us how vile of a person Christie is. The grotesque things he would do and the way he would cause people to suffer. All the while causing the viewer to understand why somebody might be in favour of such a punishment. It felt like a far better realised effort in regards to its message. No matter how vile a person may be, somebody like Timothy Evans could walk into a trap and lose their life too. If that film is in favour of abolishing such a punishment, it makes an effort to understand the other side of the argument.
Compulsion rejects this for the last quarter of the film. Fleischers stance on the topic of capital punishment takes priority and the film stops while Orson Welles delivered a passionate speech on why such a punishment is wrong and it goes on for what must have been ten minutes give or take. All the while, you can't help but think, why these boys? For a speech such as this to be made, why for these two individuals? The focus suddenly shifts and all of what follows is just jarring to say the least.
The actual final moments are quite nice but everything in the courtroom in that final quarter just brings what is a great film until then down by just a bit. The boys weren't worth the speech and the theme explored was just rushed and one sided.
I don't want this to sound so negative because Compulsion is still a very strong film for the vast majority of the runtime and I still recommend it and always will. Performances are amazing, characters are strongly written and it looks amazing too. I would've preferred to watch these smarmy bastards hang.",4.0
"Un remake non ufficiale di ""Rope"". Ma rispetto al capolavoro di Hitchcock, Fleischer non sottende nessun rapporto omosessuale tra i due psicopatici, e soprattutto si impervia su una strada decisamente più cronachistica che fa distaccare ""Compulsion"" rispetto all'originale, ma che allo stesso tempo gli dona un'eleganza ancora più malsana, che permette al regista di riflettere sulla sottile linea che passa tra la follia e la sanità mentale e tra la giustizia e il crimine, di conseguenza. In alcuni punti ci sono anche già gli echi del cinema di Brooks (perlomeno visivamente, con uno sguardo soprattutto al futuro ""In Cold Blood""), ma soprattutto il regista crea suspense continua tramite movimenti per nulla scontati e anche avanguardisti (tra inquadrature angolari, zoom su dettagli incredibili come nella scena degli occhiali e decadrage molto particolari) della macchina da presa, forse un po' smontata da una parte finale leggermente troppo didattica.",4.0
Shut up Orson I’m trying to look at Dean Stockwell,4.0
"scavenger hunt 91: a movie that takes place in a major city (Chicago).
Dean Stockwell's waist was snatched!!
despite losing a lot of steam once the court scenes came around, this was a well made movie with great performances. I thought it handled the subjects respectfully and never painted the main characters as 100% right or wrong either way.
I've noticed in almost every older movie with a court scene, there's always a part where everyone laughs at something that is said and I feel like that never happens in real life and it's very weird? why was that a thing??
anyway, I wanted to like this more than I did, but it was still worth watching. the first half was probably four stars but I just starting to check out around the 3/4 mark. Orson Welles hasn't impressed me as an actor in the films I've seen and I would have rather seen someone else play his role.
also it was super gay and they implied that several times and I have to give the movie props for that. the movie was definitely best when Judd and Artie or Judd and Ruth were interacting, lots of interesting subjects at play in those scenes. I kind of wished they'd shown the actual murder but maybe since it involved a child, the code didn't allow them to. either way, the movie was unfortunately anticlimactic.
I'd still recommend though, if only for Dean Stockwell's performance and the great cinematography. I haven't seen Rope but it might be an interesting follow-up.",3.0
"The darting headlights of the opening sequence - wow what a motif! The camera just seems so intelligent in this, I love the framing and the preciseness of it. The first half is near-perfection for me. The killers and their conceit - it's so provocative still, and all the characters throughout the film so beautifully drawn.
Then Orson Welles stumbles in mumbling a star turn, and the focus seems to change to tub-thumping liberalism in a courtroom drama almost as a non-sequitur to the character studies. Great zinger at the end though.",4.0
"Blessed with an astonishingly crisp new 4K transfer, this exploration of the Leopold & Loeb murder case is graced with sterling performances all around and a heightened, almost screwball energy that marks it in stark contrast to the bulk of its contemporaries.
And then Orson Welles shows up and just lays waste. God what an absolute titan of the screen.
It's almost unfathomable to watch this and realize he'd be showing up in some of the schlockiest garbage imaginable just for a quick paycheck by the end of the next decade. On the heels of Touch of Evil - and I know that that film was bungled by the studio, but even so - he must have seemed unstoppable at this point in his career.",4.0
"Loooooooooooooool okay okay okay, I'm sitting here thinking whom ever is responsible for Compulsion must have been really into Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. Then I came to my senses and googled it; both films are based on the real life story of 2 smart asses who think they can do anything because they're rich.
The tone changes a few times, and I was thrown by the title card music which made me feel like I was about to watch a swinging Beach Blanket Bingo movie, but thankfully what we get in Compulsion is half teen drama and half courtroom speech.
Which brings me to my closing statement: If you enjoy 1950's master/slave relationships and Orson Welles being the baddest bitch in the room, Compulsion comes highly recommended.",3.5

"Another take on the Leopold and Loeb story. It's more dynamic and engaging than Rope, opening with what amounts to an action sequence, and barreling onward until it hits the third act. Then, in the courtroom, things become slower and more stately, as Orson Welles, with his big rubber hooter, makes the case for letting the murderers live.

En un momento dado, eché de menos un registro más psicópata de Bradford Dillman.
Las disquisiciones psiquiátricas expertas en torno a la esquizofrenia y la paranoia son una patochada.
Pero lo peor es el alegato de la defensa. Suscribo todas las ideas contra la pena de muerte vertidas en la película, y yo no habría conseguido expresarlas mejor, pero su exposición ante el juez tiene el aspecto de pegote artificioso, y la reacción de sus oyentes en un estado con pena de muerte, resulta inverosímil. Y con la frase final del abogado defensor a uno de los acusados, por un momento no he sabido si seguíamos estando en un palacio de justicia o en una iglesia.
Por lo que he leído, es una atropellada adaptación de la novela basada en hechos reales de Meyer Levin, a quien no se hace justicia.",3.0

"SOBRE RICHARD FLEISCHER, por José Oliveira.
Uns óculos caídos sem explicação na cena do crime. São eles que vão fazer vacilar o crime perfeito. São eles que tudo ensombrarão no último fôlego de uma longa caminhada sobre um abismo de nada. E Deus. E Orson Welles, possuindo um advogado sem escrúpulos e sem piedade e se calhar sem sangue, que é o mais violento ser deste pós-apocalíptico circo, vai fechar o vórtice desenhado por Richard Fleischer em Estranha compulsão, de uma forma e com uma lábia que é inútil traduzir em palavras que diminuam a sua expressão e jogo de cintura. Pode-se dizer que a pressão que mete em quem o escuta, ao dizer que o mal não vai matar o mal, que o poder não se pode comportar como as bestas que praticaram o ato inominável em causa, bestas defendidas por ele, ou, talvez o cúmulo, que levá-los à forca seria regredir brutalmente na concepção e busca de uma humanidade melhor. Discurso, ética e estética que está ao nível do que Chaplin fez em O grande ditador (The Great Dictator, 1940) e que será o apogeu do Welles ator e do Welles encenador, medonha caveira carcomida a insônias.
Super-homem, Nietzsche, indiferença emocional, gelo, desprezo, superioridade, relativismo filosófico, liderança suprema, Moisés, arrogância legítima, virtudes incompreensíveis ao rasteiro... e cada vez mais supremos até de tudo estarem desprendidos. Judd e Straus, o paranoico e o esquizofrênico, querem estar para além ou para aquém do bem e do mal, do certo e do errado, sem cauções de sanidade judicial ou medicinal. Querem-se fundir em um e praticar o mal de cada vez pior, horrífico, limpo, inconsequente. Aglutinação de carnes tenras que compreende o sensível, o moral e, de maneira mais aparentemente soterrada, o sexual. Fortíssimo filme erótico de uma carga e tensão a rebentar as bordas do Scope em constante desequilíbrio. Ora abarcando, ora isolando lá pelos cantos mortos.
Sem paixão, sem amor, sem desculpas. Judd cultiva arrepiantes animais empalhados, Straus brinca com manhosos ursinhos sorridentes. Judd tenta ser mais perfeito do que o mestre sodomizante, mas acaba vergado às confusões e sensações que os olhos e o roçar numa moça loira produzem. Uma espécie ou um concurso mesmo de supradeuses que só finda quando o primeiro for ao tapete ou à ultrarreferida guilhotina. História passional entre dois homens em que o reflexo é história de horror sem causa. O que falhou e os levou ao encarceramento eterno que se revela mais cruel do que a corda que os esganaria de vez?
Uns óculos que vão baralhar e atrofiar tudo, álibis, argumentos, nexos, personalidades? A formosa Ruth fala na infelicidade do paranoico. O Wilk de Welles vai por caminhos patológicos, advogando por amor. Mas neste cruzamento ou atamento entre Festim diabólico (Rope, Alfred Hitchcock, 1948) com os vampiros libertinos e sugadores que Abel Ferrara pôs à luz do dia em O vício (The Addiction, 1994-1995), a escorregadela ou a falha que se detecta mesmo no ressoar derradeiro, aqui a coisa é estendida e distendida e reinventada para lá mesmo do último apito do árbitro, é a sentença privada e noturna de Welles. Muito mais sentenciosa e fatalista do que a do oficial, e que reza, no idioma original, assim – “In those years to come you might find yourself asking... if it wasn’t the hand of God that dropped those glasses. And if he didn’t, who did?” Pumba, “The End”.
Não querendo puxar a brasa a nenhuma sardinha, muito menos ter certezas num palco onde elas estão fora de serviço, faltou aos dois putos espertos e mais ainda ao cabecilha o que faltou ao artista de Império do terror, sendo esta uma rima perfeita ou um chafurdamento mais fundo – o respeito ou a simples consciência de uma possível transcendência, ilógica ou lógica à sua maneira, isto para não usar ou deixar em elipse metáforas ou habitantes divinos. O que transporta este filme para outro degrau ou patamar é precisamente a elevação desta questão ou desta incógnita, infinitesimal ou colossal, a estrados metafísicos, em consonância com todas as verborreias que escorrem no ora metálico ora viscoso preto e branco. Fora ou além da esfera e do peso dos corpos, do dinheiro, da posição social. Em amplitudes que justamente ao evocarem o contrário do mal só para ele caminham e o largam, besta na selva. Mal difuso que se entranha e não se isola do bem. Terror da beleza e beleza do terror, como também lá se diz.
Irracional, inaudito, insuperável. Mente que não calamos, alma que não acedemos, rol de eventos que corre imperialmente, fazendo-nos ajoelhar quando e onde quiser. Fora do que podemos tocar plana o que não podemos tocar. Ou ver. Sentir. O que nos foge ou seca como a água sobre a pele quente. Como pergunta terminal do que andamos aqui a fazer, para quê, por quê. O que Fleischer largou às feras é a impossibilidade da cura. Reconciliação. Abraço. De um modo tão amplo e circular que só podemos responder como responde aquele Straus das certezas todas – de boca cosida.
Confrontar se faz favor, para fins de outro tipo de inteligência, os dois tipos de tratamento da realização, isto é, antes de Welles e depois de Welles, que invade e tudo modifica num rompante sereno. Serenidade filha da puta. Duas partes distintas, duas respirações, duas pulsões. Como se na primeira não houvesse nada da ordem da crença e estivéssemos a flutuar e a pairar num crispado vácuo. Cenas e planos que se chocam e entrechocam, durações e ritmos convulsos, perigoso atrito, olhares desencontrados. E na segunda fossem precisos os caminhos e os saberes, por exemplo, de uma decupagem que permita dar luta ou emplacamento àquele Altíssimo ou àquele Diabo que suga tudo do campo. Olhar encontrado, escansão, movimento e significâncias tão claras como negras. E no embate do claro e do negro estará o tom geral. De onde o choque dual produz o que lá está. Sem resoluções.

"Dean Stockwell tribute:
Although I prefer Fleischer’s two subsequent films about real-life notorious murders (The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place ), this is a very good film with an all-around great performances from the entire cast.",3.5
"Dans sa passionnante autobiographie, Richard Fleischer a déclaré que Compulsion était le film dont il était le plus fier. Prédestiné à une carrière de psychiatre, auteur de nombreux films humanistes et en particulier contre la peine de mort, on peut comprendre ses paroles.
Sa mise en scène est presque invisible mais pourtant très maligne. Il va l'adapter à ses personnages: Artie, mythomane et narcissique, est sans cesse entourer de gens dans le cadre et souvent placé au milieu, comme le leader. À l'inverse, Judd est souvent mal à l'aise, dans les côtés de l'image et parfois même dans des plans débullés. On a même ce plan fascinant au début du film lorsqu'il est dans la salle et qu'on l'observe à travers la vitre où il est à l'écart des autres camarades. Le film est d'ailleurs très froid mais c'est un choix très conscient. Le film est une étude de la violence et des rapports humains. D'un côté, deux jeunes qui n'ont pas conscience du crime qu'ils commettent et de l'autre, un jury qui ne cherche qu'à les accabler, à les voir pendu. D'ailleurs, ce n'est surement pas un hasard si le film se déroule à Chicago pendant la prohibition, théâtre de nombreux sanglants entre gangs.
Justement récompensé par un prix d'interprétation collectif, les 3 acteurs principaux sont géniaux. Évidemment, Orson Welles est le plus magistral. Seulement présent pendant 30 minutes, il est d'un charisme époustouflant. Et dans ce qui est probablement la plus belle scène de la filmographie de Fleischer, il est au sommet de son art lors d'un discours d'une importance majeure encore aujourd'hui.",4.0
"A unique beast of a film that shows early signs of American Psycho's fascination with the paranoid schizophrenic sociopath and it even doubles down on that idea, evolving Hitchcock's Rope essentially (which, surprisingly to me, is an adaptation of the same story) in a gloriously filmed black-and-white wide-screen image which, if not uncommon, feels rare for these kinds of stories.
Artie and Judd are two young boys that, in all likelihood through their upbringing, feel particularly superior to their fellow human beings and the result of that is that they start testing how far they can go with their eponymous compulsion to commit crimes, which start with a stolen typewriter and end up with the stolen life of an innocent boy killed just to prove they could.
They're a vicious pair that nevertheless gets a powerful defence by a late appearance supporting role from Orson Welles as their lawyer. It's here that the film truly takes flight as it surprisingly argues against the death penalty while still fully recognising the terrible deed these boys have done and it's simply outstanding and impactful to see Welles' world-weary lawyer make a plea for love for these two murderers and to ""only"" incarcerate them for life. A plea that rings ever more poignant in light of this story taking place in 1924, a mere six years after the end of what was then still known as The Great War which also visibly seems to have left a mark on Welles' advocate.",4.0
"There is a lot going on here--not all of it good. Plus, some of the cinematically good parts are not in any way ethical. --!!!--
But for sheer force of performance will, this is a film that grabs me every single time.

"Orson Welles performance is muted borderline boring to watch, but his character is extremely fascinating. It’s unfortunate he shows up so late into the movie because his arc is rushed. That being said there’s nothing else controversial about the quality of Compulsion. Direction and editing are great, the rest of the characters and their performances are phenomenal, and the script tackles a lot of different issues and character beliefs in gripping ways.",4.0
"Hooray for Hollywood 2020
Based on the Leopold and Loeb case which also inspired Rope, this is the story of a pair of well to do young men who murdered a young boy just because, as the film says, they felt like it.
The film's title is entirely misleading, it was not a compulsion that drove the pair to commit murder, they were not in any way compelled to do what they did, and actually their reasons were quite different.
Artie Strauss (Bradford Dillman) is the one who has the idea, he is at the very least a thrill seeker, at worst a psychopath, he really is doing it for the fun of it.
Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) is different, he is in thrall to Artie, certainly in love with him, although the film steers well away from any discussion of their relationship, who has promised to do whatever Artie tells him, so desperate is he to please him. Beyond that he speaks of his belief in the superior human being, that since he and Artie are clearly more intelligent than all those around them it entitles them to not have to live by the same rules are normal people.
To my mind this is no more than posturing, he may have come to believe the things he says but only because it happens to justify his actions in some way. But it's clear that deep down he knows what he is doing is morally wrong.
The film's biggest problem is the casting of Stockwell and Dillman, who are referred to as boys and who I assume are supposed to be the same age as Leopold and Loeb who were 18 and 19 at the time of the murder. The actors themselves are 25 and 29 and look it, so any implication that they are not old enough to know better goes right out the window.
The greater part of the movie is devoted to the time before and immediately after the murder - the killing is something which we know nothing about until it's already happened - with Artie doing whatever he can to insert himself into the case, obviously without implicating himself.
The final half hour is given over to Orson Welles as their defence attorney who seeks to defend them only in so far as saving them from the hangman's noose.
As a study of the themes surrounding this particular case I'm bound to say that it's not as interesting as Rope.
Nowadays of course this kind of thinking is does not come down to superior intellect, but superior bank balance, if you've got enough money the normal laws do not apply.",3.5

"""God's got nothing to do with it.""
I first heard of this one a few months ago when a friend of mine watched it and told me it was based on the same real life case as Rope (which is a favorite of mine). Recently I noticed it was added to Netflix, so I added it to my list. After watching another Orson Welles movie yesterday on Netflix, I decided to give Compulsion a shot today. I really liked it. More than I thought I would to be honest. Though it's based on the same case as Rope, it's a very different film. I'm not sure which one is closer to the actual events, but both are very interesting films and I think they'd make for a good double feature. The film is well shot in Black an White, has good pacing, strong dialogue, an engaging stroy, and many standout scenes. The two leads (Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman) are both very good in their roles and the supporting cast is good too with strong turns from E.G. Marshall and Orson Welles. I do wish there were more courtroom scenes, but the ones we got are memorable, so I can't complain too much. Welles' final speech in the courtroom is excellent. Overall, I think this is a film more people should see. An under seen gem right here. 8/10",4.0
"Something about this film is a bit off. Maybe it's the college student actors, maybe it's the shoe-horned romantic sub-plot, maybe it's just that nothing quite gels together. The opening was exciting, everything about it was perfect, the cinematography, the characterization, the music, it was just what I wanted. Everything in the middle felt jumbled, over-long, and not particularly important once the court case began.
The two murderers are great together, but they're never really given anything interesting to do, only prolonging the inevitable, which ends up being more interesting to watch anyway. It feels like this film was built around Orson Welles' impassioned speech at the end, with a speech that, although acted out superbly, rings somewhat hollow.",3.0
"Two highly intellectual young men (Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell) plan and commit the ""perfect"" murder in order to show their ""superiority"". When they get caught the trial focuses on whether capital punishment is just or not...
The movie portrays its protagonists as two despicable individuals only able to relate to themselves. Thus director Fleischer emotionally manipulates the viewer as he might very easily agree to the DAs demands. Therefore Orson Welles defense lawyer may not only have to persuade the judge in the movie but also those in front of the screen. This results in strong involvement of the audience but as compelling as the trial scenes may be COMPULSION is far from being a perfect movie.
Its main flaw is the miscasting of the two leads who are good actors but way too old for their roles. Plus there are some dramatic missteps and suspense moments could have been handled better.
Visually there are some interesting elements and Orson Welles looking exactly like TOUCH OF EVILS Hank Quinlan is as great as you can expect him to be.
Make or Break Scene: Welles' final speech.
MVT: Orson Welles who like in THE THIRD MAN only appears in the last act but totally commands the screen.
Score: 6/ 10",3.0
"Orson doesn’t get enough credit as an actor. True, he doesn’t have an enormous range (though, let’s face it, most good actors don’t), but he does have one of the most expressive vocal instruments of the twentieth century. Cast as Clarence Darrow (in all but name), his only real purpose in the film — despite his top-of-the-line billing — was to deliver the closing speech at the trial condemning capital punishment. And what a speech. The best thing about his performance is that he worked against expectations. Most actors would have instinctively planned the speech out like a traditional five-part narrative structure to reach a stentorian climax near its end, but Welles went in the opposite direction, often turning his back on the person he’s seemingly addressing and muttering to himself, as if he’s working over his own conscience, unaware of his audience — which is, of course, his rhetorical strategy to convince them of his sincerity. Despite myself, I was moved. It belongs up there with Charles Laughton’s speech at the end of THIS LAND IS MINE as one of the great concluding soliloquies of the American cinema.",4.0

"A bit lopsided for me, I really enjoyed the first half as we got to meet Judd and Artie, two rich college students enamoured with nihilistic philosophy, and their own invulnerability who commit a murder for the sheer thrill if it. Judd is stressed and uncomfortable with their act, certain of his athiestic insights, but also appears to be a closeted homosexual, in love with his accomplice who doesn’t seem as impressed with his sacrifice in retrospect. Artie, on the other hand, is more perverse and appears positively gleeful here, even as the noose tightens around both their necks. Great stuff, if not on par with Hitchcock’s terrific “Rope” which covers the same ground more effectively.
It takes a bit of a dive, interestingly, when Orson Welles shows up, a star defense attorney and another non-believer to boot. I wasn’t particularly engaged in the trial, although neither really is the film, focusing instead on his final statements to the judge. Here the movie becomes a polemic against the death penalty, which is admirable, in a sense, attached to the plight of such unfavorable characters (a leaser film would have tied this to a more sympathetic case) but you don’t get any glimmers of the creative spark that made the firat half so exciting until a brief exchange between Welles and the boys in its closing, which puts into question some of the more simplistic ideas about right and wrong the film seemed to suggest before.",4.0

"Compulsion was released eleven years after Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, which were both based on the Leopold and Loeb murder case, and not to try and compare the two films but I do want to discuss elements in Rope.
In Compulsion the characters of Artie and Judd are given much screentime to humanize them, which I find odd because they murdered a boy in cold blood. It's like the film wants you to sympathize with them more, maybe it's to make the ending work but I thought it was weird. The relationship between Judd and Artie is much more subtle then I would have expected from 1959, the power dynamic is still there, but any hints at a sexual relationship between the two friends is still subdued. Especially when you consider eleven years earlier in Rope, the gay subtext is very in your face. However, Brandon and Phillip from Rope, at times feel like caricatures with their traits dialled up to eleven to heighten the film's claustrophobic nature. Compulsion's characters feel like real people.",3.5
"nathan leopold said it was just, like, him and 20 housewives in the theatre watching this 😭😭 that will never not be funny to me. but fr tho i love this movie.
based on the case that inspired hitchcock’s rope, compulsion is….Not as good overall but the films were going for very different things so i’m not sure that they’re even comparable.
i think fleischer’s direction is great and i’d love to see more of his work in the future. dillman and stockwell work great together! they really brought artie and judd to life and added great nuance to their characters. varsi was good too! orson welles’ performance was FINE but it was way too drawn out and he was kind of annoying. and SO FREAKING SWEATY.
the movie’s cinematography is probably its best feature; the framing of several shots using mirrors/reflections was great.
my only criticism is the horrendously long court scene at the end, especially considering how orson welles (as you could probably tell from earlier) gets on my nerves. people tend to criticize a Certain Scene Involving Ruth (which i wont mention for spoiler reasons) but i honestly like the way that scene was handled.",4.5

"This is an interesting case of ""a tale of two films,"" and one of them was definitely superior to the other. It begins as a noir study of two young men out to prove that the perfect murder can be committed and ends as a courtroom drama, with its premise based on the Leopold and Loeb murders in 1924. There were aspects I admired throughout, but the film really takes off once Orson Welles shows up and takes over its second half entirely.
Judd and Artie are out to prove that their superior intellect can outsmart the system, and are determined to do something truly dangerous that will get everyone talking. They kidnap and murder a young boy on the way home from school, but their plan hits a snag when they realize that Judd's glasses fell to the ground where the body was found. The two are eventually arrested and put on trial, but their wealthy parents hire a lawyer that has the potential to sway the course of events in a major way.
The first half of the film is solid, if unspectacular. Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman each do good work as Judd and Artie, respectively, but Stockwell gets more of a chance to display some range. I didn't like that his character finds some sympathy, as he is not only a murder but almost becomes a rapist as well, but I think the film does well to subtly examine white privilege as a concept, whether or not it was the intention. That these two boys are given the benefit of any doubt, and Artie is allowed to help the police to the extent that he does reeks of such privilege, though it also stretched my disbelief.
Orson Welles plays Wilk, a character based on Clarence Darrow, who defended the real murders in their trial. This is another case where he shows up halfway through a movie and absolutely steals it, breathing some needed life into things at every turn. In condensing Darrow's 12 hour summation into one harrowing scene, Welles puts his admirable talent on display and delivers an eloquent-yet-scathing damnation of capital punishment. But as much as I enjoy watching Welles work, and as much as that may have been based on a real-life scenario, I couldn't help but feel like Richard Fleischer was trying to make me feel bad for these two sociopaths. I'm not sure if it was the words or the expert delivery, but I refuse to lend my sympathy to such characters. In fact, the arc of Ruth (Diane Varsi) can be downright gross at times, as she seemingly wants to protect the man who was on the verge of raping her. He showed her exactly who he was, but somehow gets points for stopping himself just before going through with it? Hell no.
But maybe the entire point was to get me to wrestle with myself internally in just such a fashion. Fleischer makes the conscious choice early on not to show the murder, instead offering a time jump while the story is filled in for us by exposition. He is telling us that the focus shouldn't be on what they did but who they are, and later in the film we are meant to debate whether they deserve to die. But that decision has to be based on what they've done, not who they are, because this is still a system of laws. It's an interesting decision, though it makes for a bit of an uneven film.",3.5

"A fascinating movie. It's cynical and sincere at the same time about capital punishment, putting on full display all the ways in which the justice system can be twisted and contorted in favor of those with the means to do the twisting; yet, there is conviction and sincerity underneath it, made possible by Dean Stockwell's tragically vulnerable performance that makes you really feel for him, and even just slightly for Dillman's Artie, as he faces down a best-case scenario of life in prison. Dissects privilege and sketches out two very different products of its conditions.
The gay subtext/text is fascinating, though a little less overt than I had expected (even with the Hays Code restrictions, I had read about this film and the impression was that there was more). Their dom/sub dynamic is less titillating as parts of their personal characters and more as contrasting projections of their rebellion - Artie rebelling against his family's indifference, Judd rebelling against his brother's suffocation.
Dean Stockwell. That's all.",4.0
"Good acting and well made. Interesting subject matter for the time. I just can't get past 2 things:
1. The whole attempted rape subplot. I understand the studio did not want it clear that the main characters were homosexual. So it comes off as very problematic that this girl feels bad for Dean Stockwell's character because he wasn't able to rape her.
2. The entire climax of the movie being an impassioned courtroom speech sticking up for the rights of... rich sociopathic child murderers? These characters were made to be so despicable that I wasn't really invested in whether they got the death penalty vs life in prison. I just kept imagining the parents of the murdered boy having to listen to this bullshit about their son's murderers being persecuted for being rich!
I prefer Rope as a more entertainment-focused version of the same story or Anatomy of a Murder, as a better ""adult"" courtroom drama from the same year.",3.0

"Two wealthy, sociopathic intellectuals use their interpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche to justify their idea that as supermen they are freed from conventional moral concepts. To exhibit their intellectual superiority, their idea they can do anything and be without guilt, they decide to commit the perfect crime, the murder of a neighborhood boy, believing the inferior authorities will never catch them. Richard Fleischer's film is based on a novel of the same name by Meyer Levin, a fictional account of what was called ""the crime of the century"", a murder committed by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in 1924 which was also the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE (1948). Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as the two young men, along with Orson Welles as their defense attorney (modeled on Clarence Darrow), were jointly awarded the Best Actor Award at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. The rest of the cast including E.G. Marshal, Diane Varsi, Martin Milner, Richard Anderson, and Edward Binns, give strong support. This movie is one of the four films Richard Fleischer directed based on true crimes, the others being THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING (1955), THE BOSTON STRANGLER (1968), and 10 RILLINGTON PLACE (1971), and all exhibit his ability as an underrated craftsman who seemed able to turn out fine films in almost any genre, and get the most out of what he was given. The way he movies his camera around the courtroom following Welles as he delivers his 10 minute plea to save them from the death penalty, while showing the audience as various members of the cast react to his words, is classic cinema. I did have a couple of problems with the script. It would have been a better choice to show the murder as it happened and give us a better visual idea as to what these two young men did to kill the boy (it is described, but that is far from the same thing), to see how we would rule on Welles' plea in court. Another problem is that after the first hour or so the focus leaves Judd and Arthur, as well as the police investigation (which it really does not cover very well), and moves to the trial which is not very interesting. Even the Welles speech (Darrow spent 12 hours delivering his) seems to drone on too long. However, the performances by Dillman and Stockwell make this film required viewing. The KINO Blu-ray presents this film in beautiful black and white CinemaScope.",3.5
"When I think of Richard Fleischer movies I think of (for want of a better word) blockbuster movies like the brilliant 'Vikings' or 'Soylent Green'. What I don't think of is Hitchockian murder narratives.
'Compulsion' is well directed, and is engaging right from the opening scene where our two troubled leads nearly run down a drunk standing in the road. The characters are the best part of the movie, and to me are like more fleshed out versions of the two central characters from 'Rope'. The lead performances are phenomenal. You would never think that Al from 'Quantum Leap' could be such a serious actor, but Dean Stockwell is fantastic as Judd Steiner, the tragic outsider who tries to prove his intellect but makes a major error. Bradford Dillman is also great in full 'wise-guy psycho' mode.
The ending of the movie is the standout though. I know Orson Welles is one of the greatest actors of all time, but he never ceases to amaze me. His monologue has to be one of the greatest court-room scenes I've seen on film since the last time I watched 'To Kill A Mockingbird', and it's all down to his terrific acting chops.",4.0
"There was 40 minutes of incredibly tense storytelling in Compulsion. Unfortunately, the rest felt like a whole lot of filler. Bradford Dillman is fucking incredible. Orson Welles and Dean Stockwell are really good too. But this is a case of great performances holding up a daring script that, unfortunately, didn't have the storytelling chops to pull off the tale.",3.0
"And I thought Dean Stockwell couldn't get any creepier than he was in 'Blue Velvet...'
Before I watched this, I had no idea that this was loosely based off the real life 1924 Leopold & Loeb case. Their sexuality was often questioned, so it makes sense that their on-screen personas are tinged with as much of a homosexual undercurrent as Hollywood could get away with in 1959. When we first see them together after their first burglary, they're talking just a bit too close to each other. The complete & utter control that the one seems to hold over the other also serves to suggest a deeper intimacy that 'just friends.'
All 3 of the lead actors give powerful performances. Dean Stockwell delivers on that quiet, nervous, intense type that could spout off in an emotional tirade at any moment, while Bradford Dillman plays the cocky, always grinning, control freak to a tee. But then along comes Orson Welles, looking & talking like a man who just got out of bed, but somehow still exuding an electricity that draws your eyes to him wherever he is on the screen. His stunning courtroom monologue stole the film from everyone else. He has the rare ability to come across as nonchalant in his delivery & gestures, but still somehow manages to command the screen like no other.",4.0
"Dean Stockwell is perfect as the Nietzsche-loving Raskolnikov-type neurotic character. The film had me hooked from the very first scene but loses quite a bit of momentum when Welles shows up. His performance is good but the shift from psychological crime thriller to courtroom drama is abrupt. Would make a great double-bill with Hitchcock's Rope.

"Compulsion shows the crime, interrogation, and trial of Leopold and Loeb (Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman) concentrating mainly on their trial.

Marshall, Richard Anderson, and Martin Milner round out the cast. Diane Varsi sleepwalks through the film on her way home from Peyton Place.",4.5

"A most unexpected and intriguing companion piece to Hitchcock's Rope with both examining the nature of reconciling the fluctuating balancing act of justice and mercy in navigating and dealing with the lesser, sadder, baser intentions of people. Both feel Hitchcockian in completely different ways, Rope for obvious reasons, Compulsion in its many compelling efforts to curiously, empathetically, but firmly draw out what goes on inside those who go astray or simply wrong in life. I discovered this film by accident and see that a few others on here have coincidentally done the same. Hopefully, this review continues that trend as its a simple, solidly and sophisticatedly put film that rewards and warrants seeing.",3.5

"You know that famous moment Orson Welles is introduced from out the shadows in Carol Reed's 'The Third Man' which changes the whole complexion of the film? Well Richard Fleischer's 'Compulsion' see's a worse for wear Welles appearing over an hour into the film as defence lawyer Jonathan Wilk. There is no iconic entrance here but the mere presence of the man completely engulfs the film. And in some ways you could say his performance here betters that of 'The Third Man', or at least matches it. There is a lengthy monologue that Welles delivers at the film's conclusion that confirms just how gripping an actor he has. It is a riveting scene in which Wilks gives his speech to the judge and the audience in court, railing against the public's demand for blood against the guilty men in the stands. It is a scene largely devoid of grandstanding even though it is made for it. Instead Welles delivers an impassioned yet weary speech regailing against the death penalty and the hypocrisy that it entails. Before Welles makes his entrance the film remains an engaging and well acted piece about two young men who set out to commit the perfect crime merely to prove their intellectual superiority. It could be said that Welles simply engulfs them but for me it just adds another layer onto a really well made film.",0.0

It starts out okay but it really falls off a cliff by the time we get to court. I kind of hate its approach because it works hard for you to get to know the murder boys but I didn't feel sorry for them in the slightest, in fact I kind of hated them so much that I was mad at the end when they didn't get the death penalty. But the movie argues that they shouldn't be killed for their crime because they're just young guys who aren't defined by their rich families- and no, they are very much defined by their backgrounds and if anything they deserve to suffer more just for the sheer entitlement they have. These fucking boys are so bad at committing a crime, they constantly act suspicious and fuck everything up all the time and yet they still think they're so cool and I'm supposed to like them for that? There's also a lady in this movie who not only gives a terrible performance but has one of the most baffling character arcs I've ever seen where she nearly gets raped by one guy but then is horrified and in denial of the fact that he could have committed murder and still finds herself attracted to him as if he just fell on top of her by accident instead of attacking her- the fucking 50s, man. And then at the end Orson Welles shows up to monologue for what feels like a fucking eternity about vague morality concepts, and they get to spend a lifetime in prison and psychiatric hospitals where they can have years and years to not regret anything instead of being taken out around the back and hung. Look, I'm not saying I support capital punishment, but it was an option in this scenario and they should have gone for it.

"A brilliant film — with themes similar to “Rope” (1948) and “Strangers on a Train” (1951) — brilliant, that is, until Orson Welles shows up on screen at which point it becomes rather awful.
With Welles’ appearance in the last third of the film, this tense, eery thriller about two young psychopaths becomes a boring courtroom drama providing Orson the opportunity to do not a one, two or three-minute monologue… but TWELVE full minutes (“12 minutes of spongy sentiment,” as Pauline Kael put it.)
Welles’ character is tedious, though necessary as the film is based on the Leopold and Loeb case of 1924 — and he’s playing Clarence Darrow in what was the “crime of the century”, whose argument on behalf of his clients lasted not one, two or three minutes, but TWELVE hours. Suddenly Orson’s 12 minutes doesn’t seem so bad.
Nevertheless, everything up until then is great. Both men play their very dangerous psychopathy in very different ways. Bradford Dillman is mercurial and charismatic, quite likable though monstrously violent. He plays the kind of killer I’m not sure we see on screen again until the 1970s onward. And now, of course, we see his type all the time — the most recent example being Boyd Holbrook as Clement Mansell in “Justified: City Primeval” (2023.)
Dean Stockwell’s portrayal of Judd Steiner is perhaps more typical — he’s the cold, silent killer we know from films like “Psycho” (1960), “Silence of the Lambs” (1991), and so on. By the time it was made, Stockwell had already performed the character on Broadway for 140 performances, in Meyer Levin’s stage play of the same title (both the play and the film are based on Levin’s 1956 novel.)
As in the Leopold and Loeb matter (which also inspired “Rope”), where the awkward Nathan Leopold* was sexually fixated on Richard Loeb, Stockwell’s character is sexually attracted to Dillman’s character Judd.  His portrayal is fascinating in its subtlety — reflecting not only the character’s latency but also the attitudes of 1959 Hollywood.  How to say he’s gay without saying he’s gay? The script makes a few allusions (“don’t you chase girls?”), but the true story is really told visually through Stockwell’s mesmerizing acting.
If only there had been more of Stockwell and Dillman, and less of Welles!
* Nathan Leopold was released from prison one year before the film’s premier.",4.5

"This is a film that my Joel has been speaking about to me for years and I am delighted to have finally watched it with him.
The performances in this film were incredibly chilling and the way the story was executed was sickening. I found myself wanting them to receive the worst form of punishment because of it. This is why I can't give the film a full rating.
The final speech felt extremely preachy about capital punishment and it did not match the tone of the film. Why should I want two child murderers - who have every intention of continuing to kill for the fun of it - to have life instead of rightfully hanging?
On a lighter note, the way the camera lingers feels like you are intruding into a private matter which adds to the unsettling tone of this film. Despite the fact that we never see the crime, the dialogue is utilised in a limited yet grim way to describe it that you can almost picture it. It paints a haunting picture for sure.
Overall, a fantastic film that explores the sadistic and horrific nature of two real life serial killers from a factual perspective. Despite this attempt at staying neutral, the film does fall slightly flat at the end with its tonally clashing final speech regarding capital punishment.",4.0

If they were sharing the award I wish they would have included E.G. Marshall as well, who plays the District Attorney. Welles, despite getting top billing, doesn't appear until much later in the film, and he kind of takes it over as the defense attorney (Clarence Darrow in real life). The perspective shifts from that of the unremorseful murderers who think they're smarter than everyone, and he gives a long and powerful speech advocating against the death penalty. Having us spend so much time with the murderers before delivering that message makes it more effective. Of course the innocent don't deserve capital punishment, but neither do the guilty.",3.5

"“To the perfect crime!”
Compulsion is a 1959 American crime drama film directed by Richard Fleischer which follows two wealthy law-school students who go on trial for murder. 
Inspired by the Leopold and Loeb murder case, Compulsion, much like Hitchcock’s Rope, explores two sociopathic and megalomaniacal boys, implied to be lovers. 
Whilst this is more a courtroom drama than Rope, it’s still just as compelling, with fantastic performances. 
It drags a little in the court sequences, but is made up for with Orson Welles’ brilliant portrayal as the young men’s lawyer, delivering a great monologue. 
Dean Stockwell is also phenomenal here, giving his character a level of complexity and depth whilst remaining despicable and murderous.

"Este é um filme que há muito procurava ver, pelo menos desde que assisti a Rope (1948) de Hitchcock, baseado no mesmo caso verídico (de Leopold e Loeb). Compulsion é sem dúvida mais próximo dos eventos reais, tendo por base o romance de Meyer Levin. É o primeiro de três controversos filmes realizados por Richard Fleischer sobre crimes baseados em histórias verídicas (sendo os outros dois The Boston Strangler (1968) e 10 Rillington Place (1971)). Os três são em tudo diferentes uns dos outros.
Enquanto que no último há apenas uma tentativa de recontar com precisão os factos e acontecimentos dos vários crimes, no segundo o realizador procura estabelecer críticas à condução do processo de investigação policial e refletir sobre o estado mental do criminoso. Em Compulsion, o realizador divide o filme em duas partes, a primeira desenvolvendo as personagens de Artie e Judd e uma segunda em estilo courtroom drama em que Orson Welles toma o papel principal enquanto advogado destes, argumentando contra a pena de morte.
Apesar da brilhante performance de Orson Welles, não é um courtroom drama das dimensões quase épicas de Witness for the Prossecution (1957) ou Anatomy of a Murder (1958). Ainda assim tem alguns traços de originalidade e terá, sem dúvida, deixado a semente para muitos outros filmes do género. Apesar do interessante argumento contra a pena de morte, não é dramaticamente tão intenso quanto veio a ser, por exemplo, o quinto capítulo de Dekalog (1989) e apesar das brilhantes interpretações de Dillman e Stockwell, não é nada que se pareça com a brutalidade de, por exemplo, In Cold Blood (1969) sobre o mal e a sua natureza. Compulsion procura ser muita coisa, mas eu gostaria de o lembrar como um conto negro sobre a história dos Estados Unidos da América e o seu mais cruel crime.",4.0

"Dos niños crueles (Dean Stockwell y Bradford Dillman) matan por lo que común (y equivocadamente) se llama por las ideas, y que si seguimos al autor de esas ideas - Friedrich Nietzsche - podríamos decir que más bien matan por la voluntad de poder hacerlo. Pero en cualquier caso, lo hacen cruel aunque no impunemente. Digo niños porque ni cuando uno de ellos intenta violar puede hacerlo (es un niño sin fuerza).
Este clasicazo de Richard Fleischer transcurre en 1924, para evocar las infamias del juicio Leopold y Loeb, y aunque comienza como, digamos, La soga de Hitchock termina de una forma kantiana, nada más entra en escena Jonathan Wilk (un Orson Welles titánico, único y brutal en una de sus composiciones menos frecuentemente vindicadas) para salvarlos, no de la condena sino de la pena capital.

"After my Rope rewatch, I decided to check out the second film based on the Leopold and Loeb murder (released a year after the real-life Nathan Leopold was paroled, interestingly enough).
This one is much more faithful to the actual case, changing the names but still keeping it clear who's who. The recently departed Dean Stockwell is excellent as the sensitive, subordinate Leopold, and Bradford Dillman is equally compelling as the more controlling, aggressive Loeb. Orson Welles gets top billing, despite not showing up until the movie is nearly two-thirds over. Still, he does steal the show with his climactic courtroom monologue (which is, fortunately, considerably shorter than Clarence Darrow's real-life closing argument, which went on for 12 hours).
It's funny that Leopold and Loeb fancied themselves intellectual Übermenschen, because you had to be pretty fucking dumb to get caught committing a murder in the days before CSI forensics. No DNA evidence back then—all you had to do was literally not leave your extremely rare, one-of-a-kind glasses right next to the body.",4.0

His monologue in the final scene is pretty comfortably the best moment.",3.0
"Based on the Leopold and Loeb murder case that inspired Hitchcock's Rope - but without the fake single shot gimmick - this crime drama delves deeper into the psychology of the young murderers and the chemistry between them. The first half is excellent as we see them goad each other on, especially Bradford Dillman who has some creepy moments talking to a teddy bear to further vex his partner. The second half of the film is less effective, taking a far more omniscient view of events as the pair confess and are defended in court. Under heavy makeup, Orson Welles is superb as their passionate but down-to-earth lawyer. Having a wealth of supporting characters speculate about the duo though is less engaging than seeing them interact. The court scenes also become far more about capital punishment than the pair's crimes, which feels like an odd tangent. Still, this is mostly captivating stuff with lots of shadowy photography and solid performances all round.",3.5
"Orson approaches his big monologue like it's Shakespeare, which legitimately elevates it.

"Of course they had to 'tone it down', (it was still 1959), but this screen version of the Leopold-Loeb case, (with the names and some of the facts altered), wasn't just a first-class melodrama but also as honest as it was possible to be at the time regarding the sexual relationship existing between the killers. Nothing's overt but you didn't have be Sam Spade to figure things out.
The movie ""Compulsion"" was based on Meyer Levin's novel, the adaptation was by Richard Murphy, the highly intelligent direction was by the remarkably gifted Richard Fleischer, the superb wide-screen photography was by William C. Mellor and best of all, the killers were played by Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman. Orson Welles was their defence attorney, based on Clarence Darrow and all three were jointly awarded Best Actor at Cannes. A girl, played by Diane Varsi, was also thrown into the mix, perhaps to put audiences off the scent of what was really going on between Stockwell and Dillman but she doesn't interfere too much with the plot and there's a very nice supporting turn from Martin Milner as a young, hot-shot journalist.
It's not a great film and Welles' lengthy final monologue is certainly nowhere near as profound as it thinks it is but the film is both intelligent and very entertaining and was a very grown-up film to have come out of Hollywood at the time.",4.0

"I don't know how they made a film about ""the crime of the century"" feel this hollow and lifeless, but they did. This was a case that outraged an entire town. Rich families with small children fled Chicago while the killers were still at large. The hunt for the killers was a wild goose chase that appeared as if it was going nowhere. You don't get any sense of that in this film, as it mostly flits between rooms in Judd & Artie's houses, providing no context as to why this horrified the city of Chicago. I didn't realize this was based on a play until recently and now I see that influence. There's way too much talking, talking about the case, talking about motives, talking about how to fool the cops, all in big, cavernous mansions. There's no action in this--they don't even show the murder on screen! They try to make the killers sound like sociopaths but they also treat them (Judd in particular) sentimentally. This is a complex case, and a complex source novel, but every attempt at complexity in this film was completely thrown out.
Don't even get me started on the subplot where Judd attempts to rape a woman, can't go through with it, and then SHE feels bad for HIM. It was gross in the book but at least made sense narratively: a thwarted last chance at heterosexuality and the possibility that she could have cured Judd of his homosexuality. In the movie, all hints at homosexuality scrubbed away by the Production Code, the subplot makes even less sense and is completely repulsive.
As in the novel, the film loses steam once it hits the trial. Since we know they are guilty and that the trial is only determining whether they are hung, there's not a lot of suspense. Orson Welles, atypically restrained, does a great job here--his sad, tired eyes doing a lot heavy lifting in his scenes with Stockwell and Dillman.",2.5
"I was really hoping to like this more than I did; it was the last Orson Welles starring movie that I hadn't seen. It's a pretty straightforward thriller and often feels like a made for TV movie. The performances are all pretty decent, though, and it was fun seeing Dean Stockwell so young.
It kind of falls apart as soon as Welles shows up, all of the momentum is just drained out of the movie as it shifts gears into a courtroom drama that is essentially made up of three big scenes for Welles. Don't get me wrong, he's fine in it, it just becomes way less interesting. I wasn't expecting that.
I'm glad I finally got around to watching this, even if it was underwhelming. I've now completed the Leopold and Loeb murder movie set.

"I'm really conflicted on this film, and that's probably contributed to taking so long with this review. I've wanted to take a moment to reflect on it. I suppose that's an accomplishment of a sort on the part of the film and the creators behind it.
Compulsion is a dramatization of the infamous 1924 true-life case of Leopold and Loeb, a pair of privileged teenagers who murdered a 14-year-old boy as an intellectual exercise. The film is very dark and unflinching, dealing as it does with child murder, rape, antisemitism, and capital punishment, but it is not remotely graphic, using words and performances to sell its (sadly, timely) brand of sociopathic horror.
The performances are top notch, with Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman portraying Judd Steiner (Leopold) and Artie Strauss (Loeb), respectively. E.G. Marshall plays State's Attorney Horn opposite Orson Welles as Clarence Darrow avatar Jonathan Wilk. The sad reality is that given how events unfold, only Stockwell and Dillman are given opportunities to play off of each other at length, and even that ends about halfway through once the two murderers are in custody. I'm not sure if the closing exchange is apocryphal or based on actual events, but it seems strangely tacked on and out of character for Wilk/Darrow.
I don’t consider discussion of the resolution (that they are caught and tried) much of a spoiler. In fact, it's the principal reason for the film's existence. As a supposed ""spoiler,"" it's much the same as letting slip that the ship sinks during Titanic.
Compulsion is shot with interesting visual flair, including a scene shown reflected in a pair of eyeglasses that are crucial to the plot. In line with Darrow's defense, however, the film does little to address the ""why"" of things or who is to blame. There's a case that we all, society as a whole, are to blame for violent youth, but that doesn't exactly leave the viewer satisfied. It very well may be the real answer, though, and there's some impact in facing that.",3.0
"Dean Stockwell and Orson Welles are the standouts in this courtroom drama based off of the famous Leopold and Loeb murder trial. Stockwell, as the younger/more sheepish murderer (compared to his friend) has a vulnerability to him despite his ability to provoke discomfort and fear within the viewer. Welles, as the boys' defense attorney, delivers a thoughtful and extensive monologue with his closing argument, a standout in the film's relatively bland second act. 
It's worth the watch, even if it's just to compare to Hitchcock's Rope. ",3.0

Props to Orson Welles (looking like death warmed over) for trying and failing really, really hard to convince us otherwise.",2.0
"True Crime movie fans will love this film!
This movie was already a 4/5 good. Dean Stockwell's performance is amazing and the criminal plot is quite ahead of it's time, when bad guys were supposed to be nonintellectual, void of a higher education and never of an upper class, as if the rich would never do anything wrong like that... but this film delves into it and pushes the issue.
They're bad, and as we acknowledge now in 2017 the Western World loves to see the rich, lose, get hurt, divorce and even die, specially in Western Society.
Again, Compulsion was already a 4/5 rating movie...
Then, one hour into the movie, ENTER Orson Welles as a tired, seasoned defense lawyer named Jonathan Wilk, to deliver an almost mono-tone performance unlike no other which, I dare say, can put any modern courtroom drama to shame and turn Compulsion into a full 5/5 must see movie.",5.0

"Starts out interesting as two apparent sociopaths murder a child and try to keep their crime a secret. It's a bit of a cat and mouse game as the police close in on them.

Regardless on your views on capital punishment, it feels completely out of place for this to be the main subject of the closing act. Orson Welles's closing speech is not nearly as eloquent or stirring as the writer probably thought. I give the film a couple stars for the interesting first half, but the closing act was just pathetic.",2.0
"February 2017 Scavenger Hunt #23 Task #1: Watch a movie that takes place in a courtroom.
My List | Master List
Aside from Ed Gein, maybe no real life murderers have entranced Hollywood more than Leopold and Loeb. Two wealthy college students who killed a boy to see if they could commit ""the perfect crime,"" Leopold and Loeb sparked nationwide conversations about morality, privilege, and capital punishment. Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is the most famous fictionalized version of that crime, but Compulsion goes further by including the courtroom case where Clarence Darrow famously saved them from the gallows.
Compulsion is an uneven mix of psychological thriller and courtroom drama. ""Artie and Judd"" are campus oddballs who explore Nietzschen philosophy and begin committing bigger and bigger crimes to prove they are ""superior"" to their lowly classmates. The veil of homosexuality hangs over the film; when Judd comes home from a night out with Artie, and his brother asks why he can't be the kind of boy who goes to baseball games and dates girls, we know what he really means. Dean Stockwell's performance as the paranoid, conscience-stricken Judd is the best in the film, and a welcome contrast to Bradford Dillman's cartoonish scenery-chewing.
The film switches gears as soon as Orson Welles walks into the room--how can it not? Welles is a commanding presence, even when he seems sluggish and bored. Looking into the making of Compulsion, apparently Welles left the country before finishing the voice recording of the movie's most important monologue. That is so typically Welles, though the sound editor pieced it together rather seamlessly.
Wisely, Compulsion never shows the central murder, even in flashback. Pulpy as it is at times, sensationalizing the murder of a kidnapped child would have made it feel hypocritical, as the film's ultimate message is to seek mercy rather than cruelty.",3.0
"That yawling laugh unleashed by Dillman as the credits smash to screen promises something far wilder, and more wicked, than the fairly restrained, sometimes stolid procedural that follows. Still, it has some fun melodramatic grotesqueries and images, and the story of petulant, solipsistic rich kids thinking they deserve to get away with murder because they're in a better economic class is eternally timely. Welles is fun, in that sweaty, slimy way that defined his 1950s mien, though he's basically a 3rd act supporting player (yet received top billing, natch). The restoration on Netflix is super pristine; it's actually a little weird. It's been utterly scrubbed of grain, and while I've never seen this on a print and don't know what it looked like in its original form (it was shot CinemaScope, and the focus/shadows are lovely), i'm pretty confident that it wasn't so antiseptically smooth.",3.5

"Well-performed and often on the verge of tipping over into camp without ever actually crossing the line. There's a lot more homoerotic and sadomasochistic subtext than you might normally find in a '50s film, for sure. It features admirably dark cinematography, solid set design, and a whole bunch of off-putting dutch angles that seem to illustrate control/willpower. It's also a strangely structured film, eliding the actual crime in favor of a little bit that comes before and a whole lot that comes after. The ""after"" segment breaks down broadly into ""investigation,"" which doesn't really follow the expected pattern of a procedural, and ""sentencing hearing,"" which shifts the focus away from the central pair and onto Welles's Darrow stand-in. This structure results in a fragmented throughline, and the film peters out as it goes into the home stretch.",3.5

This trio perfectly complement a smart, cynical script that perfectly captures the real life crime this was based on, cannily using the audience's forewarning of the narrative by concentrating on psychology rather than twists.",4.0
"Compulsion is a film about a pair of hyper-intelligent boys who believe their higher mental capacity puts them above morals and the law. As a result they murder a young boy. This film is easily my biggest surprise of this month perhaps even this year. The story of these 2 boys and their struggle to avoid detection is fascinating particularly because they both have such inflated egos and can't resist the urge to brag or push themselves to do more. I cannot say enough about the acting performance of Dean Stockwell. Bradford Dillman does a fine job as the other perpetrator, but the way that Dean Stockwell plays the character of Jud is so nuanced and interesting. He idolizes (perhaps even loves) Artie, he does some mental jousting with the lawyers in the case, he even has a revelation at the end of the film that is played perfectly. Every other actor did a fine job in this film as well, I mean Orson Welles is in the movie, but there was just something about Stockwell's performance that blew me away. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I always saw him as Al on Quantum Leap or some over-the-top villain like in Battlestar Galactica, so to see him play a role with such subtlety was a revelation.
The choices the cinematographer made were also great. A lot of interesting shots, particularly on the key piece of evidence that kept you in the story. They did some nice tricks with the editing as well that made the passage of time trackable. While we only had a couple hours of film it was easy to see that the characters were experiencing a much longer passage of time. I'm trying not to delve into spoilers because this is a movie I highly recommend people check out for themselves, but if you have no interest or have already seen the film continue reading. Spoilers start here: Suffice it to say the boys get caught in their crime and about halfway or even two-thirds of the way through the film it shifts into this courtroom drama. It's not a heavily detailed case, and I'm sure it's loaded with lots of innaccuracies in procedures, but it's extremely engaging. Orson Welles, unsurprisingly, just steals the movie from this point on. His tactics are brilliant, and we get a genuine feel for how exhausted and world-weary he is by the end of the film. Then he breaks into a speech, and this is one for the history books. It feels like he's going on for about 15 minutes straight without stopping. By the end he has made one of the most convincing arguments against the death penalty that I have ever heard. I have to imagine even the most cynical and hardened person would struggle to say these boys should be executed when he's done with his argument.
What I found so excellent about Compulsion is the way they structured the story. The murder of the little boy doesn't happen for us to see, in fact we never see the boy at all. This makes it so the story is all focused on the 2 boys who committed the crime. They also have an extended sequence of the boys trying to cover up their crime and avoid detection. This is different from most courtroom dramas that want to rush to the criminal case. There was very little I didn't like about this film and I hope that this review will encourage others to give Compulsion a try because I feel it was ahead of its time.",4.5

"""There is no sadness. Only the reality of what's happening.""
Wow, pretty blown away with this one. Not a single frame is wasted in this absolutely magnificent film from Robert Fleischer, to which prior I had seen absolutely nothing from his filmography.
Everything here is technically excellent and I love the long takes in which our characters either move within frame or the camera will move itself to catch the action. It's light editing which I highly adore and if that is the case of what is to come from the rest of Flesicher's films, than I am highly intrigued. He knows when to go close for dramatic effect as it's not overly used and because of this, when he does do close-ups, they hit harder.
Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman, playing Judd and Arthur respectively, are truly the stars of this film as their acting prowess exuberates throughout. From the first scene, I could tell their was an intriguing dynamic between them and this was exemplified within the script as well when we learn in the opening scene that Judd likes Arthur to control him and order him what to do. The way that the script drops relevant information about their relationship and their relationship with wanting to commit such a crime, is delivered in a measured highbrow fashion manner that never makes me feel like this film thinks I'm a dummy nor does it try to be too smart and become convoluted and messy. It's honestly a rather straightforward narrative, but with the way it's told and it's stylistic composure overall, you never want to take your eyes off it.
Then Orson Welles show up with around 40 minutes left in the film and with a face of constant thought and a presence that simply demands your attention (honestly reminded me of John Goodman in that sense, I wonder if Goodman loved Welles...), he leads the film to it's dramatic conclusion with a moral maybe even more relevant today than then.

I’ve always sorta loved this movie that jogs so that Anatomy of a Murder and In Cold Blood can RUN.
It’s an odd one. A much truer  inspection of Leopold/Loeb than Rope where, as in real life, the story ends up being more about the potential punishment than the crime. 
Welles plays the fictionalized Darrow and at least gives Spencer Tracy a run for his grumpily mumbling money (in the year before Inherit the Wind) with a hellzapoppin 11 minute anti-death penalty summation. Stockwell and Dillman are both fantastic and given at least a little more slack on the proverbial Rope than other thrill killers before them to portray what’s boiling in these horrible young men. 
Overall, a movie whose right to life message wears its liberality on its sleeve ends up feeling a little conservative somehow. But thanks to some good acting and great directing by Fleischer, it’s still pretty darn swell.",4.0

I tracked this down after seeing Justine Triet cite it as inspiration for Anatomy of a Fall, and while I think she topped Welles' speech at the end of this, the fact that this was made back in the 50s is remarkable. Its frequent dissection of responsibiltiy would obviously come to the forefront of people's minds in the decade following, but here it's done in a way that blends Hitchockian themes with philosophy, that's ultiamtely wrapped up with the ending speech.
It's really well shot too, it takes a lot from Hitchcock in this regard, but it works in its own way to introduce the theme of insantity and superiority complexion with the way the camera is placed. It just gives it that uncomfortable vibe that a lot of films back then didn't have, many of which were shot pretty plainly (particularly courtroom dramas), as the big hits were plays.

"I was particularly interested to watch this because it's based on the same real life story adapted into Rope by Hitchcock, my favourite of his works.
I have never read the play Rope or the novel Compulsion, nor know much of the original story, so I don't know how it goes exactly in the original material but Compulsion and Rope were different in all aspects except for the 2 main characters and the topic of morality, justice, human emotion. Compulsion became a courtroom drama while the events in Rope unfolded in a much more closed space, but with all the same power Compulsion had.
I wasn't so fond of how the spotlight suddenly shifted to Jonathan, played by Orson Welles, and how our two offenders faded into the background. Artie was a consistently outspoken and fierce character that I wanted to see more of. I do like how they showed the emotional manipulation he plays on Judd, who's probably just really gay for him and it comes out as obsequious submission. Lol.",3.0

"It started off kind of weak in the first 1/3 because it tackles the characterization of the two villain protagonists in a way that makes them almost cartoonish (especially Strauss), and the only scene worth remembering from this first act is the confrontation between Steiner and the professor as it tries to give an insight on the motive of their (future) homicide. From the 2nd act onwards (where the prosecutor presses Steiner about the lost glasses) the events finally get better from a pacing perspective and they resolve into a decent ending in which the devil's advocate (Orson Welles) delivers a speech against the death penalty, which is the point of the entire movie. An average movie that doesn't display much but that is still serviceable.",2.5
"Through this film, Fleischer shows the questioning of the death penalty, and the consequences of society when it is applied. a more than sensitive topic, especially to disgusting and cynical people like Judd and Arthur.
Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman were incredible. They embodied the cynicism and the most perverse of these two murderers.",4.0
ordon welles is kind of a mid actor. the courtroom stuff was the worst part of this movie unfortunately,3.5
"Twelve years after Rope, we have a more direct adaptation of Leopold & Loeb’s murder investigation and trial, albeit still fictionalised. Nathan Leopold, on whom Dean Stockwell’s character Judd was based upon, tried to block the production of the film, on the grounds that the mixing of fact and fiction had defamed him. The state supreme court rules that he couldn’t be defamed after pleading guilty to “the crime of the century”. 
The film is fascinating in that the true thrust of it is about the political message of justice for all, and against capital punishment. The film all but has the murderers twirling moustaches in black hats with the amount of depth they’re written to have— but the defence still argues that they shouldn’t be killed even though they’re killers. The defence attorney is constantly making sure that the defendants are afforded the best defence, as the law was written to afford them, despite the mob (and Klan) mentality of the community. Framing the sentencing of the death penalty as being a premeditated killing, with the state preparing months for their deaths, is an incredibly compelling argument. 
The film is less interested in the ideology of the killers. Nietzsche’s theories get some lip service, but never at the forefront. The film doesn’t have an interest in that moral question as much as the one surrounding capital punishment. The closest we get is when Judd is talking with Ruth, but it’s far more played as her personifying an appeal to decency and his struggles to be straight; the film might be more relevant to the topic of incel radicalisation than homosexuality or the Übermensch.
While Rope certainly tied the killers’ queerness to their superiority complex and desire to kill, this film is even more homophobic in its queercoding. There’s a sense that Judd, based on Leopold, could have been cured from his diabolical impulses with the love of a girl. There’s a deeper connection in the film that homosexuality is the evil impulse, and curing it would be a cure for senseless evil. And where Rope depicted its killers just like any bickering couple, Judd & Artie have a more volatile and obsessive dynamic; there is no way to mistake them for having been romantic and loving to each other. Hitchcock used the subtextual idea that they were truly in love and caring for each other to emphasise the salacious nature, to make audiences uncomfortable, where here it’s just an aspect of villainy. 
Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman are great in their roles. While I wish the script delved a little deeper into them as people, they pick up that slack. Of course the film is built around having Orson Welles deliver the big speech at the end, and that of course is the highlight of the film. 
The film is a lot more procedural, but following the guilty party. It’s so focused on the things that happen, far more than the people who make the events happen. It’s an effective “true crime” drama, and has a good political point to be made, but it’s no surprise that Rope is the film that stood the test of time.",4.0

Lo que en un primer momento parecía nada más que un thriller de crimen y condena, que lo es, termina exponiendo un relato sobre la represión (homo)sexual, la moralidad, la justicia y la diferencia de clases el cual, aunque no esté del todo de acuerdo con su mensaje, propone continuos debates de los que son imposible no dejarse seducir.

"American True Crime Drama.
Compulsion is a prickly presentation of the psychologically corrupt human animal, based on the infamous case of Leopold and Loeb, directed by Richard Fleischer, starring Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as the mismatched killers with a superiority complex, and Orson Welles as the Palladian defense attorney, that is a pristine piece of film, more artistic than astute, but with characters who know how to talk but not when to shut up, featuring a credible examination of class consciousness, intellect as identity, and the sometimes paradoxical facets of law that demands adherence but proposes apathy.
Welles is larger than the law, all prosthetics and rotund poses. He takes charge of the film in the second half: that might sound appealing but it means we see and hear less of Dean Stockwell as the emotionally fervid rake who can't keep a lid on himself. Stockwell gives the best performance, and a performance it is of a dangerous weakling, embittered and insecure. Bradford Dillman is the caddish swain who knows to talk but can't disguise his pernicious demeanor. There are some taut interrogations and competing dialectics that present various perspectives on the master/slave dynamic and the purpose of law and occasional futility of human relations where no amount of philosophizing rhetoric can sway a wicked and entitled soul. At best, the law is an elastic leash, not a muzzle, and those who want to commit murder will do so, and everything after the fact is wordplay and flimsy logic.
The film looks like a silver antique, with shimmering photography and quaint set designs. Director, Fleishcer, creates a lucid atmosphere in a small town where somethings has gotten in the water, or at least in the tea of two preening upstarts with no way of asserting themselves without subverting others. I liked the film, but there is a lack of tension in the second half when the outcome is inevitable, and not even Orson Welles' last ditch peroration can accentuate what is a basic plot. The characters are interesting for their malicious outlook and ability to bluster. Compulsion is a worthwhile venture for showing how thrilling a film can be with capable actors and competing ideas. Although it doesn't ensnare the human animal that is compelled to murder, it does go some way to elucidating the fact the animal will continue to hunt and defy its own ability to empathize and withdraw.",3.5

"Two self appointed ""geniuses"" who are actually psychologically unbalanced decide to kidnap a murder a schoolchild in order to perform a philosophical exercise. When one of them leaves a crucial bit of evidence at the crime scene the two of them scramble to add confusion to the polic and throw them off course only for them to link them to the crime.
Once arrested the two of them go on trial for kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder and it is up to their lawyer to try and get them off or at the very least spare them the death penalty.
The two main characters are reprehensible individuals with no morals whatsoever and are psychotic at the very least. They seem to think their wealth, status and intellect give them carte blanche to commit murder and rape at will.
Once it becomes a courtroom drama it tends to drag a little as Orson Welles as a great an actor as he is tends to drone on for too long. Otherwise a fantastic film despite its dark subject matter.

He reads more like ""humanity is the devil, look at me the wrong way and I'll squeeze the life from your useless neck"". You know. Also, the female character in it makes no damn sense at all.

"""Due studenti di filosofia, tentano di mettere in atto il crimine perfetto. Tuttavia, incautamente, lasciano dietro di loro delle tracce che potrebbero farli uscire allo scoperto"". Diretto da Richard Fleischer, è un thriller basato sul romanzo ""Compulsion"", scritto da Meyer Levin e a sua volta ispirato al caso giudiziario ""Leopold e Loeb"", che aveva già ispirato Hitchcock nella realizzazione del suo ""Nodo alla gola"". Ma l'approccio di Fleischer è profondamente differente da quello di Hitch, sia per struttura che per intenti, mentre la qualità della confezione si pone al medesimo livello di quella del maestro del brivido: La regia elegante di Fleisher, la fotografia prestigiosa di William C. Mellor, ma anche la solida sceneggiatura, elevano un film molto interessante nei contenuti, ma anche ben recitato da tutto il cast. Rinunciando a inseguire suspense e colpi di scene, Fleisher indaga elementi come il bisogno di combattere la noia, il bisogno del riconoscimento e la scarsa comunicazione all'interno dei nuclei familiari, resi ancora più distanti dalla certezza che una buona posizione economica basti a sopperire ogni bisogno. Il film risulta così molto stuzzicante, pur scricchiolando un poco nella parte centrale, dedicata alle indagini e che si rivela solida, ma poco intrigante e non perfettamente ritmata. Tuttavia, con il sopraggiungere in scena di Orson Welles, il cui personaggio resta confinato nel terzo ed ultimo atto, la qualità si impenna; il suo Jonathan Wilk, ennesima grande maschera di un regista che è stato anche grandissimo attore, si guadagna subito la nostra simpatia, grazie al carisma, la battuta pronta e la curiosità che suscita l'idea di vederlo risolvere un caso apparentemente irrisolvibile; la sua battaglia in aula non sarà però un'elaborata partita a scacchi, ma un confronto dove ci si affida principalmente ad una ragione più profonda e malleabile, che colpisce al cuore, perché inevitabilmente li deve mirare, magari anche sfiorando la retorica, ma con una passione ed una lucidità rare. ""Frenesia del delitto"" si rivela allora thriller di pregevole fattura, impegnato e angosciante, che si chiude lasciandoci alla mercé di un piacevole dubbio.

It is curious to see how the trends marked so much what was done at the time, with Rope and Dial M For Murder already existing before this, how the concept of murder was revisited suddenly after Psycho, which was only a year later to see that they began to be murderers like Max Caddy that included more violence.
In general, the film derives a lot from what it proposes, it's even like Rope but without Hitchcock, but it has certain virtues at the beginning that make it interesting, in the end a lot is lost but well, it makes itself understood.

I decided to have a double feature of this one and Rope. I've seen the Hitchcock film several times, but this was only my second viewing of Compulsion. I really liked it the first time and liked it even more this time. It's a very compelling story and it's told extremely well. Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman are both really good in the two lead roles and E.G. Marshall turns in some good work too. Orson Welles shows up over an hour into the movie, but leaves a lasting impression. His performance in the courtroom scenes is wonderful, delivering the well written speeches to their full potential. There are some great moments throughout this one and overall, I think it's a terrific movie. The best film directed by Richard Fleischer from what I've seen.

"Underrated piece of demon twink cinema. Not as cinematically flashy as Rope (the other film based on the famous intellectual gay murderers), but still loaded with fierce acting performances by Dean Stockwell, Bradford Dillman, and even Orson Welles even though he doesn’t show up until 67 minutes in and monologues pretty much nonstop through the last 15 minutes (really it’s one of the most monologues of all time).
Though I’m still bitter that Roddy McDowall, who originated the role of Artie Straus on stage, didn’t get to reprise this role on film, I do find that I’m not mad about Bradford’s portrayal of the more dom-leaning of the two killer gays, as I think he does a great job of capturing that cold yet confident exterior that sociopaths have sometimes. However, I’m a little let down that there’s a lack of emotional empathy in the screenplay for his character that is allotted to his less sociable accomplice (Stockwell’s character), which I recall being a little more prominent in the play’s libretto.
This would make a pretty interesting companion piece in a double feature with Rope that I may try out sometime, mostly to compare some intricacies on how both narratives capture the same real-life incident, and the conceits about human morality that each leads to.",4.0

Wild that this isn’t brought up nearly as often as the other great Welles performances.",4.5

the first 2/3 of the movie? awesome, like, really good - and im not saying this just because i love the (very real) cold blooded murderers that are obviously queer trope. bringing up another hitchcock parallel: the two main characters and their planning and execution of the murder remind me of bruno from strangers on a train (hey, they even have the 'glasses on the crime scene' thing in common!!!). the opening scene with the car and the dialogue in front of arties house, painting a perfect portrait of the reckless criminal and his obsessed partner (in crime)??? thats peak cinema right there
and if the movie was that - tension and arguments and planning alibis and ""you want me to order you, judd?"" - it would've made my top 10, no kidding
but the trial finale!!! ugh... what can i even say? yes, orson welles was fucking great, in fact, he made the last 30 minutes worth it. but i have a deep grudge against trial scenes (that one episode of iasip not counting)

"Morality and perspective are the names of the game here. Compulsion deals with the murder of a young man by two other young men. The innocence of the suspects is not even the forefront question. After innocence, the movie's main conflict arises from the state attorney's push for the death penalty. Is the guilty member ( the boys being 18 and 19) really deserving to be executed? Or has the wealth and luxury that they grew up in twisted public perception of the case?
Compulsion successfully pulls off some techniques that have fallen out of style in modern movies yet still feel remarkable. Focus is constantly shifting around scenes, the camera usually stationary and the the actors weaving in out of being the centre of attention, baton passing when their time is up and then remerging when you least expect it. This revolving door of intentionality that every character fluidly enters and exits causes Compulsion much like Richard Fleischer's earlier work ""The Narrow Margin"" to be dynamic and constantly shifting.
The dialogue is fully loaded, snappy and free from any excess fat. Everything that the characters say feeds into a later point or helps inflate the balloon of reasoning that they carry around over their heads to justify their actions. If we all conducted ourselves at the same rhythm that the cast of Compulsion do, life would be extremely fast paced and never boring.
Orson Welles is in here and it's the first movie I've seen him act in. There is something so magnetic about how little of a shit he seems to give. Everybody in this movie is so perfectly put together, not a stitch or hair out of place. Orson Welles tumbles into the scenes as the two defendants lawyers in the final act of the movie. Slurring, disheveled, greasy and overweight, most of the time you can't tell what he is saying and he'd have agreed with you. But when he switches it on, he's on. He goes from being completely at odds with the presentation of the delivery of the movie up until that point, to an absolute captivating dynamo. Welles' personality bleeds through in a way that most actors will never achieve.
My biggest issue with the movie is how at war each end of it are. The first half is full of suspense. If I was watching it by myself I would have had to pause because of how much the tension was building up in my breath. The main characters meticulously crafted plans unravel as they deal with the imperfections of humanity that they, through their intelligence wealth and education, have convinced themselves they are above. Then the final act which is probably more than 40% of the movie deals with a court room drama. It rolls up its sleeves and tackles the question of morality. The problem is it keeps asking the same question over and over again, wording it differently. That line of interrogation ends up with a monologue by Welles that lasts for a couple of minutes before abruptly cutting to the credits. That's what irritates me.
The first half of Compulsion is so well assembled that nothing is directly spelt out for the viewer. Characters intuition levitates out from their action. We have the same epiphanies as the characters and the plot pulses forward from our understanding and not the scripts cumulative movement. One fine example of that, is when the two boys are being interviewed about their statements. The police find a piece of evidence that they think will force them individually to crack, so they wonder who they should tackle first. The camera never enters the room of the second boy, because it never needs to. We fill in the blanks. That all goes out the window when Orson Welles hits the screen. His ponderous speech slowing everything down to a crawl and it's mostly pure exposition. I don't think there's anything wrong with the acting but there is in the context in how it fits into the rest of the movie.
I really liked Compulsion and it's aged well, but I can see why it's not as well remembered as some of the other court room dramas of this period.",3.5
Oddly ordinary. And the set piece speech at the end goes on for centuries.,2.0
"""Compulsion"" is a film suffering from an identity crisis, unable to figure out what it really wants to achieve or what grand philosophical statements it wants to make. Narrative intrigue and psychological insight are substituted by a flimsy sense of ambiguity. The writing is inconsistent and sometimes unconvincing, even some of the best performances fall victim to it. What saves this film is the direction of Fleischer and the presence of Orson Welles. This is nothing more than an ordinary thriller with problematic writing. But if this film is watched without too much analysis, it can be quite enjoyable on a superficial level.",3.0
"Part of 100 Years, 100 Movies, Pt. 5
wow what a frustrating experience!
Like, there was a lot of good stuff here that I enjoyed— Orson’s climactic monologue, basically every scene where it’s just the two boys. None of the rest of the film really lived up to the absolutely great pre-credits sequence, but the scene in Leopold’s bedroom at least came close; “Do I need to order you to do it?” indeed (look I know they are not Leopold and Loeb in this film but I promptly forgot the characters names its not important)
However, those good parts are like a third of the movie at best, with another third being passable filler and another third (basically everything with Ruth) being just execrable filler
I do not need to see a girl forgiving a dude for attempted rape just because he felt bad about it like I don’t mind conflicted morals or even murder husbands but I do have a line and evidently that’s it
It scratches a deep Hyde Park itch that I didn’t really know I had but on the whole maybe just watch the first five minutes and then go watch Rope instead",3.5
"Terribly overlooked film that presents a fictionalized version of the Leopold and Loeb case. (I was intrigued that the homoerotic overtones were actually much more apparent- now, at least- in the ten-years-older Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, also based on the Leopold and Loeb case.) Bradford Dillman is terrifying as a sociopath who among friends and strangers can turn into a glad-handing bon vivant, without giving any hint of his vicious instincts. Dean Stockwell gives a near-perfect performance as the Nietzschean intellectual with a deeply wounded vulnerability- his early career really peaked with this film and Long Day's Journey into Night, until his career came back in the 80s. (Sad to think of the missed opportunities for him in the two intervening decades.)",4.0
"Would not be surprised in the least if this was one of Sorkin's favorite movies.
I was more interested when it seemed to be a cautionary tale about basing your entire personality on logic, facts, and reason and the demented places and people it will lead you to, but Orson Welles had to show up an hour in and deliver probably his worst performance - at which point the movie becomes a pretty basic moral case against the death penalty based on turning the other cheek. Really nothing new here that probably was already somewhat stale even for the 50s.
I found Welles's mumbly, sighing, 1000 IQ character to be kind of insufferable in that he feels more like a dumb guy's idea of a smart guy than anything, and made me think lesser of the movie as a whole. Of course, his big speech that amounts to ""death penalty won't bring back the dead, you heathens"" needed adequate time to get a shot of everyone in the court room solemnly closing their eyes and dropping their heads in shame.
In the end, the movie's message is not a cautionary tale against being a logic freak, it's that being a logic freak is good so long as you believe in God.",2.0
"Don’t mind me I’m just googling who won the Best Actor/Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1960 because there is NO WAY they could have been any better than Orson Welles in this film. No chance. No clue whether he would have been categorised as lead or supporting but whew, what a performance.

"A gripping film that follows the same notorious murder case as that depicted in Alfred Hitchcock‘s near masterpiece Rope, only here the film is less concerned with being technically complex and instead largely concentrated in character and psychology. Orson Welles, effectively underplaying, doesn’t show up until the last third, whilst the two leads - a swoon-worthy Dean Stockwell and a scene-stealing Bradford Dillon - are excellent.

The big kahuna here of course is Orson Welles, who rolls in late in the picture as a Clarence Darrow-ish Attorney, who gives a fantastic 20 minute oratory on the evils of capital punishment. It's a real showstopper but the whole movie is excellent. This would make a nice double feature with Hitchcock's 'Rope', which covers similar ground.",0.0

Of course, when Orson Welles shows up it essentially becomes his movie… Which is a bit jarring at first but my God he gives such an incredible performance with major bravado and heart and compassion that really ties the entire movie together.

When Orson Wells shows up it's gets very interesting. He's a lawyer who seems old, tired and lethargic but speaks plainly. Much of those part of the film hinges on legal definitions vs popular/medical definitions of words.

"One of the most notorious true crime cases in American history, the murder of a young boy by Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. and Richard Albert Loeb, became a media frenzy and went on to inspire several films, with this 1959 fictionalized version sitting in the middle of the three most famous adaptations (along with Alfred Hitchcock's Rope and the 1992 indie Swoon).
This version taken from a bestselling 1956 novel by Meyer Levin, a journalist on the real Leopold and Loeb case, downplays the gay overtones of the story (far more accentuated in the other two films) and instead focuses more on the courtroom aftermath, with a major female character thrown in to make it palatable for audiences at the height of the Production Code. Fortunately these changes have little negative impact on the film, which still remains a solid piece of drama with several strong performances including a great turn by Dean Stockwell and a showy turn by Orson Welles (as a renamed version of Charles Darrow), who doesn't turn up until the final third but gets the biggest climactic scene.",4.0

"Compulsion has the same setup, Nietzschean philosophical underpinning, and murder as Rope, except, instead of murdering a Harvard alumnus, they're University of Chicago law students/killers. If Judd (Dean Stockwell) and Artie (Bradford Dillman) are smart enough to matriculate at one of the top law schools in the land, how were they dumb enough to sign a confession, each blaming the other? It's like the Menendez brothers thirty years too soon.
It's also interesting that murder that is the central turning point in the story happens offscreen. We know our handsome duo are guilty because Judd is berated by Artie for his mistakes: his absently leaving his glasses at the scene of the crime and failing to properly dispose of the typewriter that was used to compose the ransom note. Both Dillman and Stockeell are excellent, certainly as compelling as John Dall and Farley Granger in Rope.

What's different from Alfed Hitchcock's adaptation from the stage is midpoint turn that reverses course and has Artie and Judd give opposing statements during their arrest. Artie misleading the police by giving them the names of teachers who called him a spoiled brat and could be suspects in the boy's disappearance is comical and clearly antcipates the inept and ineffectual police forces of the Italian gialli.
The story ending in a courtroom doesn't have the emotional resonance that vibes with Artie and Judd's psychotic philosophy. If some superman gets to make moral decisions above and beyond the laws of the land, it won't be this judge. The obligatory scene, the boys' recognition that they are not superman, is missing, but what their defense lawyer argues is that Artie is schizophrenic and Judd has no capacity for human emotions.
Diagnosing them at the end of the movie was anticlimactic. When does Artie manifest symptoms of schizophrenia? Judd suffers turmoil from being unable to emotionally connect with anyone, a very moving scene with the girlfriend of the reporter paying his way through law school.

The billing of this movie is screwy. The late entrance of Wilkes (Orson Welles) the famous trial lawyer known for representing defendents in capital murder cases isn't necessarily grandstanding but his role is written as one long argument against execution. When he doesnt even show up until the last act of the movie, why does Orson Welles get top billing-- which seems disrespectful towards the actors who did the heavy lifting?",0.0

"Let's get the elephant out of the room first and say that Compulsion has no relation whatsoever to Hitchcock's Rope other than being based on the same true story, which it similarly fictionalizes (though, it must be said, a whole lot less, with little more than the names changed here from the actual Leopold and Loeb case). The approach is totally different here. We're in true crime thriller territory for the first hour, building up the world, characters and psychological motivations for a shocking murder (which, perversely, we never actually see, as the killing of a young boy was even more taboo in the 1950s than it is now). For the second half, we move into a combo of procedural interview and courtroom drama, and it is here that Orson Welles' lawyer takes over the story, leading it into some interesting areas regarding the death penalty and all understandable objections to it. Despite being set in the 1920s, Compulsion has the feel of a 1950s noir in its framing, outlook, and musical styling, but this latter half, by embracing a slower, somber tone which culminates in Welles' tour de force 10-minute-monologue closing statement, turns the film into a distinctive first installment in director Richard Fleischer's ""true crime"" trilogy - the latter two films in this being The Boston Strangler (1968) and 10 Rillington Place (1972). Like those films, Fleischer's initial entry wonders as much about what makes a killer as about how a horrible killing can ever be punished - and, in this respect, has more in common with Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and its film adaptations than noir or, again, the Hitchcockian template.
Welles is so good and so invested in his role it is a surprise to know that he clashed badly with Fleischer and considered the film abominable well after the fact. (His character, incidentally, is based on the same real life figure Spencer Tracy's was patterned on in Inherit The Wind, so you could have both films in a double bill and get oodles of subtext on the events and times that birthed them.) Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman are both fantastic as the submisive/dominant duo of killers (despite, again perversely, the film being censored of all the real life case's homoerotic subtext even more than Rope had been) and there is enough depth and sensitivity in their portrayal to make the storytelling complex and as far from distortion or caricature as it could be. There's able support by Diane Varsi, E. G. Marshall and Martin Milner. All in all, a splendid crime drama.",4.0
"“And you know why I tried it Juddsie? Because I damn well felt like it.”
The Leopold-and-Loeb murder case has had a certain influence for my novel and, having no idea the film was based on this case when I pressed play, I remember letting out a humourless little snort and feeling unjustifiably mad because the first 25 minutes — including the twisted dynamic between the two leads — were quite close to what I had written back then, except for a few details in terms of personality and their personal philosophies.
The obsession with someone, that little perverse urge that pushes you to become someone you're not and do things beyond your moral compass, is a very enticing theme. To lose yourself in the other, to develop this twisted loyalty, to be this close — it's all very intimate, all very erotic and thrilling. All. Very. Dangerous. These are the kinds of things I like to write about but, also, to watch. For I know a great deal about obsession, having been the obsessed at one point in my youth but also, more regularly for the past few years, the one being obsessed about (and God am I aware of how self-centred this sounds but, of course, you know I don't mean it that way.)
Crime as an act of love. Genesis : 4. Love requires sacrifice. God loved Adam and Eve. And even in their sin, he clothed them with skins. Leather. Animal skins. Something had to die for God to love them. Blood has been shed for it. Judd accepted to kill for Artie, the same way my narrator in my novel, Oliver, did for Wilhelm. The act is atrocious. It is ugly. Judd did it out of a desperate desire for love and a morbid need for consideration from Artie's part. The only way to prove himself worthy of the other was to kill, to join him in this folie.
Orson Welles was striking in this. He had a certain coolness, a command of the room that was captivating. The kind, I find, is becoming rare nowadays in cinema. His monologue about justice made me vaguely think about the Eumenides, Aeschylus' third play in his Oresteian trilogy. In both stories, the characters contemplate the concept of justice and the consequences of actions as well as the idea of justice being more than just retribution, but rather involving forgiveness and compassion. In the Eumenides, The tumultuous chorus of Furies symbolized vengeance, while the goddess Pallas Athene stood for justice. The furies, here, are the crowds shouting for blood, it is the state's attorney, it is the jury. Pallas Athene is Wilk, asking for justice, not blood.
PALLAS ATHENE: Whoever are you? I speak to all in common, both this stranger seated at my statue, [...] and you who are like no kind of begotten things, neither belonging to goddesses seen by gods nor yet resembling human forms. But to speak I'll of people at hand who give no cause for blame, is to assume a right far distinct from justice.
Well, of course, I could say so much more about this movie: the way the two leads remind me of the characters in one of my favourite novels; I could talk about the (homo)eroticism of such dynamic bordering on the dominant/submissive — and initially, I wanted to. But I'm afraid my best friend already pointed those out anyways and she did it beautifully enough. Thus it ends. Acta est fabula.",4.5

"so queer and filled with tension right from the get-go, oh my GOD.
stockwell and dillman are so electrifyingly deviant, neurotic, paranoid and witty as the lead characters. they're literally amalgamations of the boys in the secret history—judd (stockwell) being richard in how he lets himself be commanded by artie, the polyglot neurotic academic that is henry, and the one who breaks under pressure and becomes hysterical more overtly in a dire situation despite the act he's trying to keep up that is charles—artie (dillman) being bunny in his flippant uppity attitude and penchant for anecdotes, the leader/commander of the crime and cover up that is henry, and the almost dandy-like upper middle class collegiate that is frances. and that makes me even more fascinated with them and their dynamic because it's almost like that of a fragile dom/sub where each of their boundaries are being tested as well as their commitment to their roles.
although hitchcock's rope (1948) precedes this film, i appreciate its exploration of the homoerotic friendship and the idea of crime as sex, more because it doesn't fight for attention with the technical marvel and novelty that was the single-shot takes, and it also doesn't seem to be so affected by the hays code, which would have been abolished 9 years after the film's premiere.

"Orson Welles is top-billed in this movie, but you have to wait a good 50 minutes or so before he turns up... and when he does the film loses its balance. We're more interested in the devilish duo of killers, especially in Dean Stockwell's character, who kills but feels twinges of remorse (it's an amazing performance, and makes one wonder why Stockwell didn't become more of a star). The first acts are a thriller about murderers, the final act is a long trawl, featuring a slightly mannered Welles (trying to be restrained and naturalistic, but with weird facial make-up that throws it all off-balance) talking endlessly about the evils of capital punishment. Another cavil would be that there's a homosexual strain here in the relationship between the killers, but the film fudges and fumbles it. But otherwise this is a really brilliant, absorbing thriller... just it loses its way a bit in the final, Wellesian stretch.",4.0

"Extremely entertaining. Bradford Dillman plays Artie perfectly. At first I thought his performance was over the top with playing the insane genius. However, the problem quickly faded away and I was charmed by his confidence and cleverness whenever he would address the authorities. Sadly I can’t say the same for Dean Stockwell’s Judd. He played the character alright but Judd was written as a robot. He was someone in strict denial of any emotional experience and determined to prove that his intellect places him in a superior position when compared to the rest of the world. Besides the idea of him, as a consequence, having the “emotional maturity of a seven-year-old,” there was no more nuance to the character. 
When Orson Welles finally shows up as Jonathan Wilk,  he does quickly start to steal the show. I think this is more so because the focus fully shifts away from Artie and Judd than purely because of his performance though. His assured confidence shines in perfect contrast to Harold Horn. Even though I would say I was engaged the entire time, I did feel like Wilk’s final monologue went in for too long, spelled things out too clearly, and just started to feel redundant the longer it went.
Overall I think this was surprisingly entertaining from start to finish with some truly clever moments and pretty good performances. Even though no moment jumps out at me as particularly strong or moving, there was also no drop in the pace. Spending more time to develop Artie and Judd would have only benefited the film even more, though. In the end, their characters feel too flat to ground the story into reality and allow the audience to truly question the implications of wealth and status in a person’s moral compass and ego.",3.0

"More than Rope, this happens to be my preferred version of a case that's almost reached its centenary. A galvanizing, procedural thriller has more grit than two murderers who hosted some morbid soirée, right? Strangely enough, Compulsion lacks the reputation of Hitchcock's film, likely because Fleischer is less renowned. And while I enjoyed what came before (the one-take illusion, the trunk-hiding slyness), it faltered by trying to justify why both men shouldn't have killed. There's really no moment in this Leopard and Loeb adaptation where the audience are treated like morons. I'd contend, too, that Fleischer's time-lapse image of Judd's eyeglasses (when he's interrogated for hours and then appears in the frame), is the best flourish overall. Maybe the rest isn't quite distinct on a formal level, but that's not what I'll remember. It's going to be the courtroom showdown with a dejected rebuke of Capital Punishment (wearily expressed by Orson Welles for 11 minutes), proposing Judd and Artie's imprisonment instead of a hanging. (""Yes, but here are officers of the state who for months have planned and schemed and contrived to take these boys' lives."") To redirect a trial from those who murdered seems downright bold, rather than favoring the defense's claims. When has that occurred elsewhere?
Disagreeing with Wilk's sincere declaration is besides the point. And there's no doubt that some will over a kid's senseless murder. Still, I was enraptured by how that third-act unfolded, which differs to what another actor playing a prosecutor would do. Apparently there's a faction who believe that Welles is comatose? The exhausted, taciturn manner he delivers this speech is equally effective (if not more), than the clamorous delivery it's often conveyed as. When the verdict is told, Wilk gives one of the all-time closers to his combative client (""Are you sure, Judd? In those years to come, you might find yourself asking if it wasn't the hand of God who dropped those glasses. And if he didn't, who did?""), eerily condensing the whole Nietzschean angle which drives its narrative. As is Artie's remorseless disrespect of the case, submitting he'd rather be hung instead of wasting three months in court. But the clincher is Dean Stockwell's frightening response to these words (in one of his greatest, clammiest performances), and knowing that Leopold was an Atheist, gives that ending a wallop. (Bradford Dillman gets the loathsome smugness just right, though I do think Stockwell upstages him.) In any case, for a courtroom drama, it's ruthless without mawkishness and wholly unique for this subgenre.
Now I'll revert. Startling from the first scene, a dominant-submissive friendship has Artie order Judd to run over a drunk hitchhiker (just as they've stolen a car), yet there's no collision. Prior to that, however, Artie lashes out at Judd for purposely missing their prey. Soon enough, Judd tries to redeem himself with an experiment. ""Detached, with no emotional involvement. And no reason for it, except to show that we can do it"", he asserts, even if the plan to kill a boy and put the cops on false leads is Artie's instead. From then on, a twisted take on Nietzsche's Übermensch ideology is imposed as these rich graduates are convinced they're immune to law. One particular sequence (as Judd challenges his professor about disobedient tribal leaders) allows Stockwell to be coldly forthright, exuding fierceness on par with Brother Cavil in Battlestar Galactica. On the other hand, like tearfully preventing himself from rape, is a layer where a female victim seems more scared for him, rather than herself. All at the quietness of Hegewisch Park where Judd takes Ruth for an ornithology tour. That she eventually goes on the stand to show empathy for him (who her boyfriend, Sid, is livid to learn about his former friend), makes the situation thornier.
There's a series of gratifying details that become parceled out in the aftermath. Judd's mistake to leave his eyeglasses around Paulie's corpse (which gets elaborated with the assumption he couldn't be found with 4,000 different pairs), left me riveted when District Attorney Horn mentions that a unique hinge was substantive evidence. (Just like 12 Angry Men, E.G. Marshall utterly engages with his logical, thorough breakdown in analyzing a situation.) Was also enamored by the choice to form a dual alibi where Artie deliberately seems confused over Judd's story with two women (because if he answered instantly, it'd seem obvious!), only to have that thrillingly quashed by the chauffeur's truth. A gripping lead-up occurs from earlier, too, where Sid speaks with the group (""Eyeglasses, you know? Police thought they belonged to the boy, but they looked pretty big to me""), to which Artie brutally makes his hand bleed. Artie's affable meddling to ""help"" Lieutenant Johnson around the neighborhood kept me enthralled, including the querulous dynamic between Max's protection for Judd (as concerned brothers do, all but rendered pointless), until all we can do is wait for the banged gavel. An impactful re-enactment from start to finish, deftly avoiding the simplified route it could've taken.",4.0

"A very well-executed crime film that has a muddled message. The movie shifts focus away from the two murderers around 2/3 of the way through and becomes weaker as a result. Although Orson Welles enters in at this point, his on screen presence isn't enough to offset the diminished screen time of the more compelling murderer characters. I'd rather the latter half of the movie took a more Crime and Punishment oriented approach and studied whatever guilt or internal conflict exists in the mind of the junior partner and slightly less evil member in the murderous duo. The movie seemingly can't decide whether there are any redeemable qualities to the murderers and whether they feel bad about anything. Instead, the final courtroom scenes are focused on the morality of the death penalty, which seems to not really fit with the rest of the movie aside from a brief scene in a law classroom early on. I couldn't get myself on board with most of the arguments made by Welles' character, arguments which an uncharitable viewer might interpret as 'the rich are the real persecuted members of society'. The single word I would use to describe this movie is 'absence'. Absence of a depiction of the murder. Absence of the murder victim on-screen. Absence of the characters full confessions. Absence of a single point of view character. The many ways that this movie frustrates me somewhat makes me like it more than if it had just stuck to a standard and reliable 50's crime thriller template.",3.5

"Contrairement à ce que peut laisser supposer le titre français, il ne s'agit pas de sonder un mal qui serait universel, mais plutôt d'élaborer une puissante diatribe envers la peine de mort. Tout le film est conçu ainsi, de sa présentation initiale jusqu'à son plaidoyer final, afin de mettre à mal les principaux arguments des partisans de l'exécution capitale. Pour que l'exercice de style soit efficace, il faut partir d'un cas extrême pour lequel toute défense crédible semble illusoire. C'est ainsi que l'on retrouve les principaux éléments de la célèbre affaire Leopold-Loeb (les noms ont toutefois été changés), dont une partie fut portée à l'écran par Hitchcock avec Rope, qui voyait deux jeunes gens de bonne famille investir tranquillement le crime car ils pensaient que leur statut socio-culturel les plaçait au-dessus des lois. Le principal mérite du film est de nous délivrer une analyse consciencieuse du sujet, privilégiant les joutes oratoires et les batailles d'idées aux théories explicatives (tant sur le plan social que psychiatrique) et aux représentations lourdement démonstratives (Shock corridor, Jacob's Ladder).

Ainsi, les causes psychologiques ne sont pas écartées, loin de là, mais simplement sous-entendues, Fleischer s'employant surtout à souligner la déraison qui gagne ses personnages, mettant en avant leur isolement (social, affectif...) et leur enfermement dans un univers fictif, purement intellectuel dirons-nous, dans lequel ils pourraient jouir d'une toute-puissance. C'est d'ailleurs sur une impression de flottement, de rêve éveillé, que s'ouvre le film, avec une séquence nocturne au cours de laquelle Judd et Arthur viennent défier le commun des mortels entre deux envolées de jazz. Les voir foncer sur la route, les cheveux au vent, au volant de leur décapotable renvoie l'image de l'insoumission, de la liberté totale, renforçant l'idée du ""tout est possible"". La réalité devient alors pour eux une matière malléable, soumise à leur désir, comme le montre leur tentative d'écraser un pauvre pochtron croisé en chemin. Ils se sentent tellement jeunes, intelligents, riches, invincibles, qu'ils ne peuvent que mépriser les autres, les ""médiocres"", leur bien, leur loi ou leur vie.

Se montrant parfois insistante, avec ces cadrages obliques sur les visages ou ces plans sur des animaux empaillés, la mise en scène se pare généralement de précision et de sobriété afin de rendre compte des troubles des personnages : le jeu sur les luminosités révèle des visages contrastés, des identités troubles, rappelant la perversion de The Servant ou la folie de Gaslight ; un simple reflet visible sur une paire de lunettes renvoie l'image d'une monstruosité sous-jacente (comme dans Strangers on a Train) ; les espaces clos (bureau, maison..) sont propices à l'exacerbation des tensions et des conflits internes (avec la famille, le frère...). Mais plus que l'image, c'est la parole qui trahit nos jeunes gens : le recours à Nietzsche, dans le simple but de rabaisser un professeur, témoigne d'une incapacité à évoluer en société ; les ordres de viol démontrent l’impossibilité pour eux d'investir pleinement la sphère affective... Le verbe révèle alors avec éloquence la déraison qui s'empare d'eux, le rapport caduc qu'ils entretiennent avec la réalité : le compromis est refusé, les arguments avancés ne sont que des croyances envers des modèles purement intellectuels, la relation à l'autre ne s'établit que sur un rapport de domination.

La grande habileté de Fleischer sera de nous montrer des personnages complexes, non caricaturaux, qui ne vont cesser de s'enfermer dans leurs illusions : penser que l'on peut vivre une liberté totale, sans se soucier du réel, relève de la folie pure. Le principe de réalité, en reprenant ses droits, ne fera que mettre en lumière leur dimension pitoyable : Arthur, se pensant intouchable, vient narguer la police pendant l'enquête, alors qu'une simple paire de lunettes va le compromettre ; Judd pense vivre une grande relation avec son compère (il faut voir la subtile prestation de Dean Stockwell à ce niveau), alors qu'il est profondément passif, attendant les ordres sans pouvoir forcément les concrétiser (la séquence du viol). Nos deux jeunes hommes pensent commettre le meurtre parfait, mais celui ne sera que minable et odieux. On appréciera d'ailleurs le recours à l'ellipse qui laisse le crime en hors champ afin de laisser toute la place à l'écran au cynisme et à la désillusion.

Si les pensées de nos jeunes meurtriers s'avèrent dangereusement illusoires, celles qui guident les défenseurs de la peine capitale le sont tout autant : quels effets dissuasifs peut avoir la potence envers des hommes qui ont un rapport au réel altéré ? Où se situe la différence entre l'application aveugle de la justice et un crime minable ? La réflexion conduite par Compulsion trouve alors sa conclusion au sein d'un tribunal, symbole de justice et de vérité, et prend la forme d'un impressionnant plaidoyer. Orson Welles, qui tient le rôle de l'avocat, s'en donne à cœur joie, dominant le devant de la scène par sa corpulence et sa voix grave, faisant admirer sa verve et son éloquence sans être gêné par la partie adverse. Tout cela est terriblement démonstratif, certes, mais il y a certains discours qui doivent être prononcés, histoire de donner tout son sens à une démarche artistique. C'est une manière comme une autre de faire rejoindre l'exercice théorique au réel.",4.0

"Yes, Welles is an excellent actor who does great work here, but he doesn’t appear until over an hour in. Before that time, this is essentially diet Rope with none of the tension or intrigue. The performances and dialogue are very 50s and the murderers’ superiority complex is more goofy and annoying than deep and interesting.
And even once Welles does show up, the courtroom scenes are nothing special besides his performance. The final speech is great, but it’s basically taken from the real life case, so I can only credit the performance, not the writing.",1.5
"Too well made to rate lower, but as an ""A"" picture based on a best seller, the script tries to please everyone and knows it can't get around production code hawks; therefore, it's alternately moralizing and sensational and always chaste: not good for a story this lurid. The lead acting is stiff in the louder, animated moments, but can be affecting when the actors choose a nuanced approach, usually in quiet, more contemplative scenes. Robinson's quite good. Welles' Clarence Darrow speech is magisterial.",3.5
"Very good movie that is split into two parts, the sensational part that has Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell just chilling us to bits as their fictional portrayal of Loeb and Leopold. Stockwell especially. They're very implied to be lovers, but seeing this is 1959. it's very implied here, and it's fascinating. Oh, the second part is with Orson Welles, and he tries to make up for not being in the first half. He plays their lawyer, and then all of a sudden, Dillman and Stockwell are playing distant secondary characters. Of course Welles gets the Important Speech in the end, but by then, who cares?",4.0

okayyy!!! had to watch this after rope to compare and contrast because it's the obvious choice. i don't think it's unpopular to say rope does it better BUT it's still interesting to watch two top notch casts and crews have the same plot from different angles. this movie is enjoyable i think judd and artie are so sooo much more fucked in the head than brandon and philip but also this is like wayyy less gay so there is that (but not for a lack of dean stockwell acting his ass off in this. carrying the gay subtext fr). i for one actually quite liked orson's monologue but i'm easy to appease with anti-capital punishment statements. this movie is fairly predictable but it's tense enough and plus the boys are crazy enough that you want to see how it all plays out. i love their final statements to orson they suck so much god bless. also hi dean stockwell.. perhaps ur craziest role i love youuuu,3.5

Lo único que le pesa son las similitudes con LA SOGA (1948) de Hitchcock. Pero Fleischer no se lo juega todo a la intriga, sino que expande el film hacia el noir con tres actos diferenciados en los que aborda el egocentrismo intelectual, las pesquisas policiales y la pena capital.",3.5

"Orson Welles è il primo nome a campeggiare sullo schermo durante i titoli di testa, ma già sai che, se va bene, lo vedrai nell'ultima mezz'ora e così è. Ora, non pretendo la prima inquadratura di Harry Lime - anche perché è insuperabile -, ma davvero non si riusciva a trovare qualcosa di meglio di un frettoloso ingresso in campo dalla porta a sinistra in un totale di una stanza affollata?
Per il resto, si assiste a una godibile trasposizione del caso Leopold e Loeb che già ispirò Nodo alla gola, con un'affiatata coppia di interpreti: come è abile Stockwell a restituire la fragilità interiore del suo personaggio, lo è Dillman a misurare il ruolo dell'euforica mente perversa. Innegabilmente, è la tensione morbosa tra i due a dare solidità alla struttura del thriller. Peccato che, al di là della sua infelice entrata in scena, sia proprio l'ingombrante presenza di Welles a sgonfiare lentamente il film, oscurandone i protagonisti e accomodandolo sui binari di un legal drama piuttosto pedante.",0.0
"The first part is a psychological and philosophical portrait of the two university students who commit the murder. It's shot with interesting cinematic style, and the mind games the characters play are riveting.
It then turns into an investigative drama and finally into a courtroom drama, at the climax of which Orson Welles, as the two men's defence attorney, delivers a very, very, very lengthy, very earnest monologue in the courtroom arguing against the death penalty.

"The true story of the Leopold-Loeb murder is one of the great true crime stories of the 20th century. I've seen a bunch of movies inspired by that notorious crime and I like most of them too.
This is one, based on a book, but a lot of facts and aspects are from the real deal. The movie and book it was based upon were even sued for libel. So it is a wee bit shameless.
The movie starts with our killers but the viewpoint slowly shifts until the final act which is utterly dominated by Orson Welles. Of all the Clarence Darrows and Darrow expies I have seen the one by Welles is a real favourite because he just seems so tired and exhausted by people and mankind.
Another more famous film based on a book based inspired by a true crime, ANATOMY OF A MURDER, is from the same year and it might suffer from comparison but this is still worth seeing. Especially since this is not strictly a trial and verdict movie like that one. You get some different beats.

"A fairly close dramatization of the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder and trial of 1924. Artie and Judd are two brilliant 19-year-old graduate students in Chicago Law School fascinated by crime and their personal aggrandizement. They kidnap a student and kill him just because they want to commit an act beyond normal morality worthy of being noticed - petty crimes hadn't cut it so far. After some steady detecting, the boys were found out and put on trial. Orson Welles, as the Clarence Darrow figure, has the impossible job of defending them.
We spend a lot of time with the psychology of Artie and Judd - the movie doesn't even show the planning and execution of the murder because seeing mere activity would take away from the time we get watching them be who they are. They are not humanized - the more time we spend with them, the more alien they seem - but we do understand them. Dean Stockwell is particularly good as Judd, the robotic and conflicted teen so sure of his own greatness yet so incapable of doing anything to show it he maneuvers his wild partner into taking the lead in the relationship. Welles performs one of the best monologues captured on film, a powerful statement against capital punishment.

"After going totally nuts with it and making the first film in the Paul Verhoeven style in The Vikings (1958), Richard Fleischer must have gotten some backlash; his next film, 1959's Compulsion, is safe, safe, safe.
As such, it is a very slick piece of entertainment, borrowing from earlier ventures into the Leopold and Loeb IP such as Rope (1948) and having no less than Orson Welles play Clarence Darrow (in his performance conflating him with William Jennings Bryan) and giving a very straight and detailed account of the 20th Century's first Crime of the Century.
It's a good, reliable movie of the 1950's liberal bent, much of the kind of Otto Preminger would become associated with in the coming decade. For my part, I regret that this is probably Fleischer's last film as auteur, but enjoy his journeyman films on their merits as well.",4.0

"Early portions often suffer from vocal stiltedness, and later scenes metamorph into Cinematic Theatricality and Speeches (well, one lengthy one really), but the former contains plenty of thoughtful lighting and framing (mainly to do with Judd’s oblique and often agitated state of mind and his general social estrangement from any given group of people) and the latter contains Orson Welles delivering a performance of great gravitas, so it gives at least as much as it takes. Still, something off about the main pairing which simply doesn’t work for me, in proximity. Individually they’re both great; Bradford Dillman is just eccentric enough to not be out-of-place in a Hitchcock film (less so than Rope I kept thinking of Robert Walker in the other Hitchcock-Granger film, Strangers on a Train), but not so overtly so as to be outdated in the often shockingly transgressive* piece of modernity that is this film (at some point I just started assuming that it was made in the mid '60s). Meanwhile Stockwell is just a piece of perfection—the ultimate model for stilted intelligence mistaking its isolation for superiority. But together the two just don’t come together all that well, and I can only assume that this is in no small part to the fact that watching glib reappropriation of Nietzsche, no matter how deliberately framed, is never that fascinating and always tends to come across as artificial. (See also: similar rhetoric in Pickpocket.) Though I’ll admit that there is something pretty funny about how easily foiled all their plans are by not only their own, plentiful failings but also just simple detective work. Otherwise the ending comes close to something truly magnificent, and, ironically, rather bluntly nihilistic. The Welles speech, though heavy in pathos, is certainly very persuasive. But after that long, cool, calm denouncement of the death sentence, against which one can hardly argue, we are once again reminded of the remorseless, mostly indifferent defendants, and suddenly all the humane pleas seem futile and meaningless when confronted against the void of humanity that the world is capable of producing. That is until Welles gives his cute Hand of God rejoinder and the film needlessly reinforces this even further with the superimposed glasses. Oh well, I guess it isn’t entirely modernistic after all.

"Beware of rich, white boys - whose also psychopaths.
Dean Stockwell does an amazing job as the troubled teen Judd. The movie slugs Abit around the mid point with all the questioning and all, but as soon as Orson Welles come on screen, the drama picks up again. Welles' Wilk delivers a very strong speech which rounds off this 1924 true crime (of sorts).",3.5
"coming from a field that understands the development of the adolescent, the conceited curiosities of Artie and Judd were no less disturbing. they have grown to have a compulsion to seek challenge at the expense of the lives of others simply because they were not provided the basic compassion they so needed in their childhood. this lack of love has created a thirst to prove themselves to an unobservant audience, an urge that cannot be solely blamed on them and rightfully not enough to cost their lives.",5.0

"Rotten Tomatoes: Critics-100%; Audience-86%
Two college kids attempt to get away with murder, literally. One is smart, the other a smart alec. One is timid, the other brazen. Both attempt to be detached but their emotions will get the better of them. But which emotions?
Although Orson Welles got top billing he's only in about the last third of the film. Most of it is carried by Dean Stockwell, Martin Miner, and EG Marshall. And they maintained my interest throughout. The only gripe I'd have about the film was the final monologue by Welles. Much too long.
One thing that made it more interesting is it was based on an actual case of two thrill-killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. I wasn't aware of this fact until they said they were getting a lawyer that was an atheist. I thought, that sounds like Clarence Darrow, famous (or infamous) for the Scopes Trial. And I was right!",4.0
"Oh the layers... Richard Murphy's screenplay - or perhaps it is Meyer Levin's novel - gives Orson Welles, as lawyer Jonathan Wilk, a lengthy monologue opposing the death penalty. The film is a fictionalized account of a real death penalty trial from 1924, the lawyer was Clarence Darrow, and you can read the actual monologue here: voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/clarence-darrow-plea-for-leopold-and-loeb-22-23-and-25-august-1924-speech-text/.
In spirit, perhaps, not so different. And yet so much is lost in the film. Darrow manages to reference poems by A E Housman and Omar Khayyam... Still, four stars for the quality of the effort, even if we never really get up underneath the dynamic between the two perpetrators.",4.0

"My take away from this. Give Orson Welles any role, any film, he's stealing the whole fucking movie.

That 10% that he is present, I forgot anyone else existed.",3.0

This film's technical aspect really shines through. The angles, choice of positioning, everything about the director's work is excellent. At least in the first two-thirds of the screening.

They stretched three phrases into 15 minutes of Orson pacing back and forth, attempting to deliver a profound speech.

This one also presents the two men as lovers (in a 50s coded fashion although explicitly so for its time) but leans into their dominant-submissive aspects more heavily.  Dean Stockwell gives a convincing performance.  The second half, about the trial with Orson Welles taking centre stage and the boys moving to the sideline, is more or less interesting depending on how much one enjoys Welles’ well-done but one note performance.

"Saturday’s film was the 1959 Leopold Loeb fictionalization “Compulsion”. Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman play the vaguely homosexual Nietzsche acolytes who in 1924 decided to kill a school boy because they were superior beings and had the right. The cast is rounded out with E.G. Marshall as the prosecutor and Orson Welles standing in for Clarence Darrow. The film is pretty limp when it comes to depicting the murder, and childish and unenlightening in its portrayal of the way these two superior intellects might talk and think. Orson Welles does his best mumbly down-to-Earth world weary gravitas, but he seems to grasp that the material is beyond the powers of his presentation. Stockwell and Dillman act their asses off to varying degrees of success; Dillman, in particular, seems, at times, to be braying like a horse. I'm not a big fan of E. G. Marshall, but it's his driven prosecutor that comes off the best in this one. It’s presented in the widescreen black and white, jazz music, neo-noir style that was popularized by “Call Northside 777” in 1949, done better by “Anatomy of a Murder” in the same year ""Compulsion"" was released, and chillingly perfected 8 years later by “In Cold Blood”.

"Probably loses half a star from the didacticism of that climatic courtroom speech, even with the grand delivery by Orson Welles. But the majority of the film has its focus on the central murderous dynamics, with Bradford Dillman and especially Dean Stockwell nailing their roles both apart and together so well. They develop a twisted, intimate psychological rapport in tandem with the script's procedural crime details compellingly. Welles may get top billing, but it's Dillman's chilling bravado and Stockwell's inner turmoil that drive the whole show.",4.0
"Working from the same basic premise as Hitchcock’s Rope, Compulsion is nominally a mixture of thriller and court drama. Strangely, I think the filmmakers wanted me to sympathise with the two remorseless murderers but I just didn’t. They’re terrifying figures and the moments where the film reconciles with this fact are its strongest. In many ways, this reminded me of Krzysztof Kieślowski‘s Dekalog (later expanded into A Short Film About Killing) but Hollywood sensibilities don’t allow its moral coldness to fully emanate from the screen. 
I love the period style and staging — there are some really great shots. Acting is a bit hit and miss. Despite only turning up in the last thirty minutes, Orson Welles is terrific. His final monologue makes this a worthwhile watch.",3.0

Los actores, además, están en estado de gracia, aunque el plato fuerte es Orson Welles, claro. Francamente comedido (para bien). Su duelo con E. G. Marshall es impagable.
Las únicas pegas que puedo ponerle son manías mías con el guion. A la relación entre ambos protagonistas (subyace una atracción sexual) y al alegato contra la pena de muerte les falta un poco de sutileza.

It’s a bit of a shaky whole, with the third act feeling weirdly rushed and the scenes with Diane Varsi sagging under her mediocre acting, but Dillman, Stockwell, and Welles are all very good, it’s got some very smart writing, and there’s at least one time-shift which feels distinctly ahead of its time (which is the film-nerdiest thing I’ve written in ages).",4.0
"“Compulsion” (so der Originaltitel) ist ein 1959 entstandener Thriller mit Dean Stockwell, Bradford Dillman, Orson Welles und E. G. Marshall. Regie: Richard Fleischer.
Der Film basiert auf dem Leopold and Loeb Mordfall aus den mittleren 20er Jahren. Zwei hochintelligente junge Studenten, die Theorien von Darwin und Nietzsche in den falschen Kopf bekommen hatten, sich den Mitmenschen gegenueber ueberlegen fuehlten, die daran glaubten, jemanden von denen zu toeten sei belanglos. Sie toeteten einen 14 jaehrigen Jungen nur um zu beweisen das sie einen perfekten Mord begehen koennen. Ein Fall der viele Filme beeinflusste, beruehmtestes Beispiel wohl das 1929 Theaterstueck und dessen 1948 entstandene Verfilmung von Alfred Hitchcock. Einige werden sich vielleicht auch noch an den (fuerchterlich schlechten) Sandra Bullock Film „Murder by Numbers“ (2002) erinnern.
Dieser Film hier, der basiert auf einem Roman ueber den Fall. Es geht darin nicht nur um den Ablauf des Verbrechens, sondern im letzten Akt ausschliesslich um das Gerichtsverfahren.
Das ganze ist ziemlich gut gelungen, der Film ist sehr sehenswert! Das Leben der beiden wird uns sehr trocken gezeigt, fast so kalt wie es die beiden waren. Stockwell und Dillman sind vorzueglich, Dillman erinnert mich irgendwie an Daniel Day Lewis. Sie begehen also den Mord (den wir nicht sehen), und die Polizei beginnt ihre Ermittlungen. Schon bald stellt sich heraus das ihr Verbrechen gar nicht perfekt war, und der Staatsanwalt taucht auf - E. G. Marshall in einer dieser Rollen fuer die er gemacht war. Es ist nicht unbedingt spannend, es ist einfach interessant.
Orson Welles. Dessen Name steht im Film an erster Stelle. Dabei taucht er erst im letzten Akt auf und ist nur fuer gut eine halbe Stunde zu sehen. Er spielt den Anwalt der die beiden verteidigt. Und basiert sehr genau auf dem echten Verteidiger der beiden: Clarence Darrow. „Compulsion“ ist der einzige auf dem Fall basierende Film der diese Person beinhandelt, wahrscheinlich weil seine Verteidigung weit mehr war als nur Verteidigung der beiden Moerder. Darrow, ein Atheist, ein liberaler, der gegen die Todesstrafe kaempfte nutzte seine abschliessenden Worte als Anklage gegen die Todesstrafe an sich. 12 Stunden lang redete er. Im Film muss das leider auf gut 20 minuten zusammengefasst werden. Doch es reicht. Welles ist fantastisch, wir sehen ihn hier in der besten Rolle die er in einem Film hatte bei dem er nicht selbst Regie fuehrte. Er im letzten Akt, das ist eine Sternstunde. Die „One Man Band“ gibt wieder alles, wir haengen an seinen Lippen.
Es ist so ;ne Rolle wie fuer ihn gemacht. Grosser Auftritt, im Mittelpunkt. Das liebte Welles. Hinter den Kulissen war alles nicht so leicht. Er noch sauer weil man ihm sein „Touch of Evil“ kaputt gemacht hatte, glaubte trotzdem noch wieder Macht in Hollywood zu bekommen, wollte die Regie des Films, bekam sie nicht. Er zeigte sich dann nicht von seiner besten Seite, Wutausbrueche waren an der Tagesordnung. Doch, und das obwohl unbestaetigt, ist offensichtlich: Er konnte seinen Text bearbeiten, einige Saetze, das ist Welles durch und durch.
So gut der Film insgesamt auch ist, der letzte Akt mit Welles stellt alles in den Schatten. Auch wenn seine Praesenz so stark ist das er die anderen Charaktere ueberschattet, ja, selbst die Story selbst ueberschattet, was letztlich als Schwaeche des Films als Gesamtwerk gesehen ausgelegt werden kann. Seine „Rede“ wurde damals gar auf Schallplatte veroeffentlicht.
""Der Zwang zum Boesen"" ist ein herausragender Film aus dem Hollywood der 50er Jahre. Ein ungeschoenter, kalter Blick, thematisch bis an die damals gesetzten Grenzen gehend, ganz ohne Kitsch, gibt auch nicht die typische Film-Psychologie der einfachen Loesungen. Irgendwie wirkt er sehr ""East Coast"", New York, sowas. Da war man immer etwas freier als in Hollywood.",5.0

"Talk about people not thinking things through!
What is it about these thrill-killers who commit the ultimate crime for the sake of proving their intellectual superiority.
By killing someone at all, people prove themselves to be no better than animals. And animals, at least, kill to eat, survive, even to reproduce. People kill people for money, lust and loathing.
Killing your own kind is not a reflection of superior intellect.
But for some reason, it's a thing.
In the United States, one of the most infamous cases is documented in Richard Fleischer’s melodrama, Compulsion. It is based on the murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks in Chicago.
You may know it better as the Leopold and Loeb murder trial.
Compulsion changes the names, you know, to protect the innocent. The real reason producers change the names in crime-based movies (and TV shows) is to protect themselves from litigation. It also allows the movie-makers artistic freedoms, better known as ignoring the truth.
There is a lot of truth in the characters played by the sententious Bradford Dillman and his sidekick Dean Stockwell. Orson Welles and E.G. Marshall play lawyers on opposite sides. Welles’ character is based on Clarence Darrow, who gave an impassioned, 12-hour “masterful plea” in hopes of seeing the two killers spared from a trip to the gallows.
At the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, Dillman, Stockwell, and Welles won the Best Actor Award. The film was nominated for the BAFTA best picture of the year; Fleischer was nominated for best director by Directors Guild of America; and Richard Murphy was nominated for best screenplay by the Writers Guild of America.
Give some kudos to Martin Milner for his performance as an up-and-coming newspaper reporter who scoops the competition. Milner became the image of the 1960s do-right police officer on the TV show Adam-12. His character in Compulsion isn’t much different than his Officer Malloy character on television.
Diane Varsi is the only actress in the movie who gets above the “also starring” line. She is Milner’s girlfriend and becomes Stockwell’s prey at one point.
Her big moment in the film is overshadowed by Welles’ final speech – shortened, thankfully, from the 12-hour closing argument of the real-life trial.
The film is loved by the Rotten Tomatoes critics. There is not one negative review of the film there. I don’t think the movie is that deserving, but it has perfect marks because of the small sample size – only 10 professional reviews.
Admittedly, I wouldn’t give it a negative review/score. It is pretty good. I would just be surprised if there were more than 85 critics out of 100 that would give Compulsion a good review.
One thing that is definitive about the film: You will know where you stand on the death penalty. Even after listening to Welles’ closing-argument scene, you will know if you’re a death-penalty proponent or not.
Quote: ""If there is any way of destroying hatred and all that goes with it, it's not through evil and hatred and cruelty, but through charity, love, understanding.”
See also: Murder by Numbers, Rope and a 1992 film called Swoon are all based on the Leopold and Loeb murders. Rope is Hitchcock’s fantastic film done with an experimental touch. Murder by Numbers had semi-star power, but lacks well behind Rope and Compulsion.
Historically: Although the story was a thinly-disguised recreation of the Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb murder case, the legal department of 20th Century Fox was still concerned about a possible lawsuit from the still-living Leopold. A great effort was made not to mention Leopold or Loeb in the movie, press releases, and interviews. However, there was apparently some poor communication with the advertising department. When the movie came out, newspaper ads stated, ""based on the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case."" Leopold sued the filmmakers. He did not claim libel, slander, or anything false or defamatory about the film. Instead, he claimed an invasion of privacy. The court rejected his claim, in part, because Leopold had already published his own autobiography ""Life Plus 99 Years"" which essentially publicized the same facts.

"Richard Fleischer’s 1959 film, Compulsion, is an exploration of Friedrich Nietzsche’s form of nihilism: its values (or the lack thereof), and its devastating results. The film is a dramatization of the real life murder that Nathan Leopold Jr and Richard Leob committed in 1924. In their places, we have Artie and Judd, the latter being our protagonist.
Early on in the film, we learn about Judd’s relationship with Nietzsche’s ideals. This is shown in a classroom scene where Judd is arguing with his professor. He questions whether or not some people are above the law. The professor explains that he believes everyone is and should be treated equal under the law, and we see that Judd disagrees. This is the core of Nietzsche’s higher-men philosophy; not everyone is equal within or subject to the law. It establishes Judd as a nihilist, and in turn his character is a representation of nihilism as a whole.
Artie is Judd’s accomplice and spiritual leader. Throughout the film, Artie commands Judd to carry out acts of violence. Each instance seems to be more heinous than the previous, starting with running a drunk man over to eventually raping and killing a friend. These acts are to be carried out detached, merely as an experiment. With the increasing depravity, Artie is pushing Judd further down the rabbit hole. This parallels with the atrocities committed in Nazi Germany, also influenced by Nietzsche's nihilism. It started off smaller, forcing Jews to identify themselves with armbands and breaking their windows, eventually leading to mass genocide. People in power (like how Artie has influence over Judd) can force others to commit atrocities by openly rejecting moral truths.
Judd is shown to reject these truths. At one point he claims that there is no such thing as sadness. This is a basic human emotion, denying its existence is psychopathic. He also poses the question, what does one life matter compared to the nine million people who died in World War One. Comparing one wrongful death to nine million wrongful deaths makes that one death seem relatively insignificant, but it is not. This logic, similar to rejecting emotions, is just another way to obfuscate the issue at hand. Pure sophistry.
Artie embodies Nietzsche’s will-to-power thesis. Artie wants to commit more and more acts of evil without any goal or end in sight, only for fun and to see if it can be done. After he kills the boy with Judd, he gets involved with the investigation. He gives the police false leads all the while building up his credibility through inviting them to dinner and being overall hospitable. He has a need to control his environment by eliminating all doubt against him.
When Artie is being investigated by the state’s attorney, he cleverly switches positions with him, reversing the roles of investigator and suspect. He avoids being in the “hot seat” where a light is shining directly in the eyes, getting the state’s attorney to sit there instead. Interestingly, this reversal of roles is slightly similar to Nietzsche’s idea of the re-evaluation of values. This is Artie dominating his environment and the people around him. He uses anything at his disposal, in this instance it is politeness and wit, to be in absolute control of his surroundings at all times.
Several symbols are used to enhance these themes. Glasses are used to show perspective. Its reflection shines light on Judd as if a holy judgement is being passed on him. Another shot shows Judd’s and the state’s attorney’s reflection in each lens suggesting there are two separate ideologies fighting against each other. The Judas goat is a symbol of nihilism and will-to-power. Its black wool stands out against the rest of the ""herd,"" an obvious representation of individualism. The goat leads the herd to their deaths and is spared because of it. This indifference to others in its species is not unlike Judd and Artie’s indifference towards their neighbors and friends.
Compulsion elucidates many of Nietzsche's philosophies. Artie and Judd take these ideas to heart and it results in nothing but pain and destruction around them.",3.5

"An interesting crime/courtroom drama from Richard Fleischer. It's about two young men who decide to commit murder for the sake of it, and their futile attempts to evade suspicion and arrest. The real highlight of the film is midway through when their families hire a famed attorney to save them from the noose, and he's played magnificently by Orson Welles. The two playing the murderers have the first half pretty much to themselves, with a few supporting characters strewn throughout, but once the trial starts Welles takes center stage, which culminates in a lengthy monologue that he delivers with much gusto.",0.0
"Essentially a double-feature in of itself, this is pretty evenly divided between the aftermath of the crime and the trial – top-billed Orson Welles doesn't even appear until over an hour in.
And man, I'd forgotten how good of an actor Orson Welles is. Nobody else could possibly have played that part so believably, and nobody else could have made something so didactic so informal and simple.
Again, I have to note Fleischer usage of space and how characters relate to it. The environments they're placed in and the placement of camera expresses so much. Of particular note is the sequence with Judd and Ruth out in the woods, and the contrast of how Judd is framed in comparison to all the tighter interiors he's stuck in throughout the rest of the movie, such as the interrogation directly after that.",4.0

The Story:
Close friends Judd Steiner (based on Nathan Leopold and played by Dean Stockwell) and Artie Strauss (based on Richard Loeb and played by Bradford Dillman) kill a boy on his way home from school in order to commit the ""perfect crime"". Strauss tries to cover it up, but they are caught when police find a key piece of evidence — Steiner's glasses, which he inadvertently left at the scene of the crime. Famed attorney Jonathan Wilk (based on Clarence Darrow and played by Orson Welles) takes their case, saving them from hanging by making an impassioned closing argument against capital punishment.
Notable Tidbit:
Welles, whose recent thriller Touch of Evil was overlooked in America (though appreciated in Europe), was bitter at not being selected to direct Compulsion. His time on the set was tense, and he threw frequent tantrums.[4]
In the early 1950s, Meyer Levin visited Nathan Leopold in prison and requested that Leopold cooperate with him on writing a novel based on the murder (the other murderer, Richard Loeb, was dead at that point). Leopold declined saying he didn't wish his story told in fictionalized form but asked Levin if he could help him write his memoir. Levin was unhappy with that suggestion and wrote the novel anyway, releasing it in 1956. The novel was called Compulsion, the book the film is based on. Leopold would read the book and reportedly didn't like it. Leopold later wrote that reading the book made him ""physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience.""
In 1959, Leopold sought unsuccessfully to block production of the film on the grounds that Levin's book had invaded his privacy, defamed him, profited from his life story, and ""intermingled fact and fiction to such an extent that they were indistinguishable."" Eventually the Illinois Supreme Court ruled against him, noting that Leopold, as the self-confessed perpetrator of the ""crime of the century"" could not reasonably demonstrate that Levin's book had damaged his reputation.
The Verdict:
Compulsion is one of those great courtroom movies in the vein of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or '12 Angry Men.' The movie has two minds, the first pondering two anarchists who believe they are mentally superior to everyone else they know, so that they can push the boundaries of society and end up killing a man. Believing that they committed the perfect crime, they are confronted by the fact that they committed many errors and that their stories do not make much sense to a discerning policeman. They immediately turn on one another and are arrested. THe second part of the film dwells on Orson Welles as their defense lawyer. What ensues is a lost cause, but he speaks impassionedly against doling out the death penalty. The movie is full of ethical quandaries that are very interesting to ponder and the acting in the movie is well worth watching.",4.0
"Sleepy courtroom drama about two intolerable assholes and a barely hinged Orson Wells, but it also stars an incredibly distracting and cute young Dean Stockwell as one of those 'absolute worst of the worst, example of rich white assholes' so....give it a go?

"Compulsion (1959), an early entry in Richard Fleischer’s filmography, tells the story of two well educated and wealthy young men who commit a crime and are ultimately put on trial. This film is an excellent example of white male privilege – these men, without a worry in the world, believe they can outsmart the police and the prosecutors. There is a pulpy sensibility in this film – the beautiful black and white CinemaScope photography gorgeously capture the suburban dwellings in which the two men reside. While we don’t witness the crime, just the aftermath, the opening sequence acts as a precursor, showing the men rob a fraternity house and repeatedly try to run over a drunk man, thus conveying their sadistic nature and giving the murder which is only expressed through dialogue by other characters a palpable realism. There is a homoerotic element between the two men with Artie Strauss (Bradford Dillman) playing the domineering and charismatic type, while his partner in crime Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) is more submissive and bookish. The film loses its edge once it becomes a courtroom drama and the focus shifts to Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) as the men’s lawyer.

Also, this finishes my Leopold and Loeb trilogy: Rope, Compulsion, and Murder by Numbers. There's also supposedly a 4th film, Swoon, that maybe I'll get to someday.
So, a good chunk of this film wasn't that appealing to me. The two lead dudes were just such shitty people, and I don't know if we were supposed to be interested in them or empathize with them or anything, but fuck them and their ideas. All the scenes with just them, I just didn't care. Sure, they do help set up all of the later stuff a little bit, but other than that they were just boring. Then things get a little more interesting once the murder investigation starts, mostly because several other characters get involved and I can get invested in how the case is going to pan out. Finally, the film gets truly excellent once Orson Welles shows up and the trial happens. There is a 15 minute or so monologue by Welles at the end of this film that I think is one of the great monologues I've ever seen. Welles lifts this film up so much that I think I came away from it forgetting the first hour or so and focused fully on the last 20 minutes.",4.0
"Fantastic, fun, but made me feel awful. The entertainment dies out halfway through. Then it becomes a lecture about morality. It's all correct, but Orson Welles' twenty minute monologue against the death penalty was hard to endure. 
Can't decide it's tone. It treats the damning evidence of the glasses as if they're the most thrilling thing ever. Would've made far more sense if it had stayed somber. Both murderers, but especially Dean Stockwell were perfect. Strangely fun and sympathetic. Arty's too playful to hate, and Stockwell is too beautiful and passionate to hate. Eventually I understand I had to despise them. Their personalities just disappeared when they realized they were doomed. That's probably accurate to life though.",4.0

"The murder committed in the 1920s by two young men, Leopold & Loeb, has been story fodder for years. There was, of course, Hitchcock's ROPE, the independent film SWOON, and a musical, THRILL ME, which recently played at the York Theater in New York.
This version stars Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as the killers who believed that they were supermen as described by Nietzsche. Though their homosexuality can only be hinted at, it's pretty apparent.
Stockwell likes Dillman to order him to do things, and at the beginning, the Dillman character orders him to run someone over. He does it. They move on to kidnapping and murder next. They have no emotional attachment to their crime, no sense of morality, and no remorse.
As brilliant as they believed they were, they're caught pretty quickly. Clarence Darrow is brought in to defend them. They get a life sentence instead of death by hanging. Loeb was murdered by another inmate in 1936; Leopold died in 1971. The two remained very much attached to one another.
""Compulsion"" is a fictionalized version of this story. Though set in the '20s, it somehow has a modern feel to it - perhaps it was the dialogue, the demeanor of the young men, but I never bought for a single second that we were in the '20s.
The cast is uniformly excellent. Bradford Dillman is sharp, cocky, energetic, and totally unlikeable as ""Arthur Strauss,"" the brains of the operation, and Dean Stockwell is fantastic as the submissive genius Judd.
E.G. Marshall plays the district attorney, and Martin Milner gives a good performance as a reporter. Diane Varsi is Milner's love interest who takes pity on Judd. She is not very effective.
Orson Welles shows up as the Darrow character, renamed here as Wilk, toward the middle of the film. He gives a powerful performance and has a huge speech to the judge at the end.
Apparently, Welles only cooperated up to a point. Everything was fine until the IRS took his salary. He left before the looping for the film was finished. The director, Richard Fleischer, had to put the missing part of the speech together from other parts of the movie, using words and even syllables. Welles was probably as detached from ""Compulsion"" as the characters were to their crime, but he has the technical ability to be very convincing in his role.
""Compulsion"" is an unsavory story, but the acting is good and the film won awards at Cannes. It's worth watching.",3.5

The acting and some of the production design are sensational and the direction is incredibly assured. Some of the editing choices and choice of score are questionable which makes me feel that the studio had no idea what film they had on their hands. This is a philosophical investigation into right and wrong rather than a by the numbers murder flick. Even with that the film is excellent on its own.",4.5

"Script is a bit pandering, though it salvages itself when it shifts into legal mode. Really only worth the watch for the performances of Welles and Stockwell since it's pretty off kilter tonally and Dillman's performance as Artie feels out of place. Left me wishing they had gotten Anthony Perkins for the Artie role... but I suppose not at the expense that would have on him being in Psycho.",3.0

"Based on the sensational true crime story of Leopold and Loeb, two young men who schemed to commit the perfect murder, Compulsion drives up the tension throughout the film’s first two acts and reaches a crescendo in the final courtroom scene, framing the masterful Orson Welles in CinemaScope as he delivers an impassioned monologue on behalf of his young clients’ lives.",4.0

"Law students Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and Arthur Straus (Bradford Dillman) kill a young boy just to see what murder is like. The two think they're smart enough to get away with it but the local D.A. (E.G. Marshall) finally busts them for it and plans on seeking the death penalty but a successful and popular lawyer (Orson Welles) decides to take the case to try and save their lives.

"I don’t have a very interesting summary or overall take away beyond this being a really unusual court room drama portraying the infamous Leapold and Loeb murder from one of America’s greatest unusual directors.
Here are my notes:
-Yet another case of liberal education rotting minds and murdering people. A vote for liberalism is a vote for murder.
-E.G. Marshall here again, trying to convict via glasses based evidence. 
-holy shit that’s Dean Stockwell
-I don’t think I’ve seen a movie dive this deep in to the idea of a hyper intellectual killing as a thought experiment.  More nuanced and psychological than I would have expected. Considering the era this came out of it’s a surprisingly subtle handling despite some melodramatic portrayals.
-holy shit where’s Orson Welles. 
-There he is. Fake nose again. Absolutely chewing the screen for all it’s worth. Does the dialogue get better because it’s him? Is it his delivery? Did he help rewrite his own dialogue?  There’s plenty that’s been said of his presence on screen. I think more than any other supporting role this cements his talent as a show stealer and stopper.",4.0
"Definitely anti capital punishment (as am I) but from a modern perspective I can’t help but be cynical about the manipulative nature of Welles’ speech as stirring as it is. I imagine the contemporary effect was different and meant to alter perspectives on capital punishment and would have been helped by essentially skirting over any visually violent aspects of the murder. Also the perpetrators are rich which definitely would trigger a lot of people now, justifiably. So yeah not sure how I feel about the film except Welles is excellent and Stockwell pretty chilling (although lol Nietzsche fanboy)",3.5
"The crimes that they committed are almost irrelevant because this is really about the death penalty. Take two arrogant pseudo-intellectuals that do a thrill kill, and make a case that they should not die. Even though Welles doesn't turn up until near the end it becomes his show. Many actors here went on to big TV roles.",3.0
People who support capital punishment are bloodthirsty psychopaths no better than the criminals they think deserve it? Yep.,4.5
"Really enjoyed this retelling of the Leopold and Loeb murder case starring Dean Stockwell and Orson Welles and some other folks. I think if it had stuck with the sort of exploitation vibe it starts off with through out the first two acts, maybe getting a little bit more into the murder and it’s planning than the fallout, it could’ve been really interesting. That said, it’s still entertaining and worth a watch.",4.0
"Compulsion is a movie that would probably play well in certain circles now, but I don't understand how most people in 2018 could go over the moon for Compulsion. Yes it has Orson Welles for about twenty minutes and the ""suspense"" plods along with a lot of superficially elegant dialogue. But the film loses much of its steam by meandering during the pretty predictable investigation plot line and spending too much time with our unlikable ""protagonists."" Also, the film's championing of these characters by arguing for mercy towards what amounts to a pair of reckless child killers sounds uncomfortably similar to Brock Turner and the subsequent controversies. I'm sure it played fine in the Post-McCarthy boom of American Privilege in the late 50s, but it just rings wrong now.",2.5
"Grande filme do Fleischer que se baseia no caso real de Leopold e Loeb também explorado em Festim Diabólico, Swoon e, em menor escala, Cálculo Mortal.
Dá para dividir o filme em 3 partes, a dos sociopatas ricos, mimados e de alto QI, como pensam e agem; a investigação do promotor que chega numa conclusão e a entrada do advogado de defesa da dupla. E essa terceira parte que define o filme, a defesa deles vai contra o que a maioria pensa (inclusive o público) e convence ao questionar não o crime, mas nossa própria humanidade. O que é a justiça? Como combater o mal?
A dupla principal e Orson Welles têm atuações elogiosas. A inteligência dos três fica crível pelo que falam e como se comportam.
Primeiro filme do Fleischer da trinca de filmes baseados em crimes reais que realizou (O Homem Que Odiava As Mulheres e O Estrangulador De Rillington Place). E fez com a maestria de sempre.",4.0
"A great drama with a startling genre shift ⅔ through. It begins as a psychological criminal thriller, like a predecessor to Rope or Murder By Numbers: two super smart kids nabbed fumbling their perfect crime.
Orson Welles arrives and it becomes a courtroom drama; Anatomy of a Murder or A Few Good Men. It’s thoroughly engaging and Welles really delivers. Good writing with thoughtful legal philosophy.",4.0
so it's a ten years later Rob Zombie re-imagining of Rope. the cinematography is great but that's all that it's got going for it. the entire movie rests on Welles' 15 minute monologue so it might as well just have been that one scene. this rates lower intellectually than his ad for peas. but Jeff Goldblum was good in this.,2.5

"A really good thriller for the most part. It then gets utterly stolen by a mesmerising performance by Orson Welles.
""This crime is the most fiendish, cold-blooded, inexcusable case the world has ever known. That's what Mr. Horn has told this court. Your Honor, I've been practicing law a good deal longer than I ought to have, defending now for 45, 46 years, during all that time, I've never tried a case where the State's Attorney did not say that it was the most cold-blooded inexcusable case ever. Certainly there was no excuse for the killing of little Pauly Kessler. There was also no reason for it. It wasn't for spite, or hate, or for money. The great misfortune of this case is money. If your Honor should doom these boys to die, it'll be because their parents are rich. I don't need to mention that I'd fight as hard for the poor as for the rich.
If I'd come into this court alone, with two ordinary, obscure defendants who'd done what these boys have done, there hadn't been all this weirdness and notoriety, this sensational publicity, and I said, ""Your Honor I want to gather a plea of guilty and let you sentence them to life imprisonment,"" do you suppose the State's Attorneys would raise their voices in protest? There's never been a case in Chicago where on a plea of guilty a boy under 21 has been sentenced to death -- not one.
Yet for some reason, in the case of these immature boys of diseased minds, as plain as day, they say you can only get justice by shedding their last drop of blood. Isn't a lifetime behind prison bars enough for this mad act? And must this great public be regaled with a hanging? For the last three weeks, I've heard nothing but the cry of blood in this room. Heard nothing from the offices of the State's Attorneys but ugly hatred.
For God's sake, are we crazy!? If you hang these boys, it will mean that in this land of ours, a court of law could not help but bow down to public opinion. In as cruel a speech as he knew how to make, the State's Attorneys told this Court that we're pleading guilty because we're afraid to do anything else. Your Honor, that's true. So of course, I'm afraid to submit this case to a jury, where the responsibility must be divided by twelve. No, your Honor, if these boys must hang, you must do it. It must be your own deliberate, cool, premeditated act.
The State's Attorneys laughed at me for talking about childrens' fantasies, but what does he know about childhood? What do I know? Is there anyone of us who hasn't been guilty of some kind of delinquency in his youth? How many men are there here today, lawyers and congressmen, judges, and even States' Attorneys, who haven't been guilty of some kind of wild act in youth, and if the consequences didn't amount to much, and we didn't get caught, that was our good luck.
But this was something different. This was the mad act of two sick children who belong in a psychopathic hospital. Do I need to argue it? Is there any man with a decent regard for human life, and the slightest bit of heart, that doesn't understand it? We're told it was a cold-blooded killing, because they planned and schemed. Yes, but for months, to hear the officers of the State, who for months have planned and schemed and contrived to take these boys' lives. Talk about scheming. Your Honor, I've become obsessed with this deep feeling of hate and anger. I've been fighting it, battling with it until it has fairly driven me mad.
What about this matter of crime and punishment, anyway? Through the centuries, our laws have been modified, until now men look back with horror at the hangings and the killings of the past. It's been proven, that if the penalties are less barbarous, the crimes are less frequent. Do I need to argue with your Honor that cruelty only breeds cruelty? That every religious leader who's held up as an example has taught us that if there's any way to kill evil, it's not by killing men, and if there's any way of destroying hatred, and all that goes with it, it's not through evil and hatred and cruelty. It's through charity, love, understanding. This is a Christian community - so-called. Is there any doubt that these boys would be safe in the hands of the founder of the Christian religion?
I think anyone who knows me knows how sorry I am for little Pauly Kessler, knows that I'm not saying it simply to talk. Artie and Judd enticed him into a car and when he struggled, they hit him over the head and killed him. They did that. They poured acid on him to destroy his identity and put the naked body in a ditch. And if killing these boys would bring him back to life, I'd say let them go. And I think their parents would say so, too. Neither they nor I would want them released. They must be isolated from society. I'm asking this court to shut them into a prison for life. Any cry for more goes back to the hyena, goes back to the beasts of the jungle. There's no part of man.
This court is told to give them the same mercy that they gave their victim. Your Honor, if our state is not kinder, more human, more considerate, more intelligent than the mad act of these two sick boys, then I'm sorry that I've lived so long. I know that any mother might be the mother of little Pauly Kessler, who left home and went to school and never came back. But I know that any mother might be the mother of Artie Strauss, Judd Steiner. Maybe in some ways these parents are more responsible than their children. I guess the truth is that all parents can be criticized. And these might have done better, if they hadn't had so much money. I do not know.
The State's Attorney has pictured the putting of the poor little dead body in the ditch. But your Honor, I can only think now of taking these two boys, 18 and 19, penning them in a cell, checking off the days and hours and minutes, until they're wakened in the grey of the morning and led to the scaffold, their feet tied, black caps drawn over their heads, stood on a trap, the hangman pressing a spring. I can see them fall through space, I can see them stopped by the rope around their necks. It would be done, of course, in the name of justice.
Justice, who knows what it is? Do I know? Does your Honor know? Can your Honor tell me what I deserve? Can your Honor appraise your self and say what you deserve? Do you think you can cure the hatreds and maladjustments of the world by hanging them? Mr. Horn says that if we hang Artie and Judd, there'll be no more killing. The world has been one long slaughterhouse from the beginning until today, and the killing goes on and on and on. Why not read something, why not think, instead of blindly shouting for death. Kill them because everybody's talking about the case? Because their parents have money? Kill them? Will that stop other sick boys from killing? No.
It's taken the world a long, long time to get to even where it is today. Your Honor, if you hang these boys, you turn back to the past. I'm pleading for the future. Not merely for these boys, but for all boys, for all the young. I'm pleading, not for these two lives, but for life itself, for a time when we can learn to overcome hatred with love, when we can learn that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of men. Yes, I'm pleading for the future. In this court of law, I'm pleading for love.""",4.0
"(Vou tirar obsessivamente da minha cabeça a versão do Hitchcock...)
É além de algo sobre culpa e moralidade, bem mais, egoísmo cínico e ingenuidade clara e objetiva de sua força sobre os outros, ingenuidade sobre o que é ""força"", sobre o que é ""vontade de potência"", mais ou menos: agindo da força mesquinha e da noção irrisória que se tem sobre essa força como tática de exercer privilégios, pregar pantominas; a resolução que o casal protagonista deixa pra trás: fortes exercem forças sobre iguais, se superam na complexidade dessa briga.
Aí vem pairando na minha cabeça: os dois iguais, Arthur e Judd, competem na mesma briga e é como se faltasse a um deles, o mesmo cinismo gélido quase permanente do outro, quer dizer, o que falta, falta a Judd, ele bambeia, se sente permeando em alguma dúvida, tem pouca ação intuitiva e um espírito sufocado de papel de submisso, quase no fundo um ""amor intoxicado"", um ""sentimento sufocado"" que é não só pela suposta natureza sexual frustrada disso, mesmo que pareça ser ela a maior, é uma auto-cobrança de imagem, de postura pontual, de inteligência íntegra impossível.",3.5

This is another movie in which characters are.... so gay. It's not exactly great representation. They're clearly supposed to be evil because they're gay, or maybe gay because they're evil? Possibly the one guy was pulled into depravity as a part of that. There's a real kink factor to all of it with ""orders"" and such. But like... it's really gay.

What a long monologue at the end,3.5
"The first two acts mostly present a solid crime thriller, featuring a not-at-all sympathetic pair of college students—Artie Straus (Bradford Dillman) and Judd Steiner, played by a young Dean Stockwell. In the opening, the pair having just robbed a fraternity house, one of them nearly runs over an old drunk man just for the fun of it, twice, while the other, who has slightly more of a conscience, gets him to swerve and miss. It turns out to only be a temporary reprieve from violence, as we later find out that both have been involved in the murder of a child, simply to find out if they’re capable of committing a perfect crime, and the clues are leading back to them. Not only that, but Judd, at the behest of Artie, tries to rape Ruth, a friend of his and only stops after some amount of protesting. These guys are twisted and deserve every bit of justice coming to them.
But then comes the third act, where the movie sickeningly becomes all about the pair’s defense by famous lawyer Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles), despite a guilty plea, and there is no doubt they are guilty. We’re forced to endure Ruth, the attempted rape victim, feeling sorry for them and asking for leniency. Then we get a long anti-death penalty monologue as Wilk’s closing statements where we’re told that despite these men committing the horrifying, premeditated murder of a child, a death sentence would not bring the child back, would bring the court down to Artie and Judd’s level and that the death penalty is unloving. This completely disparages the principle that they’ve forfeited their lives by taking a life and offers no justice for the family whose child was brutally killed. Instead, they get to pay to keep the killers alive through their tax dollars for the rest of their lives.",3.0

"Surprisingly stylish and clinical in its handling of the discussions on morality, up until the end that is.
I found the performances by the Leopold and Loeb stand-ins to be very engaging. The Freudian themes in their performances are almost palpable, but the heavyhanded rendering gave them a heightened sensibility.
But the movie hits a few bumps in its final act. The court room scene is very flat and uncinematic, and its moralizing does not match the rest of the film. Up until then, the movie was an exploration of morality through the eyes of two young men who are devoid of it. But once the trial scene hits, it feels like the movie's message is simply anti-corporal punishment, and it feels like any other standard liberal message movie of its era.
I can't help but feel that Welles helped direct this. There are too many of his authorial touches (his staging and composition, deep focus, expressionistic camera angles, harsh lighting, etc.) for it to be a coincidence.",3.5

"Compulsion has some great moments, but they're ultimately dragged down by staying on the murderers too much. As the case drags out, they're smart, but lack social development.

Welles shows up as their lawyer halfway through and delivers most of the best quips along with a great closing statement. The other two standouts are Diane Varsi as Ruth and Martin Milner as Sid who both provide some empathy during the murderous romp and investigation in the first half of the film. This would have been far more dynamic if we got the first half in flashback framed around the trial. The other big note is the portrayal of an atheist by Welles in 1959. This is more nuanced that many modern portrayals that make a big deal of a character's atheism. If you're not an atheist and want to portray a competent atheist, study Welles here and actually talk to some atheists (don't just do what the God's Not Dead people do).",3.0
"What a ham hocked overacted pseudo intellectual melodrama this is. Which is a shame because the beginning is a promising little pulpy dark exploration into disturbed personalities.
The first minutes are some of the best of the movie. Which should warn you of the rest. In those opening minutes Richard Fleischer allows ""Compulsion"" to be this alive weird darkly compelling beast. With wild camera movements and wild performances from Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as Judd and Arthur.
Then Fleishcer tames the beast and the movie just becomes this lame bare faced inarticulate sentimentalist clap trap. And I'm against the death penalty. But even I can't stomach this lazy sniveling dishonest reasoning of an argument.
It's based on the Leopold and Loeb case. Two rich spoiled brats kidnap and murder a small boy. While they are not 'insane' by definition, they are not right in the head. Fleischer tries to shows us how complex and human they are but the script by Richard Murphy never allows it. It's based on the novel by Meyer Levin unread by me and it'll probably stay that way.
The problems are almost too numerous to list. The most glaring issue is the movie is clearly a product of the sixties. From the blaring jazz soundtrack to the bizarre delicate little flower mixed with moments of random emotional explosions by the actors and actresses. Everyone wants to be Brando.
The crime is never shown, it happens off screen, as if in a play. This causes us not to really understand anything about anything. We know there's a crime but we never see them plan, practice, or even execute the crime. We don't even know a crime has even been committed until a side character, a reporter friend of the two catches the story.
Then Orson Welles shows up. He plays Jonathan Wilks, the lawyer hired by the boy's parents to defend them. Just when you think the Baritoned One is here to single handily save the movie, it becomes clear he cares about as much as you do.
Welles sleepwalks through almost every scene he's in. He can barely stomach the dialogue, which if anything shows how sane he is. It all culminates to Welles stalking across the screen as he gives a monologue lasting over ten minutes. Welles comes alive and so does the movie despite everything going against it.
It's not enough though. None of it is. The movie ends almost immediately after Welles's speech. It ends much as the same way as it had behaved for the last hour or so; with a whimper.",2.5
"Despite a passing familiarity with the Leopold and Loeb case, I don't think I'd ever heard very much about this thinly-veiled adaptation of the famous case. Which I guess, personally, qualifies it as a buried gem, 'cause I really enjoyed this.
The biggest Bygone Era signifier of this film- besides the lack of explicit violence that would likely creep into a film made even 10 years later- is the notion of a top-billed star who doesn't appear until an hour in, who then has the screen handed over to him for a pages-long philosophical monologue. Orson Welles - considering his penchant for prosthetics, I've never been clear on when he became so Falstaffian, versus when it was just movie magic.
Speaking of movie magic: that Cinemascope grandeur just rubs TV's face in it, doesn't it? And much like ""Psycho,"" the frank treatment of the subject matter says loud and proud that the big screen could push boundaries broadcast TV still couldn't.",4.5
"A great cast carries this somewhat schizophrenic, sort of true crime thriller. It comes a full 10 years after Hitchcock ""Rope"" which is unarguably the superior film. Young Dean Stockwell is pitch perfect as the thrill seeking but submissive Judd, and Wells does his capital-A Acting thing which is nearly always a pleasure to behold.",3.0
"Deserved the acting awards for the three male actors that the Cannes festival bestowed. I liked the visual play of the director with the spectacles several times in the film, each time in a different manner. Director Fleischer who impressed me with his film ""Barabbas"" continues to impress me here. Probably, in this film it was the final line of theism versus atheism. Finally. this is an important example of a film that argues against the death penalty.",4.0
"Meet Judd.  Judd is an intellectual nihilist who frequents jazz clubs, murders, rapes, and has been known to spend time watching sheep get slaughtered and has an atheist lawyer defending him.  Don't be like Judd.
There's a lot to like about this film, but I'm pretty sore about a few things- 1. The blaspheming and twisting of Neitsche.  He was horribly abused in this film.   2. The acting of Diane Varsi.  It was comically bad. I mean it was a zero performance.  But 3., most of all I resent the total lack of subtlety.  We're bludgeoned to death by the films opinions of subjects of faith and culture.
On the other hand, the filming is beautiful, Orson Welles and Dean Stockwell are amazing.   And the film leaves you with a lot to think about.",3.0
"Solid take on the Leopold/Loeb murder. I suspect that at the time it was made it was seen as a Very Important Film and a Prestige Production. It just has that vibe. Like most of Fleischer's work, it's good, but not great.
The performances are very good. Dillman tends to go broader than he probably should, but Stockwell and E.G. Marshall excellent in this. Welles is surprisingly restrained in the Clarence Darrow part. Diane Varsi is kind of wasted in this--I think they felt the need to have a pretty girl in the film, but her character is very one dimensional.
For those not familiar with the case, the film has Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman playing wealthy young men who are convinced of their moral superiority. Stockwell's character is brilliant intellectually and stunted emotionally. Dillman's character is less cerebral and more erratic. There is some hinting at a deeper relationship, but the film never quite goes there. Perhaps because it was made in 1959. They decide to kill a teenage boy as an experiment, convinced there is no way they can get caught and they're very, very wrong.",3.0
"Solid camerawork, good acting, but it wasn't well edited. Plot was jumpy and didn't flow well.",2.5
a terrific court room drama. the two leads are charming in the evil sort of away. orson Welles steals the end..the speech of his may rival the end speech of to kill an mocking bird..this would be nice companion piece with rope.,4.5
"Pushes the homosexuality angle less heavily than other tellings of this true-crime story. I recognized it here, but perhaps just because of my prior knowledge of the real men who inspired this film.
Welles gives an inspired performance as the utterly exhausted defense attorney in the final act, but the film as a whole doesn't go far enough in exploring the psyche and philosophy of the detached murder. However, I wouldn't say the approach is as bad as the pop psychoanalysis that most Hollywood bilge upholds as self-righteous ""character study"". Fittingly this film is thematically more mature than most contemporary American films that will be preferred by less discriminate viewers for being not ""dated"".
While they concern very different subject matter, Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder from the same year is a far more masterful piece of cinema. Regardless, moments of filmic artistry (the quietude of the opening sequence, the reflection in the glasses, etc.) prove Fleischer more ambitious than the standard technician.",3.0
"It's funny how I liked E.G. Marshall's D.A. character, and enjoyed watching him trying to crack the two boys, right up until the point Orson Welles entered the movie. From there on, Marshall is the bad guy and Welles the knight in shining armor, here to save the day. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, Welles' persona is so captivating it's impossible not to sympathize with him over everyone else.",3.5

"It's best to look at Compulsion in two halves: the first half starts off with Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman just coming off of their crime and the former holding his stolen typewriter (this isn't shown at all, so maybe, for just half a second, one might wonder if they're the killers... until they move their mouths and look at one another). In short, they kidnapped and killed a little kid, and they spend the first half - as preppy college kids in 1924 Chicago - trying to trace their tracks and not look guilty as hell (the latter part they fail at, miserably).
The other half is the court case when they're brought up on their charges and facing the hangman's noose. But enter in Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles), inspired by Clarence Darrow - as the case is the Leopold-Loeb inspired one - who is here as the Best Trial Lawyer In The Country (in caps) there to not say they don't deserve to be punished, but that they don't deserve to die so quickly.
Many will remember this for the final courtroom monologue that Welles delivers. And no wonder, as it's reported often as one of the (if not THE) longest in cinematic history. What marks this as being so extraordinary and gripping is the basic humanity of his delivery. We get some of the dry wit that we may see in other Welles performances (i.e. Third Man), but here it's different as his character Wilk gives his impassioned plea.
It's as if he can barely argue anymore, and he's just trying to talk to the people of the court - the judge especially, as due to reasons there's no jury for this case - and why Capital punishment shouldn't occur here, despite the heinous act. Watch how Welles goes about the courtroom, exerting his authority, but his delivery is carefully measured, almost saddened by the horrors of all humanity. It's the most humble we may have ever seen Welles on screen, and it's all the greater for it; you want to rewind it to see every nuance, every moment where that usual blustering, almost over-the-top (albeit towering and great) Welles is replaced by something... compassionate.
It is such a great set piece, and the trial before it is sensational too, that you almost forget that the first half is just alright. Both Stockwell and Dillman are fine, with Stockwell kind of anticipating Norman Bates in a strange way (I have to wonder if Hitchcock watched this, not just as it is a retelling of the case of Rope, but for the aspect of a skinny, pathological guy into birds).
These scenes are directed with competence, skill, even some sort of artistry with black and white scope, but it feels like we're waiting for the main show to happen. Perhaps Dillman is just so pushy, or maybe spot on, with his sociopathic killer that it gets almost tiring after a while.",4.0
"Compulsion (1959) film thoughts... Wow! Sometimes you just run across a film that stays with you a bit...While I was researching film noir this past July, I came across this film. While it was not what I was looking for, I put it aside for future viewing. With the most recent death of Martin Milner, I remembered he was in this film so I popped it in the player. Based on a true story (loosely since there is a more modern version of this apparently more ""true""), two upper crust college boys decide for kicks they are going to murder someone. The crime happens and the rest of the film is the aftermath and the law trying to prove they did it....and it doesn't help that they say they did. Where they in their right state of mind??
The first half of this film is just so disturbing, mostly because of Dean Stockwell's character of Judd. The whole time I was watching this I was thinking, ""He is like Norman Bates."" (I guess the fact he likes to stuff birds gave it away...) The strong acting by all players totally overshadows the story, which is mostly police procedural and court drama. Luckily, the parts the characters play are just amazing, it's an acting tour de force. The film also looks so good, crisp black and white photography in lively locations. Definitely a film to see, I am just surprised I never heard anything about this one until a few months ago.",4.5
A beautifully shot and well-acted true crime drama. Welles is fantastic.,5.0
"Compulsion is directed by Richard Fleischer, based on the novel of the same name by Meyer Levin in 1956, which was itself based on the murder trial of Leopold and Loeb. This is supposedly the first film produced by Richard D. Zanuck (son of the legendary Darryl F. Zanuck). The film stars Dean Stockwell, Bradford Dillman, and Orson Welles as attorneys. Artie (Bradford) and Judd (Stockwell) run over a boy to commit the ""perfect crime"". But they are suspected when police find evidence (glasses) that belongs to Judd. Attorney Wilk (Welles) takes the case, saving them from capital punishment with a motivational argument.
Richard Fleischer maintains the tone of the film by preserving it in black and white; this definitely hypes the level of insanity of some characters and the weakness of mere folks ridiculed on the grounds of ostentatious flamboyancy by rich people. The whole cast gives an applauding performance. Good editing and excellent cinematography by William C. Mellor.
NOTE: Orson Welles makes a movie worth watching, appearing almost after 1 hour. The film has actually passed.",4.0
"A cinematic revamping of the notorious Leopold-Loeb murder case in 1924, which is also the source material for Alfred Hitchcock’s ROPE (1948, 8/10), well-known for its specious “entirely-one-long-shot” conceit. This polished Black & White version is directed by a lesser-known Richard Fleischer, a prolific studio journeyman, and the final product is a compelling character study despite the fact that it strikes a false note in its climatic courtroom finale.
Judd and Artie (Stockwell and Dillman) are two flush college students who deem themselves superior to others, they carry on a “perfect crime” to murder a teenage boy for no other reason, just to flout the law and take pleasure in such “superiority” of omnipotence. However, it turns out they are rather clumsy perpetrators, soon a key evidence emerges and with no bother, their crime is exposed by district attorney Harold Horn (Marshall). Then belatedly entering the scene is the distinguished defence attorney Jonathan Will (Welles), who will launch a heartfelt polemic against capital punishment and prevent them being hanged, instead, the trail ended by life imprisonment.
As stylish as any monochromatic oldies could ever be, the film effectively introduces Judd and Artie to spectators with their after-crime ecstasy, to give instant access of their twisted morals and sociopathic symptoms. Although carefully circumventing the homoerotic and sadomasochistic undertones, but for new audience it is pretty easy to detect it without knowing any knowledge of the case itself, it pinpoints Nietzsche’s “supermen” philosophy as the root of their poisoned mindset, and gives the exclusive intimacy a fertile soil to be sanitised. A young Dean Stockwell embodies Judd’s rebellion, intractableness, blind submission, naivety and vulnerability with scorching engrossment and sheer amazement. Bradford Dillman, as the slightly older dandy, radiates some sort of gorgeous flair of a young Tyron Power, his Artie is a child trapped in a grown-up body, a capricious and spoiled wiseacre.
Orson Welles is first-billed, but only appears in the third act, but once he is on, he dominates the show entirely, only 43 years old at then, he assumes to be an old man in his seventies thanks to an intricate make-up and his portly figure, although his towering presence and the extensive anti-death penalty homily does elicit a powerful performance out of his usual haughty weight, the film misses the point catastrophically by opting for a shallow sensation while turning a blind eye to the elephant in the room, with no further intention of probing into the undoing of the two killers’ more controversial perspective of the world, which could have been more insightful and edifying to comprehend. Also during the final scenes, the implication of God’s work in the act sounds like a sententious punchline can instantly turn many liberal minds off. And last but not the least, the portrayal of Ruth Evans (Varsi), the girl who almost gets raped by Judd but is still willing to accept him as a troubled mind, looks rather dubious and over-contrived. Otherwise, the film should have connected with a broader audience and been named as one of the untainted classic in the genre of crime drama.",3.5
"63/100
First half is brilliantly executed, but the second half slows to a crawl as the debate over the death penalty is inexpertly crafted on, and the extent to which the film stacks the deck becomes apparent (e.g., not showing the kid at all, the awkward female character).",3.5
"One of those movies that's mostly interesting for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual experience of watching it. In itself it's a pretty standard Issue Movie, approximately as subtle as your average Law & Order: SVU episode. (You can't just give one of the kids a ripped-from-the-headlines ornithology hobby, you have to draw ostentatious attention to it so that those in the know notice that you did your homework.)
Some of the acting was quite good in spite of the script. Not Orson Welles's, sadly, as he was pretty clearly just there to cash a paycheck, but the young leads both acquitted themselves well -- Dean Stockwell in particular knocked it out of the park, especially given that his role was not as well-written.
What's interesting about Compulsion is the decisions the studio made about which threads to emphasize and which to downplay. If it had been made ten years earlier or later, it probably wouldn't have that quintessentially fifties panic about Teenagers Out Of Control™ -- it plays like the nastier half of a double-feature with Rebel Without a Cause, like what might've happened if Sal Mineo had talked James Dean into taking potshots at puppies with him. And for all that the homosexuality angle was heavily downplayed, it was downright obvious compared to any allusions to the fact that Steiner and Strauss were presumably (like their historical counterparts) Jewish; there's one mention of the local Klan being in a frenzy over the case without the slightest indication of why, and that's basically it. It wouldn't be surprising if filmmakers in 1959 were still be a little skittish about making their villains Jewish, but it was an interesting detail.",3.0
"""Murder's nothing. It's just a simple experience. Murder and rape. Do you know what beauty there is in evil?""
It's the start of our Richard D. Zanuck tribute series, ladies and gentlemen, and what better way to begin than with the first film he produced for his father, Darryl F. Zanuck, 1959's ""Compulsion."" Based on the book of the same name by Meyer Levin about the Leopold/Loeb murder from 1924, Richard D. Zanuck puts together a top notch team of cast and crew, headed up by director Richard Fleischer, to create a film that comes in under budget and ahead of schedule.
It's a fascinating story about two young geniuses who are convinced they can commit the perfect crime and they do -- except one of them accidentally drops his glasses at the scene of the crime. The true story is horrifying, and it's equally so in this honest film depiction.
With neither of us having seen this film before preparing for this episode, we stumbled upon a rare gem that deserves more viewers. We chat about the incredible cast headed up by Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman as the two murderers, Orson Welles as their lawyer, E.G. Marshall as the DA prosecuting them, Gavin MacLeod as his assistant, and Diane Varsi and Martin Milner as the friends caught up in the whole mess. We discuss Fleischer and what he brought to the table, along with William C. Mellor, the DP. We also discuss the interesting homosexual and sadomasochistic subtexts the film broaches, as well as rape and capital punishment, which for 1959 was a pretty big deal. It's an amazing film to stumble across and the perfect start for our Richard D. Zanuck tribute series. Check the movie out on Amazon and listen in!

"Compulsion (1959)
Richard Fleischer
B-
I imagine Welles’ closing argument is a lot more stirring if you’re of the belief that the death penalty is morally wrong in any scenario, as opposed to believing it’s wrong because it’s unfairly applied, targeting those without means or sufficient legal representation or that it doesn’t allow for the fallibility of the legal process (neither of which is true here) in which case it’s simply a well-performed, albeit repetitive, bit of oration. Notable for the way it folds the, at the time 30-year-old Leopold & Loeb case into the troubled adolescent template of the era (the opening joyride sequence in particular feels like an inspiration to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) while making some umissable overtures to the homoeroticism in Steiner and Strauss’s relationship*. Bracing in the way that not only is the murder itself performed off-screen but as is any and all plotting of said, which does a nifty job of conveying the level of emotional detachment felt by our killers. That said, for all the talk of superior intellect, our killers spend the first hour doing everything short of wearing “I’m guilty” signs around their necks (unclear whether this is a conscious attempt to undermine their supposedly indisputable intelligence or simply a performance choice by Stockwell and Dillman) while the smoking gun which ends up getting them thrown in jail is so thuddingly obvious that any flatfoot on their first beat would catch it. These two may be able to quote Nietzsche at will but they’re no match for anyone who’s seen more than 2 episodes of “Law & Order”.
*I remember ROPE hinting at this as well, albeit less overtly than here, leaving me to wonder if this sort of innuendo originated with the actual trial or if the close relationship between the two men simply encourages Queer theory.",3.0
"Top quality drama from Soylent Green director Richard Fleischer starring Orson Welles, E.G. Marshall, Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell.
Welles plays brilliant lawyer Jonathan Wilk hired to defend Ivy League students Judd Steiner, played by Dean Stockwell and Arthur A. Straus, played by Bradford Dillman, after they have been brought to trial for the premeditated and cold bloodied murder of young Paulie Kessler.
As students of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and his notion of the Superman (Übermensch) or God on earth, Steiner and Straus believe they are blessed with intellectual capacities so beyond the average mortal that they are above both the rule of law and any concepts of good and evil.
The delusional pair set out to test the theory and plan and execute the perfect crime.
The film is based on the real life events of Leopold and Loeb, two wealthy University of Chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Robert ""Bobby"" Franks in 1924 in Chicago.
Leopold and Loeb were homosexual and whilst Fleischer examines the close relationship between Steiner and Straus he merely hints at the possibility that their relationship is a homosexual one.
Fleische's film is gripping, engaging , full of suspense and is guaranteed to get the viewer involved. It is also as relevant today as it was back in 1959.
As Wilk was delivering his closing remarks to the court it occurred to me that he would be saying those very same words about forgiveness and understanding and putting away the hate if he were defending the Boston Marathon bombers.
'If there is any way of destroying hatred and all that goes with it, it's not through evil and hatred and cruelty, but through charity, love, understanding.'
As liberal as I believe that I am, I couldn't help but conclude that certain crimes are above the life sentence that Wilk was pleading for.
Compulsion is a much neglected and under appreciated film that is worthy of the support of a much larger audience than the 65 LetterboxD's who have viewed it thus far.
