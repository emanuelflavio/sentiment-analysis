"One of the first films to employ Vietnam War into its premise, The Deer Hunter tells the story of a trio of young factory workers in Pennsylvania who enlist into the army to fight the ongoing war in Vietnam, only to discover that war isn't a noble venture they imagined it to be but a hellish chaos which ultimately ends up completely changing their overall personalities.
The film features a three act structure, with the first act introducing its three primary characters, their friendships, the women they are in love with & their perspectives on life. The second act is set in Vietnam and covers the brutality they undergo there. And the final act depicts the massive change war has brought into not just their lives but also the society they are part of as a whole.
Michael Cimino's direction is good in parts, camerawork & music are also a plus and the strong cast of Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, Meryl Streep & others do chip in with sincere performances but compared to the reputation & acclaim this film has enjoyed over the years, the experience of sitting through this snail-paced war drama didn't turn out to be even remotely satisfying.
The Deer Hunter isn't really a war film but a tragic drama that aims to portray the personality change something as gruesome as war can bring in not just those who serve in it but an entire community which I actually appreciate but for the majority of its runtime, this film is a pain to sit through. It is over three hours long which is strongly felt and it's filled with characters who aren't that interesting anyway.
It opens with a wedding sequence which, for a while, felt like would go on forever. The second act, set in Vietnam, is the only part that had my attention & the Russian roulette scene is easily the film's best moment, for it is extremely intense & brilliantly filmed. The final act is a disappointment again where we are supposed to draw a comparison with the first act and that's all there is to this story.
On an overall scale, there are moments of brilliance within the film yet for the most part, The Deer Hunter remains an underwhelming cinematic experience that's awfully boring, is far too long, presents a one-sided view of war, requires its audience to suspend disbelief greatly, and in my humble opinion which you don't have to agree with is one of the most overrated films ever made.",2.0

"This movie made $50 mil at the box office, selling roughly 21 million tickets. More than F9, JOHN WICK 3, BLACK WIDOW and countless other blockbusters today. I thought of that and how some people within the industry complain that the Oscars doesn't award popular films anymore, as if this wouldn't be lucky to make $12 mil at the box office today if it got a theatrical release at all. It's the audience that abandoned good films that's the problem,…",4.5
"Is that Russian Roulette Vietnam movie really the classic many people remember it being?
In High School I was really into checking out Best Picture winners so I gave this one a rent, and only I recalled the wedding, the roulette games, and De Niro hunting a deer. I think that's what most people would remember about it, and that's because much of the rest of the film is a bunch of fluff, and is way longer than it needs to be. Did Director Michael Cimino think his movies had to be as long as possible in order to be good? Well with this being 3 hours and 'Heaven's Gate' 3 hours and 45 minutes, I guess so.
So why did this win best picture in 1979? I think it all comes down to the movie's excellent cast, the intense Russian Roulette scenes, and the fact that it was one of the first films to depict the Vietnam war as a tragedy. I think those elements came together just right to cover the major flaws of this supposed classic anti-war film.
Let's start with what I think about The Deer Hunter, since I like to be positive.
I think Cimino had an eye for great eye for visuals, and there is some breathtaking cinematography in this film. Some of my favorite shots include the melted steel and sparks in the factory to start the film, the wide shot of the of the hill De Niro climbs over while hunting, and the rest of mountain vistas during their hunting trip.
Cimino also peppered in a couple really simple but effective symbolic moments to make the film more thought provoking. These instances include the spilling of the wine at the wedding, the foreshadowing of the war from the solider at the bar, and De Niro's final showdown with a deer.
Relatable character moments or just lazy writing?
The Deer Hunter is praised for how it takes so much time to establish its characters. But are scenes with a bunch of guys talking to each by constantly dropping F bombs, singing at the bar, and giving each other a hard time ... really great character building moments?? IMO way too much screen time is spent toward getting the point across that these are simple blue collar guys, whose world is about to get rocked by the horrors of the Vietnam war. I don't mind slow burning films, but this feels intentionally stretched to the limit. The only really memorable conversation I can recall is where De Niro talks about just one bullet, mostly because it is one of the key themes of the film.
The cast and the acting is great but the writing does not flow at all, and feels so clunky and stuffed with filler. For instance, the pointless scene when they arrive at their hunting spot when De Niro starts complaining about Cazale's character not being prepared. Or how they go on and on about pretending that they will leave one of the friends behind by driving off when he goes to use the bathroom.
This was John Cazale's last role and he does a great job at playing his usual mild mannered character, that is a bit of a screw up. It was definitely a brilliant bit of casting to pair De Niro and Cazale together to make you think about watching a great movie like 'Godfather Part 2', while The Deer Hunter meanders along.
The story requires there to be some tension between De Niro's character and Christopher Walken's character in order for De Niro to leave him behind in Vietnam, despite promising that he wouldn't do that. To create this tension Meryl Streep is added as plot device to establish this love triangle. This may have been an interesting dramatic element if the wedding tied into this love triangle, but no that is for the third character played John Savage that is significantly under used.
It is made very clear that the character's we are following are of Russian heritage. This can be noticed from the architecture of the Russian Orthodox church they show several times, the traditional Russian dancing at the wedding reception, and giving a Russian toasts while drinking. I find Russian culture to be fascinating, so this was appealing until I started to think why Cimino selected Russian. And I think it is blatantly obvious that this Russian culture element was just used as a parallel to the Russian Roulette games later in the film. And I find it to be horribly tacky that they strung those elements together.
For a movie that takes so long to establish its characters, it spends no time setting up their involvement in Vietnam, which makes the situational awareness of this part of the movie make no sense. The only setup we get in Vietnam is a wide shot with some explosions. Then suddenly all three friends are some how all in the same POW camp. The majority of the scenes of the war are all stock footage, which sticks out like a sore thumb compared to what they actually shot for the movie.
Spoilers..
The roulette scene itself is the highlight of the film, but in hindsight it becomes really predictable which hurts the films re watchability factor, and I had not seen this movie in 17 years.
So the film tells us that De Niro comes back home a changed man, but for me he appears to be the same hard ass he always was. The only difference is that he no longer wants to kill deer, since he sees the value in life after being in the war.
We find out the marriage that the majority of the movie was spent on is now estranged. That's because after returning home, John Savage's character spends all his time at a veterans hospital because he can't deal with being at home since he lost his legs. This was a dramatic element that I had to go back and rewatch, to piece together how he apparently busted his legs on some rocks when he fell from the helicopter.
De Niro goes to the hospital to see him, but then finds out that Christopher Walken's character has been sending him hundreds of dollars. So we are meant to believe that Walken who was left in Vietnam has supposedly survived months of playing Russian Roulette? So then De Niro some how arranges his casual return to Vietnam, apparently during the Fall of Saigon, one of the most chaotic periods of the war, to go save Walken. We find out that Walken at this point is too far gone, and now since he is playing against De Niro he is able to lose a game of roulette and shots himself in the head. My suspension of dis-belief is typically pretty high in movies, but how this part of the story is cobbled together is just garbage.
I had recalled that the final shot of the movie was that great shot of the deer being spared, but the movie actually ends on another poignant moment. That's when the whole group of friends gather at a table to mourn the death of Christopher Walken's character, and they start to sing God Bless America. With the overall tone of the film, I feel this was done as an ironic jab to show the character's disappointment in their country that entered into this war that forever changed their lives.
I listened to Michael Cimino's speech at the Oscars when he won for Best Director for this film, and all he did was thank his actors because that roulette scene was likely the reason he won. This bothers me since a year later the superior Vietnam movie depicting the madness of war, 'Apocalypse Now' did not win, likely since 'The Deer Hunter' stole its thunder. Then consider how truly iconic Directors like Stanley Kubrick never won a best Director Oscar, but Cimino some how did?? I do plan to check out the rest of the films nominated that year to see how they compare.
I analyzed Cimino's next film 'Heaven's Gate' a few months ago and it largely has the same issues with really clunky writing, an overly long story, but with the occasional great set piece, and some excellent cinematography. I would hate to call this guy a hack, since he did have a great vision for the films, but he really should have been working with a great writer to help him tell more concise stories. But instead he got all this acclaim for The Deer Hunter, and then got exposed during the difficult production of 'Heaven's Gate', which ruined his career.
Overall The Deer Hunter is just an ok movie that shows the brutal impact of war, but I think it was seriously overhyped when it came out and that legacy has followed it to this day.

"With director Cimino's recent death and his reputation in tatters since the debacle of 'Heaven's Gate', I decided to visit 'The Deer Hunter'. Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS?
Many film lovers who despise Cimino's work instantly clam up when 'The Deer Hunter' is mentioned...and there's a reason for that. It's deservedly considered one of the finest American films of the 70's--a decade that was chock-full of great ones.",5.0
"Very few films can hit me as emotionally as Michael Cimino’s, The Deer Hunter. This epic masterpieces exudes emotion, it practically is emotion. The performances are incredible, the cinematography and musical score is full of grit, and the screenplay is incredibly jarring. Everything is at top class here. I was worried, after reading some reviews over the past few years since my last watch that it would be jingoistic and rely purely on nationalism to affect the audience, but to my delight, it is anything but said concerns.
Like The Thin Red Line, this is a “war” movie. I say “war”, because it simply has the setting of a war. But it starts out with an hour long introduction in a small town in Pennsylvania. This is one of the greatest introductions to be placed on film. Cimino creates a great connection with the characters, showing something for anyone to relate to – showing the hunter, football fan, boyfriend/girlfriend, best friends, and the town saloon. Everything shown (here) creates great draw and connection to all of the characters. It’s also brilliant in how it contrasts the rest of the film.
The beginning part builds up to a grand wedding. People coming together to celebrate a relationship, to dance, to eat, to sing. Then all of a sudden, after they go hunting, we’re in Vietnam. There is no way to prepare for Vietnam, so the abrupt change of pace is perfect. But Cimino makes no point to show us Vietnam, but the reactions towards the atmosphere and its inhabitants. It’s a story that shows how war between countries creates a greater war within relationships and ourselves.
The greatest battle shown is the isolation that the war created in the soldiers – especially Michael and Nick (De Niro and Walken). Both actors are in top-form, portraying their respected characters with a great bravura. De Niro plays Michael as a crazy guy to begin with, and even his craziness can’t prepare him for what awaits in Vietnam. But ‘Nan, and the pressure it creates in him, changes him into a calmer man, a man that sees beyond his self now – as if his experiences pushed out all of the insanity in him (breaking point for the good). We see Nick in opposite light, a sane man in his hometown, turned lunatic from the torturous events overseas.
The screenplay and the actors portraying Cimino’s vision is incredibly personal. They create so much heartbreak in the characters, and it translates off the screen as well. This is one of the only films to actually make me tear up. A few hours after, I wasn’t crying, but I was actually pissed off at it for creating such a candid atmosphere. This is in part to Vilmos Zsigmond’s fantastic cinematography. The movements, the angles, and the framing is all flawless. The amount of chaos shown is impeccable, having great scope, yet maintains such a personal look into the lives of people – not just the soldiers.
“It’s about the one shot!” This is the defining quote of the film. It is about the one shot, whether it being figurative, or an actual bullet, our lives are affected by that one shot relieving the pressure placed on us. Using roulette as the film’s motif is very controversial, but it’s one of the single most encapsulating symbols in film. Cimino doesn’t show the grand scale of war, but breaks it down to “one shot”. That one chamber between you, and the barrel, could contain life or death for you. Roulette resembles the war itself. Soldiers risk their lives every day, and that one shot could be sending them home in a rather unwanted way. It’s the most horrifying way to show war. Rather than show war from a perspective with a chance of being killed, we’re shown a one in 6 chance of being killed – making for a more intimate and horrifying experience. It symbolizes the Vietnam War without every really showing the war. All of the soldiers are facing gun point, America is facing the gun of an entire nation, and all it takes is ONE SHOT to kill us.
A lot of war films only show the affects in the area of battle, but The Deer Hunter, like the soldiers, remembers that there are people back home waiting (for them to come back). Meryl Streep is the standout, reacting in a very calm and patient manner. While her friend (who married Steve) reacts as if she was in shell shock – reacting as Steve probably did when he lost his legs. The camaraderie among the characters is impeccable, and we really want to see everyone reunited at the end. They are reunited, but in a very melancholic way.
The first hour is about the happiness of the characters, the second act is about the destruction and turmoil war causes – how we react to pressure, the last act shows the emptiness created from the second act. Rather than a wedding, and a prosperous relationship uniting the friends, they’re united by death. It’s very tragic and incredibly emotional.
I’m convinced Cimino studied puppeteering before directing films. He toyed with my emotions like a rag doll. He creates film that seems heavily American driven to become more than a jingoistic war cry. It’s a personal portrayal of one of the darkest times in history, filled with fantastic performances and incredible technical aspects.
There is no price on friendship, but there is a number on death – one shot.

"“Deer Hunter” is a war movie made by a director who didn’t care about war. 
Not just that he was opposed to it; he didn’t have any relationship to it whatsoever. He was even known to lie about having fought in one. For Michael Cimino, Vietnam was merely an engine for trauma creation. 
Possibly, this is what allowed Cimino to release “Deer Hunter” before the conflict in Vietnam had a chance to be ‘processed’ in other film output. Cimino glommed onto the sizzling live wire of the war; ignored its wider political seismology, and instead used it as grounds to tell the story he wanted to depict; about self-martyrdom as an escape from personal trauma. 
Yesterday, I reviewed Renoir’s “The Grand Illusion;” perhaps the most humanist and therefore noble of war movies. “Deer Hunter,” by contrast, is interested in human trauma without being humanist; and to me seems among the most outright destructive of nearly all the entries in its genre. There are even accusations that the movie’s most famous sequence has ‘inspired’ dozens of military suicides. 
That - to me - makes “Deer Hunter” a reprehensible piece of art, from a self-obsessed creator.
It’s therefore unfortunate that “Deer Hunter” is such a well-made film. 
Cimino - in willfully turning the other cheek to the physicality of war - created an incredible depiction about what he thinks are the traumas war causes on the psyche and on a community. His obsession with trauma over politics - over conflict - over history - make “Deer Hunter” one of the greatest character studies in cinema. 
Aided by a legendary cast of young actors, Cimino allowed entire personal histories to play out in exchanged glances, or a complex web of motivations to be unveiled only through the way someone closes a door. 
“Deer Hunter” is an irresponsible masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Cimino earned every bit of praise the film received on its release, but deserved, rather, to be held to account for using his considerable artistic powers to employ a real war solely in service of his own obsessions of self-destruction and martyrdom.",4.5
excuse me but holy fucking hell this movie did an excellent job of fucking me up. adding to my list of films that make me cry,4.5
"So, I'm reading some of the less favorable reviews of The Deer Hunter and I noticed a common complaint, other than the cop-out ""too long"" one, that the film only shows one side of the Vietnam War-that both sides of the Vietnam War were needed to be shown in order for them to deem the film as masterpiece it is known by.
First of all. Shut up. Second of all. Really? That's not a complaint that's just lazy writing and if I'm calling someone's writing lazy then we know there's a problem. If you don't like The Deer Hunter it's because you can't sit still through it and then you throw on the one sided part to feel a little safer about disowning a classic. Not only that but if you can honestly complain about how The Deer Hunter doesn't go into detail on the other side of the war then you have completely missed the point of the film. The film is not worried about how the Vietnamese felt during the war. It's not about them; it's not a traditional war film. It's not focused on a squander or a bunch of generals. It's about a group of friends, three of whom (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) go off into the war and are forever changed by it, both physically and mentally. More importantly, it's told from their perspective. Do you really think that they're worried about how the Vietnamese felt or thought?
To slim it down, The Deer Hunter is about the bonds of friendship wrapped into an anti-war film. These bonds are incredibly strong. The film takes it time at building up these friendships in the beginning. At work, at a wedding (which gives a callback to The Godfather), and going hunting. It works really well because in the good times and bad they really do seem like the best of friends. What really did it for me is when they're all singing ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" at the bar. They're a ton of fun to be around. The scene at the bar right before De Niro, Walken, and Savage go off into Vietnam is both haunting and brilliant. One of friends, Axel I believe, starts playing a very melancholy piece on the piano and the whole bunch of them becomes dead silent. They all realize that De Niro, Walken, and Savage might not make it back in one piece from Vietnam and the three of them realize that this isn't going to be the adventure that they're hoping for.
I shouldn't complain about people who complain about how long films are, like in the beginning, but I am. The Deer Hunter is able to build these rich relationships in a three hour period but it's never a drag. Everything before the immediate entry into Vietnam is long but it's a lot of fun and it not only builds on the relationships it builds up to the infamous Russian roulette scene. That there is a great, powerful, angering scene, which can serve as a symbol for the war with its effect on a player and immediate outbursts, but it's not my favorite part of the film. My favorite parts of the film are the scenes where the film takes a breather in the mountains. It's so relaxing and beautiful. You can feel and breathe the freshness of those mountains. There's also nothing better than seeing the great John Cazale wrestling a deer in a small pond.
The entire cast is great, not to mention hilarious. De Niro gives what I want to say is his best performance, but I would probably be lying. His energy to save his two friends in this war is inspiring and he stops at nothing to ensure their safety. Walken is great as well; this could be his best performance for he and De Niro both share the most heartbreaking scene in the film. Seeing how the war has dehumanized him is haunting and we really feel for what his character has gone through, all of them.
I've always been fascinated with Michael Cimino because of his monumental bomb Heaven's Gate, a film who's Criterion Blu-Ray I've owned for over a year but still have not gotten around to it. In my mind it's a very intimidating film to approach and I wanted to watch The Deer Hunter first just to see if Heaven's Gate will turn out to be either a masterful director over his head or, simply, another masterpiece. I had no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter would be great. I just didn't realize how great it would be. It's a masterpiece and I loved every second of it. From the wedding to the rendition of ""God Bless America"". It's a haunting, powerful experience and one of the best films about friendship I've seen.

"Three Russian-American steelworkers (Robert de Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage) from Pennsylvania are deeply affected by fighting in the Vietnam War, in Michael Cimino’s epic war drama co-starring Meryl Streep, George Dzundza and John Cazale (in his final role).
The film is really well made, with excellent cinematography that captures the tone well, and a beautiful, haunting score by Stanley Myers that emphasises the poignance of the story. It was one of the first films to critically address the Vietnam War, and makes some interesting points about the impact of conflict on the people who experience it, but I found it lacking in its execution of these ideas.
Coming Home, released in the same year, did a much better job at showing the disillusionment of returning veterans, and Apocalypse Now was able to use the war as a symbol of wider themes; this tries to incorporate too many elements and as result feels quite flat, lacking focus and nuance.
Though it has a great cast, the characters they portray aren’t very developed, coming across as one dimensional and underexplored. Nearly an hour of the film is taken up by a wedding sequence at the start, and while this is really well made it doesn’t give us enough time to get to know these characters.
The sudden move to Vietnam makes the pacing feel off, these scenes having a disjointed and abrupt feeling that have the opposite problem to the slow, stretched out scenes before, with sudden jumps in the story stopping it from flowing well. This choppiness in editing, along with the lack of depth to the characters, makes it hard to connect to their stories, creating a sense of unintended distance.
I found the whole secret underground Russian Roulette society subplot out of step with the rest of the film, feeling silly and melodramatic despite the high tension, belonging in an action film. This wouldn’t be a problem if the film didn’t take itself so seriously, positioning itself as a worthy statement on war when it never seems interested in exploring this in a meaningful way.
On a technical level The Deer Hunter excels, but storywise it never comes together, too unfocused and stretched out in a way that diminishes its intended impact.",1.5
"The Deer Hunter begins in a small steel mill in Pennsylvania during a traditional wedding party within a community of Russian immigrants, a prelude to the departure of three friends for Vietnam, and finishes, some time after the end of the conflict, in the same town, immersed - this time - in the astonished silence of a funeral. Nestled between these two symbolic ceremonies, the central section of the film is dedicated to the war, with particular attention to the evolution of the bond between the three friends in the face of the horrors they had to witness.
Michael Cimino's film takes place within a microcosm in which the war conflict is actually only an episode, albeit a decisive one, of a larger plan that involves the existence of different people, a sort of trial by fire that destroys or in any case deeply marks all the protagonists. More than a war movie, it is a study of its devastating effects and the loss of innocence of an entire generation. Superb is the interpretation of Robert De Niro in the role of a man whose terrible experiences in Vietnam prevent the return to a normal life, until he understands the meaning of what happened to him and his friends. Cimino paints a portrait that is both intimate and majestic, particular and universal, which on the one hand represents the trauma of war in the mind of a soldier, and on the other hand outlines the inadequacy of a society in the face of the great events of history. The result is a far-reaching work, visually flawless, with a strong emotional impact and rare psychological introspection, full of scenes that have entered by right into the history of cinema. Lastly, it is impossible not to remember the splendid performance of John Cazale, one of the greatest actors of his generation, who died prematurely shortly after the shooting of the film.

"""How does it feel to be shot?"" -Stan,
This one hit me pretty hard, but I can't truly imagine what it might do to others.
My dad was drafted to go to Vietnam right after he graduated from college... fucking imagine that. He experienced only limited combat and left after his tour but even then that experience was pretty traumatic for him. He went on to become a successful business man and never really talks much about the experience but it really makes me think about how fucked up life for troops at war must be, being taken from a relatively privileged and happy life and put into an environment where threat is a constant and adversaries are armed and motivated to stop you. Politically, I oppose most, if not all, wars, but a film like this does such a good job of addressing the difference between aggregate understandings of war and the experience of individuals that are subjected to its realities.
My dad has watched all of the famous Vietnam movies... or most of them at least. He thinks Apocalypse Now is ""fine, but kind of what nerds think Vietnam was like"" which has always made me laugh. Platoon had some good parts in his opinion and he thinks it's a good film it just wasn't as true to his specific experience. He really loves Full Metal Jacket and said it was haunting to him, saying the parts that covered boot camp was the truest stuff he's ever seen about Vietnam. The Deer Hunter though really impacted him, and he claims, and my mom remembers and verifies this, that he was a complete mess for weeks after watching it and couldn't sleep for the first couple of nights. For that reason, I actually kind of avoided this film but it was recommended to me recently so I finally watched it. It's going to haunt me and I wasn't even there so I can only imagine what it did to him.
The first hour of this movie is absolutely brilliant. The wedding is glorious as director Michael Cimino shows you joy and pain and bonding and conflict all in a one hour first act for the ages. It's a feat of filmmaking because while there is so much to object to and criticize there is an endearing and youthful quality to the men and women that makes you care for them and want them to be okay. There is also an ominous quality as it is made clear early in the film that some of the men will be going off to war. To contrast the joy and energy of the first hour with the volatile and emotional thrills and depravity of the second hour is such powerful film-making it felt like getting hit in the chest by a MAC truck.
I've never served, and I'm not interested in serving to be honest and never have been, but many people that I've talked to that have are pretty clear that a survival instinct and normalcy can kick in when you are in combat and that in many ways the toughest part of serving is coming back to America and trying to live normally. Again, if that is incorrect I apologize and don't mean to speak out of turn but it's based on numerous interactions with veterans and is at least what I have heard. I think this is where the film, despite already being a powerhouse, really hits peak impact. How does one come back and act normal when they have gone through hell? I don't know the answer to that but I like that Cimino and the script don't even check in with home during the second hour, making the audience slightly uncomfortable with going back as well and forcing them to adjust to the original setting.
Anyways, during the third act I got a little overwhelmed and started to cry at the reality of it all, thinking about my dad at a young age going off to a place he knew nothing about when he had barely gone 100 miles away from his home before that. There is this part where Michael goes to visit Steven and their son points a toy gun at Michael and he smiles that is a little detail that just says so much to me about how disconnected many of us are from the realities of violence. I don't know the whole thing was overwhelming and helped me to appreciate what people have gone through but also respect how little I can really understand about what people have gone through and I think that's a powerful thing for a film to accomplish.
I didn't even get into the making of this movie that much but in addition to it being one of the most amazing films about war I've ever seen, story wise, the movie is immaculately made and executed. The film is beautiful, the music is outstanding, the writing is nuanced and impactful, the direction and blocking is impressive, and the performances are really inspiring. In the end I just feel like this a film that everyone should see and my heart goes out to those that have been through these traumatic experiences. I'll never really understand what you have gone through but films like The Deer Hunter make me want to know more. I wish anyone who struggles with what they have gone through the best.

"Um filme de guerra que no final das contas é um filme sobre o espaço? Ou pelo menos reflete muito bem como esses três espaços sempre presentes (Vietnã, cidade industrial, floresta montanhosa) se contaminam e contaminam aqueles que ali se encontram. Maldições implícitas na própria essência dos planos: os movimentos de câmera que reservam uma iminência latente, a espacialidade reveladora dos planos gerais, a decupagem do ambiente em si. Sem falar na própria pictoriedade mórbida da fumaça que norteia tudo: a fumaça da fábrica que remete às explosões na guerra que remete a neblina etérea da montanha). Paisagens que só reiteram a morte (guerra, mal-estar social, caça) e representam uma espécie de progresso resignativo do proletariado, sendo a reunião final a imagem mais definidora nesse sentido.",5.0

"3 hours speechless, simply exceptional on the bonds of friendship beyond the horrors. The 1st part, with a bunch of buddies partying at a wedding, enjoying their last moment before going off to war, is cut short by an explosion scene with Michael dodging an enemy's bullets and all the hell follows, the transition is really violent. A powerful, well balanced film with three essential parts and a fresco describing not a general reality, but a state of mind focusing on post-war traumas and after viewing it is the kind of masterpiece that marks you for life. thanks to their visual and narrative power.
Robert De Niro plays one of his best roles, imposing in his realism, and when he goes back to get his friends to come home it's so moving, with unfortunately a part of himself that disappeared during the war. The reunion with Christopher Walken, who is totally possessed by his role, is chilling: you want him to come home too, and the face-to-face meeting between him and his friend is one of the most tragic scenes in the history of cinema.
And fuck Hollywood who abandoned Michael Cimino because he would have continued to be one of the best directors of his generation and I find it so unfair this work of art doesn't get more views on Letterboxd. In My best movies of all time

"”One shot. Just one shot.”
The contrast between the opening and closing moments of a movie has rarely been this sharp and saddening. Michael Cimino’s humanistic and poetic take on the war in Vietnam begins with a group of young and cheerful characters whose happiness, pride and sense of satisfaction seemingly will never be shaken but it ends in despair and woe as war destroys their joys, darkens their shining suns and turns them into ghosts who no longer can recognize their own family and friends.
The Deer Hunter, despite being full of life in its first hour, is in the end a disturbing account of the recklessness of war and its ruining effects on the mind and soul of individuals who upon entering battlefields expect pride, hope and glory but are instead presented with savagery and madness which will change their lives forever. This focus on war’s impact on individuals is highlighted by the film’s general focus on its three main characters, their lives and their interpersonal relationships with each other. Here Cimino keeps the war action to the minimum, there are no action-packed battles in the film, the action scenes are very brief in fact, but this refusal to show the physical aspects of war allows the movie to build on its central idea : the psychological effects of a situation like the one that Michael, Nick and Steve find themselves in is far more challenging, dangerous and distressing than the physical disabilities that it might inflict upon them.
That is why that blood-freezing Russian roulette scene in the middle of the movie plays such an important role, it is the beginning of Nick’s insanity. He has been in the war for some time but in that moment he faces something that he has never seen before, something which is psychologically beyond his – or anyone else’s – comprehension. Steve is already going mad in the scene and while Michael manages to survive that particular occasion but as we see later in the movie he also struggles to adapt to the everyday life in his post war days.
The Deer Hunter benefits from an excellent ensemble cast: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage and Meryl Streep (one of her least famous roles but she gives a truly touching performance) are all exceptional in their roles and give life to their complex characters. Michael Cimino’s ability to narrate his story without hiccups and without falling into the realm of sentimentality is admirable, as is movie’s exceptional cinematography (the work of Vilmos Zsigmond, a true master) and its minimal score. This is a movie about the everlasting and paralyzing effects that the brutality of war can have on those who are involved in it and is as upsetting as those effects themselves. A great classic.",4.0

"A group of friends in a small town in Pennsylvania enlist themselves into the Vietnam War, looking for some nice venture but all they find is chaos.
OK, well... This was something. Gotta say I kinda love the very psychological approach the film chooses to study it's many themes. In some way it feels like a coming of age, even though none of the cast have precisely the right age for it. In fact, I couldn't really believe they allowed them to enlist many of them being (and excuse my ageism) very old but I guess that tells you how desperate the government was to get people into the war.
Another nice element I found interesting was how Michael chooses particularly shots to warn us about something. In the wedding scene, while they drink from the cup, there's a red herring done by using a simple thing as a drop in the dress. Also the use of music, it made everything sound like doom or something.
All in all, while it can many times feel like it drags and there are scenes that easily could be removed, thanks to great sequences, moments of legit tension and some nice performances makes of this an almost necessary watch.",4.0
"“I feel a lot of distance, and I feel far away.”
Michael Cimino’s unflinching reflection of the Vietnam War was one of the first American films to deal with the subject matter, and remains painfully harrowing to this day. The Deer Hunter uses a more complete look at the lives of its characters; showing them before, during, and after the conflict, allowing Cimino to explore various aspects of soldiers’ psyche and depict the raw brutality and destructive effects that it had. It isn’t as refined or certain as some other Vietnam movies, instead going more in the way of gritty, rough realism, but its still a remarkable feat and a highlight among the genre.",4.0

"Os grandes clássicos do cinema de guerra investem em narrativas de indivíduos para nos guiar em um pesadelo político e cinematográfico. Que Apocalypse Now é um estudo de personagem sobre a decadência psicológica de um homem (e toda uma geração), todo mundo sabe. Mas quando você pensa em Apocalypse Now, qual a primeira cena que vem à sua cabeça? Provavelmente os helicópteros explodindo a vila vietnamita ao som de Wagner. Isso porque virou uma convenção em filmes de guerra essa relação de alternância entre esfera individual e esfera bélica/geopolítica. Mas em The Deer Hunter, o Cimino basicamente não liga pra geopolítica, é um filme de guerra completamente pessoal, até nas cenas no Vietnam. Não existe uma grande batalha aqui e a guerra em si não deve ser 1/3 do filme. Cimino nunca desvia o olhar de seus personagens, a câmera não é abalada por tiros ou questões que estão além da realidade dessas pessoas, mesmo que influenciem diretamente no destino delas. O que importa de verdade são as relações dessas pessoas simples de uma cidadezinha.",4.5

"It’s dusk near a forgotten lake. Crickets chirp aggressively, then they stop succinctly as if cut off by a dude running a television station audio board. A middle-aged suburban man walks down a wooden walkway with reeds and cattails taller than he is surrounding him on either side of the path. The doctor told him 30 minutes of exercise per day for his high cholesterol. 
A Pirate Looks at Forty by Jimmy Buffett is playing on his AirPods as he walks down the rickety boardwalk. The cheery robo-voice of Siri knifes annoyingly in and out of his musical trance by verbalizing emails, Microsoft teams messages and texts. The last of which states passive-aggressively:
“Christina, if you have a global ask for each team, could you please send an email so my Teams doesn't keep beeping at me?” The transmission then ends abruptly with the verbal translation of a smiley face emoji. 
The man grunts and a slight curl of a smirk begins to form on one side of his mouth.
The tall reeds quiver ever so slightly in the curve in the path up ahead. A faint click clack of hooves taps benevolently on the timbered slabs directly in front of him. 
At that exact moment the shuffle mechanism on his iPhone 14 switches to Strawberry Letter 23 by Shuggie Otis. The man nods his head in time with the music. He remembers a different version of this song from Quentin Tarantino’s 1997 film Jackie Brown and thinks about how much he still loves Samuel L Jackson. 
A single deer stands stoically a handful of paces ahead of him. The two beasts stare quizzically at each other for an uncomfortably long beat of time. The man carefully removes the cellular phone from the left front pocket of his cargo dad shorts. He attempts to take a selfie of himself and the deer who is now giving him the deer-equivalent of a 1,000 yard stare. He reaches his selfie arm high in the air like he’s signaling desperately for a ship to come rescue him from a deserted island. 
Without any sort of warning, the deer charges him at full speed like an angry flea-bitten bison. The startled man begins fumbling sloppily for something under his shirt. He pulls a 9mm handgun from the conceal and carry holster that for some inexplicable reason he brought with him on his relaxing nightly walk.
The man fires wildly into the ether and then recoils comedically like it’s the first time he’s ever fired a weapon in his life.
A split second later, the deer’s head explodes like a cross between the JFK assassination and when Marvin accidentally gets shot in the face in Pulp Fiction. Blood splatters all over the man’s face, his foam mesh hat, his arms, his legs and his new gleaming white Pearl Jam tour tee shirt he waited in the merch truck line for 2 hours to obtain. 
In a mildly terrified, yet completely monotone voice he deadpans “Well, that’s not good.” 
Then the man gingerly and pathetically tries to pick up the carcass and dump it over the side of the wooden boardwalk into the reeds. God forbid any of the neighborhood kids ride their electric scooters down here and see his bizarre fuck up. 
The man gags and cringes as one of the poor animal’s antlers dangles precariously and falls off while he pushes its corpse into the marsh below. Just then the music stops again and Siri gleefully reads another teams message:
“Planning, please provide some key offers that will be priced at celebration for tomorrow. We don't want to just show watches here.”
The man looks back and forth unironically, clumsily inserts the 9mm in his right tube sock and begins the long walk home. 
The garage door goes up dutifully after he enters his garage code. He takes off his shoes, removes his blood-speckled tee shirt and the still smoking weapon from his tube sock. His wife and kids are on their iPhones while sitting in various couches and chairs in his living room. None of them notice that he is covered head to toe in bloody deer goo.
The man takes his clothes, his tube socks, and the pistol and throws them all in the kitchen trash receptacle. He is completely naked now. He lifts the garbage bag out of the trash can and takes the refuse out to the even bigger trash can in the garage. Some sticky orange popsicle juice leaks out of a small perforation in the bag. 
When he returns, still fully nude, his wife speaks without looking up from the online puzzle game she is playing and murmurs “how was your walk sweetheart?”
The man replies robotically “those gnats are getting pretty gnarly down by the lake again.”

"English Version below

Ich wurde einmal, kurz nachdem ich wieder in den Staaten war, gefragt, wie würde ein Film über meine Geschichte aussehen, wer würde Regie führen, welcher Schauspieler mich und welche meine Freunde spielen. Ein Film über mich und meine Freunde, über meine und unsere Zeit in Vietnam und über unsere Rückkehr. Als mir die Frage gestellt wurde, überlegte ich eine ganze Weile lang. Nicht weil ich nie darüber nachgedacht habe, ich tat es, in Buchform. Ich wollte, da befand ich mich noch in Saigon, meine Eindrücke niederschreiben – nicht um ein Zeitdokument anzufertigen oder wie der Schriftsteller der ich nie sein werde sagen würde, zu hinterlassen, nein, ich wollte meine Eindrücke, hier und da unsere Eindrücke, meine und die Nicks und Stevens aussprechen, in der einzigen Form die mir möglich schien.
Es soll helfen, seine Eindrücke auszusprechen, in meinem Fall niederzuschreiben, sagen Ärzte, Psychologen, die in ihren Saloons Kreuzworträtsel lösenden und tratschenden Frauen. Wie ein Tagebuch jeden Tag die Ereignisse des Tages niederschreiben, sie verewigen. Damit ich begann, erst die eine Seite, dann die zweite Seite, bei Tag fünf angekommen, der Dschungel Vietnams um mich wuchernd wie Krebssporen, verlor ich am nächsten Tag die erste Seite von fielen. Sie blieben einfach leer, meine Gedanken und Eindrücke über uns in eine Box eingeschlossen und es bleibend. Also erzählte ich dem jungen Mann der mir die Frage gestellt hatte von meinen fünf Seiten Tagebuch nach denen er mich fragte, sehr höfflich und sichtlich nervös und unsicher, ob er sie sehen könnte. Doch sie waren verschwunden, ebenso wie die nie ausgefüllten Seiten des Tagesbuchs. Kurz danach verabschiedete ich mich von ihm, wünschte ihm einen schönen Tag und eine gute Zukunft. Ich stand auf und war bereits am Gehen, als er mich nochmals fragte, wie würde ein Film über meine Geschichte aussehen, er würde gerne eine Antwort von mir hören. Ich sagte ihm fünf Seiten neben dreißig, fünfzig nie ausgefüllten, so würde meine Geschichte als Film aussehen.
Was gelogen war. Der junge Mann pflanzte mir ein Gedanken ein. Er Schlug mir ein neues Tagebuch direkt vor die Nase auf als ein neues Medium, dem Medium Film. Aber, so weit glaube ich die Magie des Filmes durchschaut zu haben, beginnt jede abgebildete Geschichte als ein Film mit Zeilen, Zeilen die ein Drehbuch ergeben, woran ich mich gleich nach dem Gespräch zwischen mir und dem jungen, netten Mann gesetzt habe und erste Sätze zu Papier brachte. Die, selbstredend, voller Fehler waren, wirr und irgendwie nicht meine Gedanken wiedergaben, Eindrücke und Erlebnisse die mich noch heute, ob tief in der Nacht aus dem Schlaf aufgeschreckt in meinem Bett oder am helllichten Tag auf der Straße mit Bekannten verfolgen.
„Übung macht den Meister“ wie das Sprichwort so schön sagt und ich übte, jeden Tag seit meiner Entlassung aus der Armee der Vereinigten Straßen von Amerika das zu diesem vor mir liegenden Manuskript führte. Ich nenne es „Die durch die Hölle gehen“. Ein passender Titel, weil wir es taten, wir gingen durch die Hölle, ich, Nick und Steven. Unsere Hölle hieß Vietnam, das Vietnam der 1968 Jahre, dem Höhepunkt des Krieges. Und diese Zeilen hier, sie erzählen von uns, uns Stahlarbeiter in dem kleinen Städtchen Clairton, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. Warum mitten im Krieg beginnen, dachte ich mir. Niemand beginnt mitten im Krieg. Es gib immer ein vor und danach, für uns die dort gewesen sind wie für unsere auf uns wartenden Familien. Ich wollte alles erzählen und tat es, keine darauf gehaltene Luppe, uns als Junggesellen, Verlobte und Verheiratete, als Söhne ihrer Mütter und Väter, als russische Immigranten und als Schulfreunde und Freunde. Ein Dreiakter der jemand frisches drehen sollte, jemand der offen mit dieser Geschichte umgeht, so erzählt wie es wirklich war, als keinen Auszug im Leben dreier amerikanischer Jungs, nein, als ihr Leben.
Das sich nicht sonderlich von anderen jungen dummen Männern selbigen Alters in einem Provinzstädtchen unterscheidet. Freunde die die Hochzeit eines ihrer Freunde feiern. Ausgelassen und mit zu viel Alkohol und zu vielem Tanzen, jedoch uns und unsere hineingeborene Kultur abbildend, in der Hochzeit Stevens und Angelas ganz nach dem russisch-orthodoxen Brauch wie ich es wirklich so erlebt habe. Was Musik heißt, ebenso Tanzen und Alkohol, drei Hand in Hand gehende Gepflogenheiten jeder russischen Hochzeit gleichzeitig unseren Abschied von Clairton, Allegheny County einläutete und bedeutete. Das sie, und somit ich, ebenso unter uns Freunden wiederholten, auf der Jagd, losgelöst von dem Trubel in der Stadt mit unseren Müttern und Freundinnen und jetzt auch Ehefrauen und unseren Familienangehörigen und Freunden und Nachbarn und Bekannten. Warum schummeln dachte ich mir nach den ersten Zeilen. Warum interessanteres hinzufügen wo ich doch meine und unsere Geschichte schreibe, weniger wahr wie es mir wünschen würde, doch ausreichend genug um den Kern wiederzugeben?
Womit wir zu den Schauspielern kommen und der anfangs gestellten Frage des jungen, netten Mannes, welcher Schauspieler würde mich und welche Schauspieler meine Freunde spielen. Wer könnte diesen ersten Akt als Abbild unseres Lebens wiedergeben, ihn mit unserem Weg durch die Hölle Vietnams und wieder zurück? Altgediente Stars die unserem wahren Alter widersprechen würden, waren wir ja dumm und naive und so grün hinter den Ohren wie der Grünspann hinter dem Abflussrohr. Eine Frage die sich von selbst ergibt: mit frischen Jungschauspielern wie … Verzeiht meine Unwissenheit, was die heutigen Schauspieler angeht, doch diese Zeilen hier, sie wurden nicht für einen bestimmten Schauspieler geschrieben, sie wurden von mir, und vordergründlich für mich geschrieben. Diese Zeilen hier, der Schauspieler sucht sie, nicht die Zeilen den Schauspieler. Es mag wie eine Phrase klingen, aber zeigt mir die jungen Talente die unsere Reise so wiedergeben können wie ich es tat und wir haben die Frage des jungen, netten Mannes beantwortet.
Wie eingangs Erwähnt, beinhaltet dieses Manuskript unser Leben von mir erzählt, unser Leben was in einem kleinen Städtchen in Pennsylvania begann und seine Geraden und Kurven zog bis nach Vietnam. Vietnam was wir sowohl im Dschungel wie am Fluss kennengelernt haben. Fehlend die Kompanie- und Bataillonsstärken, fehlend die ihre Feuerkraft verschießenden Flugzeuge und Hubschrauber, fehlende die über Tage andauernden Gefechte, fehlend die Drogen und die Frauen, es waren nur wir, drei äußerst verblödete Amerikaner die sich in diesem fernen und fremden Land verirrt haben. Mit unserer Angst konfrontiert wurden wie ich sie versuchte in Worte zu fassen. Aus eben dieser Angst wurde es unsere Droge, ein Spiel wie Russisch Roulette, ein Glücksspiel sinnbildlich für diese Sinnlosigkeit sich über achttausend Kilometer entfernt von unserer Heimat auf fremden Boden unter fremden Worten sich einem Irrsinn zu verschreiben, dessen Kreise jede Entfernung zurücklegte mit der wir sie konfrontierte. Ja, ich schrieb über uns, mich, Michael, Nick, Steven und über unsere Freunde und Familien und Frauen, über den Irrsinn der in uns geritten war, über unsere Rückkehr die nie eine war, denn wir waren in Vietnam und sind nie von dort zurückgekehrt.

-------------------------------------------

I was once asked, shortly after I was back in the States, what would a film about my story look like, who would direct it, which actor would play me and which would play my friends. A film about me and my friends, about my time and our time in Vietnam and about our return. When I was asked the question, I thought about it for quite a while. Not because I never thought about it, I did, in book form. I wanted, still being in Saigon, to write down my impressions - not to make a document of the time or to leave behind as the writer I will never be would say, no, I wanted to express my impressions, here and there our impressions, mine and Nick's and Steven's, in the only form that seemed possible.
It should help to express one's impressions, to write them down in my case, say doctors, psychologists, the women solving crossword puzzles and gossiping in their saloons. Like a diary, to write down every day the events of the day, to immortalise them. So that I began, first one page, then the second, arriving at day five, the jungle of Vietnam sprawling around me like crab spores, I lost the first page of fell the next day. They just stayed blank, my thoughts and impressions about us locked in a box and it staying. So I told the young man who had asked me the question about my five pages of diary he asked me for, very politely and visibly nervous and unsure if he could see them. But they had disappeared, as had the never-filled pages of the diary. Shortly afterwards I said goodbye to him, wishing him a good day and a bright future. I got up and was already leaving when he asked me again what a film about my story would look like, he would like to hear an answer from me. I told him five pages next to thirty, fifty never filled in, that's what my story would look like as a film.
Which was a lie. The young man planted a thought in my head. He pitched a new diary right under my nose as a new medium, the medium of film. But, as far as I think I have seen through the magic of film, every depicted story begins as a film with lines, lines that make up a script, which I sat down to immediately after the conversation between me and the nice young man and put the first sentences on paper. Which, of course, were full of mistakes, confused and somehow did not reflect my thoughts, impressions and experiences that still haunt me today, whether startled out of sleep deep in the night in my bed or in broad daylight on the street with acquaintances.
""Practice makes perfect"" as the saying goes, and I have been practising, every day since my discharge from the United States Army, which led to this manuscript in front of me. I call it ""Those Who Go Through Hell."" An appropriate title because we did it, we went through hell, me, Nick and Steven. Our hell was called Vietnam, the Vietnam of 1968, the height of the war. And these lines here, they are about us, us steelworkers in the little town of Clairton, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania. Why start in the middle of the war, I thought to myself. Nobody starts in the middle of a war. There is always a before and after, for us who have been there as well as for our families waiting for us. I wanted to tell it all, and I did, no hatchet held on it, us as bachelors, engaged and married, as sons of our mothers and fathers, as Russian immigrants and as schoolmates and friends. A three-act play that should turn someone fresh, someone who is open with this story, telling it as it really was, as not an excerpt in the lives of three American boys, no, as their lives.
Not very different from other young stupid men of the same age in a provincial town. Friends celebrating the wedding of one of their friends. Exuberant and with too much alcohol and too much dancing, but depicting us and our culture born into it, in the wedding of Steven and Angela according to the Russian Orthodox custom as I really experienced it. What music means, as well as dancing and alcohol, three customs that go hand in hand with every Russian wedding, simultaneously heralded and signified our departure from Clairton, Allegheny County. Which they, and thus I, likewise repeated among us friends, on the prowl, detached from the hustle and bustle of the city with our mothers and girlfriends and now wives and our family members and friends and neighbours and acquaintances. Why cheat I thought to myself after the first lines. Why add more interesting things when I am writing my story and ours, less true than I would like, but enough to give the gist?
Which brings us to the actors and the question posed at the beginning by the nice young man, which actor would play me and which actor would play my friends. Who could portray this first act as an image of our lives, our journey through the hell of Vietnam and back again? Veteran stars who would contradict our true age, we were, after all, stupid and naive and as green behind the ears as the green behind the drainpipe. A question that comes naturally: with fresh young actors like ... Forgive my ignorance of today's actors, but these lines here, they were not written for a particular actor, they were written by me, and ostensibly for me. These lines here, the actor seeks them, not the lines the actor. It may sound like a phrase, but show me the young talent who can reflect our journey as I did and we answered the nice young man's question.
As mentioned at the beginning, this manuscript contains our life as told by me, our life which began in a small town in Pennsylvania and stretched its straights and curves all the way to Vietnam. Vietnam which we got to know both in the jungle and on the river. Lacking the company and battalion strengths, missing the planes and helicopters to unleash their firepower, missing the day-long skirmishes, missing the drugs and the women, it was just us, three extremely stupid Americans who got lost in this far and strange country. Confronted with our fear as I tried to put it into words. It was precisely from this fear that it became our drug, a game like Russian roulette, a game of chance symbolic of this senselessness to commit ourselves to madness more than eight thousand kilometers away from our homeland on foreign soil under foreign words, the circles of which traveled every distance with which we covered it confronted. Yes, I wrote about us, me, Michael, Nick, Steven and our friends and families and wives, about the insanity that had ridden us, about our return that never was, because we were in Vietnam and are never from Vietnam returned.

Not my favourite war film by a long shot but it had the most real performances I’ve seen in a while, those Russian roulette scenes are incredible.
This was the earliest role of Meryl’s that I’ve seen, and I couldn’t believe she’s as great in this as she is now, so many decades later.
But unfortunately for me, The Deer Hunter was ultimately more a collection of a few great scenes than a great movie.",3.5
"It’s actually a blessing that so little of this is set in Vietnam itself, because so much of what is depicted in this context is cack-handed and problematic, mostly in relation to how the Vietnamese people themselves are portrayed—namely, either as sadistic psychopaths who like to engage in perverse blood sports, or as weakly fleshed-out bystanders in a story about the self-sacrifice of white western interlopers. It’s no surprise at all that Cimino chose to focus his attentions on the plight of US soldiers—hell, I can understand the bitterness and the resentment that must have permeated American mindsets in the immediate wake of a brutal war that had not long been over, and which no one had had a chance to fully process by the time this film was made—but even so, it’s very much a narrow-minded, one-sided story that frames the Vietnamese people in a shallow and derogatory light, no matter whether they are friend or foe. There’s also little suggestion of any external influences weighing in on the course of events here—our protagonists are shaped solely by the brutality of the conflict and the psychological trauma of being tortured by their captors, and Cimino makes it very clear that it is these factors alone that are responsible for breaking their resolve; yet there’s no mention at all of the political machinations that were ultimately accountable for the war’s destructive legacy. It’s hard for me to ignore these glaring flaws with the narrative—they didn’t sit well with me the first time I watched this, and the same is true now.
I also still struggle to understand the true purpose of the Russian roulette scenes, other than them being a blatant device that Cimino shoehorned into the narrative to hammer home the true extent of our heroes’ trauma. It’s clearly a very dramatic component that presented the perfect “loaded” metaphor for Cimino to play with, but he doesn’t do a lot with it, other than to just repeatedly deploy it again... and again... and again, with diminishing returns on each occasion. It’s just too absurd to take seriously, and it’s only made weaker by its repetition; but the worst aspect of it is that it is built around the ludicrous conceit that the entire nation of Vietnam suddenly appears to have adopted the deadly game as some mad underground pastime. I can understand the symbolism of the device for illustrating the “insanity of war” and especially how Christopher Walken’s character, Nicky, has lost his mind to the conflict, treating every day as if it is one futile roll of the dice, but it’s hardly the most subtle of metaphors. What I cannot fathom, though, is why there are all these other Vietnamese citizens who are volunteering to take part in this lethal game of chance as well? What on earth is in it for them? It’s not even remotely explained, and it really bugs me.
It pains me that all the above is so fraught with issues, because looking at the film outside of these moments, which thankfully, is the lion’s share of the thing, I can’t help but feel that it’s well put together, and the humanity it shows to its central protagonists is otherwise very emotionally affecting. Despite the very indulgent wedding sequence at the start (it takes up a good 45 minutes of the runtime) much of the drama set in the steelworks town, where returning veterans try to reintegrate, and the community is left shattered and emotionally torn by the war’s appalling impact, is very compelling. Moments characterised by distraught silences and pained glances are very powerfully staged, thanks largely to outstanding performances all round—especially from De Niro and Streep, but the entire supporting cast here is strong. The film’s other commonly recurring metaphor of the deer caught between the crosshairs—where those that were once young and carefree have been sullied after finding themselves on the receiving end of their own barbaric, trigger-happy proclivities—is another that is not the most delicate for Cimino to have employed, but it’s vastly preferable to the dicey game of chance going on in the humid climes of the east. It’s a much more measured visual device, and its message is all the more potent for it—for the select inhabitants of this small backwater town, the butchers have become the butchered. It may only take one bullet to take a life, but being on the receiving end is an entirely different story; the anticipation is enough to shatter a man’s mind.",3.0

"I membri di una generazione sgangherata e sopra le righe (Robert DeNiro e Christopher Walken nei panni degli amici Mike e Nick colpiscono ancora per il trasformismo e per le emozioni forti come rabbia e paura che riescono a trasmettere) si prepara a dare il meglio di sé nel sanguinoso conflitto in Vietnam. Alcuni di loro non saranno più gli stessi…Sembra di sentire la solita premessa del tipo: “La guerra ti cambia dentro”. Non é solo questo però. Quella che racconta Michael Cimino é una storia di bambini (anche se troppo cresciuti) che abbandonano la sicurezza del loro nido (in questo caso un angolo di provincia americana) e la bellezza del loro paesaggio (la natura domina gli uomini e li fa sentire piccoli, più impotenti di quello che sembrano in realtà) per la violenza e il sangue del conflitto, scoprendo (forse per la prima volta) cosa sono la sofferenza e il trauma. Con la lunga e spericolata sequenza del matrimonio (ultima gioiosa occasione per ritrovarsi insieme, oltre alla caccia sulle montagne) lo spettatore si affeziona a questi personaggi per poi ritrovarseli catapultati (tramite un rapido time jump) nell’inferno del conflitto tra sangue, sudore, lacrime e sporco. La roulette russa a cui vengono sottoposti é la metafora perfetta per rappresentare l’imprevedibilitá con cui colpiscono il fato e il destino nei confronti della vita (anche noi siamo come cervi in balia di quell’unico singolo colpo che potrebbe mettere fine al percorso sulla nostra terra). Anche la vita stessa può rivelarsi incerta e magniloquente al tempo stesso (Cimino dimostra già una predisposizione per le scene di massa che svilupperà con “I Cancelli del Cielo”).
L’atto stesso dell’uccidere, di porre fine ad essa (non per gioco, ma per sopravvivere) non ci rende diversi dagli altri animali. Quella che Cimino rappresenta é anche la crisi del macho americano, non più energico e sprezzante del pericolo, ma dilaniato, segnato dal trauma e costretto ad aprirsi a nuove responsabilità e doveri. L’età della maturità, alla fine, é stata raggiunta…Mai sottovalutare il peso dell’esistenza.

——————

The members of a ramshackle and over the top generation (Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken as friends Mike and Nick still impress with their transformism and the strong emotions such as anger and fear that they manage to convey) are preparing to give their best in the bloody conflict in Vietnam. Some of them will never be the same again… You seem to hear the usual premise like: “War changes you inside”. It's not just this though. What Michael Cimino tells to us is a story of children (even if they are too grown up) who abandon the safety of their nest (in this case a corner of provincial America) and the beauty of their landscape (nature dominates men and makes them feel small , more helpless than they actually seem) due to the violence and blood of the conflict, discovering (perhaps for the first time) what suffering and trauma are. With the long and reckless wedding sequence (the last joyful opportunity to find oneself together, in addition to the hunt in the mountains) the spectator becomes fond of these characters and then finds them catapulted (through a rapid time jump) into the hell of the conflict between blood, sweat, tears and dirt. The Russian roulette to which they are subjected is the perfect metaphor to represent the unpredictability with which fate and destiny affect life (we too are like deer at the mercy of that one single blow that could put an end to the path on our Earth). Even life itself can prove uncertain and grandiloquent at the same time (Cimino already demonstrates a predisposition for mass scenes which he will develop for “Heaven’s Gate”).
The very act of killing, of putting an end to it (not for fun, but to survive) does not make us different from other animals. What Cimino represents is also the crisis of the American macho, no longer energetic and contemptuous of danger, but torn apart, marked by trauma and forced to open up to new responsibilities and duties. The age of maturity has finally been reached...Never underestimate the weight of existence.",4.5
"Disillusionment In Sun-Drenched 1970s American New Wave Cinema: A Watching Brief
The Deer Hunter is a giant name that has been looming over this project ever since I started it back in 2017 (!) - but I can't say that I was particularly looking forward to revisiting it.
And it's not because of my usual complaint about the length of the film. Sometimes I do play up that running angle a little bit for 'comedy' effect on my reviews, but actually I've been known to cope with films over 90 minutes long quite well on a number of occasions. It's also nothing to do with not particularly enjoying my first experience of it, back in my late teens. I tend to ignore my views on stuff from back then as quite a bit of time has passed and I'm a different person now.
That's not to say, going back to my first caveat, that time isn't a problem with The Deer Hunter. The opening 80 minutes or so of this are really incredibly trying. I assume the purpose of the opening stages here are to show a group dynamic and the nervousness between everyone about the conscription on the horizon. They are bloated and self-defeating in how slow they are. The aim could have been reached in half the time, and could have done well without the daft foreshadowing of what was to come when they bump into a Marine in a bar.
The middle third of this is bloated as well, though. Admittedly, the Russian roulette scenes are draining and harrowing, as Michael Cimino probably intended them to be, but I'm not sure why you would boil the conflict here down to the Viet Cong being obsessed with this game. This is the section of the film where I expected it to gain some grace with me, but it really didn't.
The basic characterisation of the Viet Cong as murderous lunatics might have flown better back in 1978 but today it's really shitty and nauseating. Especially when cast against the notion of the brave American, a narrative that never sits well with me. Sliding into its final third, Cimino's best work comes in showing a dynamic back home that everyone tries to restore only to know early on that things can never be the same again.
Even that gives way to Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken's ridiculous confrontation over another game of Russian roulette, however. Furthermore, I'm quite convinced that every one of the main cast have or had far better work in their lockers than they managed here. Because Cimino turns this into a masculine melodrama so regularly, the acting follows suit with nobody being anywhere near as convincing as I am used to them being. Except, maybe, for John Cazale.
It's just an entirely frustrating and dreary experience. Artistically impressive and certainly well organised in terms of where it is geographically and narratively. That's not nearly enough for me personally, though. Especially when taking into account the thoughtlessly feral caricature that every Vietnamese character in The Deer Hunter assumes, plus the very basic characterisation that every female character is afforded.
When I come away from any film with my main thought being about why a character has a bunch of empty KFC boxes on top of his fridge, that's probably not a great look.",2.0
"""A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that but they don't listen.""
I know someone who enlisted in the army and was quickly put into action in the Middle East. I have pretty vivid memories of his demeanor prior to his deployment, and all of them involve him smiling. His zest for life was exhausting. His enthusiasm was so constant that it became tedious. You could never just sit back and relax and enjoy the moment because he was always thinking about what's next. What could we be doing that was more fun? What would the world look like tomorrow?
When he returned from his tour overseas, I met up with him for dinner to celebrate. He still looked the same. His voice still sounded the same. Something was different though. Everything else was different. He told stories of some of the ugliness of war, but the picture was never fully painted by his words. I don't know if he was incapable or simply didn't want to go into too much detail. I didn't press for more. He said he was happy to be home and in a way I believed him, but the zest was gone. The enthusiasm seemed like a distant memory. He talked only about the past and didn't seem all that interested in the future. He barely smiled at all.
The Deer Hunter is a cinematic masterpiece directed by Michael Cimino that tells the story of three young men who leave behind their lives as factory workers in order to serve their country in Vietnam. I had seen the film before but so long ago that I was barely even able to qualify for a PG-13 movie, and unsurprisingly the mind of a middle school student isn't quite ready to process the themes of a film such as this. Needless to say, this was an eye opening experience. What I really found fascinating was the fact that of a three hour running time, so little of it was actually spent with them in combat in Vietnam. The first act may test some of the audience's patience but I found it wonderfully developed these characters with perfect pacing and essential, important dialogue. This sequence is mostly centered on a wedding and one of my favorite shots from the entire film involves the bride and groom drinking from conjoined goblets with the goal being to simultaneously drink without spilling a drop, and the camera zoomed in on two tiny splashes that stain her gown. Clean consumption symbolizes good luck for life, and this one shot so perfectly foreshadows the horrors that are to follow.
Act two brings us into Vietnam and introduce us to the iconic Russian roulette scenes that are so haunting and hard to watch but you simply cannot look away. I have no idea if the game itself was actually ever played during the war, but honestly it seems irrelevant. The concept of a one-in-six chance that this could be the last moment of your life feels so fitting for a war setting like this, that unnerving us with each pull of the trigger is an incredible representation of the stakes of sending our youth into war. The performances in this section of the film are so absolutely perfect that they only increase the horrifying nature of the content, with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken doing Oscar nominated and Oscar winning work, respectively.
The final act of the film brings us back home to Pennsylvania, and it is here when I couldn't help but think of the brave young man I know who isn't quite the same anymore. I can't comprehend it and I don't think even a masterful film can truly make someone like me understand just what war does to a human being. In the film, people ask Mike (DeNiro) how he is and he says fine with a smile on his face, but how can it be that simple? How can one be ""fine"" after experiencing such pain, seeing such atrocities, coping with such stress and fear?
I want to ask my friend to dig deeper and tell me what really went on over there, but I can't. I'm not sure if that's what he needs from me now, if that's what's best for him. Perhaps I'm just a distraction rather than a facilitator of stories that pick at forever healing wounds
I will just be there to ask him how he is. When he says fine, I will smile. Hopefully he will smile back.

"◽ ¿Acaso participar en una guerra no es jugar a la ruleta rusa?

No es una película de acción pero sí de reflexión. La guerra no aporta nada al hombre nada más que traumas físicos y sicológicos. Nos cuenta que la guerra es un acto decisivo en el que el ser humano, en un intento de evasión, pierde la inocencia que le aporta su mundo insignificante, y superficial y después cuando intenta recuperarla, ya no se puede recuperar. La inocencia es el único bien del ser humano que jamás se podrá recuperar cuando se pierde.

It's not an action movie but rather a reflection. War brings nothing to mankind except physical and psychological traumas. It tells us that war is a decisive act in which the human being, in an attempt to escape, loses the innocence provided by their insignificant and superficial world, and then when they try to regain it, it can no longer be recovered. Innocence is the only asset of the human being that can never be regained once lost.",4.0

"When a war leaves destruction and sadness scattered worldwide, there are human responses. Leaving aside political manifestos and such, art, literature and cinema are the most common trends of expression used. If you asked somebody during the 70s ""Hey, do you know Michael Cimino?"", they would reply negatively. However, if your second question were ""Have you seen The Deer Hunter?"", you would most probably receive an emotional answer.
The Deer Hunter is a straightforward masterpiece, very complete from three different points of view:
1) Character development. The magnificent cast helped a lot.
2) Extraordinary direction and storytelling, focusing on all the aspects and assigning each and every one of them the same weight of importance.
3) The pre-war, war and post-war chapter divisions.
Result = triumph and remembrance.

"""One shot?""
I'm not surprised there was a backlash to The Deer Hunter, particularly when it won big at the Academy Awards®. Michael Cimino's style isn't entirely user-friendly, with certain storytelling decisions frequently robbing the viewer of the easy gratification they're used to. And yet... after three hours, I was absolutely invested in these characters. You become a part of their world, and you feel like you're living this journey right along with them. Granted, I don't think Cimino was ever destined to be the next Coppola. But as a New Hollywood epic, I was rather swept up by The Deer Hunter. Even if I secretly think that Coming Home is the superior Vietnam picture.

"I have not yet finished this. I’ve tried to watch it once a month ever since February and well, I pushed August’s watch out a bit too much. But that’s okay. August understands my love for this film just the same. August also understands that I must get these thoughts out before I pass out.
There are many, many reasons why I love The Deer Hunter and why it’s my favorite film of all time. However, my most important reason is that it legitimately saved my life.
I am a deeply passionate (probably plain obsessive) person. I don’t know if I’m simply more susceptible to extreme emotions. I don’t know if I was just born with a surplus of love in my heart. But whatever the reason, I find film seems to stir up this passion and deep love more than any other human art form. Finding The Deer Hunter meant finding myself. Finding the essence of who I am. I can’t capture just how deeply connected I feel to those glorious mountains, to working America, to those men. I can’t. I will never be able to. That life feels more like my life than my real one. It makes my soul tremble. 
And the funniest part is? I never, ever thought I would love this film the way I did. Two weeks before I watched this film I was crying to my mother over feeling as though my life was worthless. She asked me, “What about all of the films you haven’t seen?” My instant reaction was an obstinate indifference to the idea that there could be films out there better than the ones I had already seen. I was naive. I thought - who cares? I’ve seen enough. I don’t need more.
I did. I did need more.
The night I watched this I started it at 3 am like an idiot. I finished it at around 6 am. It completely took over my entire life that day. It wouldn’t leave my mind or my heart and I rewatched it again that very same day. Nothing, nothing, will ever make my heart soar and leap the way The Deer Hunter has. It kickstarted my deep love for film. To this day, I search for pieces of it no matter what film I start, no matter the director or year. And I never find her. And you know what? I’m glad. I’m so fucking glad.
This film gifted me not only a newfound love for life and what I could make of it, but it also gifted me my favorite actor in the world, Mr. Christopher Walken. I am forever indebted to it and the late, great Michael Cimino.
This is more vulnerable than needed, maybe. Vulnerability like this, as honest as this, invites verdicts and judgments and so forth. However, I refuse to hold myself back like that. Art, film, life, love, passion—all of these things—make the human condition bearable. What is my duty in this life? To love, love, love, love, love, and love again. Over and over.",5.0
"Michael Cimino's seminal war movie classic focuses on three friends Mike (Robert De Niro) Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage) from small-town Pennsylvania who go off to fight in the Vietnam War.
In the lead up to this, they all attend Steven's wedding to local girl Angela (Rutanya Alda) and enjoy some final days of merriment along with their close friends and fellow steelworks employees namely the antagonistic Stan (John Cazale), loutish but loveable Axel (Chuck Aspegren) and jovial local bar owner John (George Dzundza).
In tow is the beautiful but put upon Linda (Meryl Streep) who is a love interest of Nick's and unbeknownst to him also Mike.
Just before being shipped out the group of men - minus Steven who is on his honeymoon - go on a deer hunt, something they have done several times before in the rocky terrain that surrounds their home patch.
We then soon cut to the horrors of war, which will indelibly change the lives and friendships of not just the central protagonists but all of their loved ones back home in ways they could never have imagined.
An incredible piece of filmmaking featuring a lengthy opening act that feels like a movie all to itself focusing on the domestic dynamics of the main characters which gut-wrenchingly sets-up the life-altering events that will take place on the other side of the world.
Coverage of the film has always been dominated by the astoundingly executed Russian roulette scenes where sadistic Viet-Cong soldiers set-up their POWs to face off against each other for bloody entertainment.
The scenes by themselves are jarring and the perfect narrative device to underline exactly what the American government was doing with the lives of the innocent young men it was sending off to fight in a disastrously misjudged campaign that ultimately achieved nothing.
Having seen the very authentic, proud small-town send-off the threesome were given so prominently in the first third of the movie and the heroic welcome home that's planned for their return it truly does bring to the forefront how much in the dark sections of American society remained in regards to what exactly their boys were going off to face.
The Deer Hunter ushered in a series of anti-Vietnam War movies that were ultra-critical of American involvement and indeed of armed conflict in general with the likes of Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Casualties of War (1989) to name but a few though unlike those portrayals the majority of this movie actually takes place far from the battlefield and deals more with the consequences of it.
Cimino's direction is at times unharmonious yet remains completely engrossing with an excellent soundtrack anchored by John Williams fittingly tender central theme.
The leads are all fantastic with the standouts the intense but thoughtful De Niro as a decent man who learns to never gives up on his friends, an Oscar winning turn from Walken who's tragic Nick character completely losses himself to PTSD and the endearing Meryl Streep in one of her first major film roles.
And there, of course, has to be a special mention for the tragic John Cazale who passed away from a terminal illness before production was completed. It's fitting that his last screen appearance affords him a role worthy of his talents as the braggart Stan who despite his often selfish behaviour remains beloved by the group.
As mentioned before this film is ostensibly about the horrors of war and specifically the Vietnam campaign with its devastating consequences being felt far beyond the blood-soaked jungles of East Asia but also at its heart lies a parable about the mystical bond of male friendship.

"The Russian roulette scenes are some of the most intense and insane in cinematic history. 
The Deer Hunter is a true spectacle from Michael Cimino. This film goes on to win the Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Sound, Editing, and Supporting Actor while being nominated for Cinematography, Screenplay, Actor, and Supporting Actress. Cimino’s demand for realism is incredible. The film is shot 100% on location with no sound stages and also opts for practical effects with actual impacts (such as the dramatic river stunts, real face slapping, and authentic spitting). The depiction of the Vietnam War and ensuing PTSD is pretty authentic. I also enjoy the love triangle that reminds me of Brothers. 
Robert De Niro is so elite on this insane run of performances:
1974: The Godfather Part II (Oscar winner)
1976: Taxi Driver (Oscar nominee)
1978: The Deer Hunter (Oscar nominee)
1980: Raging Bull (Oscar winner)
He’s incredibly convincing in showing every emotion. I can’t speak more highly of one of the greatest actors of all time. De Niro is joined by a phenomenal Christopher Walken performance. It’s crazy to see him so young but everything he does is powerful. His Oscar is very well deserved.
The John Cazale-Meryl Streep story is my favorite aspect of the movie. Cazale, who was married to Streep at the time, was diagnosed with lung cancer prior to the filming of the movie. He continued on and tragically died before the film’s release. Streep decided to be in the movie so that she could spend every ounce of time she could with her sick husband. She is beyond gorgeous and talented in this. 
This movie has so many awesome and accurate moments of male friendships. Playing pool, dancing, and drinking with the boys after work looks like a blast. The small interactions at the wedding are perfect. I love the hunting trip with the guys as they sing stupid songs, cover the driver’s eyes, take a piss on the side of the road, drive away from their friend, and fight over boots. Vietnam offers some horrific scenes. Pigs squealing, explosions, and of course, the legendary roulette rounds. The three bullets scene is fucking insanity and I also enjoy the helicopter pickup attempt. Returning home is emotional and the dynamic between Michael and Linda is a great amount of awkward and unsaid feelings. The next hunting sequence is strong with the cabin roulette game but the real intensity is when Michael finds Nick. PHENOMENAL stuff. This movie is a real downer but I enjoy the post funeral breakfast together. What a movie.

"In the discussion of “Oscar bait,” Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter rightfully gets mentioned as a catalyst for the origin of such a concept, but the way it is sometimes mentioned—specifically as the “first example” of Oscar-baiting as we know it today—feels a little misconstrued. It is true that the film is one of the first (if not the first) to have sought awards directly rather than reeling them in organically (as a marketing strategy), but this was already after the film was produced and completed. None of The Deer Hunter itself was engineered to cater to the very accolades it was seeking: appraisal was merely a last-ditch effort to make the film seem the least bit accessible. What the film was really baiting (as is true for many Oscar baits as well) was an audience. Rather than making a film designed for awards to trick audiences into believing it was quality, Cimino made a masterpiece apart from any such considerations and “tricked” the awards for marketing’s sake.
But let’s talk about what the film is, instead of what it isn’t. The Deer Hunter is dually and equally a character study and war epic, intimately spending more time with the psyches of a handful of soldiers than with their combat. Mike, Nick, and Steven’s world of hard work and camaraderie has an instability they will only be able to see in tragic hindsight when it has crumbled beyond recognition. Cimino’s impeccable direction fleshes out every location of every interaction of every scene until even a viewer totally unfamiliar with these men’s environment will feel like they themselves are saying goodbye to a home just as well, as wartime takes the innocence that these adults didn’t realize they had. It’d be a gross understatement to say these men are changed by the Vietnam War, the traumas of which truly penetrating everything that makes them, and there are times when The Deer Hunter feels like nothing but an admonitory, soulless framing of a world of pain, punishing the viewer’s audacity to expect a film from it.
Only, something strange happens. Something almost incomprehensible. In the darkest recesses of this torturous journey, The Deer Hunter’s true identity ends up not being soulless at all. The film weighs indubitably on the viewer’s conscious for its entire three hours, but it never felt personally like it was excessively long, because every waking moment is spent with these characters I couldn’t not care about. How could a movie that inspires fear, trauma, disgust, anguish, melancholy, and heartbreak also inspire so much care, compassion, and understanding? It’s almost literally incredible, but it becomes apparent we are not watching souls break in vain, but rather the prized highs and insufferable lows of the human condition on a scale we can see—and many have seen—for ourselves.
The care and intention in examining the seemingly paradoxical humanity of this film is so clearly reflected in its making. The heart and soul inexplicably found in The Deer Hunter’s core emerges to the surface in breathtaking landscape shots, perfect camerawork, and countless technical moments that let us into these men’s lives. The most notable is probably the split diopter during the gang’s last pre-War gathering. The perfection of this scene… is what cinema is for. It is why we tell stories. It is why art deserves to be made. The attention to detail and realism is written all over this film and contributes to why it is such an important work. The Deer Hunter is scarring, and hurtful, and viscerally un-recommendable, but it is an American relic, and no film has affected me this much in a long time. I reveled in the brotherhood, I grimaced at the nightmarishness, and I could not help myself from joining in “God Bless America”—out of a burnt desperation and imploring sadness rather than explicit hope, but joining nonetheless.",5.0

"A absolute masterpiece! A heartbreaking war-drama epic about a generation of young friends in a small industrial town in America, leaving for the Vietnam war and the consequences that follows.
One of the best structured, edited and paced films I have ever seen. The story, script and directing is masterful, both in character arc, originality, world building and vision. Accompanied by impressive cinematography that captures the small rural feel of USA in addition to war and the deteriorating of Vietnam. Filming both sad and beautiful shots that focused on the faces, thoughts and reactions of the characters.
All actors, in minor and major parts, are excellent. Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro are mesmerizing. We have a saying in Norway when we strongly admire something, and this saying is necessary to express how impressed I am about Robert De Niros acting and how he carried the film. I bow in the dust for him.
The film shows friendship, heroism and how far we risk ourself, often to the edge of life, to save our friends. Multiple scenes showcases both friendship and brotherly sacrifice. The people waiting at home, particularly the women waiting for their men and their friends, is displayed in a true fashion, rarely seen in films.
Ultimately this is an anti-war film focused heavily on the destructive nature of war, both physically, mentally and by the people closest to soldiers.

"“The Deer Hunter” is a slow but extremely powerful anti-war film and a true American epic. It follows three working-class friends before, during, and after their fight in the Vietnam War (all three parts a roughly one hour long). The film shows how the war crippled them physically and psychologically and how it ruined their lives and those of their friends and families.
The first part of the film perfectly introduces the characters and makes you emotionally invested in their friendship. Many people find the first part too long and dragging but I enjoyed every moment of it. You really get to know these guys and since they are all likeable, real, and down to earth everymen, you feel like you´re one of them. In some ways, they reminded me of my own friend group, which made the film feel very personal to me. And knowing what happens next gives the first part a bittersweet feeling. Like the calm before the storm.
The Vietnam part is one of the most disturbing and suspenseful movie sequences I have ever seen. Especially the iconic Russian roulette scenes burned themselves into my mind. They are the perfect metaphor for the senselessness and randomness of dying in a war and absolutely nerve-wracking.
The final part is just heartbreaking, especially if you compare the characters at this point of their lives with the beginning of the film, when we met them. The film clearly demonstrates how war affects both individuals and the community in a horrible way. The last meeting of Mike and Nick brought me to tears and the final scene is a perfect ending for this movie.
“The Deer Hunter” has a brilliant script, gorgeous cinematography, a wonderful score, impressive production design, thought-provoking symbolism, and outstanding acting performances. Especially Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken bring their absolute A game (and the relationship of their two characters is my personal highlight of the movie), but memorable supporting performances include Meryl Streep, John Savage, and John Cazale (in his final role).

Similar to my experience of the only other Cimino that I’ve seen (specifically the bluray release of MichaelCimino’sHeaven’sGate) I was equal parts mesmerized by and ambivalent to The Deer Hunter. While both films’ sense of gender, race, and national politics are at best contradictory, these are compellingly, if not masterfully composed opuses.
I avoided this film for years solely on account of Rosenbaum’s evisceration of it. I can’t blame Rosenbaum for my own ignorance in choosing not to see it for myself. But I was young and impressionable when I read his hot take and Rosembaum is possibly the most influential writer that I’ve read. I probably would have figured out long ago that his assessment is both absolutely right and completely wrong. It’s not my intention to frame my thoughts here as entirely a reaction to a single review, but that is more or less how these thoughts poured out onto my keyboard. For him, the film is maudlin, a cornball worship of fragile masculinity contrived to win Oscars and made by the hack of the New American Cinema: a second rate pressing of Coppola elevated only by their association to better filmmakers. Rosenbaum highlights the film’s mea culpa for colonialism and the novelistic fantasy of the Russian roulette contrivance, trotted out whenever the dramatic weight begins to sag.
It certainly appears that Cimino is operating in two cinematic registers at once: Griffith’s Dickensian narrative sensibilities by way of Vidor’s take on The Great War picture The Big Parade. Where Griffith and Vidor navigated the boundaries of theater and actuality (known artifice and slippery realism), Cimino phases between television and verite: all mediated reflections of corporeal materiality shaped by unseen traditions of dreamlike narrative construction. This is the wellspring of the film’s aesthetic subversions and reactionary political conservatism. It is at best a lumbering paradox: the old narrative locking horns with the aesthetic investments.
Much of the film’s concerns are proletarian and committed to a flavor of American collectivism. This is most apparent in the best section, the first hour or so that takes place in Pennsylvania. The framing is unmistakable: workers leaving the factory. A direct shot looking at a group of workers moving in unison from the factory gates; a visual tradition from La sortie des usines Lumière à Lyon to Arbeiter verlassen di Fabrik. The quality of the actuality is supplanted here by the deceptiveness of 1970s verite—a form that is highly stylized in its mediation of reality but is frequently mistaken for realism. But to be fair, Cimino muddies those waters throughout The Deer Hunter.
The emotional grace of the film is in a sense of community; of collectivism—of sharing burdens and working together. This is not without its contradictions too. While Cimino is smart enough not to film an idyllic—there is trouble and rottenness and uncertainty always under the surface here—yet he teeters on the edge of fantasy. Perhaps he is filming the world as it should be and not the world as it is. How Deleuzian of him.
The dissolution of this great proletarian collectivism is disrupted by the war, framed as a Great War picture where unsuspecting blue collar patriots are sent off with fanfare, are changed by unspeakable horror, and return out of sync with their own community.
As far as this being a Great War silent film—specifically for me an echo of The Big Parade—Cimino films it as a silent. He has maudlin tendencies to be sure, but the camera frames movement, gesture, a sense of space and how figures move through that space (this later point is especially true in the sequence where Michael walks Linda to work after his return from war). Faces and movement speak louder than any words in a film that uses pedestrian dialogue to highlight the unspeakability of lived experience. The later portion of the film is all isolation; individuals alone in alien landscapes. Michael isn’t just cut off from the community but rather the community is shattered. It is the absence of the collectivity that opened the film and the final moment is an attempt—a hopeful attempt—to return to this collectivity: signing nationalist songs in unison; eating together, mourning together, healing together.
Yet individualism, like a paradoxical sphere orbiting its rustic Americana Stalinism, blazes through the film. And it is this element that breeds the most objectionable aspects that Rosenbaum articulates. For as much as Cimino gives to the community, DeNiro’s Michael is a near ubermensch: self-sufficient, confident, direct, and philosophical. He stands above his community as the strongest morally, physically, and intellectually. His army-of-one leadership and survival in Vietnam (and its aftermath) are more cartoonish than Rambo (a film I might love more by the way), but it is uncertain if Michael’s inhuman qualities are the stuff of proto-fascist image-making or if Cimino required a narrative anchor akin to John Gilbert’s James Apperson to guide us from Pennsylvania to Vietnam back to Pennsylvania and back to Vietnam. I suppose it is both.
Also like Griffith, the racism is a glaring problem demanding attention. This is namely the depiction of the Vietnamese, who are without question wicked, cruel animals. From the first shot of a Vietcong emotionlessly murdering villagers (a thing Americans did too) to the amoral citizens of Saigon who profit and relish off the moral abyss of war (a thing Americans did too), it is obvious that The Deer Hunter is from the perspective of the American soldiers, of blue collar American men to be precise and the unknown of the Vietnamese is partially framed as a clash of civilizations that cannot be translated. This is a problem with the combat narrative in general that contradicts many complex films about war (American Sniper has a similar contradiction, but that is a far more interesting film). Is the answer to film every war picture like The Rules of the Game? It might help. It might be the only way to avoid this trap of perspective, but at the same time sensory perspective is the bulwark of cinematic poetry. I’m thinking here of Behindert and Jonas Mekas. They manage to not be racist so I don’t think it’s just the aesthetic approach.
As for the Russian roulette. It is strange to say the least. A Dickensian metaphor for the effect of war trauma that is also a literal component of war trauma. I’m not sure how well this works, but it is certainly in line with the great works of Griffith that meld narrative fabrication with actuality in ways that twist both into something new. It’s not believable at all, but at the same time it works.
I have to admit that days later I'm still mesmerized by so much of this film. I also grow more skeptical of it the more I play it over in my mind.",0.0

"Mike retorna para casa depois da guerra. À certa altura decide voltar ao Vietnã na tentativa de resgatar Nick, que permaneceu por lá como jogador de roleta-russa. Sim, ele crê que Nick sobreviveu durante esse tempo a consecutivas sessões do jogo, apesar de isso ser mais do que improvável.
No Vietnã, Mike o encontra, e se depara com o que já estava anunciado, mas que ele não quisera ou não pudera acreditar: que há um corpo, que esse corpo tem a aparência de seu amigo, mas que aquele é um corpo esvaziado de tudo que o constituía como um homem. O que ele vê movimentando-se é uma sombra, um fantasma.
Quem sabe no fundo ainda havia algum resquício de memória; quem sabe se não veio mesmo à cabeça de Nick, no último momento, as árvores da Pensilvânia, assim como um galho quebrado lembrou o irmão em O intendente Sansho de sua vida antes da escravidão, ou como certos versos de Dante fizeram o Primo Levi pensar em humanidade mesmo dentro de um campo de concentração nazista.
(Relembrai vossa origem, vossa essência:/Vós não fostes criados para bichos,/e sim para o valor e a experiência.)
O fato é que as regras da roleta-russa são cruéis demais no modo como esgotam as probabilidades para que a viagem de Mike não estivesse fadada ao fracasso. Foi preciso que ele fizesse a travessia por uma Saigon em chamas, passando pelo próprio rio Styx em direção a Hades, para, enfim, ter o corpo do amigo em seus braços.
Em O franco-atirador constantemente transitamos entre o concreto e o abstrato. Assim como o motivo da roleta-russa concentra a violência da espera e a iminência da morte numa guerra, aqui, o intervalo até o reencontro coincide com o tempo que um homem levou numa jornada mental em busca de superar a negação e confrontar seus medos.
Junto com ele, o próprio filme se conduz por esse trajeto enquanto reflexão sobre o estado do país. Quando, depois do enterro de Nick, os amigos se reúnem e há entre eles um silêncio brutal, quem o rompe, sintomaticamente, é a personagem que permanecera por muito tempo sem falar. “It’s such a grey day”, ela diz, palavras que não aliviam a dor, mas que talvez permitam aos outros começar a encarar seus traumas de frente.",5.0

Ooh, this was a damn impressive one as well. This was actually one I was anticipating for a long while, which I haven’t been able to say about a lot of AFI picks to be perfectly honest. I had heard an awful lot about this from critics and audiences alike, especially the several Russian roulette scenes that are as suspenseful as I had heard they were. Partly because one of the things that sets this apart from a lot of war movies is that I really do care about every single main character. There’s no evil coded warden (though I do love Full Metal Jacket to pieces and always will), there’s no crazy amount of one dimensional characters that we’re supposed to care about anyway (looking at you, All Quiet on the Western Front.) It’s a perfect balance meeting in the middle of any number of war films, and in particular what they did right. The big reason The Deer Hunter works so well in that regard, other than the distinct characters in general, is that the atmosphere is truly allowed to build in a way I don’t see in most movies anyway, be damned if they’re war flicks or not. Like Full Metal Jacket but with an extra layer, the three hours are set into distinct sections: before they go to war, the war, and after they return from the war.
You can see where this is going, right? At the beginning of the film all we know about our lead characters are that they’re well rounded construction workers living their own involved lives, not like Western Front where the ensemble cast is portrayed as high school kids influenced by propoganda without a sense of buildup. And it’s not so much that portraying the negative effects of propoganda is a bad idea, as a young non-binary studying mass media and literature I take great umbrage against that idea, but for it to fully work I need to...you know...care about the people being affected, not showing them as symbols. The stuff in the actual war is the weakest part, I guess, but that is the hour where we get the Russian roulette scenes and the “weakest hour” of a great movie obviously doesn’t mean that much. Look, in my reviews I just point out the things that stick out to me as interesting discussion points, like psychics claim to do. The point is, these characters and the writing in general are just phenomenal, but The Deer Hunter wouldn’t be nearly as good without the first thing about the film that stuck out to me—the striking, beautiful imagery. From the first frame of the film I knew that whether or not the content was great, I was in for a feast for the eyes, and the rest of the picture did not disappoint. Not only in designs but in symbolism, The Deer Hunter kills in the photography department. In general, the film constantly makes the correct moves like I hoped it would, and for all of that I am grateful.

What an album. I loved it. After hearing “Midnight Sky” I knew rock was where Cyrus really belonged, but I didn’t know how true that was until I listened to Plastic Hearts. Because not only is it clear that she’s done her research, going as far as to rope in some of the biggest stars of the genre she’s going for, though she fires for many and exceeds at every point. She even goes back to her country roots for moments like “Angels Like You” and “High,” which I greatly appreciated. Only reason I didn’t give a full 100 is I wish she was more varied in the topics she covered on the record.

A display of fictionalized reality in its starkest, vastest, and most ambitious form, stripping away from any fineness or refined intricacy, ""The Deer Hunter"" goes for the jugular.
Cimino frames a haunting portrayal of a working-class community plagued by the implications of war, fragmented personalities, and reflections of the past forever echoing upon the sufferer, built in character development and contrast.

"The Deer Hunter --- 1978
Like many great movies there are many words to describe a movie like The Deer Hunter: powerful, moving, beautiful, sad, breathtaking and many others.
This is the second time I've seen The Deer Hunter. The only other time I've seen this movie was *years* ago. I knew it was a good movie then, but I don't think I really appreciated it as much as I do now.
What drew me back to this movie was actually years back, when I finally got around to watching the 1980 movie Heavens Gate.
Michael Cimino directed that movie as well, as many of you already know. With the very possible exception of Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, these two are arguably the best known movies he ever directed. The two had, initially very different reactions from both critics and the general public. But it was still Heavens Gate that led me back to The Deer Hunter.
And in many ways I'm grateful for that. The performances are great here, but I believe that Cimino's direction is about as beautiful as it gets.
He may have directed a few great movies in his career, but he definitely made the most of it here.
And I do want to give credit to the rest of the group. Like I said earlier, this movie has a great cast and The Deer Hunter truly makes the most out of them. De Niro, Streep, Walken and rest are all great in this movie.
And also I want to single out finally Vilmos Zsigmond for his great cinematography. This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have seen in a long while and he deserves much of the credit here.
Overall, this is very much a beautiful and haunting movie. And very worthy of a Five Star rating.",5.0
"This must be the only example in the history of the world where the girl who catches the bouquet at the wedding is actually asked to get married. 
Sorry that is not the thing that stands out the most, I’ll get onto the review.
This film didn’t feel to carry an anti-war message or even really feel as if it was about war. If anything it feels like the Vietnam war is just something that happened to happen in the course of these characters lives. The Deer Hunter doesn’t have this foreboding sense or grandeur that Vietnam war films seem to have because it wasn’t about the bigger picture it was really about the characters and that is really interesting. I guess that makes this film more real because the men that had to fight in Vietnam had their own lives and their problems and suddenly this war came along. It’s not always about the bigger picture sometimes it’s just about how this big thing personally affected certain characters. You could say that says just as much about the war as any other film but then you could also say it says more about the characters. 
Saying all that this film did kind of feel like a modern Best Years of our Lives however without the patriotism. It’s nice seeing the before and after math because there is always less light shed on them so that insight is always interesting and quite refreshing as often we see these men go through these horrific ordeals and experience pure tragedy and never how they then have to live with that after. 
Despite what I’ve said, this film does show the brutality of war. I mean that scene (you know what scene I’m on about) is the most famous part of the film and it is so damn cathartic to watch, just pure unapologetic brutality. It is a stand out point of the film which is kind of basic to say but it is just so true. We still get a sense of the damaged war veterans who just can’t let what they saw and what they experienced go but to me this film is more so about the characters then about the war.",4.0

"A devastatingly emotional epic with perfect performances, The Deer Hunter’s brilliance lies in its ability to maintain both a massive scale and heartbreaking intimacy with its characters. It’s temporally and visually enormous, thanks to striking cinematography and mise-en-scene, but it’s also so character-focused that it almost feels claustrophobic.
Michael Cimino doesn’t rush headfirst into the harrowing war content, instead opting to establish a warm community and some of the strongest, most realistic male friendships ever depicted in American film. This romantic vision of civilian life enhances the tragedy of its inevitable loss. Although the wartime sequences are strong, this film’s greatness stems from the interpersonal drama that bookends them. 
The Vietnam setting works well enough, but I don’t think The Deer Hunter is necessarily a quintessential Vietnam movie because its scope and themes are so much broader than that particular conflict — the specific location almost feels incidental. Instead, Cimino’s film is a powerful portrait of how trauma shatters the psyche and destroys communities — and, as a skeptic of American patriotism, I also read it as an incredible indictment of nationalism’s corrosiveness.",5.0

"What is there to be afraid of in this war? The war is a joke, a silly thing.

I vividly remember my first encounter with Michael Cimino’s haunting masterpiece, a long time ago in a huge, crowded cinema. When the end credits rolled, audiences very slowly got up from their seats and streamed out in complete, hushed silence, as if nobody dared to speak yet or everybody had to sort out their emotions before commenting on what they had just watched.
The passing of time and a lot of controversies about the film’s faults and merits and its supposed lack of historical accuracy for me still haven’t dulled its overwhelming emotional impact one tiny bit. Re-watching it again for the umpteenth time, what impressed me most this time around is Cimino’s audacity in going so resolutely against the established cinematic grain. Just consider its bold, unconventional three act structure that gives it an aura of fatalism and inevitably that’s quite the opposite of plain realism and rationality. 
I hope they send us where the bullets are flyin‘ and the fightin‘s the worst.

Setting the major part of the story in a small Pennsylvania steel worker’s town, among a community of Russian orthodox immigrants, is in itself a daring choice for a war movie, but starting out with a nearly half hour long wedding sequence, just fleshing out the main characters without very much happening at all, definitely takes balls. And somehow turning it into one of the single greatest sequences in American cinema is just incredible.
A close look at that leisurely, drawn-out first act reveals it’s filled with ominous signs and warnings of the terrible things to come. Those fiery, infernal steel furnaces that dominate the very first scene already point towards the looming hell of war. A taciturn Green Beret at the wedding party seems to know things our looking-forward-to-combat protagonists can’t imagine yet. And of course there’s that ominous drop of wine spilled on a wedding dress, visible only to the movie audience, predicting all kinds of bad luck. The blown-up teenage photographs of the three main characters and all the American flag decorations at the party feel like a premonition of impermanence, innocence lost and misplaced patriotism. And the ethereal deer hunting scenes with their dubious one-shot philosophy, that are the culmination of the first part of the movie, will soon enough find their perverted echo in the jungles of Vietnam.
We gotta play with more bullets.

After this long, long introduction and just when we’re completely invested in the fate of these people, one of the all-time great scene transitions throws us and the characters brutally and unexpectedly right in the middle of the horrors of war. This central act of the movie is still as shocking, overwhelming and anxiety-inducing as it ever was, never equalled by subsequent films that only upped the ante on violence and gore. It’s also a literally jaw-dropping acting showcase for De Niro, Walken and Savage, but then the whole movie is chock-full of fantastic, natural performances. The unforgettable Russian Roulette scenes are often criticised for having no basis in historical fact, but I never considered the story to be strictly about the Vietnam War anyhow. Like so much else in the movie, Russian Roulette rather functions in a symbolical way, standing in for the senselessness, unpredictability and destructiveness of war in general, as well as for some deep-seated death wish and obsession with guns and violence in the American male psyche. And on a more personal level, no matter if it’s war, a car accident or cancer, you never know when your bullet comes up and you’re probably never going to be prepared for it anyway.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?

The final act of the movie then is the unavoidable, shattering comedown. It’s the dark, distorted mirror image of that joyful opening. Now nothing is as it was and nothing will ever be the same again. For the protagonists as well as the whole country it’s the end of optimism, innocence and the belief in a justified war. It’s the corrosion of cheerfulness, friendship and community. 
Instead of a carefree wedding there’s a bleak, wintery funeral. One more deer hunt among former friends almost ends in tragedy. And while the majestic stag is spared in the end, thanks maybe to some new-found respect for life, the human characters are not nearly so lucky, ending up either dead by that one shot or emotionally and physically scarred for the rest of their lives. We’ve come a long way from Frankie Valli’s exuberant pop hymn 'Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You' to a sombre, highly ironic rendition of 'God Bless America' in a quietly shattering final scene that can still bring tears to my eyes. 
See this? This is this. This ain’t something else.

A powerful, sobering American epic that transcends all its flaws and has comfortably stood the test of time. It deserves to be treasured as the classic that it is and, looking at the current state of cinema, it’s highly unlikely that we will see its equal anytime soon.",5.0
"The effects of war last long after the fighting is done. Soldiers leave ready and willing to fight to protect their home, and no longer recognize said home when they return.

"When THE DEER HUNTER had its initial release, I went to see it after it won Best Picture.  That had to mean that it was really good, right?  Well, I hated it.  More than that, I remember thinking that it fit my personal definition of “pornographic” because the extended Russian Roulette sequences could have a dark influence on people battling severe depression.  ... It could literally be harmful to one’s emotional health.
   
Okay, so I haven’t seen THE DEER HUNTER since the late 1970’s.  One of the things that recording my film watching reactions on Letterboxd has done for me has been to show me how my tastes have changed (and matured).  Some films that I thought were brilliant had tarnished.  Some that had left me cold revealed qualities that I had missed earlier.  Recently, a friend told me that THE DEER HUNTER was one of her favorite films.  Hmmm.  So, I thought it was one to watch again.
   
I still don’t like it.  On the plus side, I no longer think that the Russian Roulette sequences are pornography.  I think they are in unnecessarily bad taste.
   
At one point during the show, I began musing that THE DEER HUNTER would make a great theme park thrill ride at Universal Studios.  Riders unfamiliar with the film would have no idea of where they were going next.  They just arrive at the loading platform for the climb up to the top of the drop (The Wedding), lulled by a leveling off of beautiful imagery (The Hunt), and then suddenly dropped into a chaos of speedily delivered horrific scenes (Russian Roulette Sequence One).  Then we climb up to the next drop (The Return), become lulled by the reconnections (Linda and Steven), and are speedily dropped screaming into more horrific scenes (Russian Roulette Sequence Two) ... before we are sent to the exit platform (The Funeral).
   
Actually, that’s not a bad analogy because character motivations often don’t make any sense.  We are shown sequence after sequence with little meaning (Yes, I picked up on the wine drops on the wedding dress and “Don’t leave me there”).  Coincidences abound, especially the friends meeting up in Vietnam and being captured together.  And I didn’t buy the pervasiveness of Russian Roulette in Vietnam for a moment.
   
In short, despite a high-powered cast, THE DEER HUNTER has one of the most loosely constructed plot lines that I’ve ever seen with a number of illogical occurrences.  Scenes seem to be added for no reason other than to shock or give the performers a chance to emote.  And when we were “back home,” I was frequently bored.
   
I guess I don’t know a good movie even when it slaps me in the face, puts a gun to my head and pulls the trigger.",2.0
"I’m a beautiful wreck. I’m generally capable of pretty intense emotions, but I can count on two hands the films that have affected me as profoundly as the one I just saw, The Deer Hunter. A part of me is beating myself up for not having gotten to this much sooner, the other part believes that a movie sometimes comes into your life at exactly the right moment. I do believe that ten years ago, while I’m sure it would have been an emotional experience, I wouldn't have had quite the same reaction as today. So I’m glad it took me so long, as this is a film one needs to be ready for.
I had an inkling that I would love this the moment it opened. There was an atmosphere in the air that I responded to instantly. However I was completely unprepared for just how much I would love this. Although I’ve only just seen it, I can already tell that it will be with me for the rest of my life. I can see myself saying its name in a week, in a month, in a year, twenty-five years down the road. I can see myself mentioning it to my son, if I should ever have one, and how I’m making my new girlfriends at the retirement home join me in the TV room for the amazing film that will be on that night. We’ll barely touch the popcorn and cry into embroidered handkerchiefs. Because that’s the kind of movie The Deer Hunter is; a movie that needs to be preserved, passed down to the next generations, a movie that should never be forgotten. I’m not worried though that it will ever be. It’s way too powerful to just fade away.
There are so many things that I wanted to say, but right this moment I just wanna curl up into the fetal position and be alone with the feelings that it triggered — sadness and happiness, in equal amounts. Sadness over what I just saw, and happiness over the discovery of a true masterpiece. The Deer Hunter is the kind of movie that makes you want to press the pause button for the remainder of the day, just lay on the cold floor and stay in this cloud of pure emotion. It’s a testament to the greatest art this world has to offer. I’m so grateful that movies like this exist, and so depressed that there aren’t enough that can make you feel this way.",5.0
"""It's a gray day""
A inocência e a sua perda incontornável. Um filme sobre a ingenuidade dos soldados enviados ao Vietnã e a ignorância dessa mesma juventude sobre os efeitos da guerra. 
O filme inteiro é sobre os espaços, desde a primeira ida ao bar até a última, drasticamente diferentes. Na primeira parte, o casamento e a ideia de celebração passam não apenas a ingenuidade dos personagens como a masculinidade que estava ali enraizada, todos crendo que são mais corajosos que os outros em uma espécie de competição interna pelos louros do excesso de testosterona. 
Dali em diante, quando o filme move para o Vietnã, os vemos tão pequenos quanto qualquer homem pode ser diante do medo iminente de perder a própria vida em solo estrangeiro, sem família e sem apoio. Nada é familiar. O medo de estar diante de tamanha desumanidade gera  um pavor quase tangível nos olhos de todos e um único objetivo toma conta, sobreviver.
A terceira parte faz contraste com a primeira, e embora retornemos aos EUA e os espaços continuem essencialmente os mesmos, agora existe uma sombra, tudo é parte da penumbra de uma tristeza irreparável. As noites são bem maiores que os dias, a escuridão assombra e a culpa (de se relacionar com a personagem de Meryl Streep) força Michael ao resgate de um Nicky que posteriormente descobre estar perdido. 
A cena final é uma ironia sem tamanho. O hino dos EUA acapella, uma forma interessante de encerrar esse conto de desilusão da juventude trabalhadora com o próprio país e suas intenções com inúmeras e péssimas consequências.",3.5

"Structurally one of the oddest movies I’ve watched in a while. Doesn’t follow the current standard with over an hour given to the first act. The pacing and plot were fractured with priority given to long scenes of “business”. “Business” meaning people getting in and out of cars, entering locations, driving, walking - basically all the things that are mostly edited out of movies. Then ironically, interesting moments like how they get captured in Vietnam is breezed over with a quick cut. Somehow, even with the 3 hour run time and the strange meandering storytelling, I was invested the whole time.
It’s amazing that this was such a huge hit.",3.5

""I play Russian Roulette everyday. A man sport. With a bullet called life, yeah mama called life"" - System of a Down, 1998
Amirite? That song was released 20 years after The Deer Hunter! And now the song itself is 25 years old *MIND BLOWN*
Anyway…to the movie. Roy Scheider was meant to do this film but he ended up doing Jaws 2. It's an odd thought, I can't really see him in the Michael role, wonderful actor though he was. De Niro stepped in and gave the part the intensity it needed.
I used to think The Deer Hunter was brilliant, in my younger days. It's a tough one because it's impossible to disregard the cultural sensitivity that surrounds the discourse. However, there is a full one hour before the film gets to Vietnam. During this hour we spend time with a group of friends, getting drunk, playing pranks, getting married. Enjoying life. Oh and hunting deer. It's an engaging passage, if a little overlong.
Then like a crash we find ourselves in the midst of a Viet Cong ambush. I had forgotten just how prominent and immediate the Russian Roulette scenes are in this part of the film. They may be taking a liberty but the scenes do make for suspenseful cinema. They also convey the idea of the random nature of war and its often indiscriminate destruction. As a narrative device the scenes work. However there's no doubt they reduce the Viet Cong to a cartoonish villain and there is little or no depiction of Vietnamese people aside from this. Although this is a problem not unique to The Deer Hunter, it has to be said. In American cinema films about Vietnam are often centered on the impact of the war on American communities.
And I find The Deer Hunter to be strongest in its final act where the character building from the first hour really pays off. Also Meryl Streep finally gets some meaningful screen time. By the time that De Niro's Michael returns from the war, the once tightly knit group dynamic has unraveled home life in a seemingly permanent way.
The Deer Hunter is a classic that has its share of detractors. I can see why. It's a tough watch. Partly because of its depiction of the impact of the war. But also because of the politics. I used to consider it a masterpiece. I am a lot more ambivalent this time around. However to entirely dismiss the film would be foolish. It retains a lot of its power to affect the viewer purely on an emotional level.",3.5

"Pretty underwhelmed considering the reputation that this film has. 
There are definitely great elements to this film,  Christopher Walken steals every scene he’s in, Meryl Streep, Robert de Niro, and John Cazale are also really good here, the cinematography is pretty to look at, and the Russian Roulette scenes are expertly directed. 
However the length and pacing really do this film a disservice. There’s no reason for this to be 3 hours let alone have a 45 minute wedding scene. 
I respect the portrayal of veterans coming home from Vietnam, since this film came out just three years since it ended but I think it ultimately doesn’t work as well as it could have. 
Though I do think it’s neat that Christopher Walken sings a Frankie Valli song in this film and decades later he gets casted in Jersey Boys, about Frankie Valli. It’s like Mike Myers in Bohemian Rhapsody, and I think that’s just kind of a fun detail.

"It ain't from today that I have always heard the same types of commentarys involving this particular film from the extremely snubbed Michael Cimino, as perhaps the best film that the Academy Awards has ever awarded an Oscar within its main category, among others great artistic values from the film, of course. But such matter of discussion always came acroos my mind every time I stared at the film before watching it for the first time. What was so great and so special that had made this film into a grand a classic masterpiece of cinema history, when I had hardly even heard its tittle mencioned in the public sphere and only a few times between my various acquaintances and friends from my cinephile medium.
Which came as a result a first viewing at the very wrong time (I was tired and sleepy on the day, don't judge me, I am ashamed myself) and not very beneficial to my first view of the movie. That made me slander (heresy most likely) for a long time calling it an overrated, rhythmically dated, highly pretentious classic that got lost in banalities and scenes stretched more than necessary. After an hour of filming we are still at the wedding of Steve, John Savage's character, before we even see anything about Vietnam or anything relating with the title.
But a few years of ""experience"" later, watching more and more films and inserting them into my movie bag of cinematic knowledge, as I continuous doing till today (not flattering myself), and also by getting me familiar with the director's movies and style (and eventually falling completely in love with his ultra snnubed and underestimated ""Heaven's Gate""), reviewing the film FINALLY today, I could see what is so great about Cimmino's masterpiece: absolutely everything about it! And just a heads up, it won't be few the compliments that I own this movie to give here, so take the risk of reading on your own or go watch the film if you haven't already.
Cimino showns throughout ""The Deer Hunter"" to be a worthy heir and possess a few familiar characteristics of some of the richest classic films archetypes from some masters in particular. He possesses in his core a cultural and social affection worthy of John Ford's cinema when he showns to capture the cultural essence of the small orthodox Christian community where its group of characters protagonists initially coexist in such and palpable harmony; he knows how to portray the comic and tragic feeling of this environment and the conviviality of the characters in such a realistic and palpable format that almost resembles some of the classics from Vittorio De Sica, and without hitch in its rhythmic construction, having an almost a contemplative optic worthy of Luchino Visconti's cinema (with one of its intro scenes in the refinery seemingly removed and homaged from ""The Damned"", one of Visconti's masterpieces); and manages to make the whole sad trajectory of its so intimate story and turns it in a truly epic scale, grand and immersible as only Sergio Leone could do so equally well.
By the way, will this certainly will go down to be the closest that we'll ever see a Sergio Leone's Vietnam War kind of movie, or you thought that the tortuous, tense Russian roulette scene in the confined Vietcong Prison served only as a faithful and brutal historical retraction? Well, yes, but only the unseemly creation of tension by the constant exchange of sweaty looks and with emotions exploding only by the force of the ferocious looks of fear and rage, and the beautiful skillfully edited carnage that succeeds, beautifully brings us back to the glorious days of Once Upon a time in the West, with a realism in its violence so much palpable, and brutal.
But comparisons with his rich Leone or Viscontian inspirations do not stop there. Both in the way Cimino purposely and naturally stretches the story of Mike and his groups of friends in the pre, during, and post-Vietnam, using this structure of three long acts to build a retraction of the progress of these individuals' lives almost like a dramatic documentary , and to make us the audience feel each impact of events and unrollings in the lifes of each one of the characters. While behind them, we can see America as a living stage and it progresses and evolves alongside their characters, subtlely resemblengly to the other tale of ""Once Upon a time"" from Leone ... in America"". An America here that if at the beginning parts from beeing a place of ethnic and cultural plurality, full of joy and hope, by the end we see it developing into an increasingly cold and empty place with lacks of faith or hope.
You want something more 'Luchino Viscontian' than the historical stage of its characters brutally affecting all their lives?! And Cimmino accomplishes this with a rare narrative mastery of even other directors of his days. Where within all its visual greatness and historical scale, in which Cimmino spares no desire to show and elevate in his film. Using and abusing the operatic cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond in perhaps the most dazzling work of his career. Departing from the warmth of natural comfort of the beginning, going to the fierce and itchy heat of the brutalities of the conflict, and the cold and distant return to home now no longer familiar in the end. And sometimes the suttle hints of documented look of the social chaos, that the camera captures with numerous extras tormented a living chaos in the scene worthy of a true modern epic.
But with some personal highlights of its brilliance to me are present in the two brief, but striking sequences of deer hunting, revealing a landscape scale so immense and with an living operatic characteristic when the beautiful soundtrack of Stanley Myers echoes with its high and evocative corals in the background. But it is also in its moments of light chords that reveal the suttlety and the intimacy in which Cimmino manages to work so equally well the drama of each one of the characters in its brief and small moments. Without never sounding banal or forced, and yet extremely real and pure in their demonstrations of feelings, so simple and truthful. Where the pure silence and small exchanges of looks tell and speak more than any line of dialogue about the intimate relationship between each character, and letting each cast member shine at some point, some more than others of course.
Having a great cast in hand also makes it easier, with big names ranging from a young Meryl Streep in one of her first major film roles; the great John Cazale in the last great performance of his short career; and of course De Niro in the decade of its pic working on great movie after great movie and that it spares all accolades like usual, and leaves all the dramatic and emotional spotlights of the film resonate in both Streep's Linda and Nick from a FANTASTIC Christopher Walken, with his character being the most tragic reflex and greatest victim of the whole story that affects each character in a different way. The fateful consequences of a conflict, in which if at the begining started with a heroic purpose, they left it forever and lethally marked by the end.
But honestly, I must also understand the fact that this ain't a movie for all tastes and pleasures. It is sometimes silent and meticulous in the dialectic of its story and in what it seeks to convey about the impact of war on the lives of such easily identifiable individuals, for they are just like any one of us inside this story. But without losing an individual decharacterization or loss of personality, both human and cinematic, thanks to all the talents involved. Some of the best actors of all time under the command of one of the best directors of all time, where all assembled formed this which is to me today, without a doubt, not only one of the best films about the Vietnam war, not only one of the best war films of all time, but also a worthy cinematic epic.
Both in its scale and ambition, and also intimate, tragic and simple in its core. A deservedly called masterpiece and without doubt also deserves to be better remembered and celebrated as such and so much deserves it.",5.0
"Existem duas formas de se assistir esse filme: Uma delas é assistir esperando um filme de guerra cheio de cenas de ação grandiosas, como ""O Resgate do Soldado Ryan"". Caso assim seja, você irá se decepcionar e reclamar que o filme é lento.
A outra forma é assistir um dos filmes mais poderosos sobre as consequencias da guerra, a capacidade que a guerra tem de destruir a sanidade de uma pessoa. Mostra também os efeitos devastadores daqueles que vivem a guerra todos os dias, sem saber se irá sobreviver para o próximo dia, e também os familiares e amigos que não participam da guerra, mas igualmente vivem a guerra, preocupados com a vida de seus queridos que estão participando dela.
O filme tem 3 horas de duração, sendo que cada hora nos mostra uma etapa da vida daqueles jovens. A primeira hora existe todo um clima de alegria, confraternização, casamento, promesas, amizades, bebedeiras, e toda aquela ingenuidade de acreditarem que serão heróis que lutaram pela sua pátria.
Passando essa primeira hora, o diretor Michael Cimino dá um salto temporal onde vemos os jovens no meio da guerra vivendo uma situação aterradora. Por sinal, é genial como Cimino quebra todo esse clima de alegria em questão de segundos, com um único corte, somos jogados em meio ao terror absoluto da guerra, sem tempo para ""respirar"". As cenas da roleta russa são angustiantes e de uma tensão absurda.
Já a última hora de filme acompanha as consequencias da guerra na vida daqueles individuos, a forma como a guerra desestruturou cada um deles, destruiu os laços, as familias, as amizades, a alegria, a sanidade mental, e tudo o que vimos de bom na primeira hora.

"Previously had this at 5 stars. The last time I watched The Deer Hunter must have been in high school where I had this in my top 5 favorite films. Up until this rewatch, it was also my favorite Best Picture winner.
Sadly, my feelings on this film have changed a lot; I have consequently bumped this from my top 200. For one, it’s not as emotionally effective as I had once thought. The whole Russian roulette scene with the Vietcong felt very rushed and unnatural, and these particular antagonists were very cartoonish and flat. A big part of why I’m now ambivalent towards this scene is because of how the film transitions from home to the war in Vietnam. The scene prior shows the friends finding each other in Vietnam as reinforcements arrive, then in the next scene, they are prisoners. It’s honestly one of the most jarring transitions. I could have sworn it wasn’t that jarring before! I really think parts of this story are missing in chunks. I know this film is 3 hours, so this might be a bold statement, but another 30 minutes to an hour could have remedied the unnatural flow at this juncture and other junctures in the story.
I used to think the Russian roulette scene was quite tense, even after a second or third watch. Not sure exactly how many times I’ve seen the film, but it’s worn off by now. All I see is an empty shell of a scene that comes off as a contrivance more than anything else. The 2nd time the friends face off in Russian roulette is much more effective, and perhaps my favorite scene. At this point, we know Walken’s character is totally lost in the game. But not just in the game. The game signifies something much greater: The recognition of how futile the war is and how futile a human life is regarded. The game is a stand in for life and all the random shit it throws at us, where only luck will determine one’s fate. Perhaps tempting fate is an itch that needs to be scratched for this character. Once the futility is recognized, one may resort to self-destruction. But not everyone goes down this path. Some can see past it and see the beauty of life, which is why the post-war deer hunting scene is incredibly powerful.",4.0

For anyone who hasn’t seen the film, I’ll just say this: the three friends will, one way or another, be broken by their involvement in a deeply unpleasant and wholly unnecessary conflict.

"War Game
An Analysis
Virility is central to 'The Deer Hunter' because the main character, Michael, spends the majority of the film ritualistically testing his masculinity. Michael is a man who measures his masculinity by a unique ""one shot"" philosophy. Michael states to Nick while hunting,
""You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about. A deer's gotta be taken with one shot.""
Nick questions Michael's ""one shot"" philosophy and Michael says,
""Two shots is pussy.""
In other words, Michael thinks killing is a game, and how well he kills presents how masculine he is. The title of the film itself exposes an aspect of Mike's character. The title, 'The Deer Hunter', is presumably what Michael refers to himself as, and thus we can suspect that Michael has a suppressed need for becoming one with his prey and to become an equal opponent for it. In the kill, Michael takes the name of the prey for dominance. The prey hunted is deer, and his dominance of deer leads him to a new prey: human beings through war.
The film also contains some strong religious elements which tie into Michael's views on masculinity, death, and himself. If one listens carefully, we can see a pronounced difference between the chorus, which sings at the wedding in the beginning of the movie, and the much clearer choral verses that appears while Mike is hunting - this draws parallels to how Michael approaches both the pensive environment of his church, and the serene, composed, temperament of the hunt, and supports the belief that hunting is a kind of cleansing, or pure action (similar to a religious ceremony) for Michael.
The idea that Nick asks Mike if he is God is also telling of why Michael finds utter solace in the hunt. The power of taking a life for Michael is for him an act which is not necessarily so much enjoyed, as it is obligatory. The God-complex for Michael stems from Michael's constant need to be in control - whether it be control of his friends' lives, his own life, the decisions he makes (whether they're erratic or not, i.e. running naked), or how his friends finally cope with their trauma. The act of hunting and killing a deer with a single bullet, for Michael, is the embodiment of control - of ""his way"".
While hunting for Michael is about control, he's not a sociopath. Hunting deer for Michael is an act with many associations:
- He's proving his masculinity to himself.
- There's an unspoken spiritual connection Michael has not only with the hunt, but with the prey.
However, an important question to ask is if Hell is portrayed at all in the film. And, certainly, a quick glance would support the idea that Vietnam itself is viewed as a sort of Hell, accurately supported by Mike's use of a flame-thrower on a Vietnamese soldier during the first few minutes of the war portion of the movie. But rather, perhaps the greater symbol of Hell resides in the conditions and the lives that the veterans must go through. Nick has found his own personal Hell, which the viewers realize when he breaks down attempting to answer the names of his parents. Steve has found Hell in his disabilities, and the idea that he will never lead a normal life, although he attempts to be making peace with it at the end. In a sort of quasi-religious view, Mike, like Jesus, travels back into Hell, or Vietnam, in order to ""save"" his friend, and bring him back. Although he fails and thus is left to remain hell incarnate.
In the film, Michael, Nick, and Stevie are forced to play Russian roulette when they are captured by the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam war. Russian roulette is proved to be more than the ""one shot"" philosophy Michael used to measure his masculinity by hunting deer. In Russian roulette, Michael and his friend's virility are measured by receiving the ""one shot"" to themselves without fear or hesitation. Russian roulette is politically motivated and senseless, which is a metaphor for war in general. When a viewer watches these grotesque scenes of Russian roulette, it gives them a feeling of horrifying disgust, which is important to enhance the meaning of a brutal game of odds.
PART II
Returning to Planet Earth
Another major ideal in the move is that of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. None of the characters that travel to Vietnam come back the same, and Nick does not come back at all. Nick literally not returning home is the personification of how many Vietnam vets experienced life after war - they didn't. Nick has become a shadow of his former self, not wanting to acknowledge what his life has become.
Mike and Stevie too struggle with letting go and re-entering society. For Mike, this can be detected when he returns home from Vietnam without Nick, and feels out of place. Michael is still wearing his uniform, symbolizing that what he went through in Vietnam has not left him, and society's lack of understanding of what he's gone through magnifies the character as an outsider. For Stevie (who has become a triple amputee) moving on becomes terrifying when Mike comes to the hospital to take him home. Stevie is not so much wanting to stay in the hospital, but rather doesn't want to face the humiliation of having all his old friends pity him.
Michael's experience in the war changed his values for human life and nature. This is shown in the scene where Michael's wife throws a welcome home party for him, and Michael's fellow workers who attend the party chase a wounded deer out in front of their cabin. The steel mill workers laugh at the helpless deer and Michael goes out to shoot it. Then Michael realizes that nature has an important part in society, so he shoots his gun in the air instead.
A similar expression of compassion and understanding is shown when Mike attempts to rekindle the distant relationship he's developed with Stan and John, while taking them hunting. Michael's obvious intentions behind this practice are to suppress his trauma with his masculine ritual, in front of two individuals whom he knows full well are not as capable hunters. This vein attempt at ego boosting is thwarted when Michael comes across his first deer while on the hunt. Michael readies himself to fire, but doesn't. Instead, Michael decides to fire his gun into the air, alerting the deer, and allowing it to escape. Michael has learned that death is not a game measured by virility.
After this self discovery, Michael quickly returns to Vietnam to find Nick who, as I mentioned prior, has become a mindless, heroin addicted, drone that has become driven by the thrill of Russian roulette. Michael discovers him in a cheap, claustrophobic arena of sorts and tries to bring him home, but Nick won't stop playing. In the scene where Nick and Michael play Russian roulette for the last time Walken and De Niro probably display the greatest representation of comradery and love for a friend I have ever seen. Walken's drastic, tortured, facial expressions say something both to De Niro and the audience. Before Nick kills himself, Michael, at the end of his rope, begins reminiscing about the old times. They both share a laugh before Nick pulls the trigger. Nick's death represents that everything Michael has ever valued is dead, as well as the death of a generation caused by the madness in Vietnam.
Cimino uses intense scenes of violence to convey a very real message: war is hell, and not a game. Cimino is also making a bold statement about the fruitlessness of masculinity. It is at first masculinity that is of the utmost importance to Michael. However, when the loss of Nick sets in, masculinity means nothing. Michael realizes that his loved ones mean more to him than his own virility.
'The Deer Hunter' shows us the importance of life, in all its forms. It makes us question why we still trivialize death to the point where something as serious as causalities are measured by this illusory scale of manliness. It's an unfortunate reality that this despicable way in which masculinity is measured is still relevant today. Though, it's also this saddening fact that makes 'The Deer Hunter' all the more relevant now than ever before.
In short, Cimino's film shows how experience can change anyone's outlook on how they view society, their loved ones, and themselves. Even a deer hunter, like Michael.",5.0

This is by far my least favorite Best Picture winner that I’ve seen. The storyline is all over the place - one scene they are in a bar drinking and the next they are captured in the war. That sudden change had no explanation or setup and was a microcosm of how this film moved from one scene to the next. Plus this movie felt unnecessarily long. The whole first hour has probably 10 minutes worth of necessary information yet they drag it out so much with pointless conversations and dancing.
This also is the worst sounding movie I’ve ever heard. It literally hurt my ears listening to this. It sounded like they were using sound equipment from the 40s. I’m no sound expert, but my lord that was obnoxious. What a miserable experience.

The Deer Hunter Is Consider One Of The Best And Most Important Anti War Film Ever Made And I Can Confirm That They Are Absolutely Right.
The Story/Plot
A group of working-class friends decides to enlist in the Army during the Vietnam War and finds it to be hellish chaos – not the noble venture they imagined. Before they left, Steven married his pregnant girlfriend – and Michael and Nick were in love with the same woman. But all three are different men upon their return.
Winner Of 5 Oscars Including Best Picture The Deer Hunter Follows The Story Of 3 Friends Michael Portrayed By Robert De Niro , Nick Portrayed By Christopher Walken And Steven Portrayed By John Savage Preparing To Head On In The Battle Of Vietnam Leaving Their Friends And Loved Once Behind One Being A Girl Played By Meryl Streep Who Both Michael And Nick Are In Love With. Then The Three Get To Experience The True Form Of War And Coming To Terms With The Reality Of Things , The Three Get Captured And They Are Forced To Play Russian Roulette , Needless To Say They Do Escape And They End Up Surviving The War. Upon Michael Returning Home He Is A Completely Different Person But I Can See That He Tries To Hide His Emotion As Best As He Can. Meanwhile Nick Discovers A Place Where He Continues To Play Russian Roulette And Winning A Lot Of Money Which He Decides To Send To Steve Who Lost Both His Legs In An Effort To Climb In A Rescue Helicopter With Michael. The Film Feels Very Slow Burning And The Delivery Of Dialogue Is Very Strong. Now That Michael Has Returned He Builds A Strong Connection With Linda (Meryl Streep) And When Michael Does Find Out What Nick Is Doing He Decides To Go And Confront Him About Returning Home. De Niro And Walken Are Phenomenal In This Film , Truly Powerhouse Acting With A Lot Of Emotional Moments. Walken Was A Huge Surprice To Me In This Film. The Last Scene Is Indescribable , No Words Just Pure Silence , And The Characters Trying To Come In Terms With A Loss. Sure Some Scenes Do Kinda Feel Overly Stretched Out Especially The Wedding Scene But I Thing That Was The Point Of The Film , Trying To Show The Characters Life Before The War , When They Were Truly Happy And Felt That They Were Home And How The Went Deer Hunting Before And How It Felt After The War. Michael Cimino Did An Excellent Direction In This Film , The Vietnam Scene Feels Very Real Especially The Explosions , And I Really Love The Soundtrack And The Cinematography.
In Short Words The Deer Hunter Is A Very Powerful Anti War Film Presenting In A Strong Form The Aftermath Of War And Strong Bond Friendships And Coming In Terms With A Loss. What A Powerful Film.

"War haunts you, war breaks you.
The Deer Hunter has been on my watchlist ever since high school. I was visiting the classics and had just entered my DeNiro era but I knew so much about the Russian roulette scene it made me afraid of the movie.
And so it became one of my biggest blind spots but I had to check it out… and it’s as devastating as I imagined — a quintessential 70s movies: bleak, anti-war, tense as hell, and sad as fuck… with powerhouse performances from the entire cast, DeNiro is great as usual, Cazale puts a bow on his perfect filmography, but it’s Walken who runs away with this whole thing, absolutely magnetic with those piercing eyes, saying so much with minimum dialog.
I didn’t expect the entire first hour to be an entire wedding celebration but you need to show the joy, innocence, and camaraderie before the rest of the movie pulls the rug from you, raising the stakes just to crush you with the emotional and physical toil of war, a blistering commentary on man’s folly.",4.0
"I object to this film as a fraud, conjuring up the wrong emotions. It asks us to sentimentalize the Vietnam experience via small-town characters traumatized by it.
""The Deer Hunter"" is an exercise in blind nostalgia. By 1978, the US had exited Saigon three years prior, an event the movie memorializes through stock footage as well as movie scenes. That event is reduced from a general experience to a particular incident, the Mike character going back to Vietnam to find his Eurydice in hell, his buddy Nicky. He does this while Americans are evacuating. Both Mike and Nicky are from a Pennsylvania working-class factory town, which in the future will become part of the American Rust Belt.
Mike's striving to rescue the POW fails. At this point, American POWs existed in Vietnam, and presumably did for a long time, yet little was done for them. The movie, if we just look at it from this narrow POV, tells us to remember them fondly but realize also that they are far gone, gone in the sense of unable to be rescued, gone even in the sense of mentally checked out. No, they weren't.
And it's all based on the foolish belief, insinuated repeatedly by the movie, that the war itself was just bad luck. Bad luck is featured throughout the film, most notably in its infamous Russian Roulette scenes, playing up the Vietnamese as insane gambling maniacs who get their kicks on this six-shooter pastime. Maybe they did, for all I know, but if so, I'll bet they experienced depopulation!
The game is based on luck, on which chamber the bullet is in or not in. You play with your life, and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, says the movie, which is when you die.
I wanted to take the side of Mike -- as they say in ""The Dark Knight"", you make your own luck, at least sometimes. He does, many times.
But he can't stop the bad luck. He just misses Nicky in a gambling joint in Saigon. He misses him again when Nicky is too far gone to know who he is. Just when Nicky might come to his senses, BOOM. It's just bad luck.
The movie keeps talking about this bad luck. Examples abound. Mike and Linda are would-be lovers but just keep missing their chances. Their friend Steven is just unlucky enough to have lost three limbs and enjoys therefore playing Bingo, of course a game of luck, at the VA. Mike and Steven just can't get on the helicopter in Vietnam. They fall, separated from Nicky, which really begins the run of bad luck for Mike.
Was the Vietnam War bad luck, as this theme might imply? No, it was a foolish decision, as most agree, enabled by many warmongers. For them, it is convenient to have Hollywood depict the Vietnam war as just a bad break. By sentimentalizing the patriotic duty to ""serve your country"", the movie makes love for the American State, which started the madness and kept it going, something reasonable and normal. The last scene, as an example, features the entire remaining group of characters, sober finally in the bar, singing in unison, ""God Bless America.""
In that end, there's no anger or bitterness at the State that killed your friends in the end; just a melancholy nostalgia, maybe acceptance. I am reminded of the end of ""1984"", when a brainwashed Winston Smith falls in love with Big Brother. Perhaps these characters are not in love, emotionally, but if love is reciting a state creed (that ""God Bless America"" song) and then acting in a devoted way, that's pretty close to Winston Smith. By the way, I would change my opinion of this movie if I detected anything to tell me to read the ending in not in a straightforward way, as an acceptance of the movie's events. But this movie is not ""1984.""
For that reason, I think the movie perpetuates too many false notions about who is responsible for war and why anybody should avoid it at almost any cost, lest you too get wounded or killed by the war machine. One is that these nice Orthodox Americans who celebrate marriage with their traditional festival were just unlucky enough to be caught in the war, which sadly ended with some failures. No, that's not right. The State brainwashed the men into serving, then dying, for nothing. The right emotion is prophetic anger, I think, directed at the war machine. This movie just has us all humming ""God Bless America,"" while a saccharine acoustic guitar plays a weeping love theme. Yuck.
It's also not bad luck; it's bad decision-making made by stupid or evil leaders. Americans have long been warned about that, some keep resisting, and yet here we are, still in Afghanistan after 20 years! I recall 2001 and 2003. The ""God Bless America"" rhetoric was everywhere, plastered to fast-food signs, on the lips of everyone, which allowed our current forever-wars, along with the invasion-of-privacy madness, to begin. These are all choices we make, based on what we belief.
The movie, while I appreciate it celebrating the particular traditions of small-town American people, involves them in the wargames of the State, without calling out the State as the enemy who would obliterate them and their traditions, by involving them in foreign wars of great folly. Why in the world would I sing ""God Bless America"" to that?",0.5
"I couldn't get into this as much as I wanted to, heard its a classic but the pacing and that first hour with the wedding was very uninteresting to me especially how the characters acted but the message about the film concerning friendship amd how wat can change friends and family who have been in the war was effective and there were some heartbreaking, shocking moments, the ending particularly was emotional.",3.0
First third is “guys being dudes” second third is “war is bad” but the third half is where the really emotionally compelling stuff is at... some really great acting here I honestly think this whole cast is fantastic! Can’t have a 70s war movie without at least a little bit of a questionable at best portrayal of Vietnamese people but alas you could definitely read this film as critical of the military as a whole rather then trying to imply…,4.0
"In hindsight, this is a really strange pick for the Best Picture Oscar. It’s a lot grittier, noticeably less polished and ‘Hollywood’ than the type they usually reward. If released today, it would be branded ‘Oscar Bait’, and likely pick up a couple of gold statues (think 1917); but 1978 was before Meryl and Walken were Meryl and Walken. Often plodding, always demanding, and sometimes downright objectionable, it’s definitely not the most obvious choice in the awards’ history. 
Still though,…",3.0
"I've now seen Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter twice, the first time was several years ago and being a lot younger it amazed me but this time on another level. Definitely a more emotional level, I've noticed some people finding this ""Vietnam War film"" racist, it definitely does use all of the emotional moments for the american characters. As it is looking from the American side, I never had an issue with racism when it comes to this film. If…",5.0
"This was so close to being an all timer for me (pacing being the main issue). Outstanding film nevertheless and arguably De Niro’s career best performance. The first segment of the film before Vietnam was my favourite, heartbreaking seeing this group of friends transform in-front of our eyes. I also just have to mention the iconic Russian Roulette scenes... I mean how can you not, simply one of the best uses of suspense ever put on film.",4.5

"Arguably De Niro's best ever performance, but as a whole one of the greatest, most devastatingly raw war films of all time. The perfect blend of enjoyability and emotional connection, it contains one of the most stacked casts in history, and undeniably features a great screenplay. Every single actor turns in a brilliant performance, every single shot in those mountains is jaw-dropping, and most importantly, an incredible exploration on the psychological effects of warfare. Been avoiding this for quite a bit with its three hour runtime, but fortunately, I loved it.",4.0
"Robert De Niro is an absolute revelation in this role, I don’t know how else to put it. I never thought a performance of his could come close to his incredibly nuanced and all around perfect portrayal of Travis Bickel in “Taxi Driver”, but oh my goodness was he unbelievable here. He is so many things all at once, but more than anything he’s composed. You can see him holding so much back. The character, and I would suspect De Niro himself, probably wanted to fly off the handle more often than he did but there was such a masterful amount of restraint in this performance. I was mesmerized by him the entire time. 
The rest of the cast, especially Walken and Streep, are fantastic. The musical theme is beautiful and is implemented at all the right moments. The distinct three act structure of before, during and after the war is perfectly paced and allows the tone of the film, as well as the characters, to develop in a believable way. And I can’t write about this movie without mentioning one of the single greatest scenes I’ve ever seen: the Russian roulette scene. That was easily one of the most tense experiences I’ve ever had watching a movie. Guns almost always make things more tense (just ask Michael Scott at improv class) but when it’s done like this, when it truly seems unpredictable, it’s as good as it gets. That entire sequence is riveting. 
“The Deer Hunter” gave me possibly my favorite De Niro performance and is definitely a new favorite of mine.",4.5
"one of the best films out there in my opinion, simply because it focuses on pre-war, war itself AND the after-war and is the only film I know to be effective in all three (and thus justifies its runtime) Deserved the Best Picture.",5.0
"An ill-disciplined, ill-informed and bloated film. Made even more infuriating by the successes of an early set piece which are never capitalised upon. This is a meandering mess of racist imagery and pernicious revisionism. It’s an ode to invaders that is orchestrated to refocus a narrative. It wants to focus on victims, but carefully chooses the victims and explores them in the most surface level way. Behind it’s facade of grief and sensitivity its really a facile celebration of machismo and an elegy for the days where men were men doing meanly things. It’s also shoddily written and really rather dumb.
I do not like it.",2.0
"Those character snippets at the end always crush me. Deer Hunter is, more than any other film I can recall, life. In the sense that the three hours pass and I feel like I've seen everything, I've been everywhere with these people, and that's why it hurts so much. We had beers and sang ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" at John's place, we all got married together and were excited about the going to war, doing something big, something.. and those scenes in Vietnam are some of the best of that war ever. Just down to the way they're shot, the way they look and feel. And then that ending... unmatched in cinema.",5.0
This was more about the brutality of Russian roulette than the brutality of the Vietnam War.,4.0
"Pretty speechless....
One of the best anti-war Films ever put to screen.
The trauma and guilt experienced by each of the protagonists is perfectly contrasted by the Film's mesmerizing use of shadows and dark shades of black and gray that also portray late-war Vietnam.
The performances were fucking insane, both by De Niro and Walker who won a (highly deserved) Best Actor Oscar for his role in the Film.

Definitely going to think about this Film for a LONG time.",4.5
"The international treasure of cinema. This was my first Micheal Cimino movie and it set the bar really high. Robert De Niro is holy especially in the 70s. John Savage was great and this was the first good Meryl Streep performance I've ever seen. But Christopher Walken blew me away. There is a specific scene where he really shows why he's such an acting icon and I think we all know what that scene is. More on that scene, it is the single greatest scene to ever exist. 10/10.",5.0
"The Deer Hunter is a movie which could have had so much promise, but ends up being a major disappointment. Michael Cimino's film starts promisingly, taking us deep into the heart of a Pennsylvania steel town to tell the story of a group of friends and their harrowing experiences during the Vietnam War. The story is well-acted and the scenes in the Korean prison camp are particularly haunting.
However, while the movie starts strongly, it eventually devolves into shallow melodrama, with far too much emphasis on the macho bravado of the Vietnam War and too little attention paid to the film's deeper themes. The ending feels particularly tacked on, with the final scene featuring Robert De Niro clearing the forest of deer being particularly difficult to stomach.
Overall, The Deer Hunter is a noble effort that fails to live up to its potential. While some of the performances are excellent, and the cinematography captures the harsh realities of the Vietnam War, the movie falls short in its execution. Rather than being an insightful exploration of the war and its effects on ordinary people, The Deer Hunter ends up being an uneven drama that would have been better served by more focus on the real tragedies of war.",3.0
"Certainly an American engagement with un-American aesthetics and instincts, as equally as it's a war film with a marked lack of interest in the war; symbols taking place inside the events they symbolize, and doing so constantly.",5.0
"Rest in Peace, Michael Cimino.
Your film, The Deer Hunter, really changed me and made me value friendship, love, and the effects of war in a much more human way.
The wedding scene, the streets, the bar scenes.
The piano playing right before the characters lives are about to be washed away by Vietnam is so profound.
So real.
The acting here is phenomenal.
The directing really adds so much more intimate feelings and power into the film, like I was with these people.
I could've watched 30 more minutes of the party scene to get to know the characters even better.
I'll never forget the Russian roulette scenes and the emotionally devasting ending.
I cried.
I'll watch this again soon.

"Normally, I would feel restless for a 3-hour long slow-paced drama, but there's something about Michael Cimino's direction in The Deer Hunter that engrossed me. The first act has a wedding scene that goes on for 40 minutes, and yet I was entranced the entire time. I think it's because it reminded me of third places society used to have, the type of social longing that we crave now. In addition, I was surprised at how well-paced the entire movie is. Michael Cimino certainly has talent as a director and does a great job at immersing you in the setting. The performances from the cast are great, especially from John Cazale in his final film role, who was dying from cancer at the time of filming.
The film is also notable for being one of the first Vietnam War movies, made just three years after the conflict ended. The famous Russian roulette scene certainly is tense, but I was bothered by its historical inaccuracy. There are no documented cases of the Viet Cong forcing POWs to play Russian roulette. Not to mention, I really don't like how the film portrays the Viet Cong as sadistic monsters, I found that to be dehumanizing. The plot in the third act also loses momentum and becomes less logical. Despite my issues, The Deer Hunter is still one of the more emotionally shattering and harrowing war movies I've seen.",4.0

"Such poetic storytelling. I love how the first half basically introduces the group of friends before they go to war during their happy times (a calm before the storm if you will) and the second half shows how much they've evolved during and after the fucked world of Vietnam. The first hour is before the war, second hour during, and third hour is life after the war. It is just masterful storytelling, writing and directing made better by heartbreaking and excellent performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and the show stealing Christopher Walken. One of my favorite films, my favorite war film, and one of the best films ever made.",5.0
"This is fucking brilliant. I didn’t expect to love this as much as I did holy fuck what a film. 
There’s just something about the way that this was made that’s just perfect to me such a simplistic yet dreadful storyline written and executed perfectly very self aware for a 3hr film u don’t loose interest once. 
The visual aesthetic and storytelling just creates such a vibe it’s great this film is lighthearted it’s dark it very practical and realistic depicting the trauma loss and pain cause by war told threw great character arcs amazing dynamics & performances De Niro is so peak Holy f*%# Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken I just couldn’t get enough of this tbh perfect film in my book.",4.5

Physically Owned Films
Never losing its effectiveness, The Deer Hunter is incredibly powerful. The three different sections of pre-war, war, and post-war are structured perfectly, filmically distinct, and build emotionally upon each other. Cimino is extremely patient in both his co-writing and direction, but the film never ventures into over-indulgent or boring. The world is so fully fleshed out through script, editing, direction, music, sound, and performance it demands investment. When you finally reach the end it is simply all the more shattering.",4.5
"Dubfal War-Weeks

Just a different kind of war film. Im loving this first hour of pure character build up its like I often said before the classical movie which has to go long to come to the fore. That my favorite song of all time has an epic scene confirms my love to the long prolog. 
After the first hour the ultimate cut into the brutal war scenes. Absolutely epic. And a total changing of the mood which is just brilliant directed. 
Not to mention then with the Russian roulette scene one of the greatest war scenes of all time. Pure darkness in Vietnam. 
De Niro, Streep and Cazale with extra class perfomances but who’s killing it is definitely Christopher walken in this. His absolutely best role and the more than deserved Oscar for this underrated actor. 
Last but not least I have to mention this wonderful piece of music Score Myers created here with cavantina. Williams created the classical guitar version years later while Myers invented tansmans piece into piano and solo guitar. Beautiful and sad at the same time and just the perfect song for the feelings these movie is giving.",4.5

If we could have film soulmates, this one would be mine. 💝",5.0
"This is a good movie but it is really not that special. I didnt know if i should rate it 3 or 3.5 but i landed on 3.5 primarily because of the acting. 
The acting was great and the charachters were all enjoyable too, even though they said “fucking a” at least once in almost every scene, which could get annoying. 
The movie did a good job portraying the life of ordinary people and the consequences the war has on their small town. 
The movie also had many great scenes like the hunting and the Russian Roulette scenes, but it also had many slow and unnecessary scenes. 
The first hour of the movie was almost completely pointless with only few things that would matter later on. Some of the time spent on this overlong intro should have been spent on war stuff. We didnt get to see much more than the Russian Roulette before they went home again.
The transitions between the war and their hometown were also poorly made. The movie spent so much time showing them doing pointless stuff and then the next scene is a building blowing up in Vietnam, which just felt way too sudden.",3.5
"The Deer Hunter's dilemma is that its all-knowing, all-encompassing authenticity is exactly what makes finishing it a mourning process. I am still mourning over this film. It lives in me now and it’s stubborn and incorrigible. Three hours, though daunting, is still not enough. I would give nearly anything for more...for more Nick, more Michael, more beautiful Pennsylvanian landscape. Three heart-wrenching, devastating, delirious, and emptying hours...and though the credits roll and you’re left with the uncomfortable truth of fiction, the emotions haunt you forever afterward. 
Act One is perhaps the most important. I’ve seen others complain about the length of the wedding scene, and each time I think, “How could that have possibly bored you?” We are gifted with a young Christopher Walken in a funny suit, a beautiful Meryl Streep dancing her heart out, and a handsome, working-class debonair Robert De Niro. The quick, furtive glances between Michael and Linda and Nick’s intention to marry her fuses a friendship with a complicated love story. Still, there is never any finger-pointing, no blowout scenes between the two, and Linda is never some expedient scapegoat. But the wedding scene is more than such drama; it’s heavy with foreshadowing, Russian Orthodoxy, tradition, and culture. How could that bore you? I suppose our culture is just steeped with gratuitous violence and sex that anything truly authentic bores us. 
Roger Ebert said of this film, “It's important not simply that we come to know the characters, but that we feel absorbed into their lives; that the wedding rituals and rhythms feel like more than just ethnic details. They do.” These ethnic details combined with economic background give you a richer understanding of the lives these people lead...how many films are set in places like Russian-American steel towns? How many film weddings take place in Orthodox churches? This film is not glamorous, as working-class stories rarely are, and though it doesn’t take place in New York City or Los Angeles like an inordinate amount of garbage is, it is endlessly enriching and intimate. With conviction, it is more so. 
Act One also gives us the EXTRAORDINARY bar scenes. Married with music, the first song is “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” by Frankie Valli. Each character knows the song (as seemingly every American does), and it unfolds the way it would in real life; our drunken gang explodes into a belting match during the chorus. The second takes place after the hunt and is infinitely more somber. The men laugh, full of energy after a successful trip, and are slowly placed into careful melancholy. The transition into Act Two is ostensibly quiet from the classical tune played on a Klavier...but only now have I realized that it was borderline violent. But these details wouldn’t be so nearly as raw and beautiful if it weren’t for the time-bending charisma of the cast, visceral performances, and perfect chemistry. 
It’s important to note that these things wouldn’t have worked with a cast made up of Hollywood sex symbols. These things also wouldn’t have worked if the theme were cheesy, gratuitous romance. There is romance, yes, but it’s the romance that is closer to that of our own lives. It’s the romance that exists within failed marriages and falling in love with your best friend’s girlfriend. It’s awkward, shy, and lacks glamor. It’s the closest replica of the real thing. That’s Cimino’s genius...he never attempted to create something easily mimicked. He created life. A little universe. Entire lifetimes in three fucking hours. That doesn’t mean there isn’t something in the film to long for; friendship like Michael’s and Nick’s is rare. A once in a lifetime kind of company—that is worth longing over. 
It’s been said before that this isn’t a Vietnam film; it isn’t a pro-war film, and it isn’t an anti-war film, either. In other Vietnam-based films, Vietnam is the whole movement's ethos; it’s a suite of its own, and nearly every character and storyline within it is a mere instrument. But that is not the case in The Deer Hunter. It’s the exact opposite. Cimino played Vietnam like a fiddle; this stupid, infiltrating, and fucking absurdity called the Vietnam War. Perhaps all that the Vietnam War deserves is to be merely an instrument. 
Returning to Michael and Nick—this friendship wouldn’t have been so complete if it weren’t for the entire gang. Axel, Stanley, Steven, and John. These characters are full of life; they’re stupid, naive, and entertaining as all hell. They’re exactly what they needed to be. Nothing more and nothing less. Miraculously, their chemistry is only a sliver of what Michael and Nicky possess; and to quote Michael: “They're all a bunch of assholes. I mean, I love them, they're great guys, but, you know, without you, I hunt alone. Seriously, that's what I'd do.” 
It certainly helps that young Christopher Walken looks almost unreal with his angelic, floppy-blonde hair and deep-set green eyes. Initially, this beautiful son of a bitch is impossible to look away from...but near the end, he has lost more weight, his lips and countenance their color, and his deep-set green eyes are painted with loss and nothingness. He looks like half of a human being. After spending two hours with him already, learning his life, his little universe, the way he likes how the trees look...you cannot help but mourn for him. It’s watching a loved one die. The first shot of him you get after Michael returns to Saigon is easy foreshadowing, without Russian marriage tradition...intuitively, you know precisely what will become of him. And despite knowing this, it’s still a miserable punch in the face. 
This makes that final Roulette scene all the more fucking ridiculous. Ridiculous in that you’re left with nothing else. You know, instinctively, that Nick’s memory is in shambles. He’s emaciated and wildly unhealthy. Michael is desperate and alone. And what more? You get the most famous scene in the film: Nikanor with a gun to his head, wrapped in a red bandana. He’s gone. And that’s all you’re left with. This again illustrates Cimino’s genius; what you’re left with is what Michael is left with, too. 
It’s been three days since I first saw this film, and it has replaced my #1 favorite film of five years. I’ve seen plenty of phenomenal films, I’ve cried more times than I can count, and my favorites list keeps on growing...but no film, ever, will succeed at putting a stranglehold on my heart quite like The Deer Hunter. 
I have so much more my heart wishes to say, but it still refuses to budge. Not even a century’s worth of pretty adjectives will convey exactly how I feel. I suppose I wouldn’t have it any other way. I suppose that’s how I know it’s the greatest film I have ever seen.",5.0
"""One shot?""
Ein Film, der mir innerlich immer noch das Herz zerreißt.
""The Deer Hunter"" (Deutsch: ""Die durch die Hölle gehen"") ist der endgültige, internationale Durchbruch von Michael Cimino, ein Regisseur, welcher als ""Wunderkind des neuen Hollywoods"" gesehen wurde, dann aber mit ""Heaven's Gate"" um die Ecke kam und einen der größten Finanzkrisen für ein großes Studio und für das praktische Aussterben des Western-Genres schuf. Ein arroganter Kerl war er auch, aber dieser Film hier galt als ein großer Knall in Hollywood.
In was für ein Genre befindet er sich?
Tja, die einfachste Antwort wäre ein (Anti-)Kriegsfilm, was nur ca. 45 Minuten der 184 Minuten Laufzeit ausmacht, aber ein essentieller Teil der Entwicklung der Figuren macht.
Ist es ein Actionfilm? Definitv nicht!
Ist es ein Drama? Für mich persönlich ist es ein Drama, weder wirklich Antikriegsfilm noch Pro-Kriegsfilm noch Action oder sonst was.
Ich sehe ihn als ein Psychogramm von drei Personen aus einer kleinen Provinz, die durch... ich sage mal ""einschneidenden Erlebnissen"" mental oder auch körperlich zu leiden haben und wohl nie mehr aus dieser Spirale entkommen können. Ein Film über Posttraumatische Belastungsstörung wäre eine Betitelung.
Ich möchte nicht auf die Handlung eingehen, sondern vermehrt auf das Schauspiel, die Figuren, das Leitthema und die Gründe für bestimmte Ereignisse im Film, wo ich auch einen kleinen Spoilerpart kreieren will, damit ich explizit darauf eingehen kann.
Aber vorher einmal noch Dampf ablassen:
Die bekannteste Szene des Films dürfte unbestreitbar wohl die Szene mit dem Russischen Roulette sein, wo die Figuren von Robert de Niro und Christopher Walken in Gefangenschaft der Vietcongs dieses furchtbare Spiel mit Revolvern spielen müssen. Und diese Szene und weitere Szenen, die die vietnamesische Kultur zeigen als Vorwand für eine rassistische Stellung zu dem Volk entnommen, was ich absolut gar nicht unterstützen und tolerieren kann. Ich habe da jetzt mal länger darüber nachgedacht. Es mag stimmen, dass man nur die Seite der Amerikaner bekommt, die hier als ""Opfer"" vermeintlich dargestellt werden. Wer aber denkt, dass dies wirklich der Fall ist, der irrt aber sowas von. Es geht nicht darum die Seite Vietnams zu zeigen. Weder will man noch Amerika glorifizieren oder als Opfer zu zeigen. Es geht um genau DIESE FIGUREN, diese Individuen, die es aus ihrer Sicht erleben und diese Sicht erfahren wir als Zuschauer. Wir und die Kamera bleiben IMMER bei den Figuren, besonders bei Robert de Niro und Christopher Walken, die dies erleben. Eine subjektive Sicht von etwas Grauenhaften, was man nicht selbst durchleben möchte, unter keinen Umständen.
Eine ähnlich ungerechte Mutmaßung wie sie auch ""Scarface"" von Brian de Palma zum Beispiel traf oder nach wie vor trifft (in Sachen Sexismus bzw. Misogynie).
Naja, muss ja selber wissen, wa?
Robert de Niro
Vieles wissen es, de Niro ist mein Lieblingsschauspieler unter all den Schauspielern, die ich bisher auf der Leinwand bestaunen konnte. Er hat in vielen Filmen mitgespielt, die zu meinen Lieblingen zählen. Ich brauche nur ""Taxi Driver"", ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""The Godfather Part II"", ""Casino"" und ""GoodFellas"" zu erwähnen. Er ist jemand, der als bekannter Method Actor Emotionen transportieren und eine ihm gänzlich fremde Person verkörpern kann, die mich auf jeglicher Ebene fast immer abholt. Bei niemanden hatte ich dieses Gefühl gehabt wie bei ihm.
Hier verkörpert er Michael ""Mike"" Vronsky, Stahlarbeiter in einem Örtchen in Pennsylvania, zieht freiwillig den Stolz seiner Nation wegen in den Vietnamkrieg, trinkt gerne Bier und ist Hobby-Jäger, der in den Bergen ein Tier mit nur einem Schuss erlegen will. Er lebt in einer patriotisch-christlich-orthodoxen Gegend auf. Sohn einer Familie mit (wahrscheinlich) polnisch-ukrainischen Immigrationshintergrund, die wir nie zu Gesicht bekommen.
Eigentlich eine Rolle, wo man jemanden wie de Niro auf alle Fälle sehen kann, weil er vorher schon Rollen gespielt hat, die verschiedene Typen zeigten. Und er macht das einfach famos und auch ein dicker Oscar-Snub, aber ja... ich wiederhole mich zu den Oscars. Von den grundlegenden Polen Ruhe, Freude und Wut weiter hinein in Emotionen wie Verzweiflung, Trauer, geistigen Zwiespalt, schweigende Selbstreflexion, Rastlosigkeit, Verwirrung ob seines vorherigen Lebens und mehr bedient er während des Films. Und er macht das oft so subtil, was ich erst nach dem zweiten Mal bemerken konnte. Er trägt den Film als eigentlicher Hauptdarsteller und man bekommt eine Darstellung von praktisch drei Figuren in einer Figur in drei Situationen. Vor, während und nach seiner Zeit als Soldat in Vietnam.
Christopher Walken
Man kennt ihn meist als Schauspieler von psychopathischen, wahnwitzigen und schrulligen Figureb... oder auch aus dem ""Weapon of Choice""-Video. Seine Betonung der Worte ist auch goldwert und anders. Vorwerfen kann man ihm, dass er fast nur diese verrückten Rollen übernimmt, aber dann muss man diesen Film gesehen haben. Dieser machte ihn nämlich zum Superstar, den wir heute kennen. Doch hier ist es ein ganz ruhiger, lässiger, geselliger Kerl namens Nick ""Nicky"" Chevotarevich, der nie Großmaul oder Macho ist, sondern ein verhältnismäßig vernünftiger Mann, der das Miteinander und das Leben genießt. Dies ändert sich definitv während die Handlung voranschreitet, aber die Art wie und wie er dies verkörpert, ist einfach phänomenal und groß. Wohl kein Wunder, warum viele es als seine beste Performance ansehen. Er ist immer noch ein sehr guter und noch mehr charismatischer Schauspieler, aber gleich am Anfang so ein Brett von Leistung abzuliefern, ist sehr schwer zu toppen oder zu egalisieren. Gerade gegen Ende zieht seine Figur noch eine Fassade auf, die man nicht erwartet und auch nicht gewünscht hat.
Auch neben den beiden Stars des Films ist Meryl Streep in ihrer ersten oscarprämierten Rolle zu sehen (die erste von ihren tausend anderen Nominierungen/Auszeichnungen) und man weiß gleich vorweg, ohne dass man Filme aus der jüngeren Zeit gesehen hat, dass die eine Karriere vor sich haben wird und das ist vollstens aufgegangen. Hier spielt sie super ihre bereits da schon vorhandene Streep-Emotionspalette aus und ab da an wurde Geschichte geschrieben.
John Cazale, welcher leider noch vor der Premiere des Films an Lungenkrebs verstarb, ist wieder... ja John Cazale eben, jemand, den man erkennt und schon ein seichtes Grinsen auf den Lippen bereitet. Man kennt ihn eigentlich nur aus Klassikern von Coppola (""The Godfather I & II"", ""The Conversation""), Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" und den Film halt. Der hat bereits bis zum Tod große Karriere gemacht, die wahrscheinlich hätte noch wachsen können.
John Savage spielt den dritten Typen, der auf freiwilliger Basis in den Krieg zieht und es scheinbar schnell bereut und bald Angst vor jeder leeren Kammer eines Revolvers hat, wo abgedrückt wird. Er hat nicht nur psychisch, sondern auch körperlich zu leiden und sein Verhalten durch PTSD ist durchaus spürbar, wo man nur den Kopf schütteln kann. Eine ausgesprochen tolle und schockierende Performance, die das Wasser den beiden Elefanten im Raum, de Niro und Walken, durchaus das Wasser reichen.
Weiterhin spielen Chuck Aspegren oder George Dzundza, die keine große Karriere hatten, aber hier sehr sympathisch und gesellig herübergekommen sind.
Cavatina - Das Leitthema
1951 ist dieses Stück, komponiert von Alexandre Tansman, ein polnisch-französischer Herr, erstmals in Erscheinung getreten und wurde vom Komponisten Stanley Myers für dieses Film neu eingespielt, zunächst erst vor Jahren auf Klavier, dann aber in einem Gitarrenduo mit fein-orchestralischer Hintergrundmusik für diesen Film veröffentlicht und das ist eben die Version geworden, die man kennt.
Dieses Thema ist sinnbildlich für die Heimat der Figuren: Idyllisch, intim, gesellig, ländlich und in gewissem Maße frei. Ein Stück, was man gerne am Lagerfeuer spielen würde.
Doch als die dritte Phase des Films beginnt, wird das Thema erneut gespielt und es kriegt ein anderes Gesicht, eine neue Auffassung. Jetzt wirkt es nicht mehr so heimisch, sondern stützt sich ab an auf Melancholie, Trauma, Erinnerungen (Nostalgie) und Trauer. Die orchestralischen Klänge stärken diese intensiven Gefühle, gerade die von de Niros Charakter.
Es gehört aufgrund seines zwiespältigen Charakters zu meinen Lieblingsthemen. Seltenst eingesetzt, drei-Mal in 3 Stunden Film, wirkt stets intensiv und emotional.
Das Russische Roulette
Es wurde häufig in der Vergangenheit darüber diskutiert, ob es wirklich in Zeiten des Vietnamkriegs in Vietnam überhaupt sowas wie Russisch-Roulette-Spiele ausgetragen wurden. Unabhängig davon, ob dies so war oder nicht, ist dieses unmenschliche Spiel genau die perfekte Symbolik für den Krieg selbst und wie es Soldaten erleben. Ein Spiel, wo der Zufall in psychisch grausamer Manier entscheidet. Es gibt zwei große Szenen im Film, wo Russisches Roulette inszeniert wird, wovon das erste das Aushängeschild für den Film ist und wahrscheinlich deswegen wird der Film als Kriegsfilm angesehen. Es lässt in der Szene den Zufall spüren und man weiß nicht, ob die Figuren draufgehen oder nicht.
So, und mit diesen Infos möchte ich diejenigen, die den Film noch nicht gesehen haben, bitten den Film zu gucken, denn das ist eine 3-stündige Achterbahnfahrt der Gefühle und eine Botschaft an die Personen, die durch Traumatas langzeitlich bis für immer zu leiden haben.
Aber seid gewarnt! Es ist kein Kriegsfilm-Spektakel, dauert 3 Stunden und hat mehr eine Drama-Note.
-- Spoilerpart --
Warum der Titel ""The Deer Hunter""?
Ich möchte gerne zum Endstück des Films springen, ab dem Punkt, wo das zweite Russische Roulette ausgetragen wird.
Zunächst einmal möchte ich anmerken, dass die Protagonisten (sprich de Niro und Walken) zum Zeitpunkt des zweiten Aktes immer dann nur in einer Umgebung des Grauens und des Terrors zusammentreffen.
Sie waren sozusagen ab der Zeit nur zusammen als sie gefoltert wurden, doch getrennt als sie in Sicherheit schwelgten.
Dieses Roulette am Ende betont nochmal den Satz von Mike, der sagte, dass man ein Reh mit nur einem Schuss töten sollte. Dies stand nicht für das Können, was man dadurch beweisen könnte, sondern durch die Linderung der Schmerzen, die ein Tier sonst zu durchstehen hat. Ein Schuss bedeutet kein Leiden. Nick ist am Ende des letzten Aktes heroinsüchtig (siehe Shot auf seinen Arm) und professioneller Spieler dieses furchtbaren Spiels. Mike ist erschüttert von seinem Äußeren, doch sein Inneres schockiert ebenfalls: Er ist innerlich tot und leidet unter PTSD, hat Anzeichen von Amnesie, weil er Mike nicht erkennt und ja... eigentlich ein Kerl, der nicht mal mehr sein eigenes Leid registrieren kann. Sein Blickkontakt während des Spiels zu Mike ist zu Beginn starr und gefühlskalt wie eine Wand. Selbst beim leeren Schuss gegen seinen Kopf blinzelt er nicht einmal, wo es beim ersten Mal spielen in Gefangenschaft ganz anders aussah. Mike hat bei seinem Zug eher weniger Angst um sein Leben, sondern mehr um Nick, dass er ihn nicht zurückholen kann. Doch nachdem der leere Schuss gefallen ist, kommt ein Kamera-Shot auf Nick, der irgendetwas zu sagen scheint, aber es nicht aussprechen kann. Irgendwas schien dort klick zu machen und Erinnerungen kommen hoch. Mike sieht das und will Nick vom nächsten Zug abhalten. Dabei versucht er in ihn Erinnerungen an sich selbst hervorzurufen und es scheint bei einem Satz zu klappen: ""One shot?"", sagt er und er und Mine lächeln freundschaftlich zueinander, aber dann zieht Nick den Rveolver an seinen Kopf, während dieser Zug mit einer Kugel in den Kopf endet. Nick war das Reh, was mit einem Schuss getötet wurde. Das zu sehen hat meinen Kopf auf meine Hände gebracht, die meine Beine als Stütze nutzten. Das war einer emotionalsten Szenen für mich nach fast 3 Stunden, wo ich mit den Figuren zusammen war.
God Bless America (?)
Das Ende ist noch einmal kontrovers, weil man die Freunde nach Nicks Beerdigung am Tisch ""God Bless America"" singen sieht, was im Prinzip einer der patriotischsten Hymnen für die USA ist. Man kann dort natürlich die Position des Regisseurs vielleicht sehen... aber auch nur vielleicht. Nach all dem, was passiert ist, dass Saigon verloren gegangen ist, die Leben der drei jungen Männer unterschiedlich zerbröckelt wurden, kann man nicht von einem Patriotismus sprechen. Es ist eine ironische Ode und vielleicht ein letztes Mal, weil die Glorifizierung Amerikas weg ist. Der Sprung von freudiger Angespanntheit ist am Ende zum Verlust übergegangen. Es bleibt nur noch eines übrig: Das Miteinander mit Freunden und Familie, auch wenn es nie wieder so sein wird wie es einst war.",5.0
"“A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that but they don't listen.”
I chose to watch this movie to end the year and it ended up being not only a 5 star but also one of my favourite films of all time now. Everything about this film is perfect to me, there’s absolutely nothing I would change about it. Sometimes I’m unsure with my 5 stars and if they’ll actually stay at that tier for me but I have no doubts about The Deer Hunter. From start to finish I was completely invested in the story and it just got better and better as it went along leaving off with one of the best endings ever.
To start with how perfect this film is I’ll talk about the technical side of it which is flawless. The camera work in this is some of my favourite that I’ve ever seen. The way the scenes are shot so seamlessly and smooth is amazing, especially for the zoom out/zoom in shots. There’s a big lack of a score throughout a lot of this film and yet I think it adds so much which usually that can hinder a movie. Here the lack of a score makes it feel all the more real. It makes the viewer feel like they’re really there with these characters.
The score when present though is immaculate, it’s easily one of the best scores out there. It seems the filmmakers knew exactly when to use the score and when not to which I appreciated a lot. The acting in The Deer Hunter is incredible. When it comes to every single actor/actress in a film preforming well this may be the best. Robert De Niro as Michael was my favourite but Christopher Walken as Nick was also phenomenal. I was seriously impressed by those these actors and Meryl Streep along with the rest of the cast was amazing too.
I’m pretty sure this was the first time I’ve seen Meryl Streep when she was younger so it threw me off quite a bit. I also never connected the name Christopher Walken to the face but now it all makes sense. I loved how De Niro’s character for the most part was a lot more quiet in this. In most of his other films that I’ve seen he either has a ton of dialogue or heavy narration so this was a nice change of pace. I was shocked at how well they made it look like a deer actually got shot in this too. Apparently they just used a sedative but it looked very realistic.
A lot of people seem to complain about the start of The Deer Hunter saying it’s too long and drawn out but I completely disagree. I think the entire beginning is very essential for crafting the masterpiece that it is. The whole first hour of the film is used to get us attached to these characters. It’s like we’re living a long side them as we learn their personalities and interests between each other.
The wedding is especially used for this and I also found it provided a lot of foreshadowing for what was to come later in the story. The entire first act of the movie it was like joining their friend group. It felt like someone just started filming a group of real life friends and it made everything later on hit that much harder. I also love the bar scene when they’re all chilling together shooting pool, it felt so natural.
The jump into the war was so sudden I didn’t really expect it but when it happened it made everything get so much more intense so fast. It creates the feeling of being thrown into this sudden and in a way unexpected violence along with the characters. I’ve never really watched a film that was structured like this one so it was quite unique.
The first Russian roulette scene was so hard to watch. It was very anxiety inducing but it’s such a well crafted scene. It was intense and De Niro absolutely crushed it here, he couldn’t have conveyed his emotions and delivered his lines any more perfectly. Same with the gut wrenching roulette scene that comes later.
The Deer Hunter does such a great job at subtly showing the affects of war on the individual and loved ones. The after affects are present however it doesn’t feel like it’s shoved in your face so obviously like American Sniper for example. This films just feels so realistic. Coming back from the war I imagine it would be like becoming a whole new person and living an entirely different life of chaos then suddenly coming back to just peace and normalcy. It would be so hard to feel the same ever again. Seeing what becomes of the three main character is heartbreaking but I won’t spoil anything.
The Deer Hunter while it could be considered “slow paced” is in my opinion the perfect film. I’m working on a personal top 50 films list and this is going to be quite high up there for me. This is a movie that really makes you feel in one way or another. I feel so empty after finishing it but at the same time I feel a heaviness from how impactful it was to me. I wouldn’t be able to praise this film enough even if I tried so I’ll just leave it at saying The Deer Hunter is perfect.

"I started from the end with Cimino and saw Sunchaser first and I liked it! But this movie... I was put off by a three hour war movie featuring Russian Roulette weirdly enough. But here we are. I know this is widely regarded as a historically significant film but that doesn't mean I had to enjoy it. 3 hours felt like 3 hours!
1st hour - this is predominantly table setting and could have easily been cut in it's entirety. I'm a savage like that.
2nd hour - the first 10 minutes of this where they go hunting post wedding would have adequately set up the themes. Then we're in Vietnam and it's pretty traumatising.
3rd hour - hey, now we're getting somewhere. DeNiro coming home and trying to readjust to his life is really well done! Plus Meryl gets something to do! It sweeps round to being affecting but I swear it could have done it much more effectively without the extensive running time.",3.0
"10/10
I had really high expectations for this film, and it fulfilled them. Cimino's direction is really great and pretty interesting and I really enjoyed the cinematography, including a lot of the serene visuals, as well as those that were hectic and violent. Of course the performances all-around were brilliant, from De Niro and Streep to Walken and Cazale, the actors here are legends and they deserve to be, even if for this film alone. The first hour was solid set-up, but was honestly a bit too long and drawn out. The second hour was visceral, brutal, and hard-hitting. And the third hour was an intimate and tragic look into the minds of three broken men and those who love them. The three come together to create a beautiful and terrifying picture of the horrors war and its victims that is now deservedly considered one of the most quintessential and greatest films of the 1970s and of all time.

"Es una película bélica, sí, pero es de alguna manera mucho más que eso. Lejos de centrarse en la masacre de la guerra y los tormentos del campo de batalla durante el conflicto armado de Vietnam, el film decide enfocarse en la humanidad de sus protagonistas y en un vínculo de una pureza y profundidad inefable como lo es la amistad para explorar por medio de las conexiones entre sus personajes las distintas caras de la violencia y sus consecuencias.
Rica en la forma en que profundiza en las secuelas psicológicas de la violencia más que en la violencia en sí misma logrando una cuota digna de emotividad, con una gran dirección y potentes interpretaciones protagónicas. Tengo que mencionar, además, lo magnética y honestamente emotiva que resulta Meryl Streep en cada segundo que posee, elevando de forma notoria el resultado.",4.0
"“War is hell and hell is hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse.”
This quote sort of becomes the theme within THE DEER HUNTER. As a group of men enlist into the Vietnam war, looking to be heroes but soon realize they have entered a world of hell that they seemingly can’t escape. Incredible performances all around the board by everyone in the cast.",4.5
"I'd never seen it all at once, and this time I caught it right at the beginning, and it had me up until 3AM. What a good movie. I think it's the best Vietnam movie I've ever seen, in part for all the time it doesn't spend in Vietnam.",5.0
"Il Cacciatore inizia in un piccolo centro siderurgico della Pennsylvania durante una tradizionale festa nuziale all'interno di una comunità di immigrati russi, preludio della partenza di tre amici per il Vietnam, e termina, tempo dopo la fine del conflitto, nella stessa cittadina, immersa - questa volta - nel silenzio attonito di un funerale. Racchiusa fra queste due simboliche cerimonie, la sezione centrale del film è dedicata alla guerra, con un'attenzione particolare all'evoluzione del legame fra i tre amici di fronte agli orrori a cui hanno dovuto assistere.
Il film di Michael Cimino si svolge internamente ad un microcosmo in cui il conflitto bellico in realtà è solo un episodio, anche se decisivo, di un disegno più vasto che coinvolge l'esistenza di diverse persone, una sorta di prova del fuoco che distrugge o comunque segna profondamente tutti i protagonisti. Più che un film sulla guerra è uno studio sui suoi effetti devastanti e sulla perdita dell'innocenza di un'intera generazione. Superba l'interpretazione di Robert De Niro nei panni di un uomo a cui le terribili esperienze vissute nel Vietnam impediscono il ritorno ad una vita normale, finchè non comprende il senso di ciò che è successo a lui e ai suoi amici. Cimino realizza un ritratto allo stesso tempo intimista e maestoso, particolare ed universale, che da un lato rappresenta il trauma della guerra nella mente di un soldato, e dall'altro tratteggia l'inadeguatezza di una società di fronte ai grandi accadimenti della Storia. Ne consegue un'opera di enorme respiro, visivamente impeccabile, di fortissimo impatto emotivo e rara introspezione psicologica, ricca di scene entrate di diritto nella Storia del Cinema. Impossibile non ricordare infine la splendida prova di John Cazale, uno dei più grandi attori della sua generazione, morto prematuramente poco dopo le riprese del film.
Here's the english version of the review.",5.0
i wanna hug and kiss robert de niro,4.5
"Deer Hunter is a long, three-hour walk home. It takes in the scenery and breathes in the night air, but it’s a road you've travelled before if you’ve seen any number of Vietnam War classics in the past forty years.
Deer Hunter released a year shy of Apocalypse Now (1979), and predates the more biting, far more focused Born on the Fourth of July (1989). But Michael Cimino's war drama emanates with a startling balance of intimacy and grandiosity, even if its younger cousins retread the same themes tighter and stronger.
But there’s a good reason why Deer Hunter hasn’t aged with the same acclaim as other films in the same vein. Outside of its iconic (albeit liberal) use of Russian roulette, there’s little else done here that future films don't do better, and more honest.
It's hard to call Deer Hunter a war film. Its foray into Vietnam is the shortest sequence in the movie. But there’s no doubt how much it impacts the three friends that are shipped off to a war that’s given little to no historical or political context. That doesn’t seem to be of much concern to Cimino, and I think the film is better for it. The story is protracted but not bloated. Everything moves (although ponderously) towards Michael’s (Robert De Niro) shattered post-war worldview.
But what Deer Hunter says about war and the working class feels like looking at pretty houses without being invited inside any of them. Aside from its performances and cinematography, Deer Hunter ends up feeling smaller than the rest of its cinematic kin. But that’s the price you pay when you’re compared to giants.",3.0
"Tandis que des films comme Apocalypse Now et Platoon (des chefs-d'oeuvres absolus, as far as I'm concerned) se concentraient sur ce qui se passait au Vietnam pendant la guerre, The Deer Hunter s'est davantage intéressé à ce qui se déroulait aux États-Unis au cours de la même période, dans la vie des ouvriers envoyés au combat. C'est-à-dire l'insouciance du quotidien à l'aller, et le poids du passé au retour.
C'est donc un récit qui alterne admirablement entre la souffrance, le désenchantement et la perte, d'une part, ainsi que le dévouement, l'amitié et la réconciliation, d'autre part. Avec des performances légendaires de Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, John Cazale et, vraiment, tout le reste du casting.
Une fresque élégiaque absolue.",4.5

"The third act doesn't entirely deliver on the promise of the rest, but for a while I was certain I'd found my favorite war film. I avoided this behemoth for so long because I'd been marginally let down by similarly heralded war classics, but the first two hours are just incredible. It's brilliantly structured and paced; I even loved the lengthy wedding which often gets complaints. Features close to career-best performances from De Niro and Walken, gorgeous compositions, and a harrowing depiction of war that is genuinely devastating. Even considering the disappointing final hour, this is one of the best war films I've ever seen.",4.0

"This strange film started growing on me as soon as it ended.

De Niro as Michael made me tear up in that last game of Russian roulette. It's the one and only moment where he lets himself be vulnerable, when he begs someone not to play that game, and it's not even because he's afraid for his own life. It's the expression of despair on his face when he asks Nick to come home that finally shows, with so much clarity that it hurts, what we knew all along: that he truly loves him. All of a sudden I was completely immersed in and overwhelmed by the film.

"Really, really enjoyed this one. The Deer Hunter tells the story of three American hunters who go off to fight in Vietnam, but are soon physically and mentally scarred by the horrors they experience there.
At over three hours long, The Deer Hunter didn't drag nearly as much as I was expecting. The pacing is just about perfect, and the clear three act structure creates a nice contrast between the light-hearted, personal introduction in the first act and the tragedy and transformation depicted in the third. The abrupt switch in pacing, tone, and visuals when the three reach Vietnam is incredibly jarring and leads to that brutally tense but iconic Russian roulette scene.
Rather than depicting the war itself, the film instead focuses on the toll it takes on each individual and their relationships back home, expressed by a cast of actors at the top of their game. Gritty cinematography mirrors the tragedy depicted in this war epic, which ends with tension and tears, reaching an emotional climax only heightened but the fact that this was sadly John Cazale's final role.",4.0

"Can't believe it's been almost five years from the first time I've seen this. Time really goes by.
A film that is quite divisive, loved by many, hated many as well, I might just fall on the first group. ""The Deer Hunter"" is just one of those experiences. From those unforgetable russian roulette scenes (and regarding that, the last russian roulette scenes has some amazing visuals, I didn't see this the first time, but the way those people are displayed along the screen, doing a variety of motions while the two men at the center look at each other, waiting for something to happen looks like a beautiful painting) to the comradery we get on the first part of the film that is so tender and sweet, to the community that was devastated indirectly by war (not to mention those that were directly and brutally affected by the war) whose feelings of friendship have this bittersweet tone for things would never be the same ever again.",5.0

"i always tell people this is my favorite war movie, but it's so much more than that. it's more of a quiet criticism against institutions like heterosexism nestled between the war in the foreign vietnam and small town USA where traditions are in place and nothing changes. guns become a symbol of masculinity and gender conformity and the devastating loss of (human) nature that comes with it. arguably robert de niro's finest performance. superb cast all around, extraordinarily well made (i adore the dreamy visuals that come during the hunting scenes, i think it really only strengthens the argument that the deer hunter is more figurative than literal), absolutely heartbreaking. deserves to be called one of the greatest films ever made.",4.5
"Once upon a time I deeply connected with The Deer Hunter. My circumstances and life experiences in the intervening years have changed considerably, to the point where what I once took away from this has ebbed away into the background and distant memory a little, as if it were a past live that shared the same skin.
The unforgettable structure, ensemble performance and Cavatina rendition are all still as powerful as they ever were. Robert De Niro's final click of the trigger is far and away the most romantic bromance gesture in cinematic history.
But the overall canvas, Cimino's direction, and above all the content components, no longer quite resonate with me as richly as they once did. The Deer Hunter is among the films my transition (as well as lifestyle changes and growing older) has been least kind to I guess. The common experiences I shared with the film have been shed, and as a result its shortcomings are more glaring.
Still, a one-of-a-kind film that leaves a mark on all who see it. It still gets talked about on the streets in hushed reverence (or occasionally scornful repulsion), and is often held up as a barometer of cross-generation patience. Not many films have that 37 years after release. I'm glad that I once shared a romance with it, thanks for moving me deeply back in those troubling years. But I think I can consign this to a once every 5-10 years watch now. Maybe I'll be back on the same wavelength next time around, although I suspect this is more of an epochal film.",4.5
"A complicated film. And the older I get the more complex my feelings are towards it.
I suspect that I first saw The Deer Hunter properly in the 1990s. As a teenager going into a 'Vietnam War Movie', it's reputation preceded it. Mention the film today and anyone who hasn't even watched it will know about the infamous Russian roulette scenes, scenes that have been riffed, replicated and satirised so often down the years that they've even featured in an advert for Revels. Being a teenager in the 90s watching a ' Vietnam War Movie', I did not see the controversy or inherent racism/xenophobia such scenes are loaded with. I simply took it for granted that this momentous piece of pop culture was somehow part of the Vietnamese culture of that savage era - I did not question that the fabrication of such a thing, as I subsequently came to learn that indeed it was, intentionally paints the Vietnamese people (the enemy of the protagonists, and crucially therefore the enemy of the West) as savage, inhumane, 'other'.
That appreciation came later in the 00s when I felt disgust at the manipulative number the movie had done on audiences yet felt that the film was still deserving of merit and my attention. I fell in love with the film's first act, an hour long episode that does little more than shine a light on the normality of its central working class protagonists as one of their number gets married in the Russian Orthodox tradition of their Pennsylvanian steel mill town community in the days leading up to their call up to the US Rangers. Most audiences are turned off by this slow start that, admittedly could have been condensed (director Michael Cimino assured producer Michael Deeley that this introductory chapter would last around twenty minutes, though he had no intention of doing such a thing) and may even be considered surplus, but I adored - and continue to adore - the neorealism of it. Honestly, I'd go from this to the last act, skipping all of the contentious 'Nam scenes personally, a bold choice when you consider this is supposed to be a' Vietnam War Movie'. I don't know, there's something quite daring and possibly satisfying about leaving the actual experience of warfare that so damages the three central characters to the imagination of the audience, to focus purely instead on the before and after as a means of seeing how a war, which thankfully a bulk of the audience never had to experience, has (or has not) changed them.
Viewed today, I can see how the reckless madness of Russian roulette as a sport is an allegory for warfare itself. But it remains a clumsy and contentious one that one can only expect from a film whose original screenplay was set in the underground world of Vegas and which effectively had the Vietnam War crowbarred both into and around this bloodthirsty and cavalier spectacle. The film wants us to question whether sending young Americans a million miles away to fight and risk their lives for a war that they have little appreciation or understanding of is any different to Russian roulette. Surely, it asks, it would have made just as much sense to ask each enlisted man to stay at home and gamble on where a bullet was in the gun aimed at their temple. It's a striking metaphor, but it's inescapable that the anger it ought to direct at the powers who wage war is instead places firmly at the door of the average Vietnamese. And that's unforgiveable really. What further muddies the waters is the film's decision to conclude the way it did. Is the sing-song around the table a valedictory validation that America was right and that the rest of the world are 'other' who do not value life as they do, or is it meant to be deeply ironic? Cimino never makes it clear.
With the message of the allegory in mind, I'm left to wonder if the characters really were better off staying at home because it's actually interesting to consider if Vietnam even changed them all that much. For all their camaraderie, brotherhood and shared experiences, these are different men as evinced by the bloodsport they perform for leisure as much as for their country. De Niro's character is a serious, almost Zen-like hunter, a man for whom a weapon is merely an extension of his body as he strives to achieve the perfect 'one shot' to the deer which, ironically is all his roulette opponent will need to achieve for him to win. He confesses to Christopher Walken early on in the proceedings that, as much as he loves the others, he only trusts him on the hunt; something which is replicated both in his initial, practical desire to leave newly-wed John Savage behind in their escape and their eventual fate facing off against one another in the decisive game of roulette. Even so, Walken does not possess the same inner strength and contentment De Niro has in action or the hunt. He is heard mentioning how he fasts to keep himself sharp. This is something he has to work on to achieve, whereas for De Niro it is natural. Lastly there's Savage, whose domesticity indicates he is not meant for the way of the gun. It's telling that the group go hunting on the morning after the wedding. Obviously he is elsewhere, consummating the marriage, but one suspects he wouldn't be in attendance anyway. The hunt isn't his thing and it is that which foreshadows his unfortunate fate in the field. As for the others that De Niro confesses to love but whom he does not trust hunting (John Cazale in his final role, George Dzundza and non-actor Chuck Aspegren) their behaviour is either garrulous and high spirited or, in the case of Cazale, mean spirited and ill prepared. It's therefore equally telling that none of the other three join up to fight.
In conclusion, I wouldn't rate The Deer Hunter a ""Fucking-A"" because of its flaws, but it remains an interesting and beautifully structured and paced (it never feels like a three hour movie) B minus. Oh, and whilst Cavatina is beautiful, it's better served by the film it made its debut in, The Walking Stick.",4.0

"The Deer Hunter is a Best Picture winner that even though isn't perfect, it has lots of brilliant things and great moments going for it.
The main issue I have with the movie is the first hour of the movie. It mostly consists of the wedding of one of the characters and I have one thing to say, this wedding scene ain't The Godfather by any means. It is just overly long and I know what they wanted to do, but this just goes on and on and only after this is over, the movie really starts to be interesting with the Vietnam section and later the outcome of the war. Those two parts were just great and the slower pace worked much better in those scenes.
The biggest highlight of the movie are all the famous Russian roulette scenes that are just great. That was the only part of the movie I had really known about before watching the movie and they didn't disappoint at all. They are just very tense and always have a satisfying conclusion.
This movie also features some great performances with the best being from Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. Both of them were great and just sold all of the traumatic effects of the war perfectly. There were a few more solid performances from John Cazale, Meryl Streep and John Savage that fit their role really well.
Overall, The Deer Hunter is a great movie that has a brilliant second portion, while the first hour unfortunately just wasn't up to par.",4.0
"The main roulette scene is probably the most terrifying, effective scene in cinematic history. I was wowed by De Niro and Walken’s performances. Overall as an anti-war film it’s not as great as say The Thin Red Line or Apocalypse Now, but it’s up there. 
An ultimately humbling and depressing experience that questions ones will to survive and persevere through the haunting and unforgettable times of war.",4.5
"È uno dei più grandi capolavori che la storia dell'arte (non solo quella del cinema) possa vantare ed è stato ormai analizzato in ogni modo possibile.
Vorrei quindi concentrarmi su un elemento che sembra assente nel film - la speranza - ma che emerge prepotentemente da un dettaglio che non ricordavo dalle precedenti visioni (vedere i film al cinema è veramente tutta un'altra cosa): il freeze frame finale.
The Deer Hunter termina con i reduci del Vietnam - ""reduci"" in ogni senso possibile: letterale, metaforico, allegorico, umano - che intonano God Bless America. La cosa scandalizzò buona parte dei critici professionisti del 1978 che, alla luce di quella scelta, reputarono il film reazionario, di destra nell'accezione militarista del termine.
E forse avrebbero avuto ragione se quel genio di Michael Cimino non avesse optato per il freeze frame.
Il fermo immagine ha il potere di porre una sequenza al di fuori del tempo della storia raccontata e al di fuori del tempo impiegato per raccontare quella storia specifica. Il fermo immagine colloca la pregnanza iconologica di una sequenza su un piano atemporale, universale, astorico. Quel fermo immagine è un inno che Cimino tutto sommato si sente di intonare alla speranza, al non avere paura di ricominciare, di andare avanti e oltre l'orrore che la vita ci riserva.
Mi permetto di dire ""ci"" perché ognuno di noi si trova a vivere, forse suo malgrado, un proprio Vietnam personale. Il successo straordinario dei tanti film su quella pagina tristissima della storia americana è insito proprio nel valore universale di quella insensata ed autolesionistica guerra che ha spezzato una generazione e segnato negativamente un'epoca. Ognuno di noi, anche a decenni di distanza da eventi incomunicabili da chi li ha vissuti in prima persona ed incomprensibili per chi li ascolta, sente vicino Mike Vronsky o Linda perché ognuno di noi, almeno una volta nella vita, ha dovuto aggrapparsi alla speranza per andare avanti. Anche quando tutto sembrava essersi dissolto, anche quando tutto sembrava essere destinato a finire tra i grigi deprimenti di una provincia operaia della Pennsylvania come tante altre al mondo (che fotografia eccelsa di Vilmos Zsigmond) senza gli amici di una vita e senza certezze sulla strada da intraprendere. Quella piccola comunità di russi immigrati ormai fieramente americani e che per l'America hanno dato tutto sembra essere la prosecuzione ideale del gruppo sulla diligenza di Ombre rosse (1939) di John Ford. Ford raccontava in chiave epica la nascita di una nazione tra estasi della frontiera e contraddizioni relazionali, razziali e sociali, Cimino ne mette in evidenza l'integrazione nella e della cultura americana, i riti sinuosi (il matrimonio, il biliardo, il canto, i balli, l'alcol, Can't take my eyes off you, l'amicizia, l'amore), la caduta nell'Orrore più spaventoso e la morte.
Ma la cultura americana - che è per estensione quella occidentale - è fatta anche di speranza, di vitalità, la stessa vitalità che domina i primi 65 minuti del film e che nemmeno il Vietnam, nemmeno le peggiori torture, nemmeno le peggiori roulette russe, nemmeno la morte stessa possono domare.
L'America vera è quel gruppo di immigrati russi ormai integrati che, nonostante tutto, intonano un inno di speranza e di vita.
The Deer Hunter non fa sconti allo spettatore in termini di crudezza ed implacabilità ma non si tira indietro nemmeno dal lasciare un messaggio di speranza. Un messaggio di speranza dedicato a tutti quelli che hanno affrontato e affrontano ogni giorno il proprio Vietnam sperando di venirne fuori e voltare pagina. D’altronde, anche la vita stessa è un “one shot”: rispettiamola, diamole valore anche quando ci inabissa in vortici infernali.  
Grazie, Michael Cimino, per quel freeze frame finale",5.0

"A great anti-war film that somehow fails to completely land.
The film follows a man named Michael and his two friends as they head off to fight in Vietnam only to learn the horrors of war and its impact on their psyche.
This is a movie I have seen once before, and when I first saw it, I just didn't get it. It was one of those films that was well written, directed and acted, but I just never found myself all that invested. That thankfully changed a good bit for this viewing, as I do understand it a bit more now than I did when I was 17 or 18 when I first watched it. Michael Cimino, despite his controversial career (or rather, lack thereof) post this film, does a solid job behind the camera. I liked how he gave us over an hour to really get immersed into the small town the three friends inhabit. It's not your typical small town americana, it's a mining town with Russian families living there, an unusual perspective for a movie from the Cold War. It gives us their specific perspective on things, that they love their country despite being viewed as possibly the enemy from their own countrymen. It's a nice angle to see.
Cimino also excels at delivering the tension required of a war film. There's not much here in terms of all out combat, instead focusing on the sadism of war, with Russian Roulette playing a major part in this film. The roulette scenes here are full of tension, as Cimino draws out the proceedings to their breaking point before making the characters pull the trigger. There's a reason these scenes are depicted on the posters, they are far and away the most memorable parts of the movie, and they do a wonderful job showing the progression of the three leads. These torturous games all have an adverse impact on the characters, leading all three to be broken in their own way, making it difficult to come back home when the fighting is done.
Still, I just found it very difficult to really get stuck into this story once it moves to Vietnam. I'm not sure why, maybe it's the mostly subdued performances from the cast (which are excellent either way), maybe it's the drawn out nature of the film (running over 3 hours), or maybe it's just that I'm still too young and dumb to get fully invested. As it stands, this is a wonderful film with great writing, direction, cinematography, and acting, but it just never quite comes together for the gut punch I think Cimino was going for. Instead, I largely felt detached, and maybe that was his aim (it certainly was for a few scenes), but that wasn't the vibe I got from the last half hour or so.
In the end, while I did appreciate this one more this time around, I would probably put this in the same league as Goodfellas, a movie I respect for all the talent and craft put into it, even if I don't personally get the hype as much as most. Still, if you're looking for a good old fashioned anti-war film, this is certainly one to check out.",4.0
"Fuckin’ A!
I’ve always loved this one. The locations, cinematography, excellent performances (my heart breaks when I see how frail John Cazale looks in his last film role), the juxtaposition of life in a small steel mill town and the trauma of war… I’ve just always loved it. And it doesn’t feel draggy for a 3 hour movie either.

"LB Community Film-Gala
Im Gegensatz zu anderen Regiegrössen sieht die Filmographie von Michael Cimino recht mager aus. Nur bei 7 Werken sass er auf dem Regiestuhl und erfreute sich bei den Zuschauern grosser Beliebtheit, lässt man seinen finanziellen Megaflop ""Heavens Gate"", der zwar als Klassiker gilt aber nur einen kleinen Bruchteil des Budgets wieder einspielte, mal aussen vor.
Inmitten seiner guten Filme sticht aber einer deutlich hervor.
1978, ein Jahr vor Coppolas ""Apocalypse Now"", schuf er im Vietnamkriegsfilm einen Meilenstein. ""The Deer Hunter"" liegt mit einer Durschnittswertung von 8,1 bei IMDB auf Platz 185 in der Top 250, verpasst diese bei LB zwar, weist mit 4,1 aber immer noch ein hohes Rating auf. Doch nicht nur bei den Zuschauern war er beliebt. Auch die Jury der Oscars verliebte sich in das Werk und vergab 5 Goldjungen unter anderem für den besten Film.
Das Geheimnis hinter diesem Erfolg besteht darin, einen Kriegsfilm ohne Krieg zu drehen. Grosse Schlachten und Feuergefechte fehlen, überhaupt spielt der Film für 3 Stunden nur sehr kurz in Vietnam. Es geht Cimino um die Menschen, weswegen er den Film in drei Teile spaltete. Die Erwartung des Krieges, der Krieg, die Folgen des Krieges. All dies bezogen nur auf die drei Freunde die im Fokus stehen.
Alles beginnt in einer Stahlarbeitersiedlung. Über eine Stunde nimmt sich Cimino Zeit um das Leben dort zu porträtieren. In kleinen Wohnungen, inmitten dreckiger Strassen, im Schatten des bedrohlichen Stahlwerk fristet eine Gemeinschaft aus russischstämmigen Amerikanern ihr Dasein. Etwas, dass in vielen Thrillern düster, verloren und von Geldnöten geprägt wäre ist hier die Freude des Lebens. Die Menschen sind zufrieden auch wenn ihr Leben einfach ist. Msn hat Freunde, heiratet und fühlt sich wohl. Nahezu unbekümmert erscheint das Leben von Michael, Nick und Steven bis sie in den Krieg ziehen.
Dieser ist kurz. Nicht der Krieg selbst sondern die Darstellung. Die Gefangenschaft hingegen scheint lang. Plötzlich sieht man ganz andere Menschen, als die zu Beginn, obwohl es aus biologischer Sichtweise immer noch die gleichen sind. Die Umstände zehren am Gemütszustand der Soldaten und des Zuschauers. Das russische Roulette raubt den Verstand oder die Menschlichkeit. Etwas, dass selbst nach der Flucht doch immer noch verloren bleibt.
Die Rückkehr erfolgt und doch ist man nie zurückgekommen.
Cimino verweigert die Unterhaltung. Immer direkt an den Charakteren zeigt er nur das, was wichtig ist um deren geistige Verfassung zu visualisieren, alles andere wird durch absichtlich grobe Schnitte entfernt. Im Gegensatz zu Coppolas ""Apocalypse Now"" ist dies hier eben kein Kunstwerk, zeigt zwar schöne Landschaftsaufnahme, zwingt sich aber eigentlich nur zu zeigen wie unmenschlich der Krieg ist, dass der Mensch droht sich selbst zu verlieren. Dies ist schonungslos und gerade zu den gegenwärtigen Zeiten des Ukraine Konflikts wird ""Die durch die Hölle gehen"" wieder so relevant wie er zuletzt bei seiner Erscheinung war. Krieg ist hässlich und zerstört vor allem Menschenleben, vor allem die von denen die überleben.
Deswegen ist ""The Deer Hunter"" ein zeitloses wie anstrengendes Meisterwerk in dem sich Robert De Niro und Christopher Walken die Seele aus dem Leib spielen. Das Ende verstört, lässt den Zuschauer entkräftet zurück und brennt sich in das Gedächtnis.",4.5
"After seeing this film for the first time in several years. I'm speechless. The Deer Hunter is without question one of the most heartbreaking and powerful films to ever be put to screen. The acting, cinematography, music and direction are all phenomenal. Though what stands out most about The Deer Hunter for me and what makes it so powerful is the friendship between each of the characters and how you see how the war has shattered them.
The performances from Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken really sell you on their friendship early in the film. Later on when Michael (Robert De Niro) meets Nick (Christopher Walken) for the first time since the war. You see how much the conflict has changed both which leads to one of the most emotionally intense scenes I can think of. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that gets better with each viewing. The sheer power and scale of this film really make it a stunning piece of cinema.",5.0

Of course, you can’t talk about this film without mentioning the famous Russian Roulette scene, which is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. Not really going to get into it much since most people know what I’m talking about. But this film is a tough watch.

"Deer Hunter is a horror movie in every sense of the term. From the cold opening shot of a street scene in industrial Cleveland, Ohio USA near dusk with fog and smog spilling into the background, a tone of dread is set. Cimino directs the early domestic scenes with quiet naturalism spending extra time with characters like Steven’s Mom or with Angela before the wedding and so on. The wedding sequence and party after is an endurance test and I’m sure Cimino wanted it to be even longer. The stunning transition from a natural rural setting to the middle of the Vietnam jungle with De Niro wielding a flame thrower happens instantly. From that point everything that follows is hard to watch. The details put into the POW sequence including rats and John Savage’s incredibly pathetic (in a good way) performance made me feel like I was watching someone be tortured. Combine all of that with the Russian Roulette sequences which could not be funny for me despite my love for Always Sunny (s2e9), you have a horror film. 
Deer Hunter has so many other positive qualities though it is hard to walk away from it marveling at the on-location work accomplished. The actors are all very good in their roles because most of them are big names or have big name potential but seem like next door neighbors. The attention to naturalism across the entire runtime enhances the frightful nature of the film’s central message, which is one I think everyone understands by the time people are held in cages along the River Kwai. 
Though there is much to love here, a 3 hour horror flick about war hits the same note too many times.",0.0

"Michael Cimino's Oscar winning Best Picture pulls you in and never lets up for its 3 hour running time. You do feel its length, but it's rarely a hindrance.

The template for all PTSD movies of its type.
Don't use Russian Roulette to decide if you want to see this or not. It rarely goes well.

Michael Cimino's 1978 war epic isn't really an epic per say. It's 3 hours of...depression. Starting off with a wedding that takes up about 45 minutes of runtime, I surprisingly found myself quite engaged. This sequence was certainly there to settle us in and introduce the characters and it was done really well. Obviously it could have been shortened, and so could have many other scenes, but for the most part I really enjoyed the prologue. Afterwards, we went through Vietnam in a sequence that was much shorter than I expected and also much better than I expected. And following that, we are shown the trauma all the characters deal with and specifically Christopher Walken's character.
Yeah, it's a pretty simple film but thanks to Cimino's execution, lots of aspects were enhanced. The main thing to discuss though has to be the insane performances; everyone in the cast just blew me away with the main standouts being Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. I've never fought in a war or anything yet I felt like Cimino and everyone else helped greatly to bring the essence of the film's themes to life.
Not much else to say. This is a marvellously directed and acted drama that showcases friendship and trauma in a genuinely enlightening way. Just wish that some stuff was cut out while other stuff was added in. And I won't lie; a year later, a much better film about the Vietnam War came out which I'd recommend over this any day 🙈. For what it is though, The Deer Hunter is incredible. Simultaneously reassuring and horrific.
Best Picture Winners Ranked",3.5
"THE DEER HUNTER is one of those classics that for some reason, I never watched before until recently. I have see that famous Vietnam ""Russian roulette"" scene couple of times, on Youtube and TV, and I probably saw some other bits and pieces of this movie on TV before, but never the whole movie.
Similar as with DIE HARD, local movie theater was showing this as a part of ""In memory of Michael Cimino"" program, so I figured, since I will watch it sooner or later...well, why not watch it on the big screen! After all, that's the best way to watch any movie...
Well, let me tell you this...I liked this movie, I really did...but I have to be honest here and say that THE DEER HUNTER was really tough and exhausting movie to watch. Its sa good movie...hell, a great movie, with really fantastic performances from (almost) entire cast, and great character development, but I really don't have a need to watch it again anytime soon, if ever.
THE DEER HUNTER is not really a movie about Vietnam war...there is barley one war sequence here...yet, it deals with subjects as friendship and painful consequences of war, and how war can affect people and friendships, both physically and mentally...and frankly, it hits you in the gut. There are actually two movie here...one, the first half...its jolly and kind of cheerful. But the second one, the second half...well, its dirty, gritty, gloomy and realistic. That famous Russian roulette that I mentioned before...its really intense and very ugly moment in the movie...a key moment that changes everything for everybody, and basically serves as a connection between ""two tonally different movies"", and combines them into one.
I believe there is really no need to spend any more words about outstanding performances from De Niro, Walken, Streep or John Savage, or any other cast member, because as I said earlier, they are all fantastic here!
And with that being said...we came to the end of this review. Once again, I have to repeat myself and say that Im not planing to watch THE DEER HUNTER again...at least not anytime soon. Its a good movie, but way to depressing and gloomy, and to slow and to long movie for me to re-watch it again...",4.0
"Well, according to IMDB, this is Jodie Foster's favorite movie, and who am I to argue with her?
I hadn't seen this in a loooooooong time, and, well, I don't remember it being as long as it was (like, Heaven's-Gate-long). The pacing is for the most part, pretty good, however. It's just over an hour until we get to Vietnam, and the first hour does a good job of immersing us in the reality of John Savage, Christopher Walken and De Niro's characters as they have one last big night on the eve of their deployment to 'Nam and Savage's wedding. It's impossible to miss the placement of the steelworks factory in the center of the town, and the roads that De Niro and his friends zip back and forth on, and the place exerts a sort of gravity--when the friends finally get up into the mountains and away from the sight of the smokestacks, it creates a sense of palpable relief (Well, not for the deer, but you know what I mean).
It creates a genuine sense of the dimensions of white working-class life in the seventies--this is a movie about the Vietnam experience-what it was to go, and what it meant to come back or not come back, more than it is about what the war was or why it happened--which is why the second act (the war itself) feels kind of jagged. Cimino makes the transition purposely abrupt and nightmarish (We get a carpet bombing, a VC shooting a woman and her child, and De Niro burning a guy to death with a flamethrower in the first thirty seconds) and that nightmare atmosphere clings to the Prisoner of War and Saigon scenes, where every Vietnamese character is othered by the protagonists. Of course, every other character back in the USA is also othered by the protagonists, with the sort-of-exception of Meryl Streep and the Hartford Elk. But given the ahistoricity of Russian Roulette in vietnamese prison camps, it makes the POW sequence in particular feel like the film's achilles heel. On the other hand, while it's awkward from a literalist read, taken as a metaphor for the idea of the violence that afflicted these men, who saw themselves as righteous hunter/warriors (As De Niro and Walken's characters clearly do in the first act, 'One Shot' and all that) the second half of the film's focus on Russian Roulette works brilliantly because the violence they tried to master proves unstoppable, uncontrollable, random, and ultimately destructive. The participants get chewed up for money, which is as bleak and blunt a metaphor for the soldier's experience as any I can imagine.
Walken and De Niro are both scarily good in this. Walken in particular looks barely human in some of his later scenes (Apparently he achieved this through an all-rice-and-bananas-diet). John Cazale on the other hand...........was on his last legs, and he really looks it. He's very much a supporting part, but his character, and his little six-shooter, are a needed contrast to De Niro, not for the audience per se, but for De Niro to contrast himself against. And he has a terrific pathetic-awkward fight scene scuffle with Walken as Savage's wedding.
Equally sad is reflecting on something that no one would have known in 1978 at that final freeze frame toast to Nick, though. This factory town, and ones like it, were on the way out, and it's all too easy to imagine the days full of quiet tragedy that lay beyond for the characters here, heartsick despite their survival, culminating, perhaps, in De Niro's Michael deciding to vote for Trump.",3.5
"Part of my Scavenger Hunt #3 list. Task:
10. A film about or featuring a wedding!
What to say about The Deer Hunter that haven't been said before? Well, probably nothing, so I won't bother writing anything proper. So if you expect something of that nature, you can stop reading now.
The Deer Hunter is one of those movies that you ought to have watched. And if you haven't, you are sure to have seen that Russian roulette scene in one way or another. Or at least have heard it being referred to. When it comes to my own relationship to this movie, it was one of those that I watched just for the sake of having watched it, at a time when I really started to explore other movies than those hundreds of tapes of 80s movies that we had at home. With this said, it must've been 15 years since I saw it, and this task opened up a window for a rewatch. Having waited for me in the shelf for years, all dusty and still wrapped up in plastic.
I didn't expect to be as impressed as I remember being when I was a teen. But I didn't expect me disliking it as much as I did. For starters, the cast felt kind of odd, but I won't write anything more about that, not wanting to really upset people. But I can say that it became hard even caring about them despite their ordeals... well, except for John Savage's character, but I soon realized that is was more due to that I love the movie Hair than anything else.
There's no denying that the build-up, with the dramatic leap into horrific scenes of war, is extremely effective though. And I'm sad to say that it ultimately became the only real thing that this movie had going for it. Not saying that I ever found it boring, and it sure is clear what this movie is trying to tell me. What it's trying to make me feel, and it's an all so important thing to say.",2.5
"I recently revisited The Deer Hunter (1978) on Netflix. The storyline follows a group of friends from a small town sent to the Vietnam War, profoundly altering their outlooks and approach to life. When one friend chooses not to return, his best friend must confront the nightmares of Vietnam to save him.
Directed by Michael Cimino (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot), the film stars Robert De Niro (Heat), Christopher Walken (The Dead Zone), Meryl Streep (The Devil Wears Prada), John Cazale (Dog Day Afternoon), and George Dzundza (Salem’s Lot).
This is a uniquely and brilliantly crafted war picture that delves into friendship, relationships, and the concept of being brothers until the end. The cast, especially De Niro and Walken, delivers tremendous performances. The well-chosen settings, particularly the legendary mountain scenes, enhance the film's impact. The Vietnam scenes feel authentic, immersing the audience brilliantly into the circumstances, capturing both the lack of hope and the characters' resilient will. The Russian roulette scenes are legendary, unforgettable, and mind-blowing. The conclusion strikes a balance between triumph and sadness.
In conclusion, The Deer Hunter stands out as an elite war movie with intelligent portrayals of the human psyche in the face of extreme circumstances and during recovery. There's much to appreciate here. I would give this film a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",4.5
"this is a perfect movie... until the third act
the first 1 hour and 40 or 50 are genuinely perfect, some of the best and most disturbing war scenes i've seen
the characters are very interesting, especially christopher walken's character, which i think is the outstanding one in this movie
it is shocking and awesome, i don't have a single issue
but then the last hour happens, and is so... empty
this movie could have been easily 2 hours and 20 or something close to that then it would have been perfect
but there's no reason for it to have 3 hours, it feels like it's being lengthy just for the sake of it, it stops being impacftul and becomes a generic drama story, and even the characters stop being interesting
this movie isn't boring, it's entertaining in the entirety of the 3 hours, the problem isn't being boring or not, the problem is that the story becomes so uninteresting in the last hour and you already got the point of the movie, so it feels useless
with that said, i really do recommend this movie and i feel like the first two hours are genuinely perfect and have one of the most intense scenes i've ever seen
-
esse é um filme perfeito... até o terceiro ato
a primeira 1 hora e 40 ou 50 são genuinamente perfeitas, algumas das cenas de guerra mais perturbadoras que já vi
os personagens são bem interessantes, especialmente o do christopher walken, que eu acho que é o que se destaca no filme
é chocante e incrível, não tenho nenhum defeitos
mas então a última hora acontece, e é tão... vazia
o filme podia ter facilmente 2 horas e 20 ou algo parecido com isso, seria perfeito
mas não tem nenhum motivo pra ter 3 horas, parece que é longo só pra ser longo, para de ser impactante e vira um drama genérico, até os personagens param de ser interessantes
o filme não é chato, é bem divertido as 3 horas inteiras, o problema não é ser chato ou não, o problema é que a história fica muito desinteressante na última hora e você já entendeu o ponto do filme, então ela dá a sensação de ser inútil
com isso dito, eu realmente recomendo muito esse filme e eu sinto que as primeiras duas horas são genuinamente perfeitas e tem uma das cenas mais intensas que já vi",4.0
"If one goes into Michael Ciminos The Deer Hunter expecting a standard war film depicting the frontier of Vietnam in all its brutality, I would almost certainly expect they would leave rather disappointed. After all, I think these deluded expectations are where the lack of appreciation (as exemplified by the abundance of low-star, popular reviews) for this film ultimately comes from. Whereas it seems many anticipate a picture resemblant of Platoon (1986), striving to boldly through you into the chaos of the war, The Deer Hunter is no such film, in turn more pondering the ripple effects of battle and showing it’s permanent impact on closely knit communities.
It seems the biggest quarrel people have with the film is its runtime and its structure. Yet where some would argue this is a tremendous weakness, I would argue it’s perhaps one of the film's greatest strengths. The entire picture opens with a prolonged wedding sequence, which comes off as nothing but natural. From the subtle interactions between the cast members to the gritty aesthetic of this West Pennsylvanian community, Cimino gives his world an astoundingly rich and tangible feel, mostly through his sturdy directing and embracements of detail. In this opening, I for one was not necessarily engaged by the plot, but more by the sheer nuance and complexity of what appeared before me on the screen – Cimino’s portrait of a small American community is teeming with life, and its near impossible to not be absorbed by his careful construction of such an environment.
Of course, this also serves as an important means by which to anchor us in the world of our characters, permitting the audience to understand their relationships and lives in full before thrusting us into the chaos of the war. Arguably, it’s this approach that makes it such an impactful film. In the opening, if one lets the movie truly absorb them, the hole left by the war upon our protagonist's return home is visibly felt. Once again, Cimino masterfully builds this through subtleties – the formerly lively and rich sense of the town especially is absent, and it now feels like a mere shell of the community it once was. Through his meticulous, evolving world-building, Cimino constructs a simple though important theme, revealing how this area will never be the same.
Simultaneously, however, it is the performances that contribute to this. Robert De Niro gives what is one of his most understated, human depictions of a character to date, from start to finish delivering acting that is raw and unadulterated. His subtle portrayal of trauma is exceptionally profound, feeling realistic in its sheer delicacy. Christopher Walken is another surefire highlight, although his performance lacks the nuance De Niro’s in turn boasts. Still, Walken’s acting abilities are not something to be ignored – his shattered showcase of a man spinning out of control due to war is effectively tragic, working to add to the film's sharp, emotional core. John Cazale, Meryl Streep, John Savage, and Chuck Aspegren are also all fantastic, consistently giving us duly realistic performances.
Yet what I think are the most fascinating pieces of it all are the sequences in Vietnam. Unlike films like Apocalypse Now (1979) and Full Metal Jacket (1987), these scenes are not grand, intimidating battles of unparalleled scale – instead, they are small and simple, repeatedly built around feverish games of Russian Roulette. Even if this is not the most historically accurate, for the film, I think it works – it’s such a simplistic game, yet its ideals of chance and senseless violence reflect the war nearly perfectly, serving as a controlled and effective way to convey general conceptions about the battlefield. Not to mention, Cimino simply builds these moments as some of the most utterly intense scenes ever to grace the screen, creating points that converge masterfully in a small-scaled spectacle of quick editing, jarring sound, excellent production design, and keen directing.
Still, again, this is a movie less about the frontier itself and more focused on war’s effects and its long-lasting impacts. There’s a reason the majority of the picture takes place in Pennsylvania – it’s a thoughtful, slow pondering of consequence and aftermath, carefully and emotionally depicting this in a profound, intelligent way. I can see how some won’t enjoy it (its pace is long and truthfully daunting), and I don’t even think it’s perfect, but it’s a movie one needs to permit themselves to be absorbed by. If this approach is taken, it offers an interesting, somewhat disparate experience, which still stands as one of the most moving entries of the genre to date. Certainly a recommendation, though proceed with due caution.",5.0
"the final denouement.
god if they only knew.
what strikes me most about The Deer Hunter is how accessibly transgressive it is. Sometimes you'd have to look to more studious forms of art to feel like perhaps you were being challenged, but right here, a wide (and suitably hungry) American audience was delivered pain and terror like it came to each of their doors with their sons body.
A country that made enemies of everyone, the great ghoul of the west would make enemies of itself. A relentless trauma economy that made ghosts out of the dead and demons out of the living.
complete destruction.
Trauma becomes a skill. A job. Trauma becomes what war always becomes: a commodity. a Living.
The Deer Hunter is structured like a hurricane. Each bookending hour barely containing the demon seed of the middle hour.
Friendships. Cohesion. A place among the living.
[[[an implanted torment. a coincidental meeting of visiting hell while it visits you]]]
Back home. skin greyer. homelife perturbed with the missing sound of fire and screams.
I think of all the things in the film, I wanted to peer and luxuriate in the actual deer hunting and nature.
First half of the film, its a celebration. a Familiarity where the odds are yours to intensify. The gun and its barrel are yours to decide. almost no fate involved.
But the men transplanted into the Vietnamese/Cambodian jungles, nature is anything but a fertile joy. its traps, holes, spikes, blood, death.
Michaels hunt after he comes back is like a walk through a haunted house. no joy, no pain, no regret. a scream into the mountain falls to make sure they know hes clocking in again, but the place bears no fruits now.
its all complete fucking agony and, without sounding stupid, completely terrified me. the total evisceration of the working people, their minds and souls as dog food. to be fed into the mouth of a dog only to be spat back out and told to forget you were ever chewed.
no ones lives and relationships ever restored and everything totally utterly fucked.

i have to add that this film affirms my love for Robert De Niro, because i always loved the guy, but after watching this i really wanna watch his other movies again. a fucking legend. i can so relate to the woman in the grocery store repeatedly kissing Bobby D in the face. that’s really me.

"The Deer Hunter is a film that’s always been somewhat intimidating to me, i’ve heard it was quite slow paced and sometimes hard to watch. And that is true, but I thought it was a great film. The slow pace and difficult subject matter benefits the film In my opinion.
The performances here are fantastic! Especially from Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro! I knew of that Russian roulette scene before watching the film, yet it was still absolutely heart-wrenching. That first Russsian roulette scene might be one of my favorite scenes of all time, I thought it was wonderfully crafted and offers a nice payoff.
The score was also amazing! It was so beautiful and sad. I was honestly a bit emotional after that ending, I just sat and stared at the credits while that beautiful guitar song played.

"""I really don't know how to feel...….""
I don't often start my word vomits with quotes, but this one perfectly encapsulates the themes of this sprawling, complex, divisive classic. Is it a film about Vietnam? No, its about the impacts of conflict on those that come back and those that don't go, and how it often leaves both hugely uncertain of who they are, what to do and how to react and treat people they once knew and now, due to these life changing events, may not know at all any more...…
The controversial wedding sequence is brought up time and again as being one of the main criticisms of the film. Yet, its not the wedding itself that takes the time - its all the little ancillary stories around the ceremony itself that packs out the run time. And yet like the wedding, each adds a huge amount to the events to come - short scenes like Streep and her father add nothing to the plot nor to the main characters, but it adds resonance to the theme of understanding what is being left behind, why are these boys going to war - to protect a country that maybe isn't quite so great as they (and more tellingly those that are asking/telling them to fight) think it is.
Similarly with the hunting scenes, these are almost mythic, harkening back to the birth of the US in its wild frontier days showing its purity to begin with, then how the impacts of war and potentially the way of modern life after war has somehow poisoned this once pure world and act. Huge amounts of depth added to themes, not plot, yet all make the next two acts even more impactful.
The jump straight to Vietnam, no introduction, no scene setting ""here's our mission"", etc is as shocking in its structure as it is brutal in tone and similarly with the capture and initial Russian roulette scenes just 'happening', with no characterisation of the Vietcong whatsoever, highlights how little Cimino was interested in making this a 'war porn' film - the roulette sequences (did they really happen? Who knows....) stand for any brutality meted out in the name of war and are just as quickly finished and over with to allow us to now get back to the third act and the treatment of vets, both at home and abroad. Skilfully starting with Nick, who is seemingly the most 'capable' of dealing with the war - he is the only one rescued and is physically fit, we see the mental anguish and PTSD take over and then just as startlingly, we're back with De Niro, who gets the meat of act three due to him being the only one to come home. These scenes of him trying to connect with the town who hold him as a hero, which just drives him further and further into retreat, are heartbreaking, perfectly encapsulated by that first toast with his buddies and no-one knows what to say...…..
I could go on - the perfect way the film choses not to explain or delve into the change in these characters, just show them as being something no-one really understand, the poignant and biting final singalong or the horrible knowledge that John Cazale and everyone around him knew he was dying as he shot his scenes and never lived to see the film finished - but I won't. Suffice to say this is an utter classic, one that gets better and more poignant with age as the divides between people here depicted as being caused by something as brutal as war are now starting to happen much more surreptitiously through adoption of technology...…..its amazing.
Its one of the most perfect films for me as it caught me at the right time and its stayed with me. Wonderful performances, complex themes of identity, community and even masculinity take over the war plot and leave us with haunting and emotional images (ever seen anything more devastating than Walken's spit in the face of De Niro at the film's climax? Thought not) and a thought provoking movie even some 40 years later.",5.0

"1977. 
Michael Cimino, an ambitious, pompous, and bright young director who made his debut film with titan Clint Eastwood and baby Jeff Bridges needed a new leading man for his next film. His next film, perhaps the first of its kind to criticize the Vietnam War, required a hefty cast for its heavy thematic trauma and long runtime. 
Cimino initially scored Roy Scheider, a bookish, Cagney-esque “tough guy” who was indentured to Universal after the princely success of America’s most American picture, Jaws. After devouring the script, Roy realized something - nobody in their right mind would go all the way back to Vietnam for a “buddy.” Roy (who said passing on TDH was the biggest mistake of his career) then paid off his debt (begrudgingly) by starring in Jaws 2.

Cimino desperately needed a leading man, one who embodied all-American concepts of hard work. Someone who believed a young man WOULD go all the way back to Vietnam for his buddy. By some miracle, the esteemed Robert De Niro accepted his offer. 
De Niro aided Cimino with the rest of the casting. He loved real life steelworker Chuck Aspegren so much that he and Cimino gave him the part of Axel despite Aspegren’s lack of experience. 
When Cimino needed to cast the film’s most important character, he had dozens of bigtimes in Hollywood vying for the part. This didn’t matter to Cimino or De Niro—the part of Nick required someone special.
Casting took place in some room. In walked an impoverished tap dancer and theater actor—he’s thirty-four years old but could easily pass as a man in his early twenties. 
Before the audition, De Niro asked him if he was some big headliner in some big New York play. There’s a likeness. The young blonde man had a split second to decide. “Do I lie to impress THE Robert De Niro? Will it make me seem right for the movie? What if I just say yes?” 
He decided to tell De Niro the regrettable truth. No, that’s not me. No, I’m not the headliner. I’m just a guy. A hoofer from Queens. 
De Niro was absolutely, wholly impressed by this guy’s honesty. He knew that anyone else would’ve heedlessly lied to gain his favor.
Cimino and De Niro asked him what role he wanted. Modestly and reflexively, he said to be an extra in the bowling scene was adequate. An extra.  
They gave that hoofer from Queens the part of Nick, a part that would require him to work in tandem with De Niro’s Michael. Christopher Walken thinks that this honesty was what earned him the part. When he won his Oscar, he thanked the Academy and only one other person: Robert De Niro. And it makes sense—these men had to play lifelong best friends. There needed to be an honest bond between them for us to believe that. 
That bond is still real. It’s very special to me that these men still attend each other’s birthday parties and reunite for awful, corny grandpa movies made for kids. It’s special to me that Cimino could have easily chosen someone well-known and that De Niro saw something genuine, something honorable in that “nobody.” 
Thank you, Bob, for giving that guy a shot. I really love that blonde hoofer from Queens.",5.0
"Francois Truffaut famously said, ""there's no such thing as an anti-war film,"" but I'd say Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter comes pretty damn close. Perhaps because it eschews depicting very much of the war itself in terms of combat or camaraderie, it's able to avoid falling into the trap of glamorizing the spectacle of violence. Instead, it focuses on the inner lives of three young working class men before and after their experience as POWs in Vietnam.
Having been born well after the war ended, the trope of the ""shellshocked"" Vietnam vet is generally treated as a joke in my experience. Here it is anything but. The pain these men are feeling is visceral and oppressive as you see them go from happy partiers without a care in the world to hollow shells of human beings, utterly unable to thrive in the normal world. It's a gut punch and there are many disturbing scenes, but if you've got the stomach for it, I can't recommend The Deer Hunter strongly enough.",5.0
"For all it has going for it, I have to admit that I would've liked 'The Deer Hunter' more as a 2-hour film than as a 3-hour epic. The first hour of the film takes place over the final days before three young men (played by Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage) ship off to Vietnam. This extended opening gives us the time to gain a sense of what these characters are like before the devastation they will face in Vietnam. It's not focused on biographical details of these characters, but rather on learning about what they're like from how they act at work, at one of the characters' weddings, and on a hunting trip. While this extended opening makes the later sequences have more emotional impact, it still went on far too long for my taste without anything interesting to hang on to. The rest of the film is not immune from lingering too long on its scenes either.
This film is a masterpiece aside from my problems with the pacing and runtime. Whether it was the beautiful church where the wedding took place, the picturesque US forest land where the hunting sequences occurred, or the scenes in Thailand where they shot the Vietnam sequences, this film is always masterfully shot and a wonder to look at. The obvious highlight of this film is the Russian Roulette scenes. Given the nature of this ""game,"" it's as high-stakes as it can get every time it's played. If there's a way to show the devastating impact that war can have on one's psyche and how it can turn a young man into a shell of his former self, voluntarily playing in a game where you have a 1/6 chance of dying each time you play is a great way to show (not tell) the impact of the war.",4.0

I'm all for character building—especially in a movie that studies the psychological transgression of human beings before/after some traumatic event—but Act One is waaay too long. Critical moments notwithstanding, there's a substantial amount of filler that adds little, if any depth. (And is it just me, or is Streep's acting in the first-third of the movie noticeably weak for someone of her caliber or what?) The three-hour runtime isn’t the problem per se; I'd have gladly sacrificed twenty unnecessary minutes of the wedding to get an extra twenty minutes in the Vietnamese POW camp, or getting some behind-the-scenes shots of Nicky's new life as a professional Russian roulette player, post-war. The slack gets picked up a bit in the back-half of the film: Love how filthy and tense the Vietnamese scenes are, especially the build up to Nicky and Michael's escape-plan-game. Even knowing what happens - having seen it many years ago - I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The extended closure is good, but not as stark as the meat of the film. (My favorite moment: Michael playing his own twisted version of Russian roulette with Stan's pistol.) Can’t underestimate the strength of Nicky and Michael's reunited game, though, as they're staring at each other across the table and tears start glazing Nicky's eyes as he finally remembers who's sitting across from him. ""One shot."" A gut-churning turn of events that is almost compromised by De Niro's overacted screams of disbelief that follow, but there's no doubting the power of this scene. (Yes, it borders on overly melodramatic…But that’s the goddamn Seventies, man.) An good film bogged down by bloat.",3.0

"Well this was a disappointment. The Deer Hunter has been sitting on my watchlist for many years, and I’ve finally gotten around to it in my personal project to watch the movie at the very bottom of my watchlist at least three times per week, to start clearing out the backlog, which means I added this movie over 9 years ago. 
Given its reputation I had high hopes. The war in Vietnam was a fascinating period in American culture and…",2.5
"Murica! Fuck yeah! Oh...
Hmm, where do I even start with this? It’s barely a four star movie, I’ll say that. I dunno man, I guess this wasn’t exactly the movie I expected. It’s like everyone talked about this like it was a brutal Vietnam classic with a three hour runtime, but it’s really just a long ass drama that flip flops between two different stories. It makes for a rather puzzling experience. 
When it comes to movies about Vietnam, you get two different structures. One, the big PTSD angle a la Casualties Of War, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon. And two, the psychedelic descent into madness and surrealism, notably used in Apocalypse Now. Jarringly, this movie seemed to be stretching itself to accommodate both. We’re given a whole hour and a quarter long first act with our characters and their town, cementing the players in this elongated drama. But then, we’re thrown into the jungle without any sort of idea how we got there, just told to go along for the ride with a new chapter about Russian roulette and PTSD. 
Usually when I disagree with negative takes on movies, I just say so and am just left wondering why someone could come to that conclusion. But with this, I’m totally neutral. On one hand, I really love how rich and alive this movie is due to its extended first act and everyday characters. It does a great job of showcasing the various moral grey areas and hypocrisy present in war and conflict. As usual, these characters and their experiences are symbolic of an uncaring government that would rather send young working men off to war rather than think things through from a human perspective. But in this, there’s that added element of realism present, almost documentary-like, that really helps you buy into their predicament.
On the other hand however, The Deer Hunter is a bit of a narrative mess, as many on here have pointed out already. With a three hour runtime, you’d expect clarity and pacing. But throwing us into and out of Vietnam with zero establishment is kinda confusing. I’d have been fine with an even longer movie had the time been put to use properly. There’s stuff that could’ve been shaved down or cut completely too. And the third act is very bizarrely put together as well, taking us from Vietnam to the US and then back to Vietnam again, especially (once again) without any establishment of how a certain character is coming or going and how that affects others. I totally dug the whole psychedelic, surreal trip through a war torn Saigon, but where was the rest of it? And why was the ending so melodramatic? 
So yeah, this is a four star movie for the sheer effort and filmmaking prowess involved. It’s a mess and I’m sure there’s probably some unreleased four hour cut, but it’s still really disjointed and shoddily put together in my opinion. Definitely the best anti-Russian roulette movie ever made though, so it accomplished something.",4.0

"There is nothing more relaxing and wholesome than watching de Niro, walken and Fredo play pool, get drunk and singing can’t take my eyes off of you. I feel like this specifically targeted me with with the tonal whiplash.
At the wedding they dance to what would become the Tetris theme. I don’t have a joke there. It’s just something that occurs.
I’m aware the pacing is a mess for this film ( they could cut some of the scenes pre nam) and it is really contrived, but what can I say I’m a sucker for these sort of films.
This film is really dark and explores some pretty complex stuff, but it never loses sight of the core character relationships that hit really hard and are the heart of this film.
The cast is also god tier. You’ve got so many great actors in smaller parts ( shoutout to merryl Streep who made something out of a pretty thankless role) and bigger players like John cazale are amazing ( the story with him being in this film is really wild and definitely worth a research)
Christopher walken is amazing in this. He’s one of those actors whose superb in everything I watch but is always in smaller parts that he clearly got from great performances in other films. This is other films.
But the mvp is rdn. Every time I think I’ve seen every possible amazing de Niro performance I come across something new. And every time it reminds me why he’s hands down my number 1 favourite actor of all time.
The film is a bit slow first act, but it’s good buildup and makes the kater scenes meaningful. The stuff in Vietnam is 10/10 and absolutely harrowing, and everything after that is amazing. It takes some time to get into it but once you pass that hour mark this film phenomenal.
It’s a long watch, and certainly not a light one, but everyone’s gotta view this at least once. For de Niro and walken if nothing else.",5.0

"It is said that this film has the greatest acted scene in cinematic history. Of course , I'm talking about the Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken's Russian Roulette scene.
What a nostalgic ride to watch an OG like John Cazale doing what he does best with Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken in a single frame. This film is an absolute masterpiece of a work in story and acting. Any young person aspiring to become an actor can start this film and rename it Acting-101.
Most people would complain because of its lenghty screen time of 3 hours but if you make up your mind and go through these 180 minutes, the story will grip you while the portrayal of friendship and scars of war will entice you.
Watching a film like this after decades of its release can really tempt the viewer to understand the cultural conceptions that might be uncommon nowadays. The character study of each charcater is thorough and by the end of the film you'll be familiar with every character.
A certified masterpiece. A timeless classic.",4.5
"Monumentally tedious. The Deer Hunter has literary ambitions and some striking ideas - it is not surprising that the arresting horror of the Russian roulette scene would burn in as a metaphor for the arbitrary devastation of the Vietnam War, despite its lack of historicity.

"The Deer Hunter is the 1978 war drama starring Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, and Meryl Streep. 
The Deer Hunter tells the story of three steelworkers who go off to fight in the Vietnam War. 
The film is tense, emotional, and heartbreaking. It shows the many brutalities of war, from the actual fighting and getting captured, to the longterm mental, physical, and psychological effects it can have. 
All three of the main characters come out of their battles as changed men. Each of them has their own demons to face, as they struggle to find any sense of normality or peace. 
The Deer Hunter may feel a little slow at times, but the pace didn’t prohibit the film from ultimately being an worthy experience. Although I would have liked a couple of more scenes in the battlefield of Vietnam, I can understand why they decided to go in a different direction.",4.5

"The best works of art for me, besides being beautiful and truthful, are the ones that manage to capture that weird, cyclical ebb and flow of life. The works that manage to reflect that ""not-quite-right"" feeling of living. Everyone bounces from one life episode to the next, but things rarely go ""just right."" We live in an imperfect world and have to deal with that on a daily basis. Little hassles, awkward and unavoidable interactions, problems with other people, gut-wrenching tragedy, etc. The Deer Hunter is a movie that captures this duality of bad and good and of all of even our best moments being tainted by life.
What struck me most about this film is that it is a sad film, but not a depressing one. The film ends on a good note, even if it's bittersweet. Almost everyone here gets as good an ending as they could have for their circumstances. This is typical for Michael Cimino, a dude who has lived life. No one else makes films quite like his because he is very clearly someone who has put his feet on the ground and walked, someone who has spoken with many people, and someone who understands that the struggle is real. In some ways, this film is almost like a B-side to The Exorcist. Whereas that film was about the sinister spiritual forces all around us, this is about the horrors of man and people just trying to get through this incredibly short but arduous life. Someone who has only passively lived life could not have made a movie like this. Someone like Nic Refn will never make a movie like this. In fact, I'd be surprised if anyone ever makes a film like Heaven's Gate or The Deer Hunter ever again, because it seems as though so few people are really living.
Cimino's work is about living, but specifically about living in a slowly eroding America. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is a New Hollywood movie about living as a criminal but a free man in an ""vanished America,"" The Deer Hunter is about living through Vietnam and war, Heaven's Gate is about the early days of America and how things have basically always been like this and the best we can do is be good people, and Year of the Dragon is about America in the 80s and dealing with multiculturalism and immigration. I think it's pretty cringe and weak to only ever discuss a director's movies in the context of his other work, but it's important with Cimino to outline his worldview and his sense of life and America. It's hard to fathom what people would have to go through to make something like The Deer Hunter, but I have the utmost respect for artists who can channel that experience and insanity into their work.
Mike (the protagonist, not the director) is a man who lives on his own terms. ""Movie guys"" love to go crazy over movies about ""professionals"" and ""guys with codes"" and these movies are generally just good because the filmmakers understand masculinity, but The Deer Hunter is a better film about masculinity because it sort of asks the question of what it would be like if one of those ""lives by a code"" protagonists existed in real life. Mike is ""literally me"" because he struggles to be known by people, but he lives in spite of this. He isn't like many current male screen heroes who let their isolation and lack of community define them. True community and society are sorely lacking from the current America, but even when Mike has those things, he is still not himself with his family and friends. His community never sees the Mike that stalks animals through the wilderness and kills them with one shot out of a sense of honor and skill, two very masculine qualities. Mike and his friends are in a sort of arrested development that comes with living in a small town. As the America Mike and his friends grew up with and had known slowly begins to fade away, they are left in this town, yearning for identity and purpose. A tragic aspect of this time period for America is that war was a way of finding purpose for many young men.
The iconic ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" scene in the bar and the lengthy wedding scene are the film's heart. The idea of community and relationships being the peak of human existence rings true. We were bred for those things, not for war and violence. Mike and his friends leave all that to find themselves so Mike can settle this longing for danger and adventure in his heart, and he comes back broken and changed. Mike goes through a sort of baptism of fire. He has his sense of community and sense of self destroyed, torn apart, and finally restored to a more meaningful state. He didn't live by rules before, but now he does. When he goes on another hunting trip with his friends after the war, he can no longer perform the callous act of shooting a deer for sport and he explodes at his friends' nonchalant treatment of violence and lack of understanding.
Cimino was such a real one for his movies. This is why I'll always appreciate him more than someone like Godard. His art was built to last. He lived. That's why he can make a film in 1978 and have it fully capture the feeling of standing on your two feet in the year of our Lord 2023, no matter who you are or where you come from. The Deer Hunter is about how life will hurt you and you cannot go back. You can only persevere. Like Exorcist III, Twin Peaks, Eyes Wide Shut, or any of the best American pieces of media, it captures human existence onscreen. Innocence is lost, wisdom is gained. Man may not have been made to handle the horrors of the world, but that's why we have each other, why Adam was still given Eve even when he was alone in the wilderness with himself and the animals like Mike. Life sucks and is hard, but it's also beautiful and you can share a drink with your friends and the people who love you the most.",5.0
"O contraste entre a alegria da festa de casamento que ocupa um bom pedaço do filme e a melancolia da cena que o encerra é intencional. Nenhum homem volta o mesmo de uma guerra. É possível resgatar um homem quebrado fisicamente, mas será que é possível resgatar um homem quebrado psicologicamente pela guerra? A resposta está em O Franco Atirador. Se o filme ainda é impactante nos dias atuais, imagina essa pedrada antibélica de Michael Cimino em 1978, quando as cicatrizes da Guerra do Vietnan ainda estavam bem abertas perante a sociedade norte-americana.

"The Deer Hunter is a formidable, vast, daring, poignant, stark, impactful, and a triumph. Few films have depicted the harsh aftermath of war so profoundly. Honest in its portrayal of human emotions, it paints a haunting picture. It's a gripping, emotionally taxing film that, by its conclusion, left me both drained and content. The devastatingly realistic portrayal of the Vietnam scenes is jarring, creating an overwhelming impact. The actors' natural performances add a chilling realism, amplifying the harrowing situations they face. Robert De Niro's astonishing portrayal feels achingly genuine and deeply poignant. Christopher Walken's performance, possibly his career best, is heartbreakingly masterful. The entire ensemble delivers authenticity and heartfelt emotion to the story. This remarkable anti-war film is utterly engrossing, emotionally exhausting, and profoundly moving. Its strengths are significant, and the performances highly compelling. Addressing crucial themes, conveying genuine horror, and showcasing exceptional craftsmanship, The Deer Hunter remains an impactful, thought-provoking cinematic journey that lingers.

"I'm a high-school student, and my third period class is Forensic science. To fill the time and add perspective on what we're studying, we watch movies related to a subject, so I'm the guy who (usually) brings them in. My teacher has the final say in the movies I bring, and he chose—what I thought was an odd choice out of my small film collection—The Deer Hunter. I understood why he picked this film, but I knew right away that all my peers wouldn't enjoy this movie. Well, not to my surprise, quite a few students thought that the film was boring and didn't like it, going so far as to say it was terrible. Now what was their primary reason for disliking it? It was the first act of the film - the wedding. The wedding took them out of the film completely. I respect their critique on how long the first act was because I do agree, it went on a little too long, but I completely disagree on the fact that the entire film is boring (or somehow terrible). Yes, the first act could've been executed better, but it's extremely significant. One: it introduces/develops the characters (even though I wouldn't want to hang out with those guys). Two: it gives significance towards the 'one shot' axiom. Three: it's deliberately slow, showing how their lives will be changed permanently after their experience in combat. Once the first act is completed, it's where I feel that the movie becomes truly entertaining. There is no room to breathe, the way Michael (Robert De Niro) tricks the Vietcong into putting more bullets into the revolver is a testament to his courage, leadership, and will to survive. The entire sequence is powerful and terrifying. Even with all that going on, I still think my peers didn't care enough for it because the film didn't give them enough reason to invest in the characters in the first act; some people were even asleep (go figure). Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken (Nick Chebotarevich), Meryl Streep (Linda), and John Savage (Steve Pushkov) give some of the greatest performances I've ever witnessed in a movie. The last Russian roulette scene is still as heartbreaking to watch as it was the first time... The last song they sing, ""God Bless America"", is filled with sarcasm as they mourn their friend. Overall The Deer Hunter is a gripping, deep, and powerful anti-war film that is a great example of the New Hollywood era of filmmaking. 9/10",4.5

"English:
Probably the cruelest film I've ever seen in terms of how it represents war and its consequences, there are few scenes in war, but Cimino makes them as torturous as possible - that first Russian roulette scene scared me more than any horror movie scene. I think it's really incredible how Cimino creates a very unique atmosphere for each space, he doesn't reduce these spaces to a specific dimension, it's as if the entire space influences the dynamics of the scene; that segment that goes from Steve's wedding, through the party and ends at the end of the first third of the film, is very significant in this sense, in how the characters are arranged in the scenario in a way that all of that ends up being important for the creation narrative and sensorial of the scene; It's interesting how the first Russian roulette scene does this in a very different way, it uses that very claustrophobic space, and makes the characters have to decipher that space, and from that, tension is created. A film about the United States as a symbol of a patriotism that is embedded in people as a way of life – of people who are so embedded in it that they fail to notice its irrelevance in the face of the real interests of the state; the final scene very well points to a patriotism that Americans have always been conditioned to believe in, but which in reality is nothing more than a great hypocritical symbol.

Provavelmente o filme mais cruel que eu já vi em como representa a guerra e as suas consequências, são poucas as cenas na guerra, mas Cimino faz com que sejam o mais torturantes o possível – aquela primeira cena da roleta russa me deixou mais apavorado que qualquer cena de filme de terror. Acho realmente incrível como Cimino cria uma atmosfera muito única para cada espaço, ele não reduz esses espaços a uma dimensão específica, é como se todo o espaço influenciasse na dinâmica da cena; aquele segmento que vai do o casamento do Steve, passa pela festa e termina no final do primeiro terço do filme, é bem significativo nesse sentido, em como os personagens vão se dispondo no cenário de um modo que tudo aquilo acaba sendo importante para a criação narrativa e sensorial da cena; é interessante como a primeira cena do roleta russa faz isso só que de um jeito bem diferente, usa daquele espaço bem claustrofóbico, e faz com que os personagens tenham que decifrar aquele espaço, e a partir disso, que a tensão é criada. Um filme sobre os Estados Unidos como símbolo de um patriotismo que é inserido nas pessoas como estilo de vida – de pessoas que estão tão inseridas naquilo que não conseguem notar a sua irrelevância perante os reais interesse do estado; a cena final aponta muito bem para um patriotismo que o americano sempre foi condicionado a acreditar, mas que na realidade não passa de uma grande símbolo hipócrita.",5.0
"“You wanna play games? All right, I'll play your fucking games.”
I was wondering how this film would hold up, and to be honest it holds up well. Although it by no means is the masterpiece I remember or that it has been labeled. It’s very well made, it has some stunning visuals, an insane cast, and a few scenes that are as good as they get. In general though, it’s definitely too long, does not develop the characters as well as it should for a film this long, and its story is a bit all over the place. What story there is, minus the war destroys message which isn’t exactly revolutionary.
Visually it’s excellent, from both the cinematography, art design, and composition it’s all excellent. The 4K remaster is also rather impressive. The music is good, but by no means as good as it could have been, if I’m being honest.
The acting is perfect. A cast this stacked, it’s no surprise, but none the less it’s brilliant. Robert De Niro is excellent. Christopher Walken, although underused, excellent. John Cazale is excelllent. Meryl Streep excellent. Like I said everyone is great, it’s just their characters that are a bit undercooked at times if I’m being honest.
There are some stunningly good scenes, some brilliant performances, and some excellent visuals. What there isn’t is a great director, a perfect script, or a really great screenplay. All of that could have elevated this from a very good film to a masterpiece. Still it’s an excellently made film that is memorable for some great moments. It just isn’t quite as good as its reputation would lead one to believe. I really wish more than anything, the character development and script were much better. They are good, but just not quite good enough. Also it has no business being three hours long, this feels like a film where they decided longer would mean a better reception. In general it could have lost twenty to thirty minutes and would’ve been much better for it.
I would definitely recommend this film, it’s excellent in so many ways, and shows a different side to the Vietnam war, but it’s not a must watch film in my opinion. I think they made a mistake by not giving Walken’s Nicky some scenes in Vietnam besides the end. Still the acting, visuals, and the best scenes, make it a very good film that I definitely really enjoy.",4.0
"Difficult topics when handled with care can lead to stories that stand firm. This is a scathing examination of the devastating effects that war can have on those who survive.
The cast was stellar and pulled this off by hitting the empathy buttons hard. Our human psyche can be fragile when pushed to the brink and yet we keep striving for hope. Friendship can drive that hope and I think that was orchestrated well in this film.
The locations brought you in with some stunning natural backdrops. This film was loaded with extras and the coordination of all them was stellar. The soundtrack fit the tone and featured some beautiful guitar work. Even though I thought it could have been edited more, by the end it all tied together and made sense.
It is not an easy watch and has some riveting tension but it is worthwhile and an accurate look at what we now call PTSD.

It's simply a parable about three ordinary steel workers faced with extraordinary circumstances? How does that not also apply to the Vietnamese peasants who had their country bombed and invaded? The Russian roulette scene is simply an allegory for the randomness of violence in war, despite being a massive lie? Then why does the film frame this ""random violence"" as being orchestrated entirely by one side? In any case, this kind of bullshit pontificating about the chaos of war doesn't interest me all that much anymore, as if definite historical and social causes don't exist, even if they aren't always immediately perceivable in the moment. It's almost too fitting that Cimino lied about being a Green Beret and having any involvement in the Vietnam War. The war is simply his cinematic playground. There is nothing ironic or ambiguous about the film's ending. It's a perfect reflection of the limits of a certain brand of Amerikan liberal anti-war politics, in which some mystical emancipatory core of this country can still be wielded against the perversion of the military machine (as though the two are separable), international solidarity be damned. It hurts to see glimpses of talent and great filmmaking applied to something so sinister.

"Robert De Niro é um gênio mesmo, mas isso todo mundo já sabe. Mas é um filme sobre o Vietnã onde a guerra, de fato, toma pouco mais de 30 minutos. Justamente porque se trata do impacto macro, da loucura da guerra sob essas pessoas (pessoas de verdade, com todos os seus preconceitos, defeitos e qualidades) que habitam uma cidadezinha pequena e pacata, com seus costumes e seus hábitos, enfrentando seus próprios problemas e planejavam seu futuro, mas tudo isso é interrompido pelo Vietnã, por um corte seco, abrupto, do casamento — a celebração dessas pequenas coisas que juntamos de pouco em pouco durante a vida e que Cimino faz questão de exaltar sem tirar os olhos —, para a explosão de um vilarejo no Vietnã. E o acúmulo da primeira parte, da compreensão das vulnerabilidades humanas, potencializa extraordinariamente a cena da roleta russa no meio e no final do filme. Gigantesco; insuperável",5.0
"Three close friends in small town Pennsylvania prepare to head off to fight in the Vietnam War. 🦌
The Deer Hunter is not one of those Best Picture Oscar winners that one merely throws on at random intervals to pass the time. It commands your attention. It's a powerful and deeply affecting story of friendship and the horrors of war and its aftermath. I saw it many years ago, so long ago I'd forgotten a lot of it, but other parts are seared into my memory. It has scenes of such intensity that you couldn't possibly forget them. Now, imagine having lived through them. That's the focus of the second half of the movie. I know this was one of the first big Vietnam War movies, and possibly even one of the first to truly depict a soldier's PTSD, I'm not sure.
The cast seems too ideal, but hey, it was the 70's. De Niro and Walken are both stellar. Meryl Streep' s first Oscar nomination and John Cazale's final movie.
There was controversy over the depiction of the Vietnamese forcing the Americans to play Russian Roulette at the time. This is a fictional story in which things that never happened in reality can happen. I can understand their not wanting to be seen in such a light, however, there's no denying the emotional punch delivered by it. Being forced into a deadly arrangement against your will is a perfect parable for war itself.",4.5
"Wow. This film is basically 3 hours of people's mental health declining. I think it was very successful in making the audience invested in the characters by showing their friendship in the first hour. With this star studded cast, it's no surprise that the performances were absolutely incredible. There were many intense scenes in this film that were acted to perfection. I could feel the pain of the characters. I especially loved Christopher Walken in this film, maybe because he…",4.5
"Me throughout the entire film: whatever happens, Christopher Walken can't die because he has to give Bruce Willis his father's watch.
For the first hour, this is a fairly endearing film about a group of friends bidding farewell to their small town in Pennsylvania. The wedding scene goes on for so long, but I wouldn't cut out any of it, and I don't even like weddings very much myself. It's heartwarming and really fun, so much that you kinda forget that you know this will eventually turn out terrible for the three main characters, who are shipping off to Vietnam the next day.
And then the film just cuts abruptly, and we're suddenly caught in hellish warfare. Any other film would have shown them arriving in 'Nam, getting settled, the whole ordeal. The Deer Hunter just throws you in the pit with no warning. It's seriously unsettling, and breathing is pretty much out of the question for the next half an hour. I knew there was a famous russian roulette scene somewhere in here, but I didn't expect to have ten panic attacks.
Unfortunately, the film doesn't keep that adrenaline rush throughout, and the sentimentality it opts for is held down by the unnecessarily long runtime. Director Cimino does a great job at exploring trauma, and not just on the surface, but between the lines as well. But there's a bunch of stuff I'd happily cut out of the film, and it'd be tighter and equally impactful. It drags quite a bit during the second half.
But that ending... I wouldn't change a single thing, even if it makes my heart ache.
(This is yet another film I was happy to have caught on TV, only to realize it was a cropped broadcast. The film was zoomed in so that the image would fill up the screen, so I watched the first hour or so on TV until I switched formats.)",4.0
"“Stanley, see this? This is this. This ain't something else. This is this. From now on, you're on your own” 

I will never forget the first time I watched Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter. I can seldom think of a film watching experience that moved me more. And now, all these years later, it’s still a deeply harrowing and aching piece of cinema. Hollywood has tried many times since to replicate its unique emotion and atmosphere, they have failed every time. The emotional intelligence and sense of place in Michael Cimino’s direction cements this film’s legacy as one of the best dramas ever made. The opening hour where we see the wedding is the perfect window into the lives of these men, where they come from and the friendships they carry with them. 
De Niro’s Michael is the most reserved and cool of the three, his commitment to the hunting contrasts with the tomfoolery of his friends. As the wedding goes on, he stays in bar, drowning his sorrows quietly. This attitude gives him a more emotionally cold exterior but it also makes him the most levelheaded. Looking back, this is easily one of Robert De Niro’s finest moments as an actor. His performance is often forgotten due to the sheer multitude of memorable performances he has given us, particularly during his near flawless 1970s run. A performance that does get a lot of recognition is Christopher Walken as Nick, there’s not much I can add here, my favourite moment from him is when he begins crying in the hospital, such convincing and heartbreakingly good acting, an Oscar well earned.  Savage’s Stephen is the innocent one, a man who was never built for the harsh brutality of war. I think this is why we see him get married at the beginning, he’s still caught up in young love, soon to be torn down. 
One of The Deer Hunter’s best aspects for me is Cimino’s ability to convey the idea of life in a small town. He weaves such a potent sense of community and warm homely atmosphere through the enchanting cinematography and intimate camera work. When Michael returns home, it’s like lighting the fireplace or collapsing into bed after a long journey. Hollywood is essentially an ivory tower these days, full of rich leotards who can entertain about as well as they can analyse politics, it’s rare that you get a film that can truly replicate a sense of home and community. Cimino pulled it off perfectly with The Deer Hunter. Goes to show how New Hollywood was the arguable peak of the artistic output of the system. The score is certainly one of the film’s key emotional elements, the lush classical guitar decorating the landscapes beautifully. 
The atmosphere of the town is at odds with the Vietnam section of the film. That transition of John playing that beautiful piano piece into thundering helicopters is some of the most powerful cinema I’ve ever seen. Unlike their home town, Vietnam is a hell hole of death for all involved. These young men are hurdled into it, their experiences are all different yet they are unified in that they come out of that war completely changed. The awkwardness of Michael’s return is all too realistic, gone is their shared experience and an integral part of their friendship. 
Undoubtedly the most iconic moment of the film is the Russian Roulette scene. Insanely tense with every watch and terrifyingly well acted. This isn’t actors doing a scene, this is captured soldiers being made play Russian Roulette. The whole game ties the film’s core idea of trauma together. It represents the pot luck of surviving a war, your death will come as either a harsh dose of instant gunfire or as a stark inevitably. 
The Deer Hunter is more than a war film, it’s about people, friendship and community. Cimino deconstructs the American working class life and the experiences of war with fitting restraint and moving film making. A thoroughly perfect film and one of my favourites. Also, possibly the greatest film to receive the Best Picture Oscar.",5.0

"A parental film of sorts to Platoon (which is superior), Deer Hunter shows how war can have a myriad of effects, from on the front lines to being at home, as well.

"Watched on Blu-Ray
Once you take your eyes off the gigantic steel mill, the factory smoke darkening the sky and the industrial noise deafening your ears, then this almost sleepy Clairton, framed by the majestic Alleghany Mountains, somewhere in Pennsylvania, is characterised by an idyllic frugality that is hard to get rid of once you have grown up here. It is not for nothing that Nick (Christopher Walken) says to his friend Michael (Robert De Niro) in one scene that this provincial town means the world to him. A world that cannot actually collapse, so intact does Michael Cimino portray it here. Actually. The carefree existence, however, will soon come to an abrupt end when the two men, together with Steven (John Savage), go to war.
""The Deer Hunter"", which won five Oscars at the time, does not make a big point of using sprawling battle sequences to introduce the events of the war in Vietnam. In fact, a full seventy minutes pass before Michael Cimino confronts his protagonists (and the viewer along with them) with the all-consuming and disintegrating conflagration of the Vietnam War through a hard cut. And it is precisely these seventy minutes that make ""The Deer Hunter"" work in the long run, since Cimino needs this period of time to vividly portray the reality of life for Michael, Nick and others. These Russian Orthodox steelworkers who have known each other all their lives and now, shortly before they say goodbye, are once again allowed to pretend at a big wedding that tomorrow doesn't exist. As if nothing would ever change.
But it is unmistakable that a melancholy veil hangs over these first seventy minutes, attaching a sense of finality to all these impressions of exuberance captured in great detail. ""The Deer Hunter"" describes the end of normality; the end of all thoughtless abandon; the end of life. In Vietnam, the three men end up in a Vietcong prison camp where the guards pass their time by pitting North Vietnamese and American inmates against each other in a game of Russian roulette. What has often been harshly criticised is not only the exact metaphor of the senselessness, arbitrariness and cruelty of war, but nevertheless underlines the fact that Michael Cimino is not interested in taking a look at the big picture, but in depicting the perception of our main characters in the form of a meticulously arranged first-person concentration.
The accusation that ""The Deer Hunter"" affirms a one-dimensional image of the Vietnamese is understandable, but it ignores how pointedly Michael Cimino looks at and elaborates the consequences of the war. That is why in this unforgettable sequence, when Michael and Nick have to hold a drum revolver to their temples for the first time, there is only archaic emotion, no reflection, no understanding, no differentiation, only the merciless sweeping out of a psychological devastation inside these two characters. While Michael and Steven make it back home, Michael disoriented, Steven without legs in a war casualty sanatorium, Nick remains in Saigon - for him the city that once meant the world to him no longer exists. Instead, he indulges his death wish, makes a name for himself in Russian roulette gambling, simply says no to life.
The time when Michael is back in Clairton and realises every minute that he never actually returned from Vietnam proves particularly oppressive and stifling. There was no homecoming, no moving on, only an uprooting of all that was once human in him and has now become almost lifeless. Michael, Nick and Steven were cleared out in Vietnam, burnt out, destroyed, condemned to be waste products of war whose physical wounds certainly hurt, but the real horror lies buried beneath the surface. ""The Deer Hunter"" really bites into this landscape of rubble that makes up the emotional world of the three friends today and thus reveals a film about the longing for death, powerlessness, the miserable death itself and the impossibility of finding one's way back into life.
A more adequate cross-section through the society of a nation slowly vegetating away will be sought in vain for a long time. ""The Deer Hunter"" is an inside view of a dead country, because it not only deals with the suffering of the veterans, but also with the suffering that is inflicted on friends, partners, relatives and the entire social environment: It is not for nothing that the American flag is only allowed to fly when it is flanked by countless body bags. When at the end, after Michael has set off once more to Saigon to save his old friend Nick - or what is left of him - God Bless America is sung in small circles, there is nothing hymnal, nothing pathetic about it. It is only an attempt to give each other comfort, although everyone is aware that they are only indulging in bitter illusions.",5.0

"“I feel a lot of distance and I feel far away.”
The Deer Hunter is a intense story about the experience of three men in Vietnam and the aftermath of what they endured.
It starts off with a wedding scene which last way too long. It takes up roughly the first 40 or so minutes and is only tolerable because of the film’s great dialogue. In that time it introduces you to the characters but doesn’t build on them at all. It also doesn’t make them that unique as I kept forgetting them and their relationships due to how crowded the first part is. 
After that, the three men are drafted and the film picks up in pace a lot and becomes much more interesting to watch.
It’s a brutal portrayal of the disturbing things American soldiers went through, such as being trapped in cages and scenes of being forced to play Russian roulette. It’s quite harrowing to watch and the psychological trauma it leaves on them is shown very well, making for an intense last hour.
Robert DeNiro is great and overshadows every other cast member, including the big names like Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and John Cazale. He brought a lot of rage to his role, but also a lot of heart and was very watchable throughout.
I was disappointed that it wasn’t as good as I hoped it would be, but it’s still got some great moments that make it worth checking out.",4.0

"A merced de una bala
En El Cazador, Cimino nos muestra una realidad seca de lo que fue la guerra de Vietnam. Un grupo de amigos que se enfrentan a la guerra de tú a tú sin saber que los cambiará para siempre. Volver a Saigon con ellos ha sido como volver al infierno del que nunca salí desde su primer visionado.
Es que la obra de Cimino no nos muestra la guerra, Cimino nos da la realidad, el enfrentamiento al mundo después de vivir la barbarie y el dolor, no sólo tuyo, sino el de tus amigos de toda la vida, trastornados por la guerra.
El protagonista (De Niro) no quiere más que seguir su vida de antes, su trabajo en la fundición, la caza y las cervezas con amigos. El problema es que nada es igual, la gente es diferente y hay amigos que no son los mismos, nadie es el mismo y ahí Cimino destaca por la gran definición psicológica de los personajes.
Nunca volví de Vietnam, Christopher Walken tampoco volvió nunca, se quedó encerrado en su propia jaula a merced de un revólver y una bala que le hiciesen sentir algo. No creo que nadie vuelva de Vietnam al ver la película, por eso nos invade una desolación inaudita al volver a Pennsylvania, demasiadas cosas se quedan en el camino.",5.0

Ultimately about friendship, loyalty, repressed feelings, trauma and of course war and what it can do to small towns and ordinary lives. You really felt like you went on a journey. The last scene was incredibly touching and very moving without a word being said.

"Review In A Nutshell:
Attempting to capture a more contemporary experience of post-war trauma, almost in the same vein as The Best Years of Our Lives, Michael Cimino has structured such themes within a sprawling Godfather-esque narrative. The Deer Hunter’s reach is ambitious and such an attempt did elevate the drama to a level that justified the pathway of such a story. My issue lies, instead, on Cimino’s storytelling, where the drama feels far too dormant for it to emotionally excite me. While it manages to be thoughtful in places, my emotional engagement was placid, perhaps too much for its own good.",3.0
"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter follows a group of friends that sign up for the Vietnam war, yet upon their return, mental instability takes hold. First and foremost, I want this review to be different to all the other five stars, and bring up some ""new"" and less obvious points. The main one in my eyes, is that of this film being of the war genre to which I disagree immensely. Although this film holds context of the Vietnam war, this is very secondary to the actual events that follow. This is namely of the Russian Roulette, which in my opinion is the turning point of the whole narrative. My personal view toward this scene is of content against context, as the event happened because of it's era; but one could argue that the characters mental decay had spurred from the act of playing this game in itself. The Deer Hunter is not a war film, and if you are to watch this with that expectation, you will be disappointed.
As for the plot setup, Cimino made the decision to split it up into three separate pieces (Home, Vietnam, Home). Normally, I find that in taking this approach it moves away from having character development; but in this case, I am glad to be wrong. The first part is very much the introduction toward the characters, spread over an hour. Although this sounds like a long time, you'll be surprised; and after watching the film, to feel an overwhelming sense of relatability is impressive to say the least. Leading on to the second chapter, it is very much focused on the events that change the characters future; being their time in the Vietnam war. Their are a multitude of stories surrounding the catastrophic events that took place, but in my opinion, Hollywood had ever done it justice, until I watched this. The main aspect is that of Russian Roulette, which on it's own is horrifying; but to see the ""game"" unfold on the two main protagonists, makes it one of the most brutal scenes of all time. As I watched this, I found that not only was I taken by the acting, but also that this was contextually real; and it is an impossible situation to imagine. Finally, we have the descent into madness when back home from the war. There is little to say about this part, as it simply gives us answers to questions about earlier subject matter. Although this was in no way as good as the rest of the film, it led to an almost perfect ending, where the mixture between empowerment and depression takes hold of you (as the spectator).
Moving over to performances, there is an unbelievable amount of greatness. Robert De Niro, as the focal point of the film (Michael) he deserves absolutely all of the praise in which he has previously recieved. Alongside this, I also feel that he should have won the Academy Award for this film, as it is still one of the most beloved films of all time, and rightly so. Not only was his character defined, but he was also the instigator for the emotion behind The Deer Hunter, due to his relationship with Christopher Walken's Nick. Speaking of Walken, I do not believe that I can explain how good he was in this film. Despite his acting being similar to all his other roles, the character of Nick held so much depth and emotion, that it is almost impossible to critique upon. Much like De Niro, I found myself invested toward him; and the journey in which he progresses upon is very demanding of any actor/actress. John Savage played the third and final ""veteran"" of The Deer Hunter, who also did a tremendous job in his role. I feel that he had a hard time on set, given he has to work against two legends of the business; but with that being said, he is certainly not as hard hitting as the others. Despite Savage's character coming out the worst, I felt very distant from him which ultimately led to very little response from me. This disheartens me, as he could of easily had the same impact on me, yet fell slightly below par. Despite what I have already stated, his performance when in Vietnam is incredible; due to the concept of PTSD making it's way through. Therefore, when he is back in America I felt disappointed; as he seemed to waste away into nothingness. On the otherside of The Deer Hunter, is the role that women play in the film. This is mainly seen by Meryl Streep's Linda, who acts as the love interest for both Michael and Nick. What seems to be her main characteristic, is that she is the single reason for Michael's return home, as he wishes to pursue her. In doing this, it complicates the relationship between himself and Nick, and ultimately leads to Michael returning to Vietnam to get Nick. As for the rest of the ensemble, it is great, but nothing in comparison to people already spoke of. John Cazale is the only other actor in need of mentioning, but his role is (in proportion) a lot lesser than the rest.
The Deer Hunter has rapidly made it's way upon my list of must watch films, and despite it being three hours long, the time flies unbelievably quick. If you are yet to watch this film, I would buy it as soon as possible. This film has bits of almost every genre, and unlike other attempts, it does it extremely well.",4.5
"A film that looks at the before, during, and after of Vietnam and examines the psychological damage of that war with the striking and horrific metaphor of a game of Russian roulette.
I didn't want to be the ten thousandth person to comment on the film's insane pacing, but in talking about this film and how strong acts 2 and 3 are, it's inevitable and necessary. The film is split roughly into thirds. Before, during, and after. Acts 2 and 3 move fast, dig into the material, give us a harrowing and difficult tale told by some incredible actors, and is paced beautifully. But Act 1 is confounding.
Of the first hour, 51 minutes is spent on a single wedding scene. Michael Cimino lied to the studio when pitching the film and told everyone it would be about 20 minutes long, and then made almost an hour of the film this one scene. The problem here though, isn't the actual decision to play the material to this length, it's the utilization of that time. If the fifty-minute wedding dug into the characters and let us get to really know them intimately, and show us the before picture clearly, while setting up the themes of the film, it would have been a lovely and poignant beginning. But that's really not what happens. There are 2-3 minutes segments here and there that do this (such as their interaction with the soldier) and the scenes bookending the wedding that show us the camaraderie and personalities of the group, but for the most part, it's really JUST a wedding.
And the issue in giving a film an hour long first act that doesn't properly set up the story, is that it delays the connections we feel to the characters, and puts the burden of set up in the middle of the film with the second act. Thankfully, the absolutely nightmarish second act does so, and our three leads give some breathtaking performances. That said, I think more of the film's runtime was spent on the wedding than on actual Vietnam.
Then we have the after-effects of this war. Our three are scattered by this ghastly war. DeNiro returns home. Savage recuperates in a hospital. And Walken finds himself unable to escape what he has been through. And it's Walken's performance that really drives the entire film and brings all the themes crashing home. He gives one of the great performances of all time and the subtle anguish, the haunting look in his eyes, the absence are spellbinding, heartbreaking.
By the end of the film, you could ALMOST forget about that first act, and it looks like most people have. The film has a perfect last twenty minutes. The climax is the sort you anticipate because it is absolutely the only way the film could end. That's not a knock on it but a compliment, as the film found the only way it could end and executed it to perfection. And the audience, by associating with the characters could see where their paths were heading.
Overall, a great film dragged down. The roulette metaphor may not be literally accurate, but it is emotionally on point and encapsulates the experience of war in a simple, disturbed, and affecting way.",4.0

"My dad was all of 19 when he enlisted in the army and was subsequently shipped off to Vietnam. In my entire life, he's never wanted to speak on his time there, beyond an occasional understanding of why he never liked when I had lizards or snakes as pets (he confessed he could feel the snakes under him when he slept in the jungle). In the last few years, as he's entered his 70's and had some health scares, he's slowly started reaching out to Vietnam veteran groups and being more open to acknowledging the war and trading stories with them. So it was a shock when, on a recent trip home to visit my parents, as we were discussing his father's WWII memorabilia from his own time in the military, he suddenly segued into his own Army service, simply saying ""My father looked at me differently after I came home..."". He then just spoke for almost 30 minutes about his years in the Army, jumping around in time, and I could even tell by my mother's body language that she was not aware of some of this.
Amidst this discussion, the topic of films came up and he mentioned that The Deer Hunter was the closest he's ever seen in a movie to what it was actually like, and I immediately regretted having never seen it, as I could not ask any follow-up questions as to what about it rang true to him. You have to understand, this is a guy who spent almost 30 years as a cop, and would always call out film and TV for being unrealistic in their portrayal (except for The Wire - he was the reason I started watching, because of how much he proclaimed it), so for him to say that about a Vietnam film gave it a lot of cache in my mind.
As I watched for the first time last night, I went into it trying to figure what he related to. Like the characters, he came from a blue-collar suburb of a major PA city (Croydon to Philly instead of Clairton to Pittsburgh). Like the characters, he actually enlisted and was NOT drafted (something I was perhaps most shocked at - and that he re-upped for a second tour). He was never a POW, so I don't imagine some of the most famous and visceral second-act scenes had any relevance, so I'm left imagining it was simply the chaos - of the patrols, of the hospitals, of the city life. Perhaps it was his being injured, and reacting to it the same way DeNiro's character does any time he's asked about being shot (my dad's was shrapnel from a trip wire explosion, but still). I certainly hope it wasn't seeing stories from his friends there being mirrored in the film. I've become too used to not bringing it up that I'm unsure if I will ask, but when we have phone calls, we inevitably discuss what we've been watching lately, so perhaps I can mention in passing and see if he wants to talk.

Brilliant early performance from Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro. I had no idea how adorable Christopher Walken was! The Russian roulette scenes will stay with me forever!

"There’s so much that happens in this film, it’s hard to describe it accurately. More than anything, it’s a sobering narrative about a man and his close friends over the course of time, and how the ongoing Vietnam war impacts their lives. There’s a detailed look at life before Michael, Nik and Steve leave for the war. Despite some underlying darkness, things appear upbeat, which is sharply contrasted by the dark days in Vietnam, and of course what Michael returns home to.
This is considered a war movie, but Vietnam takes up less screen time than I initially expected. Really, it’s more of a focus on how war impacts people. Michael, Nik and Steve lost a lot and suffered greatly due to their time in combat, though it’s also shown just how much everyone back home suffered as well. Watching Linda cope with the absence of Nik is incredibly powerful, occupying many standout sequences. I also really loved the hunting scenes, notable for how oddly peaceful they are. Conversely, the initial Russian Roulette incident is one of the most harrowing things I’ve ever watched. The subsequent trauma the men endure shows just how much the war has broken them. At its core, this is a brutally tragic film. It feels so real, and excellently covers the human aspect of conflict.
The cast is stellar. Robert De Niro is incredible as Michael, with one of the more emotional performances I’ve ever seen from him. Meryl Streep is also amazing. Her dynamic performance gives a lot of heart to the terrible reality that Linda faces. Christopher Walken, John Savage and John Cazale are also fantastic standouts, this of course sadly being Cazale’s last film. I love the cinematography and gentle soundtrack. This movie utilizes contrast in such a beautifully tragic way. The Deer Hunter is horrifying at points, brutally emotionally yet simply so moving. The ending scene is arguably the most powerful. It’s a great film, and one of the most honest depictions of regular people facing terrible events.",4.5

"“I guess I’m thinking about the deer. Going to Nam. I like the trees, you know? I like the way the trees are in the mountains. It’s all different. The way the trees are. “
""The Deer Hunter"" is a powerful, emotionally intense portrayal of friendship, survival, and the haunting impacts of war. Michael Cimino crafts a gripping narrative, showcasing the psychological toll of the Vietnam War, the film delves deep into themes of trauma, loyalty, and the struggle to find meaning after the war. Its raw authenticity and poignant storytelling make it an unforgettable cinematic experience.

"One of the most heartbreakingly beautiful films ever made, The Deer Hunter doesn’t announce its intentions loudly, but rather allows them to form with the ambling spontaneity of real life. The cumulative effect is one of a romantic devastation. Recently I’ve been thinking about films of this magnitude, made during a better time for filmmaking, when movies could be searching, vulgar, casually barbaric, hotly sexual, spiritually enveloping, photographically marvelous, of a scale that matches their ambitions and stewarded by a master of form with something to say that’s worth saying. If released now, critics would have a conniption. What business have we inherited of such tragedy? The feelings and conflicts stirred by this movie could only be financed in Europe now. America just seems like utter toast.",5.0

"Il più grande successo di Michael Cimino consiste in un film che ricorre alla guerra del Vietnam (condensata nell'emblematica sequenza della roulette russa, perfetta nel rappresentare il terrore dell'attesa di una morte possibile) per mettere in scena l'alienazione della classe operaia e dell'America tutta. Particolarmente audace e significativo risulta in tal senso l'accostamento di Clairton a Saigon (separate da un unico taglio di montaggio e accomunate dall'infernale presenza del fuoco), a cui è contrapposta l'amenità della montagna, luogo mitico e primordiale della frontiera americana, dove è ancora possibile affermare la propria superiorità nel rispetto di un'etica ormai consegnata definitivamente alla retorica. Regia monumentale. Cast impeccabile. Un capolavoro senza tempo.",4.0
"REVIEW PUBLISHED ON MAY 15, 2023
ORIGINALLY RATED 9/10, THEN LOWERED TO 8/10
Look... there's a reason for why I've taken so ridiculously long to review this, even without so much as rewatching it. In short, I wanted to write a longer, much more detailed review for my Boards of Cinema blog, where I'd really go into depth about the characters and story. Then I kinda got stuck writing that, and never returned to it. Oh well.
Nevertheless, this film undeniably left an impression on me, so like I've been doing lately for other movies I've seen, I'll share my thoughts in a more condensed way:
As Vietnam War movies go, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is undeniably the most extravagantly-crafted one I've seen (and, all things considered, just the best Vietnam movie without question), Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket the most coldly austere, but The Deer Hunter emotionally affected me more than both. One's emotional response to art is incredibly subjective, of course, but this movie just shook me so powerfully, it's difficult to think of any other experience like it.
In terms of its filmmaking craft, The Deer Hunter absolutely lacks Apocalypse Now's smooth polish, but... in a good way? To me, this rougher-around-the-edges feel actually benefits the story quite well, while still allowing for pretty great cinematography throughout. Even while the image looks much dirtier than anything Coppola put to screen, it's no less beautiful to watch. Love the theme song as well.
The Deer Hunter is, by definition, a ""war movie"" since Vietnam is at the story's heart, but that's far from this story's central focus. Functioning more as a deeply wounded portrait of post-war trauma and fractured friendships, the movie's generally slow, but so quietly gut-wrenching.
Really, in terms of The Deer Hunter's unhurried pacing, my only issue lies with the needlessly drawn-out first hour (even after all this time, I clearly remember saying ""We're still at this wedding?"" out loud after a certain point), even if it is necessary to establish the characters' personalities, relationships, and doomed ambitions. After giving it enough thought, this does still bring my rating down a point (as said above, from 9/10 to 8/10), but so much else of The Deer Hunter refuses to leave my memory, I can't say it's anything less than great.",4.0
"Oh wow. I was not expecting this film to be as gut wrenching as it was. In all honesty, I expected a 3 hour snooze fest but The Deer Hunter is a fantastically paced, emotional, anxiety inducing, and absolutely tragic. 
Beautifully split into three equally interesting acts, the film is able to capture multiple emotions with intense depth — happiness and grief. The seemingly never ending wedding scene sets the stage of pure, uninterrupted joy that is soon to be…",4.5

"Powerful, Sad and truely brilliant.
The Deer Hunter is a film that follows three close friends and their experience of the Vietnam war from before, during and after. The result is a beautiful and tragic story that will have you grieving by the end.
The acting here is beyond Oscar worthy, Christopher Walken conveys such emotion in a way I’ve never seen before, it felt real and shook me to my core at moments. Robert De Niro does such a brilliant job at feeling without showing, every moment with him in the second half of the film had me on the verge of tears even in a mundane scene at a grocery store.
The writing is good, using a three act story structure the introduction and first hour does a brilliant job at creating an emotional attachment to the character then the second act portrays the Vietnam war in such a brutally realistic way that I’ve not seen from a Vietnam film before. Finally the third act revolves around the mental aftermath of the horrific events the characters faced.
The stand out and most famous scene from this film is the ‘Gun Roulette’ scene, and it deserves all the recognition it’s got. This scene is so incredibly intense and overwhelming with emotions and laminated with superb acting, it’s something I’ve never experienced from a film before.
The climax had me in puddles of tears, something that hasn’t happened since Avengers Endgame, that film broke me.
My only gripe with the film is it’s editing, I feel too little was left in the cutting room floor and certain things definitely should have been cut, for example the 50 minute wedding scene that takes up an entire third of the film.
It’s superb, bring a box of tissues.",4.5
"The visuals and performances are extremely beautiful, and stretches of it are emotional/intense, but it sorely lacks the depth that would justify it’s occasionally glacial pace and immense runtime. Running closer to two hours, The Deer Hunter would be a solid but shallow war picture with very admirable qualities. At three hours, its occasionally solid, occasionally dull and largely underwhelming, but at least it’s a pleasure to look at. Respectable craftsmanship and acting save this from its very problematic script. 6/10 ",3.0

"Five stars alone for that hard cut from the soft piano tune with the central group at the height of their joyful, careless comradery to the heat of an unrelentingly brutal Vietnam War sequence. After spending the first hour defining every aspect of the locations and people each character calls home through drunken nights out, games of pool, inconclusive yelling matches, dances, celebrations, weddings and road trips, the 2 hours following that cut see it all stripped to the bone and painstakingly recovered from. Every performance in this trudges through an entire flurry of emotions and is among the best ever. Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep, especially Christopher Walken (holy shit), but seriously everybody. 3 hours of some of the most purely and naturally human moments ever depicted on film.",5.0

Axel, played by the non-actor, real-life steel worker Chuck Aspegren, was the most gorgeous guy in this movie. De Niro isn’t bad either.
I’m not sure this hit all the beats for me and the three-hour runtime was felt, but the high points were moving. The piano. Meryl and John. Mike’s return to Saigon—my uncle, who passed earlier this year, was a Vietnamese refugee, orphaned by the war, evacuated as the city fell. Hard not to think of him watching those scenes.

"My one big gripe about this movie is the pace, particularly in the first act. The longer you buckle in for 'The Deer Hunter' the more it seems Cimino was simply setting up for a patient second and third act.

That's all I have to say about that.
Amen for the performances here. De Niro, Walken, and Streep were on another level, but all parts contributed to the bigger picture. And those roulette games were shot masterfully. What iconic film right there.
Again I have to say this is part of a deeper Vietnam study for me. If anyone wants to talk about Ken Burns' docu-series, or the Vietnam war films of old, hit me up because I'd love to talk suggestions and studies.",4.5

"A surprisingly easy watch for a 3 hour movie about PTSD, The Deer Hunter is a great film that suffers from a profound lack of focus. The cast is spectacular, with De Niro and Streep delivering incredible performances, though it’s Walken who truly shines. The script is solid, and the film and its themes do feel truly fleshed out. Thematically, this is an excellent dive into the way many veterans feel detached and isolated once they return home, and the toll that war takes on the psyche. However, the commitment to making an “apolitical” film about the Vietnam war ends up making the film feel both uncertain of what it’s trying to say, and very much political. There are times when this comes across as straight right-wing propaganda, portraying the VC as cruel murderers who will kill anyone for their own sick amusement. Cimino tries to have his war both ways: making a film where the actual war isn’t important, while also setting a third of his film in the midst of it, which just doesn’t work. Still, this is a must-see.",4.0

"Michael Cimono’s multi-Oscar-winning powerful drama in which three close friends plan their final hunting trip before they leave for service in Vietnam. Starring Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep.
Out of all the movies which were made in the year of this release, this film from director Michael Cimono is arguably the most disturbing of the lot.
Set in 1968, the story concerns Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage), three enduring pals from a working-class Pennsylvania fortify town, who get ready to vessel out of the country following Steven's extravagant special day and one last gang hunting voyage.
In Vietnam, their imaginings of armed admiration are rapidly thrown into turmoil by the cruelties of conflict; even those who endure are troubled by the involvement, as is Nick’s birthplace darling, Linda (Meryl Streep).
Robert De Niro and John Savage both give very good performances in their respective roles as Michael and Steven, two of the men involved whose dreams are shattered by battle. They both suit their roles well.
Elsewhere, there are solid supporting performances to be had from Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep in their respective roles as Nick and Linda. Nick is the other man involved and is the most supportive of the trio, while Linda is the woman who Nick marries but she is unable to put Vietnam out of her mind.
The direction from Cimono is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a mixed atmosphere happening as well and the script is written to a decent standard by Deric Washburn as he makes the movie good to follow.
The camera, editing and sound stand out best in terms of the technical aspects, because the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status; the film is edited to an excellent effect; the sound is brilliant as you have to listen carefully.
The movie managed to win 5 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Cimono), Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken), Best Sound Mixing (Richard Portman, William L. McCaughey, Aaron Rochin and C. Darin Knight) and Best Film Editing (Peter Zinner). The Supporting Actor and technical wins were deserved, but I don’t consider this to be the best film from this year.
The Academy also nominated the film for Best Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Supporting Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography (Vilmos Zsigmond).
At the British Academy Film Awards, the movie won the prizes for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, while it also was up for Best Film, Best Director (Michael Cimono), Best Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken), Best Screenplay (Deric Washburn) and Best Sound.
Michael Cimono did win the Golden Globe for Best Director, while the Hollywood Foreign Press Association also nominated The Deer Hunter for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actor – Drama (Robert De Niro), Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken), Best Supporting Actress (Meryl Streep) and Best Screenplay (Deric Washburn).
I mentioned that The Deer Hunter is, for me, not the best film from this year and the reason I say this is because I do believe the pace can be slow at times, so I don’t think the movie needed to be 183 minutes long.
Also, some of the violence can be very disturbing in places, most notably perhaps with the scene involving a deer, but it is part of the story, so it has to be included, otherwise I would be talking about a completely different movie.
Overall, it isn’t my personal favourite from this year and can be uncomfortable and disturbing on occasions, along with a sometimes-slow pace and long duration, but The Deer Hunter is still very decent nonetheless, due to the excellent performances from Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, along with the direction, script, mixed atmosphere and technical aspects.",4.0
"Problematic, but undeniably emotionally effective. Side note: I live near enough to Clairton to have a mailing address that's technically for there, and was born in Glassport (which is slightly more ethnically similar to the depiction in this movie), and am convinced Cimino picked the location semi-arbitrarily, as none of this movie seems to have been filmed there and it doesn't really capture its reality at all.",4.0
"The Deer Hunter follows three friends before, during and after the war on Vietnam. But this is not a film about the war itself, rather a study of what war does to a person.
The first third of the movie shows us the whole town coming together to celebrate Steven marriage and his and his two best friends, Nick and Mike, departure to the Vietnam war. They're young adults full of life, joy, hopes and dreams for the future. They have a glamourized, naive perception of war. A soldier enters the bar at some point and he's serious, cold and hollow and the guys laugh at him, they just don't understand at the time what the war will also turn them into.
The second third is the war itself. We don't get to watch much fighting, but instead the events that are more disturbing to them and also to us. The russian roulette scenes are very disturbing and nerve wrecking. The acting and the directing are so good that I caught myself clenching my teeth. Also, we start to notice each of every guy's features enhanced like Mike's leadership and mental toughness in opposition to Steven's innocence and sweetness.
Finally, the third part shows us how the past events changed and affected the three friends and their families and friends too. The final moments are especially heartbreaking.
I have to say again that the acting was so great the whole movie is worthwhile just because of that. Walker and De Niro are just amazing. The great script helps too just like the beautiful shots and music.",4.5

"Michael Ciminos ""Deer Hunter"" ist eine düster, äußerst intensive Geschichte über die Wirkung des Kriegs auf Menschen. Grob in drei Teile unterteilt sehen wir unsere Figuren erst vor, dann während und nach dem Krieg. Ihre Entwicklung und die Gebrochenheit, die aus seelischem und körperlichem Leiden erwächst wird auf Ehrfurcht gebietende Weise an die Zuschauer weitergegeben. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale und Meryl Streep bilden einen der besten Casts aller Zeiten.
In russischem Roulette dürfte man die perfekte Metapher für Willkür und Sinnlosigkeit des Krieges gefunden haben. Wenn die Darsteller die Waffe auf ihren eigenen Kopf richten, dann sind wir angespannt als wäre es unser eigener. All dies rührt auch von der großen Mengen Schweiß, Blut und Tränen, die in den Film geflossen sind her. Von echten Geschenken bei der Hochzeitsszene bis hin zu Stunts, die Robert De Niro fünfzehn mal in einen Flüß stürzen ließen, zieht sich eine Ader von zornigem Realismus. Gerade Cazales bevorstehender Tod durch Krebs wirft seinen Schatten voraus und lässt den Film ein grimmiges Testament der menschlichen Grausamkeit werden.

As the film goes on, I realised it's less about the war itself but the effects it had on the people involved which I think worked really well.

"After enduring the bullshit that is Hacksaw Ridge earlier this week, watching The Deer Hunter on the big screen was desperately needed. Cimino's film understands war better than any other film I've ever seen (yes, including Apocalypse Now ).
It expresses that understanding by focusing on the effect of war on intimate, interpersonal relationships. It does not need sequences of real battle in order to convey the experiences of war. For a three hour film about war, the film spends remarkably little time focusing on actual war scenes. It devotes no more than 40 minutes to scenes within the war. Cimino understands that the emotional resonance of war does not come from watching battle sequences, but from the effect of that war on the people and their relationships
All films are political statements about the world they exist within and war films are particularly effected by this. All movies that are not condemning of war are propaganda. The Deer Hunter is a devastating portrait of war and its disregard for human life.

Die drei Freunde Michael, Nick und Steven führen ein glückliches Leben, bis sie sich freiwillig für den Vietnamkrieg melden. Erst in Kriegsgefangenschaft treffen sie sich wieder. In einer gefährlichen Rettungsaktion können sie sich befreien und verlieren sich doch wieder aus den Augen. Getrennt voneinander versuchen sie, die seelischen und körperlichen Schmerzen des Krieges zu verarbeiten.
Der Film teilt sich sehr leicht in drei Akten auf. In der ersten Stunde lernen wir eigentlich nur die gesamten Charaktere kennen und sehen sie im normalen Leben zu. Sei es auf einer Hochzeit oder in den Bergen, man bekommt ein gutes Gespür für die jeweiligen Figuren. Danach im zweiten Akt, geht es rein in das Kriegsgebiet. Dort bekommt man ein sehr stark inszeniertes Bild geboten, was einem schon getroffen hat. Da hat man schon richtig mit den jeweiligen Figuren gelitten und bekamen auch einige harte Szenen geboten.
Nach dem Krieg geht es wieder in den ""Alltag"", was schon sehr erschüttert war mitanzusehen. Hier ein großes Lob an die Schauspieler. Robert de Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep (wahrscheinlich beste Performance von ihr, was ich gesehen habe) und sonst der restliche Cast waren brilliant.

"One of those films that makes you feel sad to be honest. We already knew that the Vietnam War was absolute bullshit. Over 50k Americans died for monetary gain. ""The Deer Hunter"" understatedly shows the mundaneness of working class life. Only to slap you in the face with the war flash-forwards. Mike (Robert De Niro) and his friends leave to Vietnam. Before hand, Steve (John Savage) is getting married and there an hour sequence of them going through the ceremony. This is where the stillness arrives. The entire sequence tries to show all angles of the characters. But, it also operates a real-time longing effect. It brings down the film a bit.
Then, the Vietnam sections start with a bang. Literally. I shit you not. It gets pretty scary. You have a bunch of Vietnamese people playing Russian roulette with our American sweethearts. And from there, the humanization of the effect of war starts to flow within our minds. ""The Deer Hunter's"" second half is much real to me than the first half. Especially towards the end where you get to see De Niro break. I think it hits for me after Mike comes home. Walken's storyline is also tragic and represents the real effects of PTSD. Will I ever see this again? Naw. I'm glad I saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse.",4.0
"Performances are superb, specially Walken really shined in this one.
The movie isn't pro-war, it shares a message on American masculinity, friendship. It plays on certain stereotypes, to create the tension and I do feel the runtime could've been a bit shorter.",3.5
"The most remarkable thing about The Deer Hunter is perhaps its unremarkable showcase of the American centre. The first hour in fact sits us in the middle of small-town festivities; bar hijinks after a day at the steel mill, a marriage ceremony with an entire town in attendance, or a hunting trip in the American wilderness. This, before abruptly throwing us straight into the mouth of madness. Here, war is hell and other adages present themselves. The plain brutality of war is a stark contrast to the menial peace of Americana. It's here that Michael Cimino first introduces the motif of the roulette, which he calls back to twice after. Once in Saigon where Mike and Nick who had lost each other, find each other revisiting their trauma and turning it into opportunity in a dingy black site betting house. The other, at the end of the film, where the confrontation between Mike and Nick comes to a boiling pitch, and they once again gamble with their lives. In a bid to save each other, the brotherly love between these two men are confronted, twisted, and destroyed, and so are they. The Russian roulette becomes an interesting motif and perhaps the only other thing that's accomplished about the film other than its showcase on male bravado and male bonding. That life is a game of chance, and that the fate of these men who are subsumed by the American myth had been decided on by the whims of a bullet. The casting of De Niro as the tortured Michael is an extension of the tortured male psyche that he's portrayed since Travis Bickle. His refusal to remove the uniform even after surviving the war represents his inability to rejoin society and the feeling that he's lost his place in it. The moral and spiritual degradation of the true working class, who were consumed by the war machine, and who once believed in the American Dream who now believe in nothing is the tragedy of their time. While we weren't looking, society caved in on itself.",3.0

"A film that shocked 70's audiences who weren't prepared for the realities of the seedy underbelly of professional Russian Roulette in Saigon. Long adored and revered as Russia's favorite national pastime many considered the sport a great way to get in some physical activity, improve dexterity, wear a stylish red head wrap, and increase mental health due to it being quite a social activity where u meet new people and have Vietnamese stereotypes yell at you. Of course what no one talks about is the negative aspects of the sport such as risk of failure, losing your will to live and ultimately not living due to blowing your frickin' brains out. Now for some context, when your other option is to live out your life in Clairton, Pennsylvania the side effects of Russian Roulette likely appear not so bad. Overall this film gets all the stars for an amazing cast, outstanding performances, beautiful locations filmed, and a riveting authentic feeling story that never feels impeded by the run time.

Easily could have been a masterpiece  but why is there a 45 minute wedding? Don’t say it was to set up the characters because it doesn’t at all.,3.5
"Ok it clicked, I loved this more second time round.
It’s truly disturbing and compelling, and despite its length, does not at all waste a minute. By the end you really come to see how each and every single scene and moment adds to the experience. Performances are amazing as you’d expect from such a great cast, I really like the score too. Such a great and haunting portrayal of the trauma that affected those who fought in Vietnam.
There’s barely even any actual WAR in the movie, very little violence. But I mean the violence was never what made these movies so good. But here, the fact that it BARELY relies on the shock of violence and still is able to be so stressful and heart rending is a accomplishment like no other. The slow building pace, and the film’s care for investing the audience in its characters is what really makes the more gritty stuff get to you. 
Up there with Apocalypse Now for best war movie ever. It’s very different to what most would expect from this genre, and maybe it’s what might turn people off from it, but for me it’s just as memorable and effective.",5.0

"Watched with my parents on VOD.
I only brought it up as one of many movies starring Meryl Streep that I would like to see and had never seen. As soon as my dad began sharing his recollections of The Deer Hunter, his voice was halted with emotion. Generally, my mom prefers to avoid sad movies, but she remembered this as being great, even if it was sad. And boy howdy, was it ever sad. It was, in fact, a lot of things: it had feeling of rich, precise detail about a very normal and natural existence, like looking through a window at a piece of American culture long since passed. It was hard to imagine how it had gotten made with the structure that it had, with the sheer amount of time that was devoted to the wedding. These characters aren't handed acts of bravado that redeem or ennoble them. It's not a movie about misery — it just depicts everyday life with such a natural, easygoing grace that the inherent misery isn't (as it usually is) disguised or whitewashed in any way. Meryl Streep was indeed wonderful in the film, and what's wonderful about her is precisely her contribution to this exact dynamic: you don't wonder what any particular thing she does means in some grander sense, but everything she does conveys to you a sense that you are looking at a real person caught in a moment of transparency, when there was no camera to capture it. The film's depiction of the normalcy that the protagonists proceed to lose in Vietnam isn't particularly romanticized or prettied up, which makes the devastating nature of the loss that much starker and heavier. By the time it was over, I was weeping too.
According to Peter Biskind's history of this film and Coming Home, there were protesters outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion the night of the Oscars. Most of the demonstrators were from Vietnam Vets Against the War. Some of the signs said, ""no Oscars for racism,"" while others said ""The Deer Hunter—a bloody lie."" There was a clash with the police and thirteen people were arrested. Biskind points out that this movie did what Coming Home was too virtuous to do, namely, take shortcuts with The Truth About The War: e.g., depict the war with Thai actors playing Vietnamese soldiers and Thailand locations playing Vietnam. (The attempted rescue by helicopter literally takes place on a bridge over the River Kwai.) And it seems strange now, especially when there are so many horrifically vivid memoirs of ordeals that US soldiers endured and perpetrated during Vietnam, that this movie creates something from scratch — the Russian roulette — in order to capture the derangement and chaos of the experience. Those vets who felt that the movie fed into a mythologized depiction of the North Vietnamese as vicious tormentors, reducing them to villains in a movie, may have misunderstood what kind of movie The Deer Hunter was. Forty years later, with the romanticized grandeur of Apocalpyse Now and Platoon in mind, I'm struck by how little of that kind of traditional gratification of heroes and villains this movie provides. Having seen it, I'm not particularly shocked to hear that it got people arrested, or to see that just the memory of the movie can make my father cry.",4.0

"I can't even remotely imagine what it would be like to look at someone I've known for years, watching them crying and weeping uncontrollably as they hold a gun to their head. All around us, there are strange and indistinguishable words being shouted at us by strangers in a place we've never been before. I can't imagine looking into their unblinking eyes in dead silence, in what may be their last few seconds. But most of all, I can't imagine trying to resume a normal, happy life after something like that.
R.I.P. Michael Cimino (1939-2016)",4.5
"If I only had a heart, I would call The Deer Hunter a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I do have a brain, which can't unsee the botched parts that compromise the power of this heartfelt movie.
The Deer Hunter's emotional punch is considerable thanks to amazing performances: an aloof Robert De Niro at his understated best, Christopher Walken in a haunting un-Walken role, Meryl Streep as a person torn between faithfulness and the need for comfort, John Savage's friendly facade covering up a crushed spirit, and John Cazale representing the epitome of nervous overcompensation. These characters live in a Pennsylvania small town, an extraordinarily vivid setting. After 30 minutes, you know the personality of this place as if you reside there: hard-working, patriotic, tightly knit, a stronghold of American values. The remarkable sense of place sets up one of the most shocking bits of editing when the story transitions from the homeland to Vietnam. And Michael Cimino films everything with a heart-wrenching seesaw effect — at times the director seems as distant and meditative as De Niro, and other times he registers as a sympathetic spirit, able to stare at pain in the face. 
This attention to detail stands in obvious contrast to segments that don't hold up after a minute or two of honest reflection. Much has been rightly criticized about the Russian roulette sequences. The first such scene makes sense as an isolated example of torture, even though the particulars may not pass a logic test (why the hell would anyone allow a prisoner to handle a revolver with half of its chambers loaded?). But by the last time you see the deadly game outside of the context of a depraved POW camp, reason would suggest a metaphorical interpretation is the only way to justify the silly premise. 
The bigger fumble is the hunting segments. No one successfully hunts in this absurd manner. You don't run to the deer; such a method would fail after the first step. You may counter: Shouldn't Cimino have artistic license? Of course, but the actual deliberate process of hunting would fit The Deer Hunter's somber mood better than the ridiculous displays that made the final cut. Even worse, having De Niro talk to the second deer, which barely flinches after nearby gunfire, reeks of overwrought stupidity. 
The B-movie roulette and hunting aspects paint The Deer Hunter as a morbid fantasy, when it actually works best as a calculated and sensitive picture. That the movie doesn't lose its potency after these glaring pratfalls speaks to the sincerity at the center of the production. While Cimino almost kills the point of his conflicted vision with a dubious ""God Bless America"" singalong at the end, the actors and the established small-town spirit thankfully sell the moment. The Deer Hunter is thus somewhat deserving of its grand reputation.",3.5
"This is an important work of art that represents the impact of the war on a group of young men, although it hasn’t aged well, because some people say that it’s “racist”.
Everyone should watch this movie once in a while to remember the damages that war causes, so it never happens again.
100% would recommend.",4.0
"Evidently, Michael Cimino just about pioneered the Vietnam War subgenre in making this so soon after the formally defined conflict had ended, and from all appearances, it seems certain that his all too early perspective was hardly ripe for prescience after years upon years of hindsight would catch up with him. Despite it so distinctly placing its focus on the unrecoverable damage inflicted upon working class Americans during and after wartime, it remains a fable of their virtue in the face of a one-note, consistently evil enemy, melancholically patriotic in that Spielbergian way where the voids created between a soldier and his society become worth it when they're for a noble national cause; sad, but allowable, painful, but only to prevent greater pain. Cimino's Viet Cong are violently sociopathic, his Vietnam was a harrowing, but ultimately honourable battle fought, and its needlessness need not be acknowledged. His soldiers' trauma, both physical and mental, comes from their torture by sadistic Viet Cong captors in particular, not the atrocity of war at its base, nor the insidious means by which their government constructed their adversary because they stood something to gain; no, he laments that these men became fodder for the battlefield, but he can't bring himself to judge the ruling class who tilled it, blinded so heavily by the cattle heartlessly eating away that he can't make himself look down at the poor soil directly underneath him. A truly American story if it's ever been told.",3.5
"Oder auf Deutsch DIE DURCH DIE HÖLLE GEHEN. Der Titel bezieht sich sicherlich auch auf die Charaktere im Film, davon ab aber bestimmt auch auf den Zuschauer!
Dabei kann es kaum nur an falschen Erwartungen gelegen haben, dass ich mich nun drei Stunden lang in einem Folterknast währte. Wenigstens eine Stunde nimmt sich THE DEER HUNTER Zeit für seinen Prolog. Dabei wird ein Haufen unsympathischer Typen eingeführt und man darf sie hauptsächlich beim Feiern und Saufen bestaunen. Dannach gibts einen knallharten Schnitt und man hockt mitten in der Hölle von Vietnam. Da gewinnt der Film an Fahrt und wirkt dabei arg gehetzt. Nach geschätzt einer dreiviertel Stunde wars das dann auch schon wieder und man bekommt einen jetzt wieder zähen Epilog von einer weiteren Stunde zurück in Amerika präsentiert.
Dabei fasziniert es zumindest De Niro und der wunderschönen Meryl Streep bei der Arbeit zuzusehen. Umgehauen hat mich aber Christopher Walken! Kaum zu fassen, was der für eine Intensität und einen Wahnsinn der an den Tag gelegt hatte. Richtig stark.
Das reichte mir aber nicht aus, um über die elendig langgezogenen Szenen, zum Anfang und zum Schluss, hinwegzusehen. Zumal ich die Charaktere und Ihr Handeln nicht zusammenbringen und begreifen konnte. Keine Ahnung, ob da irgendetwas wirklich Sinn ergeben hat oder nicht.
Ne tut mir leid, absolut kein Film für mich. Das waren quälende 184 Minuten. 🥵",2.5
"It seems I'm on a roll today with being hugely dissapointed by ridiculously overrated films. Bad pacing is always a killer for me, but this one was just agonising to sit through, as literally nothing happens for an entire hour of a dreadfully boring wedding and annoying drunkenness, until they're suddenly in the middle of Vietnam with nothing bridging the gap. It just makes everything feel superficial and pointless, so not even the Russian Roulette scene - which seems to be the sole reason people think this film is a masterpiece - holds any weight as it isn't riding on the back of anything substantial. Then after that's finished in an underwhelmingingly brisk manner, the rest of the film just seems so aimless, and while that might be what it's trying to convey, it caused me to just lose all interest. Also, the atrocious sound design gave me a headache, so that no doubt played a big part in hampering my enjoyment.
I give this film a C1",2.0
"Es gibt viele Filme, die ich nach der Erstsichtung nicht besonders mochte, aber mit zunehmenden Sichtungen zu schätzen gelernt habe – einige dieser Beispiele gehören heute zu meinen Lieblingsfilmen, wie z.B. „Der Pate“ oder „Chinatown“.
Dann gibt es Filme, die man bei der Erstsichtung besonders mochte, aber mit zunehmender Sichtung immer schwächer werden.
Ein Grund dafür ist definitiv, dass man älter/reifer wird und sich u.a. dadurch die Ansprüche und Interessen ändern.
Allerdings ist „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ für mich aktuell ein echtes Unikat, da ich Ihn bei der Erstsichtung überraschend stark fand (damals hätte ich ihm ungefähr ein Rating von 4/5 gegeben), nach der zweiten Sichtung schwer enttäuschend (3/5 – also nicht mehr als
„ganz gut“.) und nun, nachdem ich ihn zum dritten Mal gesehen habe, meisterhaft!
Zum ersten Mal habe ich von „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ in einer Filmabteilung in einem Müller-Drogeriemarkt gehört, als sich zwei Kunden über „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ unterhalten haben, dass er mit mehreren Oscars, u.a. als „Bester Film“, ausgezeichnet wurde und sie deshalb schwer enttäuscht waren (ich meine, einer der beiden Kunden hat sogar erwähnt, dass er zu den schlechtesten Filmen gehört, die er jemals gesehen hat.), u.a. weil er sich angeblich als (Anti-)Kriegsfilm ausgibt, aber tatsächlich nur sehr wenige Kriegsszenen zeigt und ansonsten extrem langweilig ist.
Eine längere Zeit verging, ich hatte den Filmtitel auch nicht mehr so richtig im Kopf, als ich eine Oscar-Dokumentation geschaut habe, auf der
ein ziemlich cooler „Oscar: Bester Film“-Clip dabei war, der selbstverständlich auch „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ enthalten hat.
U.a. wegen dieser Kassette habe ich mich eine Weile lang für die Oscar-Gewinner der Hauptkategorien interessiert, und eine Weile später habe ich zufällig ein sehr günstiges
DVD-Angebot zu „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ angenommen, um ihn schließlich endlich mal selbst sehen zu können, wodurch ich anschließend überrascht war, dass mir der Film tatsächlich, trotz auffallender Längen, sehr zugesagt hat. Es war zwar damals kein Film, den ich mir öfter ansehen wollte, darum habe ich ihn auch irgendwann wieder verkauft, aber begeistert war ich trotzdem.
Viele Jahre später hatte ich dann plötzlich wieder einen starken Drang, den Film wieder zu sehen. Also habe ich den Film nochmal bestellt, diesmal auf Blu-Ray, gespannt in meinen Player geschmissen, um Ihn kurze Zeit später wieder zu verkaufen, weil ich diesmal so schwer enttäuscht war.
Woran das lag:
Diesmal fand ich die Hochzeitsszene tatsächlich zu lang und unnötig gestreckt – generell fand ich das erste Drittel viel zu lang. Ich hatte mir diesmal tatsächlich gewünscht, der Film würde mehr Kriegsszenen zeigen bzw. länger in Vietnam verweilen.
Der Film konnte mich in keinem Moment sonderlich begeistern oder nennenswert emotional abholen.
Aber ein Hauptproblem, das ich schon während der Erstsichtung hatte, war die Darstellung von russischem Roulette! Mir kam es nämlich diesmal noch stärker als bei der Erstsichtung so vor, als würde der Film vermitteln wollen, dass es sich bei russischem Roulette um ein Spiel handle, das durch Geschick bzw. Begabung beeinflusst werden könne, anstatt um ein reines (menschenverachtendes) Glücksspiel: ich fand es fast schon albern, dass Nick (Christopher Walken) im letzten Akt wie eine Art Champion/Profi des Spiels dargestellt wird.
Vor kurzem bekam ich allerdings trotzdem wieder Lust, den Film zu schauen, darum musste ich ihn schon wieder auf Blu-Ray bestellen. Gesagt, getan, heute Morgen – nach langem zögern – nochmal angeschaut und nun erkenne ich ihn endgültig als Meisterwerk an!
Diesmal hat mich weder die Hochzeit gestört noch fand ich die Laufzeit zu lang: das erste Drittel, das ca. 66 Minuten geht und die berüchtigte Hochzeit beinhaltet sorgt nun mal dafür, die Beziehungen der Figuren untereinander und deren Beziehung zu ihrer geliebten Kleinstadt zu vermitteln.
Der Fokus liegt dabei auf der Freundschaft zwischen Michael (Robert De Niro) und Nick (Christopher Walken), der scheinbar Michaels einziger Freund aus der Kleinstadt ist, der mit ihm sowohl emotional als auch intellektuell auf einer Wellenlänge liegt.
Die Kleinstadt und ihre fantastische Naturumgebung werden in beeindruckenden Weitwinkelaufnahmen präsentiert und die Jagdszenen sehen dadurch fantastisch aus.
Später in Vietnam gibt es dann allerdings tatsächlich nicht viel vom Krieg zu sehen, aber die wenigen Kriegs- bzw. Gewaltszenen, die es zu sehen gibt, sind alle sehr unpathetisch, intensiv und erschreckend – also so, wie es in einem Antikriegsfilm sein soll.
Aus visueller Sicht finde ich in Vietnam besonders die Hubschrauberszene und die anschließende flüchtende Menschenmasse extrem beeindruckend.
Aber der Film fokussiert sich, wie erwähnt, nicht auf Kriegsszenarien, sondern auf deren Auswirkungen auf die Charakterentwicklungen und Schicksale seiner Hauptfiguren Michael, Nick und Steven (John Savage). Das wird vor allem im letzten Drittel deutlich, wo Michael in die Kleinstadt zurückkehrt und einfach nicht aufhören kann, an Nick und das Versprechen, das er ihm gegeben hat, zu denken.
Diesmal empfand ich es auch nicht so, dass Nick als eine Art „Profi“ im russischen Roulette dargestellt wird! „Die durch die Hölle gehen“ ist eben ein Film, der nicht jeden Beweggrund und jede Entwicklung seiner Figuren erklärt bzw. über jeden Sachverhalt aufklärt, aber ich fand, insbesondere bei dieser Sichtung, dass durch diese Gegebenheit, und natürlich auch Christopher Walkens großartigem Schauspiel, Nicks apathischer und resignierter Zustand und dessen Ursache auf eine nachvollziehbare bzw. glaubhafte Weise manifestiert wird.
Dadurch, dass man in der ersten Stunde fast ausschließlich mit den Figuren abhängt, um ein Gefühl für sie zu bekommen, wird der Film am Ende nochmal sehr ergreifend, ohne dabei auf viel Pathos zurückgreifen zu müssen.
Auf inszenatorischer Ebene ist der Film natürlich auch fantastisch: neben den erwähnten großartigen Weitwinkelaufnahmen wird diese verlustreiche und dramatische Geschichte noch von einem wundervollen schwermütigen Score von Stanley Myers unterlegt.
„Die durch die Hölle gehen“ gehört nach dieser Sichtung nun auch für mich zu den Meisterwerken der Filmgeschichte: ein unpathetischer, ehrlicher, ungeschönter, ergreifender und psychologischer Antikriegsfilm, der den Fokus auf seine Figuren legt und mit wenigen Gewaltmomenten trotzdem eine verstörende Wirkung erzielt.",5.0

"Ja....isn guter und intensiver Film, aber für mich auch jetzt nicht DAS Meisterwerk.
Es ist auch malwieder ein Film wo ich eher fasziniert bin das er in der Form existiert als vom Film selbst.
Weil mal ganz ehrlich, wer würde denn heutzutage noch so eine Hochzeitszene dem Zuschauer zumuten? Und ja ich meine wirklich zumuten, denn auch ich finde das die bisschen übers Ziel hinaus geht.
Vergleicht man das mal mit The Godfather, da ist die Szene wesentlich kürzer, dient dem Worldbuilding und man lernt die Charaktere grundlegend kennen. Das schafft The Deer Hunter nicht so direkt.
Schwubbs ist man dann auch in Vietnam und ja das ist alles sehr wertig inszeniert und ausgestattet, aber fühlt sich fast schon dokumentarisch an.
Und auch hier hatte ich Probleme mit den Charakteren zu ""connecten""...das gezeigte verfehlt dennoch nicht seine Wirkung.
Aber ich bin ehrlich, weniger Hochzeit und mehr Vietnam wäre effektiver gewesen.
Aber gut....vielleicht dachte man sich, können beides einschneidende Erlebnisse für Mensch und Seele sein, daher die gleiche Gewichtung.
Ja und dann der Epilog der auch nochmal gut reinhaut.
Die Drehorte find ich übrigens richtig geil! Mehr deprimierendes Herbstfeeling geht ja fast garnet.
Was soll ich sagen, wenn der Film das Ziel erreichen wollte das ich mich nach 3 Stunden komplett beschissen fühle.....well done. Dafür auch objektive 4 Sterne, aber eben kein Herz, denn dafür war mir der Film dann doch zu ""distanziert"".
Schauspielerisch gibts auch überhaupt nix auszusetzen, alles super. Vorallem ""Fredo"" sollte mal erwähnt werden.
Aber ja, ich kann auch jeden verstehen der das hier als prätentiösen Bullshit sieht.",4.0

The life and times of some working class friends who have their simple existences rocked by getting caught up in the Vietnam war. Nothing will ever remain the same.
I feared that I would be let down by The Deer Hunter, since a 3-hour war film sounds like a chore to me. But it is lucky then that this is less of a war film and more of a gloomy small town drama where the war is a backdrop as opposed to a main attraction. It is in the small, almost insignificant moments where you find the beauty here. The drinking at the local pub, the hunting trips, the banter. The scenes in Vietnam end up feeling ridiculous by contrast. Christopher Walken getting addicted to Russian roulette sounds like something you'd expect in a Tarantino film, it sticks out in a gloomy drama like this. Doesn't make the eventual tragedy of that whole ordeal any less tragic though.
By the way, this is probably Walken's best performance right? He almost passes as a normal guy here at some points. And the same goes for Robert De Niro. This film has a startling ability to make dudes just look like dudes. And that is fitting when so much of the runtime is them being dudes, for better or for worse.",4.5
"With future rewatches I may come to appreciate The Deer Hunter more, but I found the extensive 3 hour runtime to be far too long and unwarranted. There were many periods within the film where I felt bored and didn’t get anything out of it, but the film sequences that take place within Vietnam are breathtaking. There is beautiful scenery and production design captured by brilliant cinematography during this era that really enforces the wild and naturalistic atmosphere. The musical melody is a classic contribution to cinema too that has a melancholy mood to it and there is something all bittersweet about the ending.
The clear standout scenes were the Russian roulette face-offs that had a visceral tension, but a large part of the film suffered from a lack of engagement and prolonged silences that just wasted time away. 
A good film, but not a gripping masterpiece that I was hoping for.",3.5

Had to do this one over two viewings. When it was released it apparently divided critics who either adored it or loathed it. I can see why. It is brutal and complicated, not unlike its subject matter.
The scenes that cut from the grimy town that all the friends live in to the majestic Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are jarring, and do as good a job of any film I have seen in conveying the restorative power of wilderness.
The acting and attention to detail throughout is incredible. Everyone is so young!

"JB’s review: 5/10
“Every scene went on for too long.”
It’s hard to discern where runtime turns from a filmmaking tool to a filmmaker’s indulgence. But I do know that the time Cimino spends in Pennsylvania is never time wasted.
We’re not just shown what these guys are going off to fight for, we’re forced to live life with them for a whole hour. Every ideal small and large is captured, and the hometown camaraderie is not profoundly beautiful—just really beautiful in its honesty.
The comparatively quick trip to Vietnam is sufficient enough (especially in the wake of Apocalypse Now!) to understand the madness of the war and introduce this thematic rift that destroys these men; life is a gamble and someone else is holding the gun. The talent it takes for Walken, De Niro, and Savage to pull that off is astonishing.
I’m also realizing that Vilmos Zsigmond is the best thing to happen to this generation of directors. Absolutely breathtaking.",5.0

"O Franco atirador, Cimino
Autor: Jacques Lourcelles; Tradução: Matheus Cartaxo
O grande filme americano dos anos 70. Com uma ambição imensa, Cimino tenta construir um cinema épico e wagneriano que é também lírico e contemplativo e não desprovido de densidade romanesca. No que concerne à força da mise en scène, Cimino é o único cineasta da sua geração no qual se pode ver, através do seu filme, um herdeiro de Walsh e, especialmente, de The naked and the dead. Isso não o impede de conduzir, através dos outros aspectos do filme, uma busca absolutamente pessoal e original. Ele atinge o poderia dramático das cenas pela duração desmesurada das mesmas, o que as torna misteriosas e encantatórias, por um senso quase mágico do cenário e pela atenção à certas características individuais dos personagens, sem qualquer preocupação de rigor dramático aparente. A busca dele vai de encontro ao centro da sua proposta; não pelo realismo, mas com o auxílio de um conjunto de alegorias que transformam o realismo em elementos de reflexão moral e filosófica. Os temas privilegiados de tal reflexão dizem respeito à energia e à vontade de poder da América. A caça, a guerra distante, o jogo cruel da roleta-russa, tudo isso são os motivos dramáticos e visuais, extremamente espetaculares, que permitem confrontar essa possibilidade de poder com o real. De acordo com os personagens, veremos esta vontade se destruir, fraturar ou mesmo perdurar, ao transformar-se e mudar de conteúdos. Epopéia de fracasso, O Franco-Atirador é também um réquiem grandioso dedicado aos sofrimentos e à estupefação da América diante da maior derrota da sua história.
N.B.: Um exemplo de pesquisa efetuada por Cimino acerca do cenário: ele explicou (em «American Cinematographie», outubro 1978) como ele tinha construído visualmente o sítio da sua pequena cidade da Pensilvânia, utilizando oito exteriores diferentes, filmados em Ohio: único meio de conseguir, segundo ele, com que uma usina se perfile no horizonte em cada um dos planos gerais de exteriores que figuram nas seqüências que deveriam transcorrer na Pensilvânia.

"1000th film!
Couldn’t ask for a better film to watch for this milestone. If you’ve noticed, I haven’t been writing much about films I’ve been seeing lately, and have instead just been logging them because I’ve been experiencing a string of writing blocks. I don’t think I can write much about The Deer Hunter - not because of these mind blanks, but because this movie is just so goddamn humongous that no sentences I string together will be enough to summarise how awesome this is.

"Good drama with bad history!
—Of course I’m not a big fan of mindless patriotism and this movie is a great criticism about all ignorance that surrounds war and
its dehumanizing effects of men. 
Drinking beer like an idiot, hunting animals, playing with guns, disliking trees or even betraying a friend for a woman- Nothing like a traumatic experience to become a better person.
I’m not sure about some depictions created along the film, like the portrait of most of the Vietnamese people. It’s also not historically accurate and mildly racist- but just by being an anti-war material it gets my respect. 
Well with a cast of actors like this, nothing could go wrong!",4.0
"The very opening, in which our characters endure red-hot heat and other inhuman conditions just for a simple night wage suggests the breathtakingly moving journey the latter of the film embarks us on. Very few films play with my emotions as much as this one did. These are the types of films where in you feel exactly what the characters are feeling, whether it's being happy, anxious, regretful, hell even aroused... and this was fortunately one of them. The Deer Hunter is an ambitious work of cinematic art that comes with an uncompromising glaze to it. With a narrative that runs just over three hours, it unearths the most common forms of manoeuvres in human emotions from weddings to war grounds and from funerals to falling in love. Michael Cimino takes the flawless writing and puts it to even more flawless use as he sucks us in with the
gorgeous imagery, filled with striking contrasts. Whilst also directing the camera realistically as possible, he doesn't, even once hold back from uncompromisingly switching from one tone to another. And yet, from the duly omnipresent score to the cinematography that speaks for itself, The Deer Hunter is a film of great, if mostly melancholy, charm. It uses raw power and conditions to its advantage, often creating scenes to the uttermost of sentiment, still unprecedented in cinema. The impudent transitions in cinematography as the story moves on, may be startling, but create some of the most gorgeous sceneries in film that are all worthy of being postered onto a wall. The film also has De Niro and Walken in their prime with some more great performances, especially by Cazale and Streep who just debuted. As much as it boasts in all its grand essence, The Deer Hunter is a close to life and enervating film which also results in an upsetting experience inducing just as much tension as for the war veterans then. And even more than three decades later, stands as one of the most powerful yet benignant expanses ever committed to cinema.",5.0
"Forever doomed to live under the shadow of Apocalypse Now (tbf, a tighter and far superior Vietnam film that gets his point across more effectively). But kudos to this for being one of the first big releases to shed some light on the madness and burden of war in blue-collar America. I enjoyed every little moment spent in that Pennsylvania town (can’t believe the wedding is widely considered to be boring).
A flawed classic, but a classic nonetheless.",0.0
"The Deer Hunter is a well-structured, in-depth character study with a suitably tense set-piece that's one of the most nervy moments in a best-picture winning film, probably ever. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performance as the film provides a powerful exploration of three primary characters and how their friendships are shaped and changed by Vietnam, with the war taking place in the middle act of the movie.
What follows before and after is as you'd expect, completely different - to the point where it almost feels like there's three films competing at once, yet this never feels like an issue as the pace is so expertly managed, running so smoothly that I didn't feel bored at all or like it was once retreading its steps in its impressive runtime. I don't think it quite beats Days of Heaven as my favourite film from 1978 but it's one of the stronger best picture winners that I've seen, and one where you just have to accept that sometimes the Academy can make a good choice.",4.5

"You wanna play games? All right, I'll play your fucking games.
De Niro, John Cazale (in his final role) Christopher Walken ho! And Meryl Streep. Winning 5 Oscars out of 9 noms, best picture, director, supporting actor, sound, film editing. Went into this completely blind, all I knew from it’s reputation was winning best picture and all the great performances. 
De Niro comes off the likes of Mean Streets, Godfather Part II and Taxi Driver, can you imagine how amazed the director must of felt knowing he got De Niro onto his film in his prime?!! I find it amusing De Niro plays a character called Michael in this. A director who was barely known, Michael Cimino, this is my first exposure to him and what an excellent film this was. It had everything from stellar performances, amazing camerawork it was really well shot and edited well, a good score and a strong story. The pacing is truly amazing for a 3 hour film. 
There’s a really nice zooming out shot of a mirror that I liked, and there were a couple of split diopter shots. 
Pay no attention to the title, It’s not about deer hunting, that’s only a tiny portion of it, essentially It’s a drama which follows a tale about friendship and PTSD in a small town. I won’t say anymore but the film takes a turn and it is awesome, I was surprised by what happen in this. Just when the film needs something more, it delivers. It was captivating to watch even when you know what’s going to happen, that’s an impressive feat in itself. There was so much chemistry and character development in the film, I really liked this group of characters. De Niro is great in everything but here he is phenomenal and so is Christoper Walken, he’s always been a good actor but here this is the best I’ve ever seen him. Meryl Streep we all know is brilliant but even here she surprised me, well deserved Oscar noms all around.
For a film that’s 43 years old, this has aged so well, it explores the human condition unlike any other film of today. The greatest films stay with you and this undoubtedly will. It may be one of the best films ever to win Best Picture let alone one of the best films ever made. I think my kink is De Niro films where long periods of time pass with a runtime of 3 hours... 
Fun fact: De Niro claims there’s one scene in this film that was the most emotional scene he’s ever done.",5.0

"Very long but well acted and well written, The Deer Hunter weaves together American-working-class realism with some visual fidelity, depicting a dark goddess of fortune spinning her desolate silver chambered wheel, against the temples of revenant forms, once men.
Life and death, are left to chance in the hollowed eyes of those that served their imperial nation which subjugated the small country of Vietnam as it struggled for sovereignty. We only briefly see the struggles of the Vietnamese as the second act opens; what is wild about the film is that its harrowing take of what veterans went through was probably viewed as liberal and pinko for the time; considering the destruction to the nation and people of Vietnam was an afterthought. Rightly subversive for its time, I don't think the act of deer hunting (Deniro literally running after a deer....come on) is accurate in the film, but its depictions of humans internalizing war, are worth your time.",3.5

It just falls into the ""Legendary Films that's in my Harddrive but I have absolutely no time whatsoever to sit down and watch"" category..
I expected this film to be good, read a lot of reviews that got me pumped up for this film...but I didn't expect (not in a million miles) this film to be so Brutal..
Its less of a War movie to be honest, just around 45 minutes of the entirety of 3 hours was dedicated to show the characters in the dirty underbelly of the Vietnam War...but in those 45 minutes the director managed to get every ounce of Brutality, Suspense and Violence from the Vietnam war..
The first act was more of the bonding between the characters, the bond of friendship, the parties, the wedding, the insane amount of beers, the hunting etc...its gives a relaxing and a pleasant atmosphere to the audience..
The second act is totally the opposite..
I'm gonna tell this now cause I might forget it later...""The Vietnam Roulette"" is probably one of the most intense, suspensful and barbaric scenes, I've ever watched in a film..
Not to mention, The bombing of innocent civilians, the shooting of a mother holding her child, the screams of fear and anguish by Walken and Savage etc...just elevates the whole movie into a dark, violent and unpleasant state..
The third act is everything that comes after..
The Characters need for Isolation, the mental trauma that is inflicted on them, unrendering stress caused by the aftermath of War is something really devastating to watch...and Christopher Walken and John Savage have showcased this Perfectly..
In short, One of the most brutal yet truthful depictions of War...I would recommend this film to everybody but I'm pretty sure everyone has already seen this film..",4.5
"I like the emotional journey here, it has a somber feeling of the sudden awarness of life’s fragility at the expense of clueless young men. Walken and DeNiro are great. The film’s first hour, while necessary at many points for world building, does come off rather monotonous for the most part. The film has an interesting shift halfway, and reading how drastically different this aspect was from the novel, at many points it almost feels a bit unearned in how it explores its new location? Again, the performances are key here, the chemistry in the final act and subtle facial expressions are the standout.",3.0

"9/10
Very few movies make me cry.
But, I guess this one can be added to the list of ones that have.
The first, maybe hour of this film is just foreshadowing and character developing. The characters are just playing pool and singing. Nothing of real importance happens in this first hour.
And it's absolutely necessary.
You spend so much time with these characters that eventually they just feel like real people that your watching. They all feel like real friends by the end of the first act. Which makes all the Vietnam content that much better. 
This film is so intense at parts. Which makes sense given that a good portion of this film revolves around the game of Russian Roulette. This film is barely about Vietnam in as itself. It's mostly about the trauma it brings to these characters. By the end, you are just as broken as these characters.
The performances are great. Specifically, Christopher Walken. Before he was selling magic remotes to Adam Sandler. He was doing stuff like this. He's the best character. De Niro is obviously great as always but Walken is the standout.

"The judge smiled. Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all. Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that man’s hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a man’s worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence.

Here the bewildering antithesis of play and seriousness presents itself once more. We have gradually become convinced that civilization is rooted in noble play and that, if it is to unfold in full dignity and style, it cannot afford to neglect the play-element. The observance of play-rules is nowhere more imperative than in the relations between countries and States. Once they are broken, society falls into barbarism and chaos. On the other hand we cannot deny that modern warfare has lapsed into the old agonistic attitude of playing at war for the sake of prestige and glory. Now this is our difficulty: modern warfare has, on the face of it, lost all contact with play.

"The Deer Hunter is certainly not the kind of film that is easy to watch, and I was a bit hesitant before dipping back into it, but it turned out to be a most rewarding revisit. Its ambition and scope most impressive. This is not your ordinary war movie. It's a film that shows us a group of men before, during, and after the war, and all three parts of the film are equally important for the final product (and take up pretty much the same amount of its runtime, too). It is the kind of project that, these days, would probably be turned into a miniseries rather than a single film, yet it never feels rushed or underdeveloped (on the contrary, the pacing feels very deliberate), even although it has so much going on in its mere three hours of runtime.
It helps that Michael Cimino can rely on some of the greatest actors of their generation for this film (De Niro! Cazale! Streep!), but it is Christopher Walken who is leaving the biggest impression - partly due to having the most gut-wrenching part to play.

The Deer Hunter is a raw, visceral film that illustrates the cost of war and its disorienting effects that curses the human body, mind and soul.

"i got many mixed feelings from the deer hunter, a acclaimed classic praised by many, but that for me was unfortunately an incoherent, messy and ultimately frustrating experience. but let’s start with the positive aspects: everyone’s performances is very good, with the obvious highlights belonging to deniro and walken. meryl streep and john cazale have minor roles but they both have their qualities within their possibilities. the cinematography was beautiful and the main theme from the score is truly lovely. and that’s pretty much it.
the structure is pretty clear and not very inventive, with its three well defined acts that are almost too detached from each other to be cohesive, what only isn’t that bad because of the cinematography.
the first act sets who the main characters were before war, the dynamic between them, their cultural background, hobbies and mundane lives, and how naive they were for enlisting in the army thinking it’d be some sort of heroic adventure.
the second act is the war itself, brutal and violent, but this could be any war—the film is incredibly non critical and apolitical showing it, not addressing the north american implications or interests behind it at virtually any point (the final scene is too vague to be considered criticism, at least for me). it contains the strongest scene of the whole film, the russian roulette one, that is a metaphor for the war itself, its waste, absurdity and senseless violence. it’s almost abhorrently good if its quality and certainty are compared to the rest of the film. it even gives the impression the entire film was created just so it could happen.
the third act is the messiest one, and where most of the problems lie. it’s supposed to show the psychological consequences to all the horror but what it gives is only mild when not ridiculous. mike is supposed to be changed, but the only evidence of that is he not being able to kill a deer, which is hardly enough to convey that. and the storyline goes places that are completely unbelievable: nick surviving all that time playing russian roulette for a living? mike managing to get back to saigon in the most chaotic period of the war, actually finding nick then getting back to america like it was nothing? how did he get all that money, was it nick’s? why did nick get addicted and, in that case, what kind of addict in this world would send off money to other people overseas instead of getting their drugs?
there are lots of complaints about the pacing, but it wasn’t even the major issue for me, although nothing seems to justify those three hours of sheer ludicrousness and the impossibility of identifying what it’s really trying to achieve. is it about obsession? friendship and loyalty? how war changes a man? it skims on those subjects but never delves deep enough to make any meaningful point, sending so many mixed signs along the way. the use of vietnam war feels like a low subterfuge and the love triangle was weird and off putting, especially when linda was such a secondary and badly developed character.

This is a heartbreaking and brutal portrayal of the effect of the Vietnam war on the mental state of veterans.

The three lead performances are some of the best I've ever seen and the writing for the characters is excellent.
The only thing that keeps this from 5 stars (honestly I could still see myself changing to 5 stars anyway) is the first act. I understand its importance in introducing the characters and really giving us a good feel for who they are so we can see just how much they change later. But I can't help but feel it could have been tighter - I did find it a little difficult to stay interested at times.

The calmness and peacefulness of the hunting compared to the chaos of Russian roulette and war as a whole and of course the core of this film which is the effects of war. The former being executed much better than the latter. I think the first two acts are quite alright despite few dragging scenes and awkward transitions that left me a little confused if they had to cut footage. Cimino and DoP Zsigmond create a visually enticing story and the use of music is excellent. What this fails to deliver on is meaningful pay off and third act that really doesn't hold much power. It consists of scenes that are supposed to make you contemplate how much these men are changed but I couldn't shake the feeling that the major conflict between Michael and Nick lacked authenticity.
We don't see much of anything and are just supposed to take it as Michael being able to hold himself together better. Maybe the process of change is gradual and I can't see that or maybe it's just that the difference is there all along. A matter of nature and willpower? I don't know. I didn't like the third act. It bounces around trying desperately to show every aspect that has changed from the first act. Scenes between Linda and the friend group feel so eager to point out everything while disguised as profound by the slow pacing. It's loud and clear but in an annoyingly distant way. The best aspect is probably how the whole community reacts to these men so carefully because it isn't obvious at all. There's the subtle contrast of outside appearance and what their behavior really says about them which I think with Michael, Linda and Steven is too pushy.
Well, there is still much to admire about the film like the performances or individual scenes and atmosphere at parts. It doesn't actually even drag that much opposite to what I expected and delivers on its message on a basic level. I wish it was done differently though. Actually show some progress and change, not just compare things. The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that handled the effects of war extremely well.",2.5

"This is less of a review than it is some thoughts about a film which has been critiqued, examined, pulled apart and stitched back together more times than anyone would care to count.
I know films were paced differently in the '70s, but I found this best picture winner and American classic difficult to get into. The first act is incredibly long and drawn out, filled with scene after scene of dancing and merriment at the wedding, most of which seems superfluous when compared to the better character building that comes with the hunting scene.
Then the jarring jump to Vietnam occurs with the second act and I thought I'd picked up a bad copy of the film. Thankfully, the Russian Roulette scenes managed to re-engage me, as they were excellent examples of taut, tension-filled film making. And yet the whole time I wanted to see how Steven was broken rather than seeing all his set up with his wife; likewise I wanted to see how Michael became the bad-ass he was - so much so that it feels like a whole film was missing from this part of their journey.
The third act is powerful representation (for its time) of what PTSD can do to individuals, but again, I found the pacing to be sluggish. And by the end, I was just glad I'd managed to sit through the film which helped establish so many powerful actors of that (and this) generation.

"Clearly The Deer Hunter operates much more in the realm of the ideal, something that really couldn't be much clearer in it's incessant selectivity, often surprising cuts and the more experimental structural choices, however sparse. Therefore it interacts more with the idea of war, rather than the actual events that take place. Fittingly, the actual war sequence take up less than one third of the film, relatively serving as a transition, and the focus is returned to the psyche of our characters. And rarely, from Hollywood, have I seen such a fascinating multi-faceted psychological study. The characters fluidly floating in and out of coherency, their motivations and inner thoughts often obscured and even minute interactions become monumental undertakings. The damaged sub-consciousness in constant battle with external factors and a knowledge of right and wrong.
This is seen clearly in Steven's, and, particularly, Mike's return. Even in Nick's lack thereof. There's a defiant refusal, or incapability, to return to their old day-to-day lives. Mike skips his Welcome-party, Steven stays at the hospital. Mike's development can be seen most clearly in his interactions with people on the street and when he goes hunting again. Nick, ludicrously, finds meaning elsewhere. Finally, the inevitably tragic conclusions permeates through our main characters' local community, leading to, quite possibly, the strangest ending scene I have seen. Everyone completely disabled from functioning normally given the setting. Culminating in a haunting and displaced rendition of ""God Bless America"". Largely, the psychological effect, and the main point of interest of the film, results from social constructs and rituals, and the divergence therefrom, especially, in Mike.
Perhaps one of the more appealing aspects of the film as well, is it's prophetic mode of foreshadowing. It takes a pretty literal sense, in the exchanges that takes place between Nick and Mike, but also in a more spiritual way. There's is something about Mike traversing the North Cascades that reminds me of Friedrich's ""Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog"", at once intensely romantic, but mysteriously metaphysical. Here we also see how prepared Mike is for the lack of any real structure that the war represents, as opposed to Nick, who doesn't recognize the determination and the mental strength of his friend. Mike, as the much more spiritually connected individual, is acting in a manner almost cryptic to his peers. Nick, externalizes his spirit in his superficial appreciation as opposed to Mike's deeper immersion. Although it should be noted, that no matter how prepared Mike is, he also comes home as damaged goods.
Although comparatively simple in its depiction of war, even here Cimino offers a new perspective. In The Deer Hunter, like Cimino said, ""The war is really incidental to the development of the characters and their story"". A largely critical view of the Vietnam war as overall deleterious, particularly to the american people who had not asked to be there in the first place. As such, the war, or any war for that matter, is lamented as inherently a personal experience, which is really where it's lasting effects lie, before being twisted and sanctified into an effort for greater good. This film certainly offers a complex and interesting point of view where it really matters, on the personal level. As it goes in depth, surveying factors of human existence that rarely are reflected upon.",4.5
"A more controversial outing as far as anti-war films are concerned but with that being said ""The Deer Hunter"" is still considered a classic. Steelworkers witness the horrors of war and we get to see how each one of them and their community as a whole are affected by it. So in that regard it gets very personal and intimate. Which was very much needed for its time of release and in a way it is kind of needed now. With all the different wars and disturbances going on around the world, I have found through personal experience growing up that this is a good movie to keep revisiting.
The cast in general is one of the main reasons why I enjoy rewatching this. They have this chemistry with each other that is a rare sight in the world of cinema. They worked well together in bringing out authentic and personal emotion that helped keep this film afloat. The more violent scenes can be a bit much for some though, which is where part of the controversy comes from. On a technical level though it is done quite professionally and can really get the blood pumping during the more tense moments.
Overall it is on par with ""The Godfather"" in terms of being epic but also highly personal. There are a variety of themes I could get into but that are worth bringing up but that could fill an entire book. It's tone and pacing are quite unique and also work effectively when linking the various scenes in both America and Vietnam. There is plenty of tension with the Vietnam scenes but the emotional hurt and suffering displayed in the scenes back in the states are what really hit close to home. The disillusionment is strong in those scenes as well. Especially with the deer hunting scenes. At the end of the day It is an emotionally tough watch but the scenes of camaraderie are quite touching and worth the trouble.",4.5

He still wins me over with this film’s combination of good direction and powerful ensemble casts. It’s a quintessential veterans and PTSD film and knows when to lean into the fictional storytelling and when to be fully grounded within the world of 1960s and 1970s America.",4.5

"""One shot...""
It is often the case that a director crashes and burns after they make a great film, it happened to Shyamalan, the Wachowskis, Besson, and countless others that I could name. But none ever happened quite as dramatically as it did to Michael Cimino, who went from making what many, including myself, consider to be one of the greatest films of all time into making Heaven's Gate, which is considered one of the biggest box office and critical disasters of all time. But while Heaven's Gate has gained a cult following in recent years, it shows that when you capture lightning in a bottle, you can never fully retain or recreate such an experience.
While Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket are happy to explore how war affects a man, The Deer Hunter decides to step back into mundane reality and ask how does war truly affect a man. How can a man live with the horrific things that he had to see and do while in combat? It is the uncomfortable questions that people would want to ask their fathers and grandfathers who fought in a war, but can never bring themselves to that The Deer Hunter is interested in. The answer is that it either forces the person to silently accept and live with the atrocities and violence that was experienced, much like with Michael or it can break people entirely, much like with Nicky.
Despite great writing and directing, what truly takes The Deer Hunter to the next level is its acting. Never has Robert De Niro seemed more natural in a role than he was in this film, we also see Christopher Walken before he became the eccentric oddball that we know and love today, showcasing that despite his eccentricities, he is more than capable of holding his own against a great like De Niro. One can also sense the connection and camaraderie that is between the cast, particularly with Walken and De Niro, we also get an appearance from John Cazale before his unfortunate death in 1978 from lung cancer, and the sense of loss is felt throughout the film, not just of him but also the innocence of the characters and of the lives that they once had, with the sobering realization that life will never go back to 'normal' for them.
As I often say, there is no such thing as a perfect piece of work, and The Deer Hunter is no exception. It can feel meandering at times in its infamously long beginning, which has been criticized in recent years for being meandering and boring. While I can say that it does sometimes drag with some of the character drama, but for the most part I think that it works. I also found problems with its portrayal of women, while Meryl Streep's character Linda is given some depth, the other women are once more trapped in the 'madonna-whore complex' that is found in much of fiction. There is also the film's use of extremes, and while it works for the most part, there are some scenes where I was tested, like when Michael points the gun at Stan's head.
While I prefer the more operatic Apocalypse Now, I've never felt that any film ever came as close to capturing its dark energy as much as The Deer Hunter did, though I found that The Deer Hunter was far more subtle and personal in approach, keeping the dark psychology and explorations of the savagery of man while showing how war can affect a man even in his personal life, and how one might never truly be able to move on from such horrific experiences.",5.0
"""I feel a lot of distance, and I feel far away""
The Deer Hunter has been of my most anticipated watches in my watchlist for a long time and man, what a movie. This is one of the more unique war movies, where as other war movies always show you the characters in training or whether they are already in he war, this movies shows you the characters lives before and after the war and how they were before and after said war. The acting, my god the acting is amazing! I believe this movie wouldnt have worked without all these amazing actors such as Walken, De Niro, Savage, Cazale, Streep, etc. They all did wonderfully bringing these characters to life. Christopher Walken is one of my favorite actors of all time and his role here solidifies that, easily one of my favorite if not favorite performance by him. The soundtrack is so beautiful and reminds me alot of brokeback mountain, hell even the camerawork feels very much like BB as well with its wide open view of the forest and surrounding areas but up close and claustrophobic in tense situations, a masterclass in both areas. The Deer Hunter is funny, it's intense, it's heartbreaking, it has great performances, soundtrack and cinematography, it is an overall great movie that I would highly recommend",5.0
"a horrible, ugly film reflective of a dehumanised country consumed by war. racist, provocative hell. genuinely such a hateful film, but this hate feels more targeted to foreign countries, particularly vietnam, rather than its own country- which is my main problem with it. the deer hunter showcases exactly how america villainise and make caricatures of their enemies, is this in attempt to try and excuse and rationalise the atrocities that america committed on vietnam’s very own soil? maybe it was cinimo’s idea all along, he knew that the entire country would fall for this nationalist propaganda, unaware or uncaring of the deep-rooted racism embedded inside it. maybe it’s what the country needed after being torn apart by war for so long. i’ve personally always took to media that looks inside rather than out, though to be fair to the deer hunter, i do think it can be reflective too- de niro’s character is representative of the most stoic american man, at constant battle with his masculinity and this fight is magnified when he returns back from Vietnam and struggles to reintegrate into modern society.
the presence of the industrialised town is striking. smoke flows from the factories as machinery whirs become helicopter blades whirring. late capitalism fuels war as bigger guns become the product of advanced technologies. these lingering shots of the town really force the viewer to reckon with their thoughts, particularly how these people who have lives and share joyful memories with their friends are also used like cogs in machines, used to fight a war that wasn’t caused by them. this is where the deer hunter works best for me, but i don’t feel it ever really hones in on these themes enough. 
walken is (once again) on god mode, a true force to be reckoned with and on his day no body, not even de niro, can touch him. he’s got the it factor in abundance, and this is proof that he’s always had it, even from a young age. de niro is obviously great too, but i just think walken may be the most under rated/utilised hollywood actor of his generation.",3.0
"Wavering between 4/4.5 stars, not that it really matters, but just trying to sell the impressive scope of Cimino's masterpiece. Read the biography of Cimino late last year, and his story blew me away. Where Heaven's Gate was a tad long and disjointed, Deer Hunter was the perfect slow burn from beginning to end. The characters are laid out perfectly from the beginning, and while the Russian roulette aspects were a bit weak thematically, the way Cimino calls back to those moments inspires quite a bit of intrigue. Combining the power of friendship with the cruelty and broken promises of war is far from unique, but love the way it plays out here. The ending is beautiful, absolutely the most heartbreaking and poignant way to end the film.",4.0

"Stanley Kubrick once mentioned that Girlfriends was his favorite movie of 1978. While I'll acknowledge his legend-status, I couldn't disagree more because The Deer Hunter also came out the same year. There's so many small elements that make it amazing but I love how big this movie felt. It's a sort-of ""epic"" film so you would expect this, but so much happens in the three hour runtime that it just feels larger than most movies.
The content matter that was covered was incredible. I've seen people say that the pre-Vietnam section of this movie is a little slow but I was honestly found the wedding and friend dynamic so entertaining. I think compared to the monster second and third act it's overshadowed. I found it so cool that they were Russian because the wedding scene was so novel to me and cool to watch. It's amazing how they planned a whole wedding for this movie, and an extravagant one at that. The music and atmosphere was really amazing during this wedding and I'm glad it made up a big chunk of this movie. I loved the friendships but I did find all the yelling and singing to be annoying. To be fair though when me and my friends are drinking we're probably even more annoying so I cant hate that much haha.
The Vietnam section was simply amazing. The cinematography of the rainforest was so pretty (not to mention the Appalachian mountains and the industrial scenes back in Pennsylvania). The scene of them in the water cage was really hard to watch. I know that the Vietcong were notoriously bad to American POW's during the war. They actually didn't consider them ""POW's"" because then they would have had to follow rules laid out by the Geneva Convention for their treatment. Instead they considered them ""outlaws in an undeclared war"" which means they don't technically have to follow any rules. This alone probably shows you how brutal they were. The Russian roulette scenes are so tense and hard to watch.
I've seen people claim this movie is racist due to its depiction of the Vietnamese people. From my point of view I didn't really see any of that. The prison scenes were brutal but the Vietcong were actually very terrible to prisoners. I think a stronger example of a racist depiction of Vietnamese people is seen in Rambo: First Blood Part 2. If anyone wants to debate me on this, feel free. I would like to know what's so racist about this film.

"The wedding sequence is good as hell and the people who complain about how long it is will not survive the winter, may shock you to learn but the rest of this is pretty good too - discussion over the thematic aims and performances (De Niro and Walken really are that good, turns out) has already been inked by much better writers over the course of decades so I really just want to single out a few bits of filmmaking texture I loved, like the jump from Pennsylvania hometown to Vietnam in the space of a single cut, or the track that sounds like Popol Vuh at the beginning of the first deer hunt. Also a big fan of the purgatorial Saigon setting in the last act with ambient fires and spliced-in newsreel footage, feels real and unreal simultaneously, De Niro wandering empty streets until entering the Russian Roulette den PACKED with people.
Have my quibbles (the coda's a little much), but hell if I was United Artists I also would've given Cimino ""financial suicide""-level resources for Heaven's Gate after seeing this",4.5
"I know this might be a controversial opinion, but despite the stellar acting performances from De Niro and Walken, as well as the impressive cinematography, The Deer Hunter is a good movie, but not an excellent one to me. In my opinion, there are a lot of things holding this film down; the film is divided into three separate acts, each with its own distinct tone and themes.
In the first act, we are introduced to Michael and Nick and their lives in a small industrial town. This section serves as an important setup for the rest of the film, and it generally works very well, except the pacing feels slow. While I don't mind long movies, I do take issue when a film's length seems to serve no purpose other than padding, as is the case with the extended wedding scene in The Deer Hunter. It feels unnecessarily prolonged and could have been trimmed down significantly without losing its essence. I can see this movie being easily cut down to about 2 and a half hours and still being just as good. I know this statement is a bit hypocritical because that’s a valid criticism of both The Return of The King and Killers of The Flower Moon, both movies I love and are way longer than this, but for those two, they can both be excused because of how every scene hooks you into the movie and tends not to state the same things over and over again, which is something I feel like The Deer Hunter’s first act does constantly.
The second act, which takes place in Vietnam, is where this film truly shines. The intensity of the war scenes and the psychological toll it takes on the characters are portrayed brilliantly. De Niro and Walken's performances truly come to life here, showcasing the horrors of war and the impact it has on individuals. The tension and emotional depth in this part of the movie are palpable, drawing the viewers into all of the characters' experiences.
The final act, set back in the United States after the war, explores the aftermath and the challenges faced by Micheal as he tries to reintegrate into society. I like this final act, but it doesn't quite reach the same level of intensity as the Vietnam sequences to me. While it offers some powerful moments, like the scene with Micheal trying to get Nick back home, it still doesn’t hit the same level for me like the second act.
Out of the three parts of this movie, the undeniable worst part is the beginning for me; while having some moments of greatness, it truly does struggle in most other areas that the other parts just don’t have.
Despite my reservations about the first part, The Deer Hunter undoubtedly benefits from the exceptional performances of its cast and the visually striking cinematography. The film effectively captures the devastating effects of war on individuals and the complexities of human relationships.
Maybe I will feel different when I watch it again later down the line, but as of right now, it’s a perfectly fine movie about trauma. Both De Niro and Walken carry this movie for me.",3.5

"One of the greatest American movies of the 1970s is Michael Cimino's sprawling Vietnam War movie The Deer Hunter. It initially begins in a Russian Orthodox community in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and focuses on a group of young male steel workers. There are three threads: 1) a wedding for their friend Steven (John Savage); 2) the impending deployment of the core group of friends to Vietnam; 3) a deer hunting trip before they are deployed. Main characters are established, with a significant focus landing on Mike (Robert DeNiro), the seemingly most mature member of the group, the one who also happens to be the most enigmatic. The film then abruptly shifts to prisoner of war camps in Vietnam with our protagonists about to be killed. Following a harrowing ""game"" of Russian Roulette, they are able to escape, but not without suffering significant physical and mental trauma. The last part of the film focuses on the men reintegrating into their new life back home, but one of their friends has not returned, Nick (Christoper Walken), leading Mike to return to Vietnam to find him involved in a dangerous game. Cimino's attention to detail, the great acting and camaraderie amongst the cast, the local color (of the Pittsburgh suburb), the religious and secular traditions of the men, the portrayal of (wartime) disability, and the attention to the dynamics of ""patriotism"" in the face of an unjust war contribute to the greatness of this movie, which provides no easy answers. My main problem with the movie is the ""Russian Roulette"" content, which not only didn't happen during the Vietnam War but which also comes off as lame and racist pro-war propaganda to appease that particular constituency in the audience; the fact that this constitutes the two main suspenseful and emotionally gripping events in the film taints it. Despite this big weakness, there is much to admire about this unconventional, gripping, and devastating movie.",4.5

"“One shot is what it’s all about. A deer’s gotta be taken with one shot.”

Director Michael Cimino’s depiction of wartime trauma is very powerful. This film is incredibly well made so it’s no wonder that it received so many Oscar nominations.
Starting off with what I feel is the highlight: the cast’s acting. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep and John Savage are all amazing in their respective roles. Their performances were so genuine that at times I almost forgot they were acting. This film is also written and directed fantastically.
On the whole, I wasn’t too bothered by the three hour long runtime, however I did definitely prefer the second half of the film to the first half. The wedding sequence in the opening act ran on far longer than I thought it would, and I did start to wonder if it was ever going to finish. As for the visuals, Vilmos Zsigmond’s cinematography is excellent. Lastly, Stanley Myers did a marvellous job with the score. The ‘Cavatina’ piece of music is absolutely beautiful.
Overall, The Deer Hunter is a moving psychological war/drama from Michael Cimino. It features amazing acting, fantastic writing and directing, excellent cinematography, and a beautiful score. However, I definitely felt more invested in the story during both the second and third act. The first act of this film dragged a bit too much for my liking.

El estudio del estrés postraumático, de las consecuencias psicológicas de la guerra, es humano y empático. Salen de un campo de batalla para terminar atrapados en otro; el de su propia mente, en la que la perpetuación de los roles masculinos, el orgullo y resentimiento, les impiden una ""superación"" idílica.

"I’ve taken a strange path through Michael Cimino’s films, starting with his masterful neo-noir Year of the Dragon, next going to his unfairly reviled to say the least sprawling epic Western Heaven’s Gate, to now arrive at the film that set his career truly in motion, The Deer Hunter. In this, Cimino’s second film, we get a narrative nearly as epic in scale and structure as Heaven’s Gate, giving us time to truly live with the characters - the advantage The Deer Hunter has over Heaven’s Gate conceptually, however, is the backdrop of the Vietnam War, grounding the film in a more relatable and recognizable conflict. The film opens with the famously mocked wedding sequence, a brilliant emotional sleight of hand to prime us for the horrors the characters will go on to endure (these are even hinted at in one of the most unnerving scenes of warning I’ve ever seen in a film). The way this horror plays out, along with the aftermath of it all, certainly makes for one of the most complete war films I’ve ever seen. We get everything in The Deer Hunter, for better or worse.

"Not what I expected at all. I was almost half-dreading it because I was tired of all the war films that I’ve been watching for my Best Picture “marathon.” The Deer Hunter is a film about what happens away from the frontlines, what happens to the people back at home, and who you become after you experience something nobody else will have to. 
The entire cast is so dedicated to the project. DeNiro, Savage, Walken, and Streep are all so heartbreaking in their roles. I think that each of them have an equal chance to show off their range and dynamics as actors. I’m particularly interested in how Savage didn’t get any awards love. Maybe a bad campaign??? At least, I felt he gave out one of the strongest performances.
The score is also beautifully delicate and fragile. A pretty interesting juxtaposition to the horrors onscreen.
Anyways, cool movie!",4.5

"Another thing I noticed in my rewatch is that war is a steaming pile of garbage. And that it destroys soldier’s minds, it rips families apart, and makes people suffer even more. It even rips apart towns. You don’t have to be a soldier to feel the effects of war, just by having a relative in the war is enough to feel them. And yes, I get that this movie can be long and tiring, but it’s so realistic and raw. The message is beautifully portrayed by the actors. John Cazale really outdid himself in this role, I appreciated his character more this time.
Another thing that I realized is that we have to be grateful for our lives. The horrors these soldiers went through was atrocious, and we have to pay thanks to those men and women every day for our freedom. I might be against war, but sadly, sometimes it’s needed to fight for our rights.",5.0

"“ONE SHOT”
Deer Hunter is an emotional rollercoaster, that’s for sure. It’s like three films stitched together to form a monstrosity. A story nobody wants to be apart of, but things just kinda happen. Three parts; the before, during, and after of a man and his friends shipping out to the Vietnam war. A recent example it reminded me of was Scorsese’s The Irishman, which is another story of being in a dangerous career that leaves the future of the main protagonist grim.
This film objectively does a lot of stuff great. The cinematography is beautiful, acting is great (especially Streep and Cazale) and the soundtrack is gorgeous. I think this film does atmosphere the best out of any aspect though. The setting feels lived in and lively. No matter where our characters are, they feel apart of the world, and I like that a lot.
I think the biggest issue this film has is it’s pacing. The length isn’t too bad honestly, but a lot of stuff definitely could have been shaved down. There’s multiple scenes that tend to drag on for no real reason. I think each of the acts (except maybe the second one) could have had at least 15 minutes of them cut, and it would’ve fixed the experience as a whole.
I definitely feel a bit conflicted, but Deer Hunter is more than worth your time. It somehow mixes happiness, horror, and hell altogether, and not feel like a mess. At a strong 7, don’t really see myself rewatching, but I can definitely recommend a single watch.

"""A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that but they don't listen.""
A very impressive take on the Vietnam War and especially the trauma that follows after.
It has a lot of slower paced moments but they are all deeply needed to connect to every character and feel for them once the war actually begins. The whole first act covering the wedding does a great job building a bittersweet tone that I feel like will only be even better on rewatches. We are just as unready for the sudden brutality of war as the characters.
The performances are also all amazing, especially DeNiro and Walken; they absolutely killed it in the russian roulette scene. Their friendship and dynamic was a true highlight of the film, and it was heartbreaking to watch as things unfolded.

"‘The Deer Hunter’ Review: A Haunting Take on Vietnam
“The Deer Hunter” is a massive undertaking, a film of immense drama, incredible tension, and impeccable acting. It’s the kind of film that makes you forget about all others, because this is the only one that matters. The emotions it generates are that powerful. 
 
   Michael Cimino’s film rightfully won Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, and even though it probably cost the next year’s “Apocalypse Now” its deserving win because they both take place during the Vietnam War, I don’t care. “The Deer Hunter” is in reality, despite what the Academy may have thought, a very different film from any other war movie I have seen. There are barely any actual war scenes, and you don’t follow characters throughout the duration of the war. You see a few snippets of things that happen to them, but most of the movie takes place, in the first half, before the war, and in the second half, in the aftermath. 
 
   Cimino lets scenes play out for so long that it feels like he is literally stretching scenes out, wringing them for every single ounce of emotional weight possible. At first, I thought that this just added to the film’s runtime of three hours unnecessarily, because most of the dialogue isn’t that important. But by the end of these long scenes, I realized just how important they were. Even if the dialogue is almost useless, what is important is the body language of each character. That tells you everything you need to know, especially because of the stellar cast. These scenes also let you spend more time with the characters, especially in their normal lives before the war, so you get a sense of the trials and tribulations of each person, and you care about what happens to them later.
    
“The Deer Hunter” features one of the greatest casts of all time, not only in star power, but in acting ability that comes through in the movie. Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale are each phenomenal in their roles, and add gravitas, feeling, and nuance to the movie. They are the reason that you care so much.
 
   The other big draw are the famed russian roulette scenes. These scenes are brimming with tension, not only about what happens next, but also because you don’t want anything bad to happen to these characters. 
Those are some of the heaviest and most haunting scenes, along with the ones in the latter half of the film, when De Niro’s character, Michael, returns home. There is a lot of ambiguity about what happened to Nick (Walken), and that is played perfectly be De Niro and Streep, whose characters don’t know what to feel. 
The film is really about what war does to people, and in that sense, it is the best anti-war
Film I have ever seen. It doesn’t rely on blood and guts (although it is present) to make you hate war. It shows you characters you love and invest in, and then tears them apart, which makes you spill tears.
This movie is worth investing three hours into, and that’s probably the highest praise I can give it.",4.5

"If not quite the best Best Picture Oscar winner certainly the one that strikes me as being the most quintessentially American, for better or worse. The first hour is virtually perfect. The Vietnam sequence is obviously “problematic,” but it turns The Deer Hunter into an object that must be contended with. I mostly forgive the Russian Roulette metaphor for reasons of narrative expediency. Cimino shows remarkably little interest in depicting battle, condensing all of the horrors and moral confusion of the War into this one harrowing sequence. It’s a microcosmic point of view that is all the more defensible due to the tight scope used to observe the situation at home. This is not a film about geopolitical concerns. It is a film about human ones. The simultaneous beauty and brutality of America has only fitfully been captured by cinema as it has here.

As much as it is a graphic look at the horrors of the Vietnam War, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a sombre rites-of-passage story.

"A look into the psyche of three US soldiers after fighting in the Vietnam War. This is not as much of a war film as I thought it was, it's more about what soldiers do when they get home. It captures what the horrors of war does to the brain and how hard it is for people with such experiences to live a normal life. It's a tragic film that definitely is required viewing for the war genre.
There are three main characters and they represent the different reactions people can have after fighting in war. First you've got John Savage's character Steven, who's legs had to be amputated and his coming to terms with that. Then you've got Robert De Niro's character Mike, who comes home and seems normal at first glance, but inside he is in constant turmoil. And then finally you have Christopher Walken's character Nick, who's mind is too far gone, still back in war, and rather than coming home he takes his life. These three characters are written brilliantly, and the performances for them are all great. Christopher Walken's best and De Niro's second best.
I tried to nitpick and find issues but everything I initially felt troubled by I put aside after thinking about it for a few seconds like the length. So I have less than a handful of things I didn't like. I thought the music, while worked most of the time, couldn't quite flow with the movie sometimes. I thought they should have shown more scenes in Vietnam, I know it was more about what war does to people and not war but it was such a central part of the movie and it's the shortest act in a three hour movie. Also I didn't like the fact that it ended on a freeze frame. I hate when movies do that.
The movie is filled with with cinematography and scenes that feel like they should be more iconic. I understand this is well known, a classic, and critically acclaimed, but I feel it should be more up there than it is. Beautiful and haunting imagery, emotional writing, fantastic acting, and overall amazing.",4.5

"Um dos melhores filmes de guerra que eu já vi com a maior certeza do mundo, acredito que só perdendo para Apocalypse Now dos que eu vi até agora. Michael Cimino fez aqui um filme pesado, longo e doloroso abordando sobre a guerra do Vietnã, com um ótimo roteiro, utilizando uma ótima cinematografia e atores asiáticos que colaboraram totalmente para a imersão do filme. A atuação do De Niro nessa obra é uma das melhores que eu já vi na vida, a entrega que ele deu nesse filme principalmente no final dele naquela cena da roleta russa foi absurda, e olhe que eu nem considero a melhor atuação dele, realmente um ator fantástico que pra mim é o melhor da história do cinema. Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Christopher Walkin todos muito bem também, eu fiquei impressionado o quão bom foi o filme e quão rápido foi essas 3 horas de duração, preciso ver mais vezes essa obra prima, Deer Hunter se tornou um dos meus filmes favoritos, méritos demais também pela cena final deles cantando God Bless America, vendo que a América na verdade não é tão linda assim, me lembrou muito meu filme favorito Era Uma Vez na América.",5.0
"Não é um filme sobre a Guerra do Vietnã. É sobre as consequências desta e, porque não, de outras guerras. Nenhuma guerra poderia ser celebrada. Não há vencedores e nem perdedores. Só resta corações e mentes quebrantados.
A produção é dirigida pelo Michael Cimino, que pegou um roteiro sobre roleta russa de Cassino em Las Vegas, e modificou isso sobre o contexto da Guerra do Vietnã. O elenco é poderoso, temos Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep e John Cazale. A carreira de John Cazale foi explendida, pena que o mesmo faleceu devido à um câncer, pois era um grande ator e só fez filme gigante.
O filme é longo, tem três horas. Várias reviews em outros sites dão essa duração e quebra de ritmos como motivos para o filme não levar nota máxima. Realmente, tem momentos no filme que tem quebra de ritmo e fica pouco lento, mas a dramatização e as atuações do protagonistas retomam as rédeas do filme e eles retornam aos trilhos.
O filme pode ser divididos em três partes principais:
1 - Temos a primeira parte como a apresentação dos seus personagens, temos um casamento. Uma festa gigante, todo mundo bebendo todas, se divertindo. Porém, tem aquele anseio, pois temos três personagens que foram convocados para a guerra, e estão até nervosos e com expectativas de como será no campo de batalha. O noivo e dois amigos irão para as trincheiras.
2 - Corta para a guerra. E temos as cenas chocantes. É quase um mini zoom do que acontece em ""Apocalypse Now"", pois este foca ainda mais nos horrores da guerra. E temos também as clássicas cenas da roleta russa dos vietcongues.
Apesar que não temos registros históricos que os vietcongues fizeram isso com os americanos ou com reféns. Mas, como contexto cinematográfico é sensacional. O drama dos atores, o nervosismo e a tensão são repassadas com mestria.
3 - Na parte final do filme, temos o retorno de alguns soldados para a América. Observamos as consequências das guerra, não só dos soldados, mas sim dos entes queridos em volta. Todos sofrem, direta ou indiretamente, alguns tentam esconder, outros preferem se preencher daquele vazio de outra forma.
É aqui, para mim, que o ritmo do filme declina. Pois temos praticamente 1 hora de consequência sofrida dos soldados e dos familiares. Mas, os atores seguram as cenas de uma forma sublime. Eles entregam uma carga dramática sensacional, e para mim isso foi fundamental para o filme ser gigante. Por isso que termino aqui e entrego 5 estrelas para a produção.
Não vou escrever mais nada, porque cada cena é preciso ter uma experiência de cada espectador. E são cenas marcantes, vide os últimos 20 minutos de filme.

"I didn't go into this expecting much and for a while I thought this was gonna end up as a three and a half star, but it really grew on me as the film progressed. I'd get bored at times but I really don't think there was a wasted scene or moment. The message and story they're trying to convey wouldn't have worked nearly as well with a shorter runtime or with a faster pace.
Something I liked was that the technical aspects like cinematography, editing, and score slowly got better and better as the story progressed, just like the overall quality of the film did.
This gritty and serious narrative is told through two POVs. We have Nick's that's about what war does to people and how far from reality it takes them and we have Michael's that's about how an experience like war can teach you the value of life and to not risk it or end it for no reason. A tragic story on one end and an uplifting one on the other.
I didn't write a ton of notes for this one because to be honest I don't have much to say. A really effective film that's not one of my all-time-favorites, but is something I'm really glad I watched and something I'd recommend to anyone who hasn't.

"Man, am i glad i saw this again, always loved it, recently its kinda went up in my ranks but this rewatch just solidified its place in my top films.
Start to finish a flawless and moving masterclass depicting war's lasting effect. Come and See may be the most ''anti-war'' film ever made when it comes to the war itself, but the latter half of this movie explore the damage thats done after the combat experience and the fact that we're only in the war for maybe a 30 minute stretch in this 3 hour movie and it still stands as one of the biggest critiques of war in film speaks volumes. 
The pacing is absolutely flawless to me, i was never for a second bored, the few scenes we get in vietnam are intense and flawlessly written, which honestly describes this whole movie. The dynamics build between the characters, the dialogue that feels so natural, the genuinly amazing preformances from everyone in the film just adds together for this absolute colossus of a film. 
SPOILERS: 
After Nicky is lost in vietnam we see Mike sort of take his place. Physically it goes back to normal but there's this underlying sense of dread, it's like completing a puzzle and still feeling like a piece is missing, Nick as we see cant be saved from the effect vietnam had on him and he cant come back home, even with Mike there to fill the physical space in Linda's life there's still a gaping hole there that can never be resolved. This is just one of the many examples of how The Deer Hunter shows you how literally nothing good comes from the war.
It's why i prefer films like this that have the balls to not paint war in any form of picture that can be used to get something good out of. It's why i will never see something like Saving Private Ryan as a good war movie, trying to twirl in sparks of ''brotherhood'' or ''heroism'' cause these are things people think they will get from war, some sort of reward or golrious sacrifice and i will take the scene where everyone sits around at a dinner table with nothing to say and nothing to draw from the events that occured.

"This is the movie about tragedy to beat all tragedy’s. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made, while at the same time being one of the most difficult to watch. With in-depth war scenes that don’t have a run time that lasts nearly as long as it does in our heads, this movie decides to exploit the horrors of war. Yet more importantly, this movie believes that the horrors of war are what happen once getting back and how everyone around the soldiers are affected, just as much as them. Truly a powerful film that helps creates everything we see in movies today.
Michael Cimino was an excellent story teller. When it came to his writing and directing, he understood the importance of purpose. He understood that there was a purpose to have the first third of this over three hour long war Tragedy to take place at home with the characters families. We do not see the war field until the two hour mark, and this is for a purpose. Cimino understood the process of building well structured and relatable characters, so when we see the horrors of war, there is a much more visceral reaction that we feel connected with. This is the art of movie making at its finest point.
The story of ‘The Deer Hunter’ is told in three parts, before the war, the war, and returning from the war. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken both show different sides of the same character going through a traumatic challenge like war. Each actor plays their character with nuance, even the side characters that seem to not bring as much to the story. This is what the art of acting is all about, and it is important to understand that the difficulty shown on screen, is something not everyone can find in themselves to show.
There are many aspects of this film that are flawless, the cinematography is one of them. A complex shot ratio of intense close ups with gorgeous mountain landscape shots bring this beautiful film together. With the imagery of how nature is shot and viewed, through many different locations, we get to view how beautiful the world was then. Truly a magical look through the eyes of Vilmos Zsigmond.
There is heart to ‘The Deer Hunter’, there is passion and there is love. This movie dances with many ideas about what meaning is after the safeness of life is torn away from people. This movie explores every aspect of perfect filmmaking, and it endures the test of time, holding up 45 years later. Truly a masterpiece if there ever was one, and one that should be watched and studied and enjoyed for years.",5.0

Toda a ambientação no Vietnã é excelente, principalmente como em momento algum passa o pano pra nenhum dos lados apesar de dar destaque pra crueldade vitamina como na perturbadora sequência do campo de prisoneiros.
A fotografia é linda e a trilha sonora é ótima.

"I have two word for this film:
Fuckin’
A
I’ll be real honest and say that for a third of this film I was completely confused. Why on earth were we spending an entire hour of a war movie at some wedding. But as The Deer Hunter went on, I kept returning to what these characters once were. 
Before Vietnam, we witnessed young men beginning their lives. One was getting married while the other was making plans to get married and the other was kinda doing his own thing. But it all falls apart as soon as the movie drastically changes to Vietnam. 
The editing of this film gives no time for transition. Just like these men were, the audience is thrown into bloodily battle and psychological torture from the serene countryside and security of loved ones. The roulette scenes never ceased to be unnerving and it was hard to gauge what was going to happen as tension rose and rose and rose to impossible heights. (I finally understand that Call of Duty is not as brilliant as fourteen year old me thought and that Black Ops just rips directly from The Deer Hunter.) 
Yet after the war is when the trauma is felt. Again, I found myself seeing these characters who I’d seen as happy and loving transformed into scarred and beaten prisoners of war and then released with their chains still clattering against each other. The acting and direction in The Deer Hunter are both incredible. The signs of PTSD are played out so naturally and effectively. From seeing a revolver to hearing a tin pan clatter on the ground to the fear of silence, De Niro and the other soldiers portray their characters magnificently. Each has their own results from the trauma and each is effective in their own way at showing how different Vietnam made them. 
In conclusion, if you’re watching The Deer Hunter and waiting for the action to kick in: relax. Enjoy these boys and their lovably drunken selves party with one another. These are ghosts of the men who landed in Vietnam and left their souls in Saigon. The Deer Hunter is a powerful movie in its perception of the Vietnam War and expertly crafts a tale of PTSD and other scars brought home by the brave men who returned from war. It is a heavy movie, but it is fantastic and I highly recommend it for any sort of character study or Vietnam film.

"Deservedly, The Deer Hunter is seen as one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 1970s. The Deer Hunter is a true spectacle from Michael Cimino. The film’s portrayal of the horrors of war and the bonds between the characters is undeniably powerful and makes for an evocative and thought-provoking narrative. The cinematography, handled by Vilmos Zsigmond, is absolultey wonderful. It's epic and gorgeous when it needs to be but claustrophobic and horrifying when the story calls for it. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale and John Savage are all amazing in their respective roles. Their performances were so genuine that at times I almost forgot they were acting and they all give themselves wholeheartedly to the material. Despite it’s shortcomings, The Deer Hunter makes for a very compelling and profoundly moving watch with an amazing cast.",4.0
"""The Deer Hunter"" ist ein sehr ungewöhnlicher Kriegsfilm, weil er nur sehr selten im Krieg spielt, der Krieg trotzdessen allgegenwärtig ist. Es ist auch ein Film, der jede einzelne Minute sehr nötig hat. Die erste Stunde hätte man nicht kürzen können, da Cimino dort das schöne Leben in der Heimat sehr ausführlich zeigt, damit man sich in der Heimat heimisch fühlt und damit der Krieg und die darauffolgende Traumatisierung den Zuschauer noch härter trifft. In der ersten Stunde ist noch alles perfekt, jeder hat Spaß, liebt das Leben und fügt sich perfekt in die Idylle der Berge und Natur ein. Doch Vietnam ändert das alles schlagartig. Plötzlich sind wir mit der Härte des Krieges und des Lebens konfrontiert und für immer gezeichnet. Wenn Michael nach Vietnam in die Heimat zurückkehrt, ist er nicht mehr der Gleiche, er ist traumatisiert und geschockt vom Krieg und wirkt wie ein Fremdkörper in der idyllischen Heimat. Vietnam, der Krieg, hat aus ihm einen Fremdkörper gemacht, der fehl am Platz ist. Vietnam ist nun seine wahre Heimat. Zunehmend verhält er sich auch so wie im Krieg, indem er russiches Roulette spielt, sogar gegen seine besten Freunde. Dabei will er seiner Heimat und ihrer Idylle gar nicht schaden, was sich zeigt, wenn er den Hirsch verschont. Doch auch die anderen sind sehr stark gezeichnet von Vietnam. Die einen wurden körperlich zerstört, die anderen widerum wurden psychisch zerstört. Das Leben wird an keinem Ort mehr so schön sein, wie es einmal war, der Krieg hat ihnen die Auge geöffnet, ihnen gezeigt, dass das Leben hart und kalt ist.
""The Deer Hunter"" ist die vielleicht spannenste Dekonstruierung des Krieges überhaupt. Er zeigt auf schonungslose Art, dass der Krieg eine sehr harte Sache ist. Dabei ist Ciminos Meisterwerk auf fast jeder Ebene makellos und zurecht ein Klassiker der Antikriegsfilme.",4.5

"An incredibly powerful movie—emotionally profound, gut-wrenching and meaningful still. THE DEER HUNTER dispels the glamour of war and brings home the fragility of life, friendship and love. Top-notch acting makes it feel so real and not a movie! Robert De Niro spent six weeks in the Ohio Valley steel-producing region mingling with the locals to develop his screen character Michael. Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, the epic, three-act drama takes an intimate look at working-class friends torn apart by the Vietnam War and explores the harsh effects of it on a small industrial town in Pennsylvania. One of the best epic movies ever made.

"Würde man The Deer Hunter auf seine zweifellos absolut ikonischen Szenen rund um das Russische Roulette reduzieren, würde man dem Film Unrecht tun. Cimino zeichnet ein enorm düsteres Bild vom Vietnam-Krieg und lässt sich viel Zeit dafür. Wenn der Film kritisiert wird, dann für seine Länge.
Er nutzt diese Länge aber äusserst effizient. Der erste Akt besteht fast nur aus einer Hochzeitsfeier im heimischen Pennsylvania und man lernt eine ganz normale Clique aus dem Arbeitermilieu gut kennen. Erst dadurch entfaltet sich die Wirkung der folgenden Ereignisse mit voller Wucht. Dass mit De Niro, Walken, Streep, Cazale und den anderen ein brillanter Cast am Start ist, tut sein übriges.
Nein, The Deer Hunter ist nicht zu lang, sondern zu Recht ein wichtiges Stück Filmgeschichte, auch über die ikonischen Szenen hinaus.",4.5
"88/100
First rewatch and I gotta say is the Russian roulette scene during the war is a rip 5 scene of all time in my books, incredible once again.
I love the structure of the film so much, to see the group before after and during the war is something rarely done and never done as welll as this. I found The first hour runs a little long 
Second time around but I’d still say it’s well paced for a three hour film and not one that will bore you.
It’s an extremely anti-war film showing us the heartbreaking pain caused physically and mentally by the war in both Nicky and Steve, one man has lost his mind and soul to the war (Nicky)  and the other has lost his legs (Steve) whereas Michael is home safely with minor physical and mental damage which we get to see when he goes to deer hunt and dosnt have the heart to shoot the deer anymore. Each of these men’s story are able to showcase to us clearly why war is a tragedy and not a triumph.
The cinematography is amazing, the mountain shots in the second deee hunt are some of the most stunning shots in film and the soundtrack is good. Of course it’s very high level acting from De Niro, Streep, Cazale ( RIP an absolute legend) and Chris Walken and just overall brilliant.
De Niro, Streep and Cazale do not miss.",5.0
"Cimino exterioriza uma desolação, um distanciamento latente em cada quadro do homem que é evidenciado como uma figura obscurecida pelo trauma. Embora seja um filme grandioso, ele preserva umas sutilezas na encenação que fazem toda diferença, que transborda do micro ao macro. São homens em meio à escuridão do padecimento físico e moral que não se distancia da guerra nem mesmo em suas terras que por sua vez está tão em ruína quanto em meio ao conflito.

"Not sure I have much to add beyond what Aster brilliantly wrote about but what occurred to me wasn't so much the Vidor of The Crowd, which is certainly there, but the Vidor of Northwest Passage. The accusations of racism that have been lodged at this film for decades are correct (obviously) but I'm less interested in them as they a manifestation of Cimino's own complicated worldview than how they act more as a direct line towards prior racist and imperial films of the prior decades. The personification of the Vietnamese is in line with how earlier American filmmakers depicted the Natives of the land during imperial conquests - they're faceless, malicious, violent savages without a shred of humanity and so they're easy targets for an audience to see as enemies and otherize (assuming the audience in question doesn't already have their own racist inclinations). But it's not just Vidor, it's a tradition we can see within many classical American directors, whether it be Ford or King, to say nothing of DeMille - another spectacle director for whom a case could be made for influencing Cimino. In this way, Cimino is a quintessentially American filmmaker, for he shows not America not just what we think it is, but how it really is. He recognizes that it's built off the backs of the working class, but that the working class aren't this pure body. They can be trained, their idealism for a ""better world"" and ""freedom"" can so easily be corrupted and tainted with otherism. He's a nationalist but not in the same way we think of it today. America's beauty and tragedy and horrors and anger and pain aren't isolated fractions of the cultural psychology, they exist within the entire nation, intermingled and inextricable.",0.0

Pendant le film, je ne pensais pas mettre plus de 4, car je n'arrivais pas à prendre du recul sur ce qui m'était montré. Et puis je sorti de la salle, et impossible de me détacher du film. L'écriture est trop forte, le message trop puissant, les acteurs trop bons. Cimino l'a d'ailleurs compris, et la durée du film est expliquée dans ces longs plans où le réalisateur laisse simplement son/ses comédien(s) s'exprimer. Le thème musical est divin, tout comme certaines astuces de mise en scène : Cimino s'amuse plusieurs fois à rendre visible le travail de l'image, en passant d'un plan pov à un tracking shot, ou en accélérant un travelling d'exposition par exemple (tout le temps tombé dans le panneau pour ma part).

my one gripe is with the heavy-handed portrayal of the vietnamese characters: while i understand that this was made pretty freshly after the vietnam war, it could’ve been handled differently. i’m trying to get better at being able to critique outdated/underdeveloped parts of things that i otherwise really enjoy, though.

Recommended by Ali
To think that this is one of the first anti-war films to tackle the Vietnam War is quite something that feels not only powerful in how it portrays the aftermath of the war, but also heartbreaking in how it affects the characters’ mental mindset afterwards. Even though the first hour does have some audio editing issues and may get a bit dragged in the wedding scene for too long, I was invested in the overall story and gives us amazing performances from Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken that gave us one of the scariest portrayals of Russian roulette that’s ever been filmed. Quite horrifying.

"Self important, oversimplified and shallow, with a very dated outlook on the American military and the tragedy of Vietnam. Frames it entirely around the suffering of the American soldiers, and largely ignores how much worse it was for the Vietnamese people. Ultimately, what sinks this so completely is the insultingly slow pacing. There is about an hour's worth of story here stretched over 3 miserable, ponderous, endless hours.

"I finally saw this great film by Cimino, considered one of the best films in the history of cinema, and I totally agree!
What I saw left me speechless, from every point of view there is perfection, from the visual to the sound point of view, from the direction to the screenplay.
This is a very rare quality film, in which Cimino succeeds in everything he set out to do and convey to the viewer (although not at all at the time, having been heavily criticized in Europe for being a fascist and celebrator of America and the war against ""the bad Vietcong"").
The film portrays an era, a nation and its mistakes, but above all portraying the human being, with his strengths and weaknesses, his hopes, madness, violence, desire for oppression and ugliness, all this pervades the film with a sort of uselessness of life, which finds its maximum expression in the macabre Russian roulette.
Incredibly iconic, numerous scenes such as those of Russian roulette, that of the final dialogue between de Niro and Walken (immensely touching and moving), the scene in which the character of de Niro and the deer ""look at each other"" and a thousand others.
This movie undoubtedly made it into my favorite movies list of all time.

Heavy As Fuck!,4.5
"Less about the actual experience of war itself and more about how it changes the people who go and their perception of the world around them; the Deer Hunter tells the story of three factory workers from rural Pennsylvania, starting on the eve of their deployment to Vietnam and ending with their return home, having left either some or all of themselves over there, in one way or another.
The Deer Hunter is a brutal and often ugly slog of a film. The Russian roulette scene serving as the story's centrepiece is especially intense and hard to watch, but it's more than that. There is a pervasive sense of sadness ingrained into every beat of the story. Even the early going, the first hour encompassing a wedding and a hunting trip, has this Sword of Damocles hanging overhead as even the most casual conversations drift eventually back to how these three men are going to war.
If there was one fault with the film, it comes in the final scene. Without spoiling, it features the ironic use of a song that feels entirely too on the nose given the events that have preceded, and unfortunately robs the climactic moments of the power that the last three hours spent building up.",4.0
"THE AFTERMATH OF WAR
It's a metaphorical war masterpiece. It also covers the aftermath of war PTSD. A 3 hour movie which will be a great experience to watch.
Robert De Niro was fantastic and potrayed a soldier's pain and stress effortlessly. Christopher Walken is a really good actor. The climax was just painful to watch. His acting was so powerful.
The Vietnam landscapes are true to surface. It's a real classic. The Russian roulette scene was intense and anxiety inducing scene and was unforgettable.

"Michael Cimino ""gets"" America, almost as much as America didn't ""get"" him. The first hour of rugged, soulful Americana, culminating in the first hunt between the lads and the beautiful wedding scene, is so masterfully constructed and authentic that it makes the -admittedly intense- Vietnam segments pale in comparison (and feel derivative of Coppola, even though this one preceded Apocalypse Now in release, if not in production, as well). The notorious Russian Roulette denouement (which I had seen years and years ago for some, now oblivious, reason) has been talked to death already, so focusing on the small important gestures and character building of the first half (and, partly, the third act) felt like a critical obligation on my part; highlighting the deep-rooted -through God and country- communities that are now all but lost (due to demoralization and disenfranchisement - the Vietnam War being one of the most fatal blows to American masculinity) for millions belonging in the newer (and future) generations.",4.0
"Checking off the Best Picture Winners I hadn’t seen, and this happened to be on Peacock. What a depressing experience. It’s a Vietnam war film made in the immediate aftermath of the war, so the pain of it was fresh for most audiences when they saw it in 1978. A group of steelworkers in rural Pennsylvania enlist in the Army, but their experience forever alters them.
Christopher Walken earned his own Academy Award for his performance, a worthy choice. Today he’s largely a punchline on the internet for his weird acting style, but this film proves he’s always had great talent within him. De Niro is also good, with a quiet intensity that explodes one he’s in Vietnam. John Savage doesn’t fare so well, in comparison to the other two stars he’s forgettable.
The film is an exercise in excess, the runtime three hours long in order to accommodate many scenes that could have been trimmed down. The opening act wedding sequence drags and varies in the importance of the details it tells the viewer. Many in the audience will lapse in attention, finally brought back with the deer hunting scene that shockingly smash cuts into Vietnam.
This is the best part of the film because it’s so appalling, since the contrast to life at home is direct. True horror is playing with your own life through a one in six chance of the bullet being in the chamber of a gun pointed at your head. Walken in particular is great in that scene, broken by such intense emotional pressure.
The final third shows the three’s impossibility in coming back to home life. The soldiers are strangers in their own hometown, and nothing will ever be the same for them or those who stayed. Meryl Streep is the weepy former flame of Walken, who can no longer come home to such innocence. Her hurt is powerful, and she makes the most of a relatively small role.
The central metaphor of hunting deer and hunting humans doesn’t get enough connective tissue to hold the movie together, and it spins its wheels too much in a few respects. But this is still a powerful movie, one that confronts trauma and questions what it means to be patriotic in America. I haven’t seen the other 1978 nominees for best picture yet, but I do wonder if this one will be topped. Three and a half stars.",3.5
"Recommendation Watchlist #7 || Jackson
[58]
Director Michael Cimino's (this acting as my first encounter with the filmmaker) The Deer Hunter has long been on my backlog of films to watch. It seems like through osmosis that the infamous Russian roulette scene would crop up in any film enthusiasts scouting for an example of one of the best acting scenes in film. However, much has been said about the very inclusion of Russian roulette as employed by the Viet Cong in POW camps — something that has reportedly never been factually found as a practice by North Vietnamese forces. Notwithstanding the point in fact that the North Vietnamese in the film are depicted as sadomasochistic racists. Problematic in this way, indeed; however, the inclusion of Russian roulette here is the thematic fulcrum of the story, a story that more reads like a fantastic parable than one taking a vital interest in historical verisimilitude.
The film is about five friends more than it is about the war itself (scenes of the war occupying roughly 40 minutes of its 184-minute runtime), though it remains one of the first American productions to highly criticize the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War — which may be the largest indicator as to why it took home the covetous Best Picture Oscar since politically-minded films that seek to concuss the status quo more often than not snag the top prize. Five friends, three of which enlist to fight in the jungle of Vietnam, all reeling from its two prominent members — in Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken's characters — and their deadly affinity for defying death time and time again after a brutal thralldom in a small prisoner of war hut on the shores of the River Kwai.
It is a decidedly compelling premise: the decay of friendship, physical bodies, and mental fortitude following time spent in war. The film's prelude practically opens in a hellish landscape, a metalworks factory with molten metal cascading in an imitative brook of manmade magma, a fiery symphony of sparks shooting into the ashen air as our group of friends — equipped in protective gear — toil in a manufactured hell. Fitting then that they later trade one hell for another in the dense greenery of wartorn, napalmed Vietnam.
But however compelling that initial scaffolding may be, and despite three hours of film used to convey that narrative, The Deer Hunter yet registers as thinly expressed. There is roughly one hour of this film that is quite tremendous: the sojourn into the mountains prior to deployment, Vietnam, and the climactic duel of fates in the underworld of Saigon during the Liberation. The rest is in watching wheels turning. Not to say there is nothing of interest otherwise, but there is a lofty amount of scenes that feel distended or lacking in emotional heft. Detractions can be found in the story engines of the Act One wedding (which vastly overstays its welcome, as if trying to find a combatant in The Godfather's much better wedding sequence), and in De Niro's repatriation and further love interest in Meryl Streep, who is a frightfully unenthusiastic presence here — which, firstly, is shocking since she is routinely spellbinding in other works, and secondly, in Cimino's apparent inability to assemble her character in preproduction, telling Streep to effectively write her own lines.
Easy to see why this is so beloved in certain circles, and it has no shortage of iconic, deeply affecting sequences, but there is still much to be desired here nonetheless. However, the film's central conceit in the role reversal between De Niro and Walken as either the virile sadomasochist or peacemaking lover as the film moves on is perhaps the film's greatest attribute, next to the performances at large and the audiovisual feast of mountainous America and emaciated Vietnam. A wonder in several ways, but ultimately it falls short of greatness.",3.0
"From the mountains to the prairies...
To the oceans white with foam...
God bless America, my home sweet home...
God bless America, my home sweet home...
There's a slight flaw in Letterboxd's summary provided for this film...after you watch The Deer Hunter, you'll know what it is...
...
You can have your opinions about this film's pacing, or how the majority of its three hours was wasted, or your difficult time connecting with its characters, but I will say this movie led me to discover a whole new emotion that I can hardly put into words...it's like a longing to escape with the full knowledge that it won't get better...and as a viewer, it's difficult to say how I sympathize with this concept because I've lived such a contented life...it's not so much ""the grass is always greener"" as it is ""everything is ruined, so hold your friends tightly""...
Usually with these three-hour epics, I hesitate to gauge how much time is left during the less dramatic moments, but the drama is so densely packed (though people tend to think it meanders on), that I had no inclination to check...I just wanted to take in every frame...there are SO many locations, and they return to most of them, but each carries a specific weight to itself...
Ofc the wedding and homelife is super light, then WHAM! we're in Vietnam with thick black smoke (I could feel the humidity, my mouth went dry from dehydration), so the most iconic scenes were even heavier with tension and conflict and suspense, then we get home and it's definitely not as light as before (it is, quite possibly, heavier than the initial Vietnam scene) as the drama kicks into the highest gear...I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but it just gets heavier and heavier until these weights are lifted off your back so you can breathe...but again...everything is ruined, so hold your friends tightly...
The whole thing works off of this balance where the scale is gradually tipping to one side, and if someone could just catch it before it spills, things might be alright...so you're rooting (at least I was) for that someone to catch the scale no matter what/how long it takes...my point is...who cares how long this film was...??...it was gorgeous and tense and full of emotion...in the brilliant words of the eloquent David Lynch, ""who gives a fu*ckin' shi*t how long a scene is...??""
...
That being said, we transition from the analytical portion of this review to the technical praises...first off, I have to mention the acting...now...I am no expert on acting whatsoever...I make TikToks for goshsake...but these performers soar above the world...
Robert De Niro...in my humblest opinion (seriously, this is probably the humblest opinion you've ever heard), this is one of De Niro's best performances yet...dude, he's got a he*lluva career, but when I Google ""Robert De Niro movies,"" The Deer Hunter shows up between Dirty Grandpa and Meet the Fockers...talk about an overlooked performance...@JonVoight sorry fam I think your Oscar belongs to this guy, there must've been a mixup...jk I'm pretty sure someone liked your performance in that other Vietnam movie from the same year...
Christopher Walken...yeah swipe that Oscar right quick, your baby face deserved it, dude...Meryl Streep lights up the screen as always...I loved her natural voice here...John Savage is hauntingly good, that ""socks"" scene (of all parts) brought two tears to my eyes...Dzundza, Aspegren, and Alda were fabulously supportive and necessary...oh, the people reffing the ""game"" did an outstanding job of making me HATE them with all my might (esPECIALLY the younger one...mao, mao, mao, stf*u for once can you stf*u...?)...and ofc John Cazale is brilliant as usual...a short-lived but star-studded career and legacy you led, Fredo, rest in peace...
The shots were beautiful...I love the use of silhouettes and shadows...it reminded me so much of their use in Heart of Darkness (and no, I'm not just saying that bc Apocalypse Now is also a Vietnam movie)...from the Pennsylvania steel yard to the bar to the MOUNTAINS to a bustling Vietnam street to its aftermath from the ""shi*t-storm,"" the sets were all just so impressive and tied the atmospheres together...worlds apart...excellent excellent camerawork...
Lastly, the music certainly enhanced the experience...I've listened to ""Cavatina"" several times as I put together this review...the musical selections just worked...""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You""...ahh...don't think I didn't notice...
If I have ANY criticism of the film...it's the director...not the direcTING...the direcTOR...Cimino, rest in peace, there's some sketchy shi*t goin' down here and you knew it...I guess it takes a lot of random decisions, a lack of research/authenticity, and dancing your cast to exhaustion to get that Oscar, but dude...your career died shortly after, so I guess...sorry...?
...
I don't exactly know how to end this review, but I have nothing left to say for now, so just know that you should watch this movie and form your own opinion before any of these reviews (including and especially mine) convince you of something before you've even seen it...
For me...The Deer Hunter gets 5/5 stars as it is a masterpiece... I think I'll be the only one of my friends to think so, but that doesn't matter...everything is ruined anyway, so I should just hold them tightly...I suppose I'll end it in the cheesiest way I think I can...and that's with the big-boy quotation...

"Honestly the most stressful part for me was the beginning when everyone’s all happy and dancing
A true story about Michael Cimino: in high school I wrote my first movie script with my friend nick, and his mom knew Michael, and Michael offered to read our script and give us some advice. And our script was an incredibly stupid comedy that had no plot, and Michael must have been a great guy because he actually tried to give us constructive, thoughtful advice, god bless him. Never met him but over email he was real nice to two very stupid kids
So yeah, finally checked deer hunter out! It’s great. If it wasn’t so long I feel like it would be more widely considered one of the great movies of all time. Movies about the Vietnam War seem to either be satirical (Apoc Now) or sincere bordering on sentimental (Platoon), and this is one of the latter ones. As someone emotionally paralyzed by irony I normally hold sentimentality against a movie, but I think it can be easily forgiven when it’s a movie about actual real life horrors instead of, like, some liberal arts kid just being soft as hell",5.0

I don't find it to be offensive, no, but it's fair to regard it either as a drama using Vietnam war as a narrative backdrop, or a failed attempt at propaganda. I understand the filmmaker's effort at delivering an anti-war message, but doing so by reducing Vietcongs into one-dimensional villains throwing grenades gratuitiously at their own people is a tad bit underhand, and ironically, backfires the film at its core.

"A ""coming home"" picture in all essence that I have trouble deducing into anything but an elaborate, full-blooded American-style character study dressed with European film intimacies, but without the European masters' willingness to innovate. The rehabilitation of Michael from a psychological misfit to a brother of sacrifice that occurs in the third act of the picture isn't so much objectionable - as it makes the film feel not too far off from The Best Years of Our Lives, and the dark and murky layers developed in the first act are allowed to clear up and become useful signposts to the idea of country as a therapeutic foundation for the emotionally stunted - but rather points to a conservatism (which is no surprise to anyone) that has no conviction to be about what it is, while the emotional comfort food of more middling films of this subgenre, like Hal Ashby's Coming Home, have twice the sense of indoctrinatory purpose with half of this film's running time and supposed dramatic and psychological complexity, which is more than redundant and evasive by the third quarter. The film's subversiveness lies in its teasing apart of an American community, proposing that the Other is mostly created in our minds, its un-subversion in that the film is about Us, not Them. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a career looking at this sort of story of Id, Ego, and Nation, and this uneasy combining of the macro and the navel-gazing is where I part ways.",3.0

“Um exemplo de pesquisa efetuada por Cimino acerca do cenário: ele explicou (em «American Cinematographie», outubro 1978) como ele tinha construído visualmente o sítio da sua pequena cidade da Pensilvânia, utilizando oito exteriores diferentes, filmados em Ohio: único meio de conseguir, segundo ele, com que uma usina se perfile no horizonte em cada um dos planos gerais de exteriores que figuram nas seqüências que deveriam transcorrer na Pensilvânia.“

"“To Nick.”
First things first: the portrayal of the Vietnamese was very problematic and there is a lot of discourse surrounding this issue. With that in mind I felt uncomfortable during those scenes and not just because the Russian Roulette motif is heavy and difficult to watch. The roulette felt very mismatched with the rest of the film, it did make the film very tense but I am not sure if it worked every time. 
The quick cuts between scenes from the friends being together, to the war, to a hospital were so jarring and really put me on edge (in a successful way).
The way that Nick (Christopher Walken) and Robert De Niro (Michael) portray their postwar selves was great but the one that hurt me the most was Steven (John Savage) in the cage waiting to play Russian Roulette. It was truly heartbreaking. 
The final scene with Michael and Nick was painful. 
Meryl Streep (Linda) the woman that you are. Gorgeous and beautiful but also loving: to take the role to be close to her dying partner John Cazale (Stanley) in his last few months was so bittersweet to read about.",3.5
"2022 has been important for me as someone who likes movies because this year has led me to finally knock off some of the movies I've been dying to watch for years. I've been trying to watch The Deer Hunter for the better part of a decade. De Niro, Cazale, Walken, Savage and its an Academy Award winning film about Vietnam? Sign me up! That said, I am slightly disappointed in the framing of this movie, with the Americans being the good guys doing good things and the Viet Cong being heartless and evil, and the weird kind of nuance Cimino employs by making the French exploitative (Like the Americans weren't?). Aside from that, the film is very commendable, and feels like it broke ground for what came afterwards in America's view of the Vietnam War. De Niro is fantastic and so is Streep along with everyone else, and there's some beautiful shots to boot. It's earned its reputation.",4.5
"I've maintained hatred of the Deer Hunter since I first rented it on netflix's mail-based dvd rental service in the early 2000s. I didn't expect my mind to be changed watching it now about twenty years later but at least now can provide some details regarding why i don't like it, and can even see there's stuff here I did enjoy.
I like the first hour of this film. I like the altman-esque sound design with all these ball-busting, bullshitting guys talking over each other. I like the wedding, I like the old russian orthodox grandmas who look and behave exactly like the older women in my family except white instead of brown. I love soaking in this sort of small-town minutiae because of my roots, and as my friend Efrim described, I think the final transitionary scene into the second act is a wonderful way to close the book on this piece while foreshadowing the tragic loss of innocence these young men are about embark upon.
Instead, though, the movie carries on for two more boob-less hours. We feel sad about the white guys while being taught to view the vietnamese as torturous savages (funny, i thought it was the other way around?) and one of the leads gets weirdly addicted to russian roulette and makes a small fortune becoming the local legend of it in saigon. This shit is beyond stupid, and the film, for all it's notoreity and accolades, is disgustingly racist. I think you can safely skip this one and just watch First Blood as the superior text on vietnam and PTSD from this era.
By far the worst part of this film though, is how much it's going to drag down Letterboxd's aggregate ranking of Robert DeNiro on my stats page. I don't find pleasure in lying to myself, and I hate lying to other people, so it's just going to have to be something I'll get over.",1.0

הסרט לוקח את הזמן ונותן לנו להכיר את הדמויות, באווירה קלילה כיפית ומלאת הומור מטורף אנחנו מתחברים אליהן אחת אחת. בשלב הזה הסרט לא שם לב לנרטיב אלא יותר מנסה לתת לנו תחושת שייכות. למרות זאת תמיד יש ברקע תחושה מעט לא נוחה שמשהו מאוד רע הולך לקרות.
לאחר מכן יש מלא רולטות רוסיות והמון ספויילרים אך כשהמוטיבים מההתחלה חוזרים על עצמם כשהגיבורים חוזרים מוויאטנם אתה מבין כמה המלחמה השפיעה. ולא רק על החברה כולה אלא על האינדבידואל רדוף הטראומות שמנסה לשוב למקום היחיד בו הוא מרגיש חי, בתוך לבה של התופת.
אני מבין שהויאטנמים בסרט לא מקבלים כתוביות כדי להוריד מהאנושיות שלהם אבל זה קצת מעצבן אותי כי זה עושה רומנטיזציה היסטורית לאמריקאים במלחמה ומוציא את האשמה מהמעשים הנוראיים שגם הם עשו.

"Great art can change the lens through which you view the world. The Deer Hunter is a juxtaposition of many different things that illuminate a common thread of ritual. Man cannot exist without ritual, even in hell. Even after the scrambling of a culture, ""Is that a Russian name?"" ""It's American."" Russian Roulette in Vietnam, an already corrupted form of a game that has further become un-tethered from it's motherland.
Ritual grants us a sense of ourselves within existence. A man shouting into the cliffs to hear his voice echo back to him confirms his place in space and time in the same way that marriage does, that going hunting does, eating and drinking together does, singing together does, and a gun to the head with 5 empty chambers does. These abstract things orient us far more than anything material ever could. Nick forgoes making his phone call home, even after consulting with his wallet photograph of Linda. It's not enough.
""Mike who?""
Nick doesn't even recognize him until he plays the game and Michael intuitively knows that it's the only hope he has of getting through to him. Back when they were in captivity Michael broke the rules of the game to free them, he exited the game, seemingly rightfully so, but there's something in the way that Nick is portrayed in the end that seems to indicate that he has some form of high ground over Michael. Dressed all in white, a man riding an incredible streak of luck, he has unlocked something that Michael hasn't. He has found something that has allowed him to make sense of his life in hell, perhaps knowing that he can never successfully return to the normal world and engage in anything that would be meaningful to him ever again. Michael begs him and tries to get him to remember home, with the mountains and the trees. We see a faint remembrance of these things flutter across Walken's performance, largely the word ""home"" and the idea of a physical place where he came from and belongs to has become something beyond his comprehension. And in the end it's too little too late, he's claimed by the rules of both of their games simultaneously. ""One shot.""
Michael breaks the rules and rejects tradition and ritual, he goes sprinting naked down the street, he flirts with his best friend's girlfriend, he refuses a welcome home party, he asks for three bullets. But he has a firm ritual of his own ""One shot. I try to tell people and they don't listen."" A man cannot exist without rules, even if the rules only make sense to him. The film ends on a wide shot, Michael is finally assimilated into a group ritual.
I'm not sure I fully grasp everything going on in The Deer Hunter, and in this case I consider that a gift given to me from the work. As bleak as this one is I would gladly swim again in the waters of this strange dream on film. I have a feeling that even after one hundred viewings I could only return enlightened. This is a work that will, and has stood the test of time not only because it's a stunning technical achievement in it's slavish adherence to hard brutal and beautiful realism, but also because it grapples with deeply rooted aspects of what it means to be alive and small and humbled by God's vast creation and the very rules of reality itself.

"Added to: Sight and Sound Greatest Films
To address the elephant in the room first, here’s the link of an article written by Steven Biel who eloquently laid out both sides of argument regarding the political, racist issues of The Deer Hunter. I recommend anyone to have a read first, especially if you think the film is a flawless masterpiece, because it’s not.
Let see the bright side first, I like the film's three-act structure, its depiction of the American working class and the second/third generation of the European immigrants in America, its powerful execution of the controversial Russian roulette sequence, its illustration of PTSD and the psychological trauma following a life-threatening event, its thorough character study, lyrical music and splendid cinematography. But every now and then the film rubs me the wrong way.
The film is very problematic in its presentation of the Vietnam war, especially when the filmmakers and producers describing the film as apolitical, surrealistic, and allegorical. The argument I heard most often is that the Russian roulette is only a metaphor, it’s not necessarily talking about Vietnam war but wars in general. That's nonsense. There’s no such thing as a ""apolitical film"" since acquiring a ""apolitical stance"" is already a political decision. And don’t forget the film ends with the characters gathering after a funeral and singing ""God Bless America"", its cheaply sentimental and overtly patriotic.
The Russian roulette sequence happens in the middle session of the film and serves to be the turning point of the three principal characters in their life. They are captured by the sadistic Viet Cong and impelled to play the deadly game apparently while the Viet Cong soldiers betting who would be (or not be?) shot in the head. Later in the chaotic Saigon, we also have scenes showing this Russian roulette as a seemingly underground routine of gambling, and the involved party is mainly East Asians.
From my point of view, the decision of using the sadistic game as a generalization of horror is too insensitive. It indirectly (whether intentional or not) diminishes the importance of asking the fundamental question: why the characters were put in that scenario in the first place, is it war or just bad luck. In The Deer Hunter, the war is just a backdrop and the film never doubts of its necessity. Conversely the film indeed eloquently illustrates horror and madness as fundamentally irrational and random, but the Russian roulette, basically the main source of the characters' psychological trauma since the film has not adequately shown what they did besides playing the Russian roulette during the war, could easily be transposed into other situation, for example a kidnapping of foreign travelers in a tropical country, or if the entire film is played as an allegory, it could become Saw (2004) or Funny Games (1997).
Despite The Deer Hunter has shown the suffering of the Vietnamese civilians, including poverty-driven prostitution, hunger and homelessness, and a scene of a Viet Cong coldheartedly killing a group of civilians of women and children by throwing a grenade into their hiding place which is IMO more horrifying than the Russian roulette, but the filmmakers never lay the emotional ground for them, they are merely exploitation. Not that I really need all ethnic representation in one single film, nor a true evidence of the Russian roulette is authentic, but from my two viewings I could only comprehend the Russian roulette as a victimization of Americans’ pride and the indulgence of sorrow after the defeat in the Vietnam war. With the song of ""God Bless America"" at the end, the broken soul of Americans are comforted.
Perhaps my argument is not eloquently articulated here, but that middle section of the film did trouble me a lot. Asides from that, I think the film is beautifully structured, albeit flawed. The first one-third, the big wedding sequence is over-stretched. I see Cimino’s point in depicting the American working class and the friendship between the principal characters, Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), Steven (John Savage), Stan (John Cazale), Axel (Chuck Aspegren) and John (George Dzundza). All of them are steel workers except John who’s a bar owner. It is the day of Steven’s wedding, and days before Michael, Nick and Steven joining the Vietnam war. The first act unhurriedly set up the characters and their personality which are nicely contrasted with the third act, the aftermath of the war service. I think the film successfully shows how most of the American soldiers were before joining the war, they are unaware of and uninterested in the meaning and justification of the war except having a belief of serving God and their country, also they worship guns like the symbol of their masculinity.
The first deer hunting sequence occurs on the next day after the wedding night, it’s solemnly staged and grandly shot as a ritual from Michael’s perspective, who is annoyed by Stan’s disrespectfulness towards the hunting. Here Michael fulfills his ideology of ""a deer’s gotta be taken with one shot."" It foreshadows the one out of the six shot in the Russian roulette that could kill a man, and finally contrasts with the second deer hunting session after Michael returns from Vietnam. After the war Michael is, for better or worse, a changed man who’s feeling estranged to the community. He’s conflicted in between his love to Nick’s girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep) and his guilt of not able to bring Nick back. Michael couldn’t kill the deer and instead shoots in air, now he fully recognizes the horror of gun. One shot could kill a deer, it could also easily kill a man, or else leaving him insane. That’s why Michael becomes enraged when Stan wavering a gun around, unknowing it is loaded. The Deer Hunter fails to be a war film, but it certainly takes a ""political"" stance against firearms.
There’re others minor issues I have with the film, mainly the script problems, like the female characters are underused and stereotyped. Angela (Rutanya Alda), Nick’s wife, deserves more screening time on the aftermath of her husband’s permanent impairment from war, whereas Linda is too one-noted. Luckily we have Meryl Streep who breathed an air of authenticity into her character Linda. I love long film, only if they have justified materials. The Deer Hunter doesn’t have. Michael Cimino knows how to shoot but doesn’t know where to cut which eventually ends his career in the next film Heaven’s Gate (1980), but that’s another story. The Deer Hunter is, above all, an egotistical product of a filmmaker with a great support from the cast and crew. It’s powerful yet polarising. Be critical of a film and don't be deceived by its ""apolitical"" presentation, The Deer Hunter has been loved by a lot of people, regrettably not me.

"Despite the fact that America tarred Vietnam with napalm, it is the Vietnamese who are portrayed as murderous savages.
But not only does the veer into parody of imperialist propaganda, it's also just sloppy, overlong, tonally overplayed, and dullllllll.

"I understand this film's place in history. I really do. I also completely understand the Academy Award and all other accolades it received. It's undeniable: ""The Deer Hunter"" is one of the first and thus most important pieces tackling the Vietnam war properly - as a disaster turning people either into lifeless piles of meat, cripples, or into tragic socially inept misfits. But it's so damn long...
If a film like that was released today, it would immediately receive a label of an afterschool special ham-fisted schmaltzy drama stuffed with performances that add up to mostly nothing. But it wasn't released today and perhaps because of the time and a still fresh memory of the war, this film is now widely regarded as a classic. Though, I dare say that ""First Blood"" says far more about the horrors of Vietnam war than ""The Deer Hunter"".
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I watched it. I'm glad to have seen Christopher Walken before he became a parody of himself. I'm glad to have witnessed the iconic scenes not taken out of context. I'm glad to have seen De Niro in his prime. I'm glad to be able to add this title to my personal bank of cinema history. I'm glad. I really am. But it doesn't mean I enjoyed watching it. Not that I really should have, because the subject matter should really make sure I'd feel uncomfortable. But the only discomfort I can recall is the pain in my backside.",2.5
"This film is incredible ! Watching the friendship between Michael, Steve and Nick at the beginning and learning about the three men is great stuff to watch but once you reach Vietnam everything around them starts to crumble and everything goes to shit for them. When Michael meets Nick at the end of the film and they play Russian Roulette Nick has an expression on his face that looks like he just doesn’t care anymore. After the war he looks like he just doesn’t care anymore and when he pulls the trigger he seems like he won’t mind if it blows his brains out, he still seems calm pointing a gun at his own head. When he finally pulls the trigger for the last time and he dies Michael’s reaction feels real, like Robert De Niro is best friends with Christopher Walken and he has actually just watched Christopher Walken blow his brains out. That’s why the first act setting up their friendship was so important, their friendship makes everything that happens to them more impactful. The ending may be one of my favourites in cinema history and the final Russian Roulette may be one of my favourite scenes of all time ! Liking the characters this much is a testament to just how fucking great the writing is. The film is also incredibly directed. The final Russian Roulette scene feels so intense ! There’s a feeling I get when I discover a new favourite film and that is what I have right now ! This is what cinema is all about ! Thank you for telling me to watch this, Katelyn !",5.0
"Casi perfecta esperaba más tenía una pizza de superficialidad siento yo algunas cosas disparatadas pero el que te dividida correctamente en tres parte me pareció una obra majestuosa una película antibelica grandiosa conformada por Robert deniro que hace algo diferente a otros escenarios y mencionar al Jonh cazale gracias a peli de la semana sin el nunca hubiera sabido lo que se esconde detrás de este actor y de la película de como Robert deniro incluyo a cazale en ella creo que no pasó un año y falleció cazale escenas brucas que ponen en riesgo la fragilidad de su cuerpo de cazale debido al cáncer avanzado que se encontraba en todo su cuerpo parece que lo querían forzar demás jaja pero no bueno esas escaleras en las que corrían no me gustó tanto la escena como fue dirigida esa parte un gran película el paisaje que conforman los lugares la primera cazeria que hacen dónde el siervo cae en manos de Michael una escena triste de un animal indefenso y su muerte y luego esta misma se repite dónde michael ya no tiene ganas ni tampoco sabor por quitarle la vida a este ser indefenso dónde también sus amigos parecen críos jugando con ese revolver que stan de Cazale tiene incluso cuanfo esye le apunto a Axel? No le importa parece ser que es peligroso pero sabe que solo un juego pero vemos algo que marco a Michael y es como los vietnamitas se divertían con ellos jugado a la ruleta rusa ( es que ellos no saben lo que por lo que pasó
Michael porque jugar esas idioteces como unos críos) al igual que cuando entra el tío con la boina verde en la celebración del bar se puede entender con toda claridad los horrores por los que ha pasado y se entiende a Michael que es el más duro de ellos mientras que Steve es alguien que se ha roto por completo más frágil tal vez no podría hacerle daño a alguien más mientras que Nick es el tío que quedó en otro mundo como una persona que quedó mal de la cabeza no tengo idea de lo que hacía en ese lugar debo suponer que estaba ahí para jugar a la ruleta rusa? Cada que lo querían y en ese instante no tuvo más suerte pero es preciso incluir como cambia la comunidad pequeña de este grupo de amigos un antes y un después nadie sabe por lo que pasaron solo las secuelas en su persona es lo que pueden obtener dentro de lo que sucedió en la guerra es algo que me gustó las localizaciónes y la puesta a escena y meryl strepp estaba bien linda necesito ver más películas de ella cuando era joven me gustó ver más a Meryl que ha francés mcdorman en esta película de los hermanos Coen en ese tiempo era pareja de Jonh cazale me parece y Christopher Walken también está incluído como un principal de los hombres que van a Vietnam todo un joven Walken a un que se siente más vivida la participación de deniro que todos y wlaken y Cazale están a la par y John savage como Steve se me hizo muy poca pero en conjunto todos comparten buena química dentro del grupo",4.5

Extended periods of time soaking in the lives of the lead characters, including a dance sequence. Somewhat unconventional, at times off-putting, characterization (including a love triangle with Christopher Walken at one of the ends). Incredibly bleak throughout and ends on a real sudden downer. All of this shit that Heaven's Gate got flack for is in this movie.

cinematography is out of this world too, especially in the mountain scenes. i loved the coupling of those majestic shots of the Appalachians with Russian Orthodox church music. in the first act it serves as an almost unsettling omen of what’s to come. but by the end of the film…it’s a meditation on what has come to pass.

The Vietnam stuff and the ending are both superb, if that was how the whole film was I'd have been in love. The first hour however was an absolute slog, and the middle part was not a great deal better.
I get that this is a great film, I just didn't love it as much as I expected too, but the good bits are enough to still make it a decent watch for me.",3.0

"The Deer Hunter is well renowned and deservedly so in many respects but it's far from an easy watch, I've only sat through it once previously and whilst I can certainly appreciate it for the decadent production values, on location shooting and most importantly the searing performances of the likes of De Niro, Walken, Savage and Streep overall I'm less enamoured with it than one would hope to be given the acclaimed reputation of the picture.
This is a movie from the twilight era of a time when filmmakers had far more free reign in how they went about their profession, an era that came to an end in part because of Michael Cimino's follow up work to this movie. I'm thankful for the great pictures we secured through this era and despite my personal misgivings about this one I would include The Deer Hunter in that great company of picture's like The Godfather, Apocalypse Now etc but I think by today's standards there were things that needed to be reigned in on this movie, as it stands it sits close to the epic quality it was shooting for but doesn't quite reach it.
Walken and De Niro give lights out performances here though it has to be said, I'm rating this higher than my feelings to the overall movie would see me do so purely off the basis of their work. I can't believe that supporting performer Chuck Aspegren was not an actor and just someone who worked at the steel mill who so impressed Cimino and the casting director they offered him the role, so shout out to him on this one as well as he did great in the company of heavyweight thespians all of whom are so widely lauded in their field.",4.0
"PELICULÓN.
El inicio se siente lento y un poco tedioso, para ser más específico, la escena de la boda, después de eso, toda la película se torna interesante a más no poder, porque la historia, a pesar de ser bélica, se centra más en los conflictos internos de los personajes, aunque tampoco dejan de lado los externos, la escena de la ruleta rusa en el campo de prisioneros es asquerosa, impactante y llena de suspenso, y después de eso muestran lo que la guerra y la tortura le hicieron a Nick, al punto de transformarlo en alguien inhumano.
En aspectos técnicos, es excelente, la fotografía es hermosa, la puesta en escena es igual de buena, el diseño de producción es sin dudas maravilloso, y algo que me gustó mucho es que en las escenas de Vietnam, no solo en las de guerra, están filmadas en su mayoría, con cámara en mano, lo que le da una sensación más real, como si fuese un documental.
Es imposible hablar de esta película sin mencionar el magnífico trabajo que hicieron los actores y actrices, todos están brutales, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken y John Savage muestran coraje, dolor y desesperación en toda la película, es difícil decidir que actuación me gustó más, pues todas están muy bien logradas, pero a mi parecer, la de Christopher Walken como Nick es la mejor de la película, no solo por lo anterior, sino porque al final también muestra otra cara de su personaje completamente distinta, fría, inexpresiva y sádica, además de que nos encariñamos con su personaje y nos duele su muerte.
Algo que también recalco, es que al mostrar la guerra, la muestran muy bien, ningún bando era bueno, muestran como los estadounidenses asesinan e incineran vivos a civiles inocentes, queman sus hogares y los obligan a irse, pero también muestran a los vietnamitas torturando a los soldados en una escena muy impactante.",5.0

"Not light.
I was leaning 4 after completing this epic. My biggest complaint with The Deer Hunter is that Stanley Myers's score is too Oscarbaity saccharine for me, and it never seemed to fit well with the dark grittiness it blanketed. Beyond that, though, I had to let the film settle.
In the 24 hours since, while doing a bit of reading on its production and cinematic influence, I'm confident with a 4.5.
In the waining days of New Hollywood, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter was the first major film to speak vehemently against the US war in Vietnam. Coming Home was released the same year, though had less of an impact, and Apocalypse Now would release the year following (while Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Born on the Fourth of July, and others would follow).
The film also changed the way Hollywood would shoot war scenes; focusing more on the nihilistic absurdity than the heroism.
But what The Deer Hunter does best is focus on a fascinatingly-chosen Russian-American community of characters from industrial Pennsylvania, splitting their story into three sections: their lives before the war as depicted in an epic wedding celebration; their lives during the war and the hell they endured; and their markedly changed lives after.
The plot structure is masterful, and the opening hour of wedding festivities brilliantly ties together the community, as well as the audience.
Then the notorious Russian roulette scenes take hold of the plot... while it's true the movie's Vietnamese (neither the north nor the south) are depicted with zero dimension, and that there's no historical evidence of Russian roulette being played in the country during the war, the deadly game of chance is effectively used as an allegorical tool to show the arbitrary cruelty of war - in particular, the Vietnam war, whose US soldiers were draftees, not volunteers.
The story is increasingly devastating, but told with immense care and profound technical skill. Vilmos Zsigmond’s cinematography is wonderful, while Peter Zinner's editing is a Herculean effort (supposedly, he had over a mile worth of initial footage).
The cast is indeed superlative. DeNiro is typically excellent, but his co-stars, Christopher Walken (who won an Oscar for this), John Savage, and Meryl Streep, are all equally memorable.
And before it's all said and done, Cimino crushes us with an ending that's a disturbingly poignant moment of conflicting Americana: pride and shame.
The first of several prominent anti-Vietnam war films, The Deer Hunter changed the way we see war cinema with a metaphor that's just as haunting to contemplate today - all while telling a loving story of friends, family, and community, and the sacrifices they were forced to make for their country. It's among the elite class of its decade.",4.5
"... well that was fucked up.
A comprehensive look at the men that went to Vietnam. Life for the them before, during, and after. Well after for most of them unlike Nick.
No cool camera techniques or frills. Just pure emotion. It's just so smart to start your movie with some kind of party or wedding. Put all the main characters together and show the audience how they interact with people.
A particularly brilliant shot is the camera focusing on that single woman scoping Nick out at the wedding. The camera appears to be Nick's gaze focusing back but as we keep pushing in we notice that the real intent is Meryl Streep dancing in the background. Sets up the 3rd act of Mikey and Linda beautifully.
I can't imagine being in a theater in 1978 and witnessing the Russian Roulette scenes for the first time. There must have been audible gasps.",5.0
"I've mulled this over for days because I see that everyone loves this movie and I feel bad for giving it a relatively low rating. I have to stand by my feelings though. The first half was a slog for me, just a bunch of small industrial town guys fucking around and going hunting. I can see that locally. The wedding scene went on waaay to long. The second half was more interesting, but still not great. I'm not big into modern war movies. The title should have been ""The head shooter"". The only part that really sticks out to me, stays with me, is when Michael goes back to Nam to find Nick and the city is falling around him. That part was pretty chilling and sad.",3.0
"It very rigidly follows the three-act structure, with the film being split up into easily distinguishable phases for the characters: before deployment, during deployment, and after deployment. Aside from the time jumps between these, though, the film moves incredibly slowly.
For better or worse, it shows us every aspect of these character's lives. We see them in their place of work, we see them hunting, we see them shopping or drinking at the bar. We see them bantering with each other, fighting, and falling into romantic relationships.
Obviously, there is a difference in how they approach and handle these activities pre-war and post-war. I assume that's the ultimate point of the film. To show how war changes a person. And I'd say it succeeds at that.
The first act is tense and imperfect, sure. Most of it is taken up by a 40-minute, almost real-time wedding sequence where the characters all bicker, fight, and share secrets. But there's ultimately a positive tone; the characters all share camaraderie and fall into macho stereotypes, and most of their conflicts are surface-level and easily resolved.
The film effectively sets up the characters as ""normal people,"" flawed but generally stable and happy. I really only have one complaint here, but it's huge: this could have easily been established in the first 10 minutes or so of the film. I don't need an hour plus of them going to work, stores, social gatherings etc to understand that they are perfectly average civilians.
Unfortunately most of the Vietnam scenes don't do much to help this, they all focus on very simple ideas (the characters are trapped and have to escape, the characters are injured and have to find a hospital, etc) but go on for far too long. And there isn't even the awe-inspiring spectacle that most war films have, it's all fairly small-scale and visually bland.
It would maybe be fine if I were invested in the characters, but as I said earlier, they are all perfectly average people. And even in Vietnam they aren't given too many traits, the broken relationships and PTSD don't come into play until the third act.
The final act, though, is quite interesting. It's much more character-focused: where the rest of the film has 3 to 5 central characters at once this act focuses mainly on Mike. It allows us to empathize with him more specifically, get immersed in his struggles and understand his motivations/reactions. He also covers a lot more land in this act, whereas the first two are only set in a handful of locations this one is all over the place.
The last twenty minutes are also incredibly tense, and resolve all of the character arcs perfectly. Easily the best part of the film in my opinion. If only the rest of the film had been as effectively paced and character-driven as it.",3.0
"Finally saw this film recommended so many times by @kategln ;)
And she was right, what’s not to like about this film? The moving story of 3 young American men drafted at the Vietnam war, performed brilliantly by John Savage, Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro. The 3 act structure of the film was so clever portraying perfectly the changes each character endured after the war. The beautiful music theme which made my cry at the end. The movies pace where it did not feel at all like 3 hours. How you get so attached to each character 🥺. And of course the game of Russian roulette which serves as a powerful metaphor for the very nature of war. Some return apparently unscathed some return missing limbs some return missing their sanity and some never return at all. Like gambling it is 'the luck of the draw'.
The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars may be because I saw apocalypse now yesterday 😂 but more importantly I didn’t think the cinematography was hypnotizing nor was the portrayal of the Vietnam war… It was too one sided for me.
It still remains overall an epic movie. 
Btw this is the second Vietnam film in two days I think I will take a break😂",4.5
"Been a very long time since I last watched this. Time is certainly required to grasp the scope of this one. A lot of it is like a Coppola film directed by Altman, and then Peckinpah jumps in for a chunk, then back to the first two. About as New Hollywood as it gets. A colossal bummer, but beautiful, real, ambitious and intense. Still one of the most stunning and raw best picture winners. I think the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is that while De Niro is great in this of course, his character is hard for me to get a handle on. Which is unusual for him, especially at this time. That may be something I need to focus on in future viewings. Also, it could be about 10 minutes shorter and probably be fine. Who really cares though, it's a helluva film.",4.5

For The Deer Hunter, it seems that the sentiment weighed over its evident shortcomings to become celebrated all these years as one of the most acclaimed movies ever.

I read today that Meryl Streep only took the role to stay close to John Cazale who was suffering with lung cancer. This makes their scenes, even though they are not close in the film, very moving. When I watch Streep grieve in this I have no doubt she was thinking about Cazale and to be honest it made me quite sad too thinking how great of an actor he was.

"""The Deer Hunter"" is a 3-hour long epic that does the one crucial thing an epic must do. It places its characters in monumentally different places at the start of the film and at the conclusion, which makes the experience so much more than the 3-hours; it feels real.
The 3-act structure, with each act lasting roughly the same duration, allows the film to be split up but also lets it act as a slow transition, the transition being from happiness to outright horror to post-traumatic depression.
But specifically, it's the transition from the enjoyable, often humorous look at love and life in the first hour to the distressing, tense atmosphere of the Vietnam War that is so brilliantly done, and it's something that keeps replaying in my head. The tense scenes even reached a level of tension where I shifted uncomfortably in my seat and even contemplated taking a break.
I've seen a lot of people criticise this for being slow or boring, with which I completely disagree. In my eyes, it's the focus on anticipation that always keeps the film from feeling slow. From the start we know these men are going to war, and we're nervously anticipating it, just as they are. And once there, we anticipate their death or their survival, and then we anticipate the day when everything gets back to normal, if it ever does. This is why the bond between the audience and the characters is so strong; we feel like we're on this journey with them.
I also think watching the actors portray the transition in their characters was really incredible. Walken, particularly, gives such a powerful performance that perfectly encapsulates the whole thematic basis of the film.
It's not just a comment on war, it's a comment on life before war, during war, and after war, and how it affects each and every person in differing ways. And for that, it's a truly harrowing cinematic experience.

"""This is this. This ain't something else. This is this.""
The Deer Hunter is one of those movies where whenever I watch it now, it's crazy to think I didn't like it the first time. I found it overlong and boring, but with each new viewing my appreciation for the film grows. It is undoubtedly long, but despite its slow pondering pace, it never feels too long for me anymore. This one has a lot of great themes, such as War and how it affects people, but more than anything I feel its about friendship. I have a couple really close friends, so this film is easy to connect with. It helps that the main performances are so good and sell the relationships between them. Robert De Niro is terrific in the lead role, and gets strong support from Christopher Walken, John Savage, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, and pretty much everyone else. I love the definitive three act structure of the film and there are so many brilliant scenes throughout. The cinematography is breathtaking and the score is beautiful. I can understand why some wouldn't like this one, because I didn't use to, but I absolutely love it now.

"A damning portrayal of the violence of American ideology inflicted both at home and abroad. The juxtaposition of the images of fire and smoke in the Vietnam War with the fire and smoke of steel town Pennsylvania struck me so much more this time than when I first saw this movie (around 8 years ago), some breathtaking cuts. The first act felt like it dragged on, but as the movie progresses you realize how thoughtful and skillful Cimino was building up the reality of these lives that are destroyed over the course of the movie. The ending could be read differently, but the singing of that song by those people around that table is pitch perfect. Was so sweet to see this on 35mm at Metrograph (first time there!).
Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep are both insanely hot here 🥵

"""When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life.""
THE DEER HUNTER is a movie my opinion has gone back and forth on.
I first saw it as a teenager and didn't really like it, though I acknowledge that a lot of it probably went over my head. Much later, around the time I turned 30, I watched it again and despite some issues, tried to convince myself that I liked it because of its reputation as a classic. But despite this, I still felt something about it was off that I couldn't put my finger on. People insisted that I give it another watch. Now, years later, after a third viewing, I feel I can finally say this movie, despite having many good things in it, just doesn't click for me.
In a small Russian-American community in Pennsylvania, we meet a circle of friends who will be affected by the Vietnam War. Michael (Robert DeNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) are all about to leave for military service. They are steel mill workers, and we get many scenes depicting them and their other friends as working class, beer-drinking good ole boys who may not have much education but are good-hearted. Much of the first hour consists of Steven's wedding, where our characters have various small antics, and Michael gets so drunk that he at one point runs naked through the streets at night, leaving Nick to catch up with him.
But the horrors of the war will shatter their lives forever, affecting not just the three men but their friends and lovers, leaving them with trauma and dysfunction.
My main issue is that there is very little to these characters. Despite the fact that they get so much screen-time, there is an unfocused feeling throughout the film. So much of the first hour consists of scenes of them just being themselves, bullshitting around while playing pool in the bar, or bullshitting at the wedding, or bullshitting on the deer hunting trip. This is an example of characters talking a lot while not actually saying anything.
And I understand that Cimino wants us to get a feel for the characters from their interactions and everyday banal mannerisms rather than dialog, and the great ensemble are all talented, but there just isn't much on the page. Supposedly the entire cast had to improv a lot to give their characters more to do, especially Meryl Streep who herself called her character ""the stock girlfriend.""
The most powerful scenes are those in Vietnam (shot in Thailand), with the infamous Russian roulette sequence. In fact, I think one of the best transitions in the entire film is going from the gang all celebrating at the bar, slowly becoming melancholic as one of them starts playing the piano, to suddenly being in the midst of Vietnam. We don't see boot camp, we don't see them going off on a mission; we just see the three friends reuniting on the battlefield just before they are captured and put in a POW camp. Russian roulette becomes a powerful thematic device during this sequence. This entire sequence could have been its own short film.
The deer hunting scenes are also quite beautiful and have the best cinematography of the entire film. The gang has a passion for going deer hunting, and Michael frequently repeats his motto of ""One shot,"" because ""Two shots is pussy."" Michael is a person with a single-minded approach to decision making. There is no second-guessing and there is no half-assing. The deer symbolizes that a life can be taken with just one shot, and while the other guys are all less successful or require two shots, Michael always gets his prey. But later on in the film, when hunting again after returning from Vietnam, he successfully hunts down a deer but cannot bring himself to shoot it and ultimately chooses to let it go, as if he has lost his way. He realizes he has broken his promise of bringing Nick back home.
But between these great scenes are many small episodic moments of filler. When Michael returns home from Vietnam, I was surprised to see there was a whole hour of screen time left, and we meander from one vignette to another. I don't necessarily mind a movie having this structure or many characters, but they need to be interesting.
It doesn't surprise me to learn this project originated as two different screenplays that were joined together, nor that there's controversy over who the writer is. It feels like too many writers worked on this. Do we need superfluous scenes like Axel getting stuck in a bowling alley lane or the extra shenanigans that happen on the deer hunt?
And despite the immense talent of this cast, I have a hard time getting invested in almost any character. Of course DeNiro and Walken are the two standouts, but even by the climax of the film involving Nick's tragic fate, I still didn't feel like I was given a clear sense of who Nick really was.
On a personal note, I always thought the movie should have been titled RUSSIAN ROULETTE. That's a much bigger element in the story, both literally and thematically, than the deer-hunting element is.
Ultimately, THE DEER HUNTER is a movie with many worthwhile elements that make me recommend it. But I don't think it's a masterpiece, and a lot Cimino's tendencies to lose himself in quiet, pointless scenes and indulging in nature shots all showed early signs here, before becoming more prominent in HEAVEN'S GATE.

This is a pretty phenomenal movie. I was surprised with how little actually happens compared to most three hour movies. It's very patient and also allows things to develop thoroughly which I actually found quite strong. The first act does a great job of building the relationship between the characters, then the next two acts use that incredibly well. This is mostly a character study for De Niro but it's a character study through his relationships with different people. I honestly liked pretty much everything.

"No meio de uma cena tão opulenta como a do casamento ortodoxo, um plano ""se destaca"" pela sua própria natureza plástica. É um plano detalhe do vinho sendo derramado no vestido branco da noiva.
A questão não é que esse é um momento tão potente ou significante para o resto do filme, mas que nesse gesto está contida toda a mentalidade que organiza a obra. Tudo está estruturado numa relação muito esmiuçada sobre a fisicalidade, os gestos, o tempo (e a própria ideia de sua passagem), o espaço físico. É uma estrutura montada a partir da realização (porque se trata da percepção mesmo de que este é o jeito com que isso tudo deve ser abordado) de que se há significado, potência, trauma e paixões a serem exploradas, elas precisam vir por meio dessa qualidade que é de síntese, apesar de se tratar de um filme de três horas.
É síntese porque se atém justamente às únicas coisas que importam. Está na evidência da própria imagem. O modo como Steven dança e usa seu corpo na celebração é contrastado depois com sua condição já aleijado. E isso não vem por meio de uma direção de mão pesada ou qualquer bobagem desse tipo, vem com toda força simplesmente pela habilidade do olhar, de saber afastar ou aproximar sem essa intenção maçante de ""querer dizer alguma coisa"". Simplesmente É.
E isso está na atmosfera do filme, cada plano e cada corte segue por esse olhar que mesmo aonde mais poderia desviar dessa força e pesar a mão (em toda a sequência da primeira ""roleta russa""), ainda assim Cimino sempre tira das situações imagens que são belas no sentido mais pertinente do termo. É saber olhar para Michael conversando com Steven de costas, em silhueta.
Interessante também como essa lógica transparece até mesmo na estrutura narrativa como um todo. Observar a guerra do Vietnã e resumir esse trauma a um momento ""rápido"" (em contraste com a duração das outras sequencias) é justamente uma manifestação desse olhar tão atento ao detalhe que abre caminho para a força de todas as cenas.
Dito isso... não existe nada mais raso e estúpido do que dizer que o filme poderia ter 1h30 de duração como se vê em algumas ""sugestões""",5.0
"I’ve been meaning to watch this movie for a while now because of its critical acclaim. Finally got around to watch it and it was good but ngl I’m a little underwhelmed.
Now, this movie has its great moments. The symbolism and foreshadowing was great here, from the dripped wine to the depressed soldier at the bar. The visuals of this film were absolutely breathtaking, especially when they were in the mountains. The acting was superb as well omg that stellar cast did not disappoint. De Niro and Walken gave a great performance, especially in the russian roulette scenes. The scenes in Vietnam were incredible and emotionally charged and more than once I caught myself holding my breath.
On the other hand, I felt like this movie was quite long. I love long movies and always have the patience for them, but this wasn’t executed well. Many scenes were either awkward fillers and/or unnecessary. At times I felt like finishing a particular scene was a chore and it immediately took me out of the film. That wedding scene was too long as well; if y’all wanna know how to do a great wedding scene, just take notes from The Godfather.
Despite some negative aspects, the movie’s theme is SO important. War is hell. If you don’t die during the war, it will kill you slowly from the inside out; PTSD is a very real thing.
I truly think that this film’s message will stand the test of time, and I respect and appreciate that so much. 3.5/5 deers.",3.5
"Deliverance but in Vietnam, and twice as long. It's great to see Christopher Walken in a movie where he's playing a real character and not just himself in some whacky scenario or cameo. Meryl Streep also isn't insufferable like most times. De Niro melts into the character of Michael so hard that he's unrecognizable. Overall I'm just glad to have finally sat down and watched it, and it's probably the best deal I've ever found at Dollar General ($4 can you believe that).
Also have now seen every movie starring the great John Cazale, may he rest in peace.

"Is this a grueling meditation on the physical, psychological, and practical effects of war on the common man or is this a longing covert gay romance where De Niro and Walken look at each other with “fuck me” eyes for three hours? Many possibilities. As far as films about Vietnam go, this is no Apocalypse Now, but it remains a wholly respectable effort. Perhaps I expected more character and thematic depth from a film so sprawling, but the ensemble is absolutely insane, especially De Niro and Walken, that scene near the end is unforgettable, and it still explores the impacts of war in a tastefully raw, honest, and understated manner. The whole before, during, and after approach to the exploitation of the working class for geopolitical games feels unique and compelling.",4.0
"A guerra transforma,destrói,constrói,desconstrói, é quase como um ciclo
Quem é você antes e quem é você depois do trauma? depois de uma guerra?
A guerra não é para os mais fracos,nem os despreparados
A caçada serve como um ponto tanto de preparo quanto de reparação,de viver os velhos tempos vividos pelos personagens
A amizade q o filme apresenta para,em contrapartida,mostrar a separação, é sim bem apresentada,já q você vai sim querer amigos como os de Michael,você vai se identificar (uma hora ou outra)com esses amigos
The Deer Hunter também é um filme sobre jornadas
No 1° ato temos a jornada de preparação para a guerra,o horror q nós será apresentado
No 2° ato vemos a jornada dentro da guerra,desde a jornada para a fuga até a jornada para tentar voltar para casa
Todos seguem sua jornada, mesmo com o filme contando o final com a vida de Michael,q é o único q volta para casa
No 3° ato temos a jornada da ""a vida continua""
A vida de Michael após a guerra,Michael lutou,foi forte,e,mesmo traumatizado,tenta (e quer)seguir a vida,quer aproveitar os amigos,tudo q aquela cidade tem a oferecer,até se reencontrar com Steve e partir para a busca de Nick até aquele final

"I watched The Deer Hunter years ago and I thought it was pretty decent, like an 8/10. Yet every time anyone ever brought it up I would talk about it like it was one of my favourite movies ever. Revisiting it this many years later, it finally lives up to the legacy I made up for it in my head.
Very few movies are able to be this melodramatic yet unflinchingly brutal, helped by some of the best structuring I’ve seen in a movie. I see some people complain about how much time is spent at the wedding or how not enough time is spent in Vietnam, but if you ask me, the time spent in each location is perfect. Cimino utilizes every set for such an exact purpose, and he executes it flawlessly.
The sprawling almost lackadaisical first act leads you to experience the film as though you were an observer. It’s the tiny things moving within a massive mural that dictate where the story goes. It’s a lot to handle for a first watch, but going into this knowing what to expect I found myself moving through the landscape as though I was there next to the characters. Cimino’s vision is so big, but it’s not so much one enormous action, rather one million little ones that the audience can sift through themselves.
The second act in Vietnam is visceral and difficult to watch. Enough ink has been spilled on the brilliance of this middle act and I don’t feel like I have that much to add to the conversation. It is fascinating to use Russian roulette, a game based on thrill seeking and deluded invincibility, as the defining characteristic of America’s involvement in Vietnam, but I digress. It’s harrowing and devastating, and while certainly very “Hollywood” it’s still extremely effective.
Then the third act hits. It’s muted, with one emotional outburst, which is shocking for a best picture winner. Despite its somber tone, the third act feels like the final cacophonous end to the bleakest domino chain imaginable. It’s devastating, and it doesn’t feel like a coda, but a true climax that results in quiet resignation opposed to thunderous revelation.
A Vietnam movie for sure, but also so much more. It’s technically brilliant and the central cast gives incredible performances across the board, De Niro truly deserves his greatest of all time status. It’s a ghost story from the ugliest side of America, and one that grows more poignant with time.",5.0

"Visto per la prima volta in sala ed in lingua originale per l’anniversario dell’uscita. Per quanto si trattasse di una versione apposita, l’audio è stata una delusione totale dato che non è stata compiuta nessuna rimasterizzazione e spesso, TROPPO SPESSO, le voci o i suoni risultavano fastidiosi. Dopo un bel po’ ci si abitua, ma pessimo lavoro per riportare un film in sala dopo 45 anni.
A parte ció, è in tutto e per tutto una pellicola che non ha resistito al passare degli anni, anche se ha uno stile con un certo fascino. Tuttavia peró, la storia non è il mio genere raccontando in 3 maniere differenti, gli effetti postguerra su normali persone diventate soldati del Vietnam. Di base un qualcosa di interessante, ma accompagnato da un’accozzaglia di altre circostanze al limite del bizzarro che personalmente non mi hanno conquistato ed anzi, molto stranito. Ovviamente mi rendo conto che il tutto serva proprio per mostrare il contrasto con la guerra e presentare meglio le vite comuni dei personaggi, ma per me il risultato è un secco no.

"“You wanna play games? All right, I'll play your fucking games.”-Released 45 years ago today, ‘The Deer Hunter’ is one of the most deserving best picture winners ever, so haunting, simply one of the greatest films ever made. It follows a trio of steelworkers whose lives were changed forever after fighting in the Vietnam war. The film runs 3 hours, with the first act revolving around a wedding that lasted about an hour. It could be trimmed just a tad, but I feel that hour wedding is important as it makes us care for the guys in order for what they experience in Vietnam to really hit us. Great character development. We see before the war, during the war and the aftermath, and each has its moment of powerful scenes that stay with you. Michael Cinomo’s direction is incredible, with the infamous Russian Roulette sequence is the most intense scene I’ve ever seen and to me is what really secured his Best Director win. This film shatters you so many times with its in-depth examination of the ways in which the war impacts men and how it affects friendships. The editing is excellent, with the transition from middle class America to Vietnam being flawless.

Despite being Oscar nominated, this is one of Robert De Niro’s most underrated performances, as you rarely hear it being brought up, which is a shame. Bobby has said this was his most grueling shoot ever and it shows in his acting, so much raw emotions. He is the heart of the film, the guy who is always there for his friends. Christopher Walken gives the best performance of his career here, his Oscar win was so deserving. The slaps in the Russian roulette scene were real and just how he took them, the pain he displayed in it gives me goosebumps. He is absolutely riveting, and towards the end he looks like a dead soul waiting for the body to follow. Love his scenes opposite Bobby. Meryl Streep earned her first of her record 21 nominations for this film, and she’s really good as a woman in love with two best friends. The great John Cazale went out strong with his last performance, and you wouldn’t even think he was dying of lung cancer during filming. Lastly, John Savage breaks your heart being the most physically damaged member of the crew. The film is currently streaming on Netflix, and I highly recommend.",4.5

absolutely devastating film that really depicts how no one ever comes back whole from the war.
so much time is spent at the beginning of this film just getting you into the shoes of all the characters. linda (meryl streep), stan (john cazale), steven (john savage), mikey (robert deniro) and nick (christopher walken) are perfect portrayals of the average american. they’re hardworking, simple people who one way or…",4.5
"“If you don’t spill a drop, it’s good luck for the rest of your life!”

Robert de Niro had John Savage on his back, but Christopher Walken was carrying this entire fucking movie on his.

Pros:
- This was the quickest 3-hour movie of my entire life for some reason
- Both Russian roulette scenes were INCREDIBLY well acted
- Some phenomenal shots and production design
- The recurring revolver imagery is neat, I guess.
- It’s nice to see Meryl Streep before she entered her GILF stage.

As for the cons?!
Well, for one, the “boohoo, war is hell” stuff was SO fucking undercooked, it’s almost unbelievable. One solitary scene of some POWs being tortured is not enough to encompass the terror of the Vietnam war. It just isn’t. You need more context for it to feel grand and horrible.
Honestly, pretty much any potential themes wound up undercooked because of how underdeveloped every character besides Michael was.
Yeah, blah blah blah, ‘war bad’ and ‘violence cringe’ and ‘toxic masculinity soy’, but WHERE’S THE FUCKING NARRATIVE?!
The incredible over-reliance on a three-act structure kinda kills this movie. There’s too much time spent on the wedding, not nearly enough spent on actual combat, and then, the last hour just drags out everything to no end while still saying nothing.
I don’t need some half-assed unrequited love subplot crowding up this bloatfest, Cimino. I just need relevant character writing.
Look, this movie was way more grounded and graphic, sure. But fuck me, at least ’Apocalypse Now’ or ’Full Metal Jacket’ could carry a narrative for their entire runtime. And both of those films run circles around this one in terms of what they actually SAY about Vietnam.
Besides, I’m historically against sucking off movies for “doing it first”, or “being influential”.
So, that’s it. Didn’t really do it for me. I also just can’t see 70s De Niro as anything other than Travis Bickle. Sorry.
Admittedly, I was going to make a joke about John Cazale’s hairline, but I’ll instead commend him for showing up on set every day and giving it his all despite his grim diagnosis, and Meryl Streep gets my props alongside him. Rest in peace.

"One of the least enjoyable Vietnam movies ever made. The opening hour is dominated by the wedding, where very little happens, and it honestly took a strong commitment to completionism not to just fast forward through it. Cimino goes for quantity over quality here - making us spend so much time with these characters that we think we know them deeply even though the important relationship and emotions and mental states could be relayed in far fewer minutes. Then we get to the war and it's practically straight into the harrowing Russian roulette scene in captivity. It's one of the most powerful, affecting scenes that you'll see in a Vietnam War movie but speaks to such a specific and unlikely traumatic experience that it doesn't really work quite as well overall as the ""they all came back changed and with PTSD"" story that it wants to be. De Niro and Walken are truly great, though, and I wish that they'd been in a tighter picture with a lot deeper character development rather than barely defining them and keeping them at arm's length (even before they get altered by their wartime experience).",3.0
"I do love a great War film and this one definitely delivered on so many levels. 
This film really dives deep into the complications and effects of War and the distressing imagery of the Vietnam War presented in this is very shocking. An impactful, compelling, realistic and heartbreaking story that creates tension like no other War film I’ve seen. All the performances in this were unreal, especially from THE greatest actor of all time in Robert De Niro who’s performance is up there with one of my favourites of his and then Christopher Walken who displays such absolute top class acting and is probably the star of the film. Such a well written and deeply emotional film. Yes, the first half of the film does drag quite a-bit especially during the wedding moments but once you are introduced to the whole War aspects of the film, it’s game on from there. Absolutely riveting. 
But fuck man, The Russian Roulette scenes were absolutely brutal. Such powerful and chilling scenes that showcases some of the finest pieces of acting you’ll probably ever get I’ll be honest. In particular, the scene with both De Niro and Walken. Just wow. Truly outstanding. The ending too is just nothing but complete sombreness.",4.5
"While I find it hard to argue with critics who find aspects of this a little clumsy (to put it mildly), I still just think the overall canvas is kind of overwhelming.
The opening hour alone is a tour-de-force, with the Appalachian backdrop captured with uncanny efficacy. Having driven through and lived in many of the areas where this was shot, the way the varying states where this was shot (Ohio, Washington, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) are pieced together to cohere into such a specific time and place is simply without equal. The jump to Vietnam is almost a disappointment, to be honest. It leads almost immediately to this film's most infamous sequence, sure, but the patient execution of the film's opening drops away so swiftly that the effect is jarring in a way that doesn't feel purposeful. And subsequent narrative beats here are elided in a way that feels unnatural.
And then we have the initial return home, which is always longer and more expansive than I remember, and which - once again - I didn't really want to end. I think, in part, it works so well because Streep is given so much more to do here, and her dynamic with De Niro (with the looming specter of the absent Walken) blossoms out in fascinating ways from their comparatively brief interactions in the opening hour (leading to one shot in particular which serves as a haunting echo of one earlier in the film that sees her attempting to care for her drunk and abusive father).
Of course, this all leads to a second round in Vietnam that's staged with much more confidence, and which Cimino much more appropriately casts in such a heightened atmosphere that it encourages an audience to read the whole Russian roulette concept as more metaphorical than literal. That's not a line Cimino toes well enough for it to effectively counter the criticisms of how he portrays the Vietnamese people throughout - and it's not something Cimino ever saw fit to correct as far as I'm aware, due I'm sure in no small part to a contentious relationship with the press - but I think a certain surreality is definitely intentional.",5.0
"Yeah, this didn't let me down.
The Deer Hunter was a great watch and for a 3 hour long film, did really well at holding my attention. The storytelling in this film was brutal but fantastic, and the camera work was seriously impressive, adding a real level of discomfort in the appropriate scenes and feeling of warmth, only occasionally, in others. This film really delves into the psychological side of war, not just for the people directly involved but the people back home as well. My only fault with it is that, it felt kinda detached from itself at times the way it jumped from certain scenes and the begining felt a little unnecessarily long, I know it was to build connections and develop the characters, but I'd have rather spent that time exploring the people somewhere other than the wedding.

"“A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that, but they don't listen.”
“The Deer Hunter” is a devastating yet equally compassionate film. It’s a humanizing look at the life of a US soldier in Vietnam. It shows what they were like before the war. The wedding scenes are so charming. Everyone is so full of hope except the Green Beret Vietnam veteran. “Fuck it.”
My favorite shot of the film is them in the mountains with the snowy peaks in the background as they complain about Stan not having his boots.
Then the abrupt switch to Vietnam. You’re thrown right into the action. They sharply contrast senseless violence with the cute wedding and bonding scenes beforehand. The Deer Hunter gives you a baptism by fire. You see the dehumanization of everyone’s characters. They lose their minds and sense of self in the POW torture trap. This all happens while the rest of the characters in the US wonder why they aren’t home yet—something isn’t right.
There is an all-star cast with DeNiro, Walken, Cazale, Savage, Streep, and many others. But Walken’s performance takes the cake—he’s incredible. 
The Deer Hunter is 183mins long, but it’s worth it. The slow character-building creates a rich world. You grow attached to each character, which makes the ending so disturbing. In my opinion, this film has one of the most devastating endings ever. I highly recommend The Deer Hunter.",5.0
"Virtuose. Michael Cimino livre un film sur les effets, physiques comme psychologiques, de la guerre, ici celle du Vietnam, comme pour exorciser, quelques années après sa finalité, les démons entourant tout un peuple traumatisé d’une guerre stupide.
Voyage au bout de l’enfer se découpe en trois parties distinctes, la première décrivant la vie de trois amis en Pennsylvanie, travaillants, jouants, chassants ensembles et se préparant au départ pour le Vietnam, ainsi que le mariage de l’un d’entre eux. La scène de mariage étant une très longue sequence, comme un long dernier moment de joie avant l’enfer. 
La transition avec la deuxième partie est extrêmement intelligente, les trois amis, autour d’un verre commençant à redouter le lendemain, se retrouvent directement quelques années plus tard au beau milieu de la jungle, une des plus grandes transitions de l’histoire du cinéma.
Viens la terrifiante scène de roulette russe, la tragédie de ce moment et les émotions des personnages sont retranscrites de manière si brillante. Michael Cimino, en quelques minutes (cette deuxième partie est la plus courte), matérialise avec justesse l’horreur et la terreur, c’est une perfection, et ça me marquera à vie.
Sans entrer dans les détails du dénouement de cette situation, vient rapidement la troisième et dernière partie, racontant les effets clairs et précis de la guerre sur ces trois personnages, dont chacuns on des séquelles différentes.
L’écriture de chaque personnage est brillantissime, le tout formidablement mis en scène par Michael Cimino. 
Je note les performances de chaque acteurs (Robert de Niro, John Savage et Christopher Walken), qui sur les trois segments, ont des émotions fortes et diversifiées à faire retranscrite, et c’est réussi avec une justesse folle, fortement aidés par la place laissée par Michael Cimino et ces longues scènes les laissant s’exprimer.

"I have immense respect for John Cazale, whose career was cut so short by his death after this movie. He appeared in only five movies, the first of which being The Godfather. All of his movies were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. I felt the need to pay a small tribute to the unappreciated man. I read something after I finished this movie that made this entire film click in my head. The movie brilliantly uses Russian Roulette as a metaphor to represent the entire United States involvement in the Vietnam War. They don't know if they will live or die, and there is no sense, rhyme, or reason to it. Life and death is random. This is one of the last De Niro movies that I needed to see, and I am highly satisfied by his performance. Along with Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, this movie is stacked in terms of acting. I do think that they definitely could have cut out at least 20 minutes out of the first hour of the movie, because the party and wedding drag on for a while. This movie does not intend to be historically accurate. Instead, it looks into the seams and folds of friendship and trauma. Also, the scenes in the mountains are absolutely visually gorgeous. Just my two cents.",4.0
"look: i'm not going to argue that this film doesn't have flaws. forty-three years later, it remains a punishing sit - while the deer hunter is never boring, its cavalcade of misery that begins around the one-hour mark gives you the same thousand-yard stare of the film's hollowed-out vietnam veterans - and its treatment of the vietnamese people is even more problematic now than it was in 1978. director/co-writer michael cimino portrays all of the asian characters as either glassy-eyed war profiteers or sadistic torturers; even if we're supposed to take the film as the subjective perspective of, say, robert de niro's patriotic american soldier, the lack of humanity shown towards the ""enemy"" proves as dispiriting as the film's many scenes of bloody russian roulette (which cimino probably invented for the film, btw).
all that said, i cannot deny the deer hunter's undeniable filmic and emotional impact. you couldn't make a movie like this today, and i'm not just referring to its controversial aspects: this is a massive american story, with huge setpieces and hundreds of extras. the opening hour alone - which takes us through a wedding and its reception in what feels like real time - would get noted into oblivion by a thousand studio executives. rare is the mainstream studio picture that earns the descriptor ""novelistic,"" but the deer hunter contains the same specificity of incident and sweeping narrative scope that, say, tolstoy favored in anna karenina.
furthermore, it represents the apex of a kind of filmmaking that emerged in the 1970s and then vanished with the rise of spielberg and lucas: the mumblecore epic. despite the broad scale, despite the panavision location shooting, the character work has the offhand naturalism of a john cassavetes movie. our protagonists bicker and deflect and stumble through their dialogue like they're making it up on the fly. take de niro's opaque hero. it's a fascinatingly internal performance of a deeply complicated man who wants nothing more than to be uncomplicated, and de niro conveys all of this through a few half-muttered phrases and offhand glances. but this improvisational grit serves the larger canvas - if anything, the film takes on the tenor of a silent movie, so vibrant are the emotions, and so terse are the words surrounding them.",4.0

"graphic and heartbreaking beyond words. while the deer hunter borrows slight historical inaccuracies, these inaccuracies are intentional, as director michael cimino aimed for the film to have more of a metaphorical atmosphere rather than one of strict realism.
even then, the deer hunter FEELS very, very real - each performances is one of sheer, raw realism, and these performances allow yourself to even identify certain characters alongside people you’re familiar with in real life. the two leads themselves, de niro and walken, are POWERHOUSES, and walken himself is able to grasp an entire audience just by sitting still and offering a single stare. it’s incredible.

"There is a mental toughness that is attributed to being able to survive the pressures of war. But torture is known to break even the toughest of men. This is what we see through the eyes of Mike Vronsky. Michael Cimino introduces us to a group of friends in a small steel town outside of Pittsburgh. From a wedding to a hunting trip and then the Vietnam war we see some Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage present the psychology of love, war, and the result of torture. Each response differently.
This is a film that intertwines brotherhood with the anguish from torture. Vronsky before enlistment already displays a personality that could be considered distant a social behavior apart from his friends as like a lone-wolf. The film does a great job of capturing this aspect of his life through different situations. Of course, dealing with war, torture, and death results in a dark theme.
It is a well-told story, however. Just one more vehicle to remind you of what great actors Meryl Streep, De Niro and Walken are.",4.5

The length of three hours plus prevents this movie from becoming one of the greatest cinematic experiences of the 1970s; especially the wedding scenes in the first act( too much exposition is done which was not required in the first place). Walker is the standout amongst the male leads. The intense Russian Roulette sequence still holds up even after all these years! Worth checking out!",3.5
"I have seen so many actors performing, I have been overwhelmed by so many performances, and I wonder everything that's in store for me considering I have so much to explore from world cinema.

It sets up all these characters and their relationship with each other and it does so perfectly.

"The Deer Hunter is a good, albeit slightly overrated, film with some amazing high points and some disappointing lows. First of all, the cast is great. Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken are the standouts, and each deliver a knockout performance. The supporting actors are also great and do a fine job filling out the cast. The film is most famous for its “Russian Roulette” scenes, and I cannot stress enough how thoroughly impressed I was with these sequences. These are genuinely riveting, intense, and heavily troubling scenes that are made to perfection by the people in front of and behind the camera. Despite some great things it has going for it, I feel as if the film is kept from greatness because of one major issue. The major issue has to do with the film’s runtime and pacing. It clocks in at three hours and three minutes, which is a fine runtime, but it’s pacing is so incredibly slow that it has a strong sense of dragging at points. The first hour of this film is genuinely hard to get through at points because it is filled with long stretches where not much is actually happening. I wouldn’t call this film “boring”, the acting and direction are too good for me to give it such a title, but it could definitely use some cutting. I feel like this is a film that could quite easily be 20-25 minutes shorter than it is. Overall, it is a really solid film, and I would recommend it based on its legacy alone, but it does have some issues with pacing that are hard to not notice.",3.5

"Considering all the movies that analyzed and deconstructed the Vietnam war and the effects it had on the people fighting in it, I don’t think any of them get it exactly right. It’s possible that this was such a messy war that it would be hard for any single piece of content to fully encapsulate the disaster that it was. I think this is why Ken Burns attempted to do this with an almost 20hr documentary series to fit everything in (which I’m currently half way through). That said, I’m not sure any piece of art can come close to Tim O’Brien’s semi-true autobiographical novel The Things They Carry. It basically boiled down to the idea that truest war story is one that isn’t true at all. Many Vietnam films take these liberties, like this film here, but none come close to that book’s poignancy.
The Deer Hunter might not be a completely great War film or even just a film that accurately captures the PTSD experience. It’s extremely messy as far as pacing goes, it’s characters are a bit thin, and it is very self-important. Yet it’s grand scale, inspired structure, and all around ambition is something to be hold. It kind of reminded me of messier The Godfather Part II turned up to eleven with both more to say about the world and thrown in Vietnam. As I have said on here before, that while I do love the first Godfather, the second left me cold being way too pretentious for its own good. It’s the same feeling I have with this film.
Cimino seems like he wants to get across the a lot here. There’s the idea American Individualism, changing identity, trauma, fragile masculinity, and much more. Focusing on any one of these themes could have been more than enough to justify this 3hr long experience, but he stuffs so much in here that it can never be truly meaningful overall. The cinematography and much of atmospheric style here is so dreamy and disorienting, it’s hard for me not to enjoy and appreciate a lot of this. In the end though, it’s just another overwhelmingly flawed, but very interesting 70s New Hollywood epic.

SPOILERS: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK
One of my least favorite questions in the world is when someone asks me my favorite film. People know me as a Cinephile and clearly, there has to be something that reigns supreme over the thousands of other films I've seen. I can confidently come up with seven films that rotate on being my all time favorite: ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Days of Heaven,"" ""To the Wonder,"" ""The Double Life of Veronique,"" ""Contempt,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and this, ""The Deer Hunter."" Any day of the damn week, any of these films can be my favorite, each for their own different and special reasons. These, to me, are my films and none are more special than ""The Deer Hunter."" Saying that it's not only the finest War film, the best 70's film, and the greatest Best Picture winner are understatements: ""The Deer Hunter"" just might be the best movie I've ever seen.
My love for ""The Deer Hunter"" is unusual, being that it's not necessarily one of the most popular favorites to say. I know that to some, it hasn't aged at all. But for me, each viewing destroys me; there hasn't been a viewing since my first where tears have formed in my eyes. There isn't a film that destroys me more, the mastery of the film remains timeless and effective. I'll never forget my first viewing, one that happened right after I bought the DVD. And each viewing, the love doesn't diminish. I've sold the DVD and purchased the Blu Ray, I've purchased the sountrack on record, and you bet I'll be buying this on 4K or Criterion whenever it comes out (because yes, it deserves a Criterion).
People tend to forget Michael Cimino's skill as a filmmaker; ""Heaven's Gate"" (a masterwork in its own right) murdered Cimino's legacy and the string of failures afterwards only nailed Cimino in his coffin. To me, Cimino's fascination with the American Dream may not be paralleled. It's also obvious that Cimino's visual sense, combined with his ambitousness and scope of his pictures are second to none; ""The Deer Hunter's"" scope is huge, perhaps the best for any War film. But what makes Cimino's vision come full circle are the lingering moments, the intimacy and the interactions; Cimino was a perfectionist and ""The Deer Hunter"" shows this --and perhaps, this would ruin him. Scenes of little glances that Michael gives to Linda, the woman of his dreams, but cannot act on his feelings because she's with Nick, his best friend. No dialogue is needed to exhibit these hidden emotions, it's all in the acting and the direction.
I've heard complaints of the runtime of ""The Deer Hunter"" and, to be blunt, you're all wrong. It's an Epic, but it's much more than that: Cimino wants to hurt us with ""The Deer Hunter,"" he wants to hurt those who drove us into this war. But more importantly, he wants us to understand these characters, to learn how they work and what makes them unique. The Wedding scene is a perfect example of foreshadowing: Michael secludes himself only to be brought back to the party and unwinds from his serious, wound persona. Nick and Linda are falling deeper and deeper in love with one another, Stanley's a jealous man, yet cares deeply for his friends, Axel and John are lovable oafs, and Steven's impulsiveness to be like his friends lands him married with a pregnant woman who's not carrying his child. At the end, things are different. Gone are the days of laughing. Sorrow and sadness replaces the good times. Nick is dead, Michael and Linda have grown closer, but the impact of losing their best friend and partner (respectively) has a everlasting toll on them, Axel and John have matured and are plagued with the regrets of their inability to accompany Mike, Nick, and Steve into the war, Stan's become more antsy and anxious, and Steve is suffering from PTSD and the lack of 3 limbs. The three act structure is a segment about life and how impressionable we are to our surroundings. These moments in the first act are long forgotten memories, the second are the scars that will never heal, and the third is the regret and remorse and the longing we have for the simpler days.
Let's talk about the performances in ""The Deer Hunter,"" which are some of the greatest performances in any film. To me, I really can't find a male supporting actor performance win (at the Oscars) that gives a more distraught, devestating, and heartbreaking one that Christopher Walken gives; Cimino focuses in on the character's transformations throughout the three hour runtime. Nick becomes a hollowed, Heroin user, suicidal man whose traumatic experiences have mentally destroyed him. Walken's innocence at the beginning of the picture only hurts more when the finale happens. And Robert De Niro's performance (still) is one of my all time favorite performance and arguably his finest acting. De Niro balances so much with Mike's persona --the leader, the friend, the lover, and the soldier-- and each mask Mike wears is a different person and De Niro's ability to perfect that is unquestionable. There isn't a stronger presense in 70's film than Michael Vronsky (save maybe Pacino in ""The Godfather Part II) that's as tragic as a Shakespeare character, as complex and intricate like a Kubrick film, and as iconic in representing the culture of 70's Americana. Michael Vronsky was that period and De Niro blows it out of the god damn water.
There are two questions that arrise every time I view ""The Deer Hunter: Does Nick intentionally kill himself and is the ending as ironic as they come. I think so, yes to both. For the ending, we're left with our characters humming ""God Bless, America"" after Nick's funeral. America's propaganda, the ""I Want You!"" embodiment has killed so many people. Nick believed that enlisting was the right thing to do because that's what his friends were doing and that's what everyone thought he should do. Was it right? Depends on your belief, I suppose. The ending just becomes more clear as I continue to watch it: This is an intentional stab at America and all the innocence lost. My answer to the other question is also the same: Nick kills himself. That one brief moment of recognizing Mike again spoke volumes to Nick. He saw the pain Mike was in from the war, he saw the pain Mike saw when he looked at him. Nick couldn't go back to a normal life of hunting and fishing with his friends, the war had taken that from him. So, in a morbid end, grabs Mike's arm, smiles, chuckles, says one brief mention of trees, and kills himself, ending his misery and the pain he experiences. Mike craddling Nick's head in his hands is still the single most haunting image I think I have: The devestation and the realization of what and why Nick has shot himself slowly hits Mike and bursts like a volcano erupting. It's the most shattering scene in the entire picture, that few seconds is one of the most powerful scenes in film history.
I've made it a mission to watch this film once a year. I can't allow myself to forget it, it's in my blood and it's in my thoughts. ""The Deer Hunter"" is apart of me, that special film you call your own. To me, no Epic can come as close to impactful as this one does and its influence on my life and my art is unquestioned. Perhaps the film I love more than all, perhaps the best film of them all. I don't know and I don't think I'll ever know. And I'm perfectly okay with not knowing.",5.0

Movie 53 - The Deer Hunter
As a guy who is really interested in movies about Vietnam, I had already seen it, but this rewatch actually didn't mind me that much. There were a few parts (in the first and final acts) that kinda drugged, but those weren't for much. This movie spends a lot of with these characters before and after Nam and not so much in the war. That was because the movie is about how the war changes you. In difference to Apocalypse Now, the movie doesn't drive you into madness, but makes you wonder what you would do for your friends and family. The second act in Vietnam was for me the best one, but the other two were also great. The movie was about the characters and those were amazing. The acting also was incredible. Walken gave probably his best performance and De Niro gives another one of those timeless performances thar he gave especially in the 70s. There are many scenes spread throughout the film that are there just to develop the connection and the conflicts between the characters. And someone might find those boring or uninteresting, but without all them you wouldn't have such an emotional and powerful ending. The ending gave me chills. It was fantastic. My only negatives are that there are a few slow parts and that it was 15 to 20 minutes longer than it should. Anyway it was of course great.

I'd be fake to say I loved this.
I've read all of the 5-star reviews about being the best film revolving around War. I disagree, seeing that the before, during, and after segmentation didn't work in the least for me. This film has been in my watchlist since 2015 and I have started it a half dozen times over the years and it says something that I've fallen asleep every time during the first act. Not dramatic. Not hyperbole. Not a lose depiction of the truth. I have NEVER managed to get through the first act without dozing off. I don't find the first ~59 minutes engaging whatsoever. [And yes, being the math and engineering nerd that I am, I've considered the odds for which I start a movie 6 times over the course of ~3 years and NEVER make it past the 1st act. It can't be attributed to just the random probability I'm tired (though I'm sure some random error could be attributed)]. The idea of the 3rd act complementing and juxtaposing the characters from the 1st act is nice in theory but what a war itself to get to that point.
I've read all of the 1-star reviews that thinks it's a steaming pile of shit. I disagree. The segment where the group is actually in Vietnam was particularly moving and kept me on edge/engaged. Yes, yes the Russian Roulette scenes damn yes. Also yes yes the historical accuracy yes. But the minute we were back in Pennsylvania, I found myself more engaged than the first go around, especially with seeing the men and how their lives changed from war.
I fall in-between. No means love; no means hate. Just impressed with myself I managed to stay awake finally. So here's the lesson for you kids: fool me once, shame on you; fool me six more subsequent times until I finally can keep my eyes open for all 180 minutes!",3.5

Task # 3: A film your father loves
letterboxd.com/joyceheinen/list/scavenger-hunt-15-june-2016/ ___________________________________________________________________
“The Deer Hunter” is a movie classic that was especially known for that one scene: the Russian roulette scene. But “The Deer Hunter” is more than that and can easily be called a masterpiece. With this war drama director and screenwriter Michael Cimino shows us the impact a war can have on the average man.
Mike, Steven and Nick are three friends. They work together and spend their free time in bars and hunting. The three are called in to fight during the Vietnam war. There the men are captured by the Vietcong, that forces them to play a game of Russian roulette. They manage to get away, but loose each other. Mike returns to America, without knowing what happened to his friends. Steven has lost his legs and Nick is traumatized and is now playing Russian Roulette for money.
The movie is three hours long and is separated in three sections: before, during and after the war. The film is never boring, but off course we can thank the fantastic acting for that. Both Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro are brilliant in their roles.

"After a very intensive weekend of watching diverse movies I finally have to say that ""The Deer Hunter"" was definitely my Highlight.
This film is segmented in three different parts.
The first part is introducing the main characters and their families. You're getting pure-bred into their little idyllic world and see their way of life.
The second part is in Vietnam and in my opinion the most touching and most exciting part of the movie. Especially the roulette game was very intensive and disturbing. The acting of ""Robert de Niro"" and ""Christopher Walken"" was so great that I totally believed their fear of dying.
The third and final part is showing the consequences of this war and their participation in it. This is shown really dramatically and terrifying. Almost a little bit to much stereotyped for my opinion.

"Sarebbe superfluo descrivere ""Il cacciatore"". Gemello de ""L'arpa birmana"", analizza alla perfezione come esista un prima e un dopo la guerra, con esperienze che mutano completamente chi siamo. Mike, Nick e Steven non sono solo tre veterani che non usciranno mai davvero da quella capanna sul fiume: sono lo spettro di una generazione che non potrà mai più voltarsi e tornare indietro.
In quest'elegia funebre degna di un romanzo russo, Cimino di fatto ha realizzato anche il vero canto del cigno della Nuova Hollywood, prima ancora di ""I cancelli del cielo"": ci saranno sicuramente ancora titoli importantissimi come Apocalypse Now, ma quello che doveva essere comunicato è stato fatto, e da qui in poi ci saranno solo Rocky IV e Top Gun.

The two very clear yet vastly different portions of the film; pre and post Vietnam is an impactful way of storytelling. A jovial beginning yet uncertain and eventually tragic latter half really helps…",4.5
"I went into this film knowing as little as possible. I didn't know the story, who it starred or what it was even about, I had only heard of it. I really think that helped me when watching as I had no expectations at all.
Though it being based on the Vietnam war, it's more about the effects before and after the war. I feel that the Vietnam scenes should have been longer as they only take up a short amount…",4.0

"They did a great job during the 1st part of the film making you love and vibe with these characters.
The relationship between the 5 of them is so powerful I absolutely loved watching them laugh and fight and do all the things boys do. 
Then the transition of time to ‘during the war’ was stomach-turning because it was so sudden. 
All the joy we felt before got stripped away and replaced with pure disgust as we watch these once lively men quiver in fear and struggle. The lack of build up was an unexpected touch yet a good one as it brings all your emotions to the surface.
Additionally, the acting was top class from everyone involved. Probably Robert DeNiro’s best performance. The cinematography was solid and the score was levitating too.
The character development in general is eye-widening and Nicky’s development specifically stole the show. The happiest of them all became an empty, hollow, drug-addled shell with no memory of his home, his friends or any joy he’s ever experienced whatsoever…

"É um filme estruturalmente meticuloso, é não somente uma espécie de preparação ao Heaven’s Gate nesse sentido, mas até ainda mais rigoroso quanto a essa estrutura narrativa e a forma de abordá-la por meio da estendida metragem.
Isso manifesta-se pela paciência aterradora comum ao Cimino, que jamais se sobressalta, que é capaz de dilatar os instantes a fim de encontrar essa minúcia que pode revelar o âmago, seja dos homens, das mulheres, da comunidade e até mesmo da própria cidade através de um mapeamento evidente da vizinhança que compreende o mundo limitado daqueles personagens.
O contraponto da floresta acaba sendo poderoso justamente por essa preparação. Uma expurgação ritualizada, as brincadeira juvenis dão lugar ao primeiro conflito do grupo diante da câmera, como se o lugar revelasse o peso que carregam pela expectativa de uma guerra que se aproxima, promessas de ter rompido todo o contato com aquele entorno deslumbrante e, principalmente, com aquela pequena sociedade que os acolhe e que guarda seus segredos, ou seja, os desejos mais íntimos.
A brevidade da passagem da guerra propriamente dita também não é à toa, ela funciona, além de obviamente como a instauração do trauma e do testemunho do horror, como uma ponte entre dois mundos, aquele que Cimino percorreu paciente, o definiu e revelou, e aquele que agora vai ser encarado pelos soldados que regressaram, sob o ponto de vista do De Niro.
Um mundo que o diretor faz questão de referenciar à primeira passagem, são as mesmas ruas, as mesmas pessoas, mas a visão agora carrega um peso, um peso traduzido na frieza das imagens, outrora acolhedora, agora a mesma cidade traduz a desolação. Uma conclusão de uma melancolia singular, quando o trauma torna-se tudo que você conhece passar a ser distante e você um observador daquilo que ao seu íntimo importa.",5.0

"do yall know the john cazale and meryl streep lore
they met in 1976 doing a shakespeare play and fell in love instantly + moved in together. then in march 1977 he got his terminal lung cancer diagnosis and meryl did everything she could to support him and carry on as normal.. even starring in a miniseries called Holocaust which she loathed in order to pay for his medical bills. the role required her to be in austria away from john while he was getting sicker and sicker and on the last day of shooting she immediately flew back to new york and dissapeared with john for five months. she wrote this in a letter to her former drama teacher who she was very close with:
“My beau is terribly ill and sometimes, as now, in the hospital. He has very wonderful care and I try not to stand around wringing my hands, but I am worried all the time and pretending to be cheery all the time, which is more exhausting mentally physically emotionally than any work I’ve ever done.”
and then he passed away and this fucking kills me
“Meryl wasn’t ready to hear it, much less believe it,” Schulman writes. “What happened next, by some accounts, was the culmination of all the tenacious hope Meryl had kept alive for the past 10 months. She pounded on his chest, sobbing, and for a brief, alarming moment, John opened his eyes. ‘It’s all right, Meryl,’ he said weakly. ‘It’s all right.’ ” Then he closed his eyes and died. Streep’s first call was to Cazale’s brother, Stephen. She sobbed throughout.

"O franco atirador estreava há 45 anos em Los Angeles.

Americanizado demais na questão xenófoba, quando eles começaram a fazer filme do ponto de vista dos vietcongs, me chamem. Bando de imperialistas de merda.

What I love about the movie is that it takes its time. It doesn't move fast from one event to another, instead it takes half an hour to show you every single thing that happens. The film also doesn't need to do much to express a lot of emotion inside these men. Everyone is really great, I didn't really see a performance I did not really like. It's an anti-war film, and it portrays that message in a great way. It's like Paths of Glory, but I think I like this one a little bit more due to the characters that I really grew to care about.",4.0
"Heartbreaking… No glorification in the slightest & the three hour runtime moves surprisingly quick. The shots of De Niro hunting through the Appalachian mountains are breathtaking.

"Holy fucking shit. The Deer Hunter more than lives up to its sterling reputation. It’s such captivating hollywood filmmaking in every sense of the word, showcasing immaculate and petrifying, heart wrenchingly raw performances from an all star cast, coupled with the poised and uncompromising direction from Cimino which delivers the film's blunt effectiveness with cutting power. The plot itself of the film is spread across a multitude of different people but it somehow never once feels narratively disparate or incongruently disconnected. Each and every storyline is equally and intrinsically compelling in one way or another, the film never becoming boring or lethargically paced throughout its 3 hour running time, with it continually exploring the themes that are so deftly handled by Deric Washburn’s incredible script. Crucial to all of this is that the film wisely takes its time in its first half in order to establish the core conflicts at the heart of the story. It also very effectively utilizes that time to thoroughly develop its characters while simultaneously fleshing out their relationships with each other naturally. So that by the time this film takes a sharp right turn in its more stark and emotionally fraught acts beyond that point (with the movie essentially transitioning from an observational slice of life story into a full blown monolithic war epic) it’s all the more impactful to watch unfold. Cimino also shoots all 3 acts of the story with the same authentic attention to detail and meticulous composition as one another. Whether it’s in its louder action heavy sequences, its more quieter and morally contemplative dialogue driven scenes between characters, or more atmospheric moments of just laying about, the film is consistently strong in its cinematic construction. Those brief but powerful bursts of violence are particularly evocative as well and they’re incredibly well rendered through the sheer strength of Cimino’s excellent control of tone and precise technical skill. The Deer Hunter is also just a gorgeously realized film from scene to scene, with top notch production values across the board, frequently jaw droppingly stunning, visually stimulating cinematography (thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond’s assured hand) which makes great use of locations, and a murderers row of grippingly put together set pieces. On the most visceral level the film is chock full of blistering moments of cinema (that iconic roulette scene is such a brilliantly shot and tautly edited piece of suspense filmmaking) and to this day it’s still incredibly artistically rewarding. It’s hard hitting in its drama without ever coming off as maudlin or saccharine, it’s highly thoughtful and morally complex while avoiding patronizing didacticism and cheap appeals to sympathy, and it’s profoundly haunting in both its sobering imagery and in its more broad thematic implications. The resulting film may not always feel particularly breezy or fun to watch (nor is it striving to be simplistic escapism either) but it’s an unquestionably masterful piece of cinematic storytelling which begs to be experienced. I absolutely loved this movie.",5.0

"i've been dying to watch this for forever and my time has come. it for sure didn't disappoint .

this is one if not my favorite De Niro roles. 

watching him start out as this stoic and brute man turn into a guilt ridden man with a shadow of his dignity left was so fucking sad. it might've not been the most accurate potrayal of the war, it felt quite real on the apsect of what happened to soldiers that went and came back from the war. watching John Savage's character have so much life and hope for him then he gets to vietnam and almost all of his humanity is stripped from him was so heartbreaking. i wish meryl streep's character was utilized a little better but she fucking kills it, same with John Cazale. John Cazale and De Niro bounce of each other so well in the beginning tbh the whole cast together their chemistry was so good when they were all together. for a war movie there wasnt alot of war going on but i honestly preferred it.it really showed that even tho soldiers hoped to come home, the ones that did make it back never came back the same mentally or physically .the last russian roulette sequence had my jaw wired to the floor. there is a scene in the beginning where the blue hues of the sky are hitting the bar and the signs outside and i thought it was so beautiful.

There's other long sequences in this that definitely could've been trimmed.

"In my teenage years, when I was working at the video store, I distinctly remember reading an article in Total Film of the 'Most Disturbing Movie Scenes Ever' and one of them was the Russian Roulette scene from The Deer Hunter had always kind of stuck with me, but that 3 hour long runtime was always a hinderance in me watching the film as a teenager. As the years went on and I got older, I just lost more interest in ever watching The Deer Hunter. Well, that all changed. I finally down sat and watched it.
I can't lie, the 3 hour runtime was still somewhat of a slog. All of the stuff about the small town, the steel workers, and the friendships early on are kind of so-so. I get that it's all about building up the bonds of this group of men's friendships, but it still takes a good while for the film to get going. Once we reach the Vietnam War scenes, the horrors of war and the infamous Russian roulette scene, it's like a bomb goes off and the film had me by eyeballs. The Vietnam War stuff, is up there with Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.
The cast is great. The acting is pretty phenomenal. Even Meryl Streep in her supporting ""girlfriend"" role delivers. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale and John Savage are fantastic. This is also the hottest that RDN has ever looked on screen. The war scenes are unflinching and do capture the horrors of war. There are some emotionally heart-breaking scenes, one that involves a certain character committing suicide. The Deer Hunter is long, takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's unrelenting in it's depiction of the Vietnam War. Not a movie to enjoy, but I am glad I finally watched it.",4.0

"Actors Challenge #52

14. Robert de Niro
The film consists of three parts, each of which is different from the other and equally important.
The first part is the longest and serves to get to know all the characters and for the viewer to become friends with them. This part is a lot of fun and we meet our characters at their friend's wedding, they are workers who do hard physical work and now they are celebrating deservedly before going to war.
The second part comes suddenly and the viewer is instantly shocked with scenes of playing Russian roulette and torture. The symbol of Russian roulette is the most important and powerful theme of this film.
Just as the game itself is a random expression of violence, so war itself forces an individual to kill random people, where he can kill himself in the attempt, and if he is not killed by a bullet, he can leave his sanity forever in the violence of war.
The last part of the film shows the consequences of the horror of war. After the war, everyone welcomes you home as a hero, but you are nowhere near that, you only worry about how to stay sane in your head and how to take care of your comrades and friends.
In the last part of the film, it is almost unreal and sad to watch the transformation of the characters from the first part and the sarcastic singing of ""God Bless America"" at the end of the film.
De Niro is the leader in the entire film, but Christopher Walken, for whom I think this was the role of his life, and the new star in the making, Meryl Streep, should also be praised.
The film did not deal much with the description of the war, but deals more with the consequences and with the damaged human destinies.

"labours in the trauma for so long that it fails to discover the humanity, interested less in the sociopolitical moment of its war than a faceless kind of pain. overplays its hand with a banger first act that loses shape almost immediately when we’re thrust into gunfire. it’s a purposefully jarring cut that nonetheless feels less curious than the hour that precedes it. a war film, then, that’s far more compelling when its horror is domestic than when the ills of “the enemy” are left to fill in the blanks. walken nearly saves it, but the coda that follows lands hollow, an unravelled epic laid out with moments of brilliance too few and far between.",3.0

"The Deer Hunter as a movie speaks to the millions of Americans that faced national trauma during and following the Vietnam War, from hurt girlfriends and broken wives to distant friends and weary soldiers. I can’t really relate to the film in this sense, but the pact of friends being forever altered by an event none of them had any say over is compelling. The story itself is paced weirdly (they make it to Vietnam in ‘69 and leave the following year, but after a weekend of deer hunting it’s already time for the fall of Saigon?) and has jarring cuts during the second act of the movie.
That being said, the film is supported by incredible performances from Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryl Streep, and Chuck Aspegren - he’s not even an actor, he was a factory worker invited to the set so De Niro could familiarize himself with steel working and ended up getting the role after Michael Cimino and De Niro wanted him in the movie, and he still throws down one of the most realistic performances I’ve ever seen. Aside from the acting, The Deer Hunter has a solid soundtrack and good cinematography that shines during the hunting trips led by De Niro’s Mike.
Even though I have some criticisms over the film editing and pacing, I really liked The Deer Hunter. It did put me to sleep for a little while near the end so definitely have a coffee if you’re gonna watch this slow-moving three hour epic.

"This is a film that is incredibly devisive. Some people absolutely love it and some people absolutely hate it. As you can see I am on not only the love side of the spectrum but this is one of my absolute favourite films, I adore it with all my being.
I was scared to rewatch this as I honestly thought I would be bored, it wouldn't hold up. How wrong I was. It was actually even greater on rewatch. I did intend to do some work whilst I rewatched it but nope, I watched it from start to finish, didn't pick up my phone a single time and I paused once to go to the toilet. That's how incredible this movie is, I only watched it less then a year ago and was able to rewatch it now and be just as if not more engaged and love it even more.
Personally I don't have much issue if any issue with the pacing, I think it's slow and definitely gets very slow in some places but never too exhaustive and definitely not boring at all. I can see why some might struggle I guess but for me I love all three parts, yes even the wedding.
One of the many things I love most is the way we're thrown in to Vietnam in just seconds, much like the characters themselves we don't get time to process much, we have the opening wedding and hunting where we meet the characters and get small hints of Vietnam but it's with a simple cut that we arrive at about the 1 hour mark with almost no warning. It's such an effective direction and really gets you in the right mindset for what's to come. It's jarring and shocking, that's the point.
The Vietnam section is tense and great but it's the aftermath, seeing how the war has affected the characters which is what the film is really about. The last hour is powerful and tragic, especially the climax with the Russian roulette scene, that is intense. It all ends with an incredibly heart breaking and sad moment in the bar and despite how simple it is, it's incredibly effective.
The deer hunter is amongst my top 20 films of all time without a doubt. It's just incredible and I am in shock that love it even more on second viewing. This is a masterpiece, I don't care what people say, it is a truly fantastic piece of cinema. It's shocking, tragic and brave, it was the one of the first Vietnam war movies and arguably the best.",5.0
"Here's what I'm experiencing while watching this movie:
The first hour: a great build-up of the movie I love Christopher Walken! and what a nice group of friends! there's a wedding and they dance oh there's also Meryl Streep in this movie, neat. Although, I need to say this... animal cruelty in any way shape or form is my biggest pet peeve in movies.
The second hour: this is the best part of the movie hands down, it was super intense!! Robert de Niro and Christopher Walken act their ass off!!
The third hour: okay this the part of the movie that feels all over the place for me and this is also where it started to get slow... In my opinion, the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Nicky (Christopher Walken) and Mike (Robert De Niro) that's why I love the second hour so much the lack of that in the 3rd act bothers me. But they did get that very emotional scene at the end so I guess that's cool.
Overall I think this movie is not bad it just doesn't leave me a big impression after the credit rolls but that's okay like I said I do enjoy some of the parts so yeah.",3.5

"If you hated the leftist approach of Coming Home, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter was a neutral examination of the loss of innocence, war, and trauma before, during, and after Vietnam. Cimino's film is more visually poetic than Ashby's film, but both films demonstrate a human understanding of the matter. They never approach the subject like a preacher would at a church. In The Deer Hunter, Cimino exhibits an appreciation for these characters from small-town America, and he never treats them with an elitist form of condescension. The late film critic Gene Siskel once mentioned how this movie dealt with serious issues through an epic fashion like The Godfather. This is an accurate statement because many sequences are reminiscent of an epic. In terms of the acting, it is brilliant across the board with Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, and John Savage. I would argue Walken and Streep are at their best here because they demonstrate a vulnerable side of them we rarely witness. Despite the failure of his career, Cimino does not have to worry about people criticizing this film for winning the best picture award. Even though I prefer Coming Home, The Deer Hunter is a powerful and intelligent piece of filmmaking.",5.0

"Being one of the first films dealing with the darkness of the Vietnam war, The Deer Hunter is an epic achievement. It does far more than focus on the war itself, which is its greatest strength, but also a tad disappointing for a film known as a war film. The Deer Hunter fails to achieve the consistently gritty intensity of Saving Private Ryan while succumbing to quite a bit of melodrama in its first and third acts.
Michael Cimino directs The Deer Hunter in a stunningly intentional manner. There are some impressive tracking shots and meticulous long takes in this film. The style feels consistent throughout the film. Weddings, hunting scenes, Russian roulette, and the entire mourning process is all captured with the same sense of emotional detachment and subtle unease to give the film an impact that blunt brutality isn't capable of delivering. The deer hunting scenes in particular were utterly beautiful. They achieve a serene sense of beauty and grace amidst nature that cinema rarely was able to capture until the early 21st century.
Robert De Niro gives another masterful performance, and Christopher Walken gives his greatest performance that I've seen from him. Meryl Streep's emotional reactions to De Niro's emotional detachment drove home the power of the film more than the war scenes themselves. The screenplay plays to every performer's strength, and Cimino's controlled eye behind the camera makes the character moments some of the high points of the film.
For such an epic and expansive film, The Deer Hunter is filled with more bone than meat. The themes it presents are almost too easy to digest and the film's more metaphorical moments are appreciated, but every other moment is repetitive and basic in what it intends to do and what it ultimately accomplishes. I was simply left unmoved and with very little to reflect upon, which is a shame for a film this beautiful and thoughtful in every other regard.",3.5
"This is an incredible movie. Its hard to find words to describe it. Its slow and it takes its time and its about heavy shit and things feel important. I love the comradarie between the guys. I love that it barely takes place in Vietnam. I love that the wedding is basically an hour of the 3 hour runtime. The cinematography is breathtaking. Every frame has time to breath and feel alive but the mountain scenes are next level. All of the acting is fantastic, especially DeNiro (obviously) and Walken. This movie sticks with me every time I see it. Its a dark, heavy, important, and real story and its told extremely well. One of the best movies I've ever seen.

"""A blessing on the hunter sent by the Great Wolf to his children.""
Michael Cimino New Hollywood epic ‘The Deer Hunter’ is a film that draws a vast canvas, centred on the lives of three working class men from Pennsylvania who decide to enlist for the Vietnam War. Formerly chipper factory workers with a penchant for hunting and beer, the horrors of war they endure irreparably damage them in distinct but no less terrifying fashions. In this way, The Deer Hunter is less a visceral dramatisation of the Vietnam War than it is a metaphorical analysis of the middle American psyche. It is no surprise then that the three main locations of the film’s hour-long introductory chapter are the moltenous metallurgy factory, the riotous local bar and the pensive church. Initial static shots of the men performing their labour-intensive, dangerous work in the factory give way once they say their goodbyes to colleagues. Sweeping shots of the men walking to the water hole one last time before the war take over, impressing just how industrial and gritty their hometown is. We get to know the men in their favourite locale of the prototypical American bar, as this extended sequence is given time to develop a true sense of realism that gives the rest of the film a greater weight. Once Cimino’s cruel intention to have us witness Steven’s (John Savage) almost ‘farewell’ wedding to his wife-to-be becomes clear, it is impossible for the audience not to know where this headed. Still, we can’t help but feel the joy of this huge celebration of life and love, full of music, dancing and booze. Here we learn much of Nick’s (Christopher Walken) character, seemingly a kindred spirit deeply in love with Linda (Meryl Streep). Later, we come to understand Michael’s (Robert De Niro) need to control the vast landscape of the American frontier. Against lush, gorgeous imagery of the environment, we witness his exhausting search for dominance over all nature but his own. Then, we are abruptly thrust into the hellscape of the Vietnam War.
I discovered the charges of chauvinism against the film to be true in this fiery second act. Clumsy and exploitative as it is, the film dodges the full brunt of its ideological nativism through a reductive but ruthless Russian roulette metaphor. In the roulette, Cimino almost accidentally achieves a kind of savage warfare realism. The terror of the soldier’s mind is front and foremost, and his fate - entirely up to crude chance - is never under his control. War as ‘randomised death generation’ while true to a large extent, does erase the insidious intentionality underlying almost all warfare and thus, it seems appropriate for the film to have been subject to controversy at the time. Yet, the actual filmmaking itself remains riveting, leaving the audience entirely unable to assign blame to the men for their coming mental dissolution. Importantly, the war tears the formerly inseparable group of friends from one another. Michael loses his need to dominate, forever shaken by the instability of combat. Nick loses his mind, completely absent of a sense of self or a desire to return to the normality of home. And of course, Steven loses his legs, reducing him from the once fit, dashingly handsome American posterboy he was to an institutionalised freak who ‘doesn’t belong’.
The contrast between the opening and closing moments of a movie have rarely been this incisive. There is a poetic element to Cimino’s screenplay that mimics the three-act structure of heaven, hell and purgatory thereafter. In this reading, Vietnam is a sort of Dante’s Inferno, lending a heaviness to the pensive, painful final act. The men begin the film as young, confident and full of camaraderie. Their despair levels them into mere husks of the men they left home as. Steven is literally a half-man (on the nose indeed), leaving his wife and child in squalor and decay. Michael no longer seeks the thrill of the hunt. Nick comes home in a coffin. It is death, not love that brings them together in the end. The community can barely recognise them. This is a movie about the never healing wounds of war on participants and everyone around them. As Michael ‘quoting’ from Native American culture winks at, these working class boys were seduced by the great American myth of militarised Exceptionalism. The effects are devastating, and this is a film that leaves you every bit as reeling as their broken community.",0.0
"+Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale and John Savage all had amazing performances.
+All 3 acts are excellent, i really enjoyed the fact that the film covers many parts of the war. Before, during and the aftermath. This sets up very well done character development.
+Russian Roulette scenes are just insane. Brilliantly crafted to create suspense and tension. Interesting metaphor on the Vietnam war and waste of life.
+Ending is jaw dropping and heartbreaking.
+Soundtrack is great, John Williams' ""Cavatina"" is chillworthy when it hits during the ending.
+Cinematography is great, especially when mike is hunting in the Mountains.
-Whilst it was very entertaining and introduced the characters well, the opening wedding is slightly drawn out.
10/10
Overall- Deer Hunter is now one of my favourite films. Incredibly intense, showing the horrors and aftermath of war.
DID YOU KNOW- During the prisoner of war camp scene, Steven shouts ""Michael there are rats here!"" Which is John Savage actually shouting to director Michael Cimino because of his fear of rats. Also Di Niro nearly walked off set when Walken actually spat in his face in the final Roulette scene.",5.0

"AFI 100 Unspooled Watch Along
I thought this film was wonderful. I loved the cinematography and the performances. I was engaged for the entire three hours. The podcast made me rethink the way I loved this. However, I have personally decided that my enjoyment was not wrecked by the inaccuracy and often masturbatory nature of this film. This film was so violent that it was jarring, even all these years later. Many of the scenes were hard to stomach.
Meryl Streep is a straight-up goddess in this film. The second she entered the film I could not handle her beauty. Then there was Christopher Walken. He's hot? I was born in 1995, I have never been introduced to this attractive Chris Walken. His performance in this film is wonderful by the way.
Should this film be in the AFI 100, I'm not quite sure. But for me personally, I liked it a lot more than some other films from the list. I especially liked this more than Platoon, another Vietnam film on the list.
Another instance of me loving 1970s cinema.",4.5
"Great cast and iconic Russian Roulette scenes aside, I don’t know what else this film has to offer. Its themes are rather underdeveloped considering the tremendous runtime, as are the characters. Instead of being narratively well-written, they are given a lot of screen time until we feel like we know them from the sheer amount of time we’ve spent watching them—we see them go to bars, a wedding, hunting trips, etc., but we don’t know much more than that they’re friends going to Vietnam. And we only know things in roundabout ways, via a lot of unnecessary fluff. 
Yes, there are interesting moments (mostly involving Russian Roulette). Yes, there is a great cast. Yes, the films provides a unique mood and is something you should watch. But it’s too flawed to be an entirely enjoyable experience. 
Director Cimino would ruin his career and, largely, United Artists through his inability to rein in excesses while making  his next movie, Heaven’s Gate. ",2.5

Из четырёх хоббитов в Мордор отправились только трое (Сэм остался охранять берлогу). В итоге, Мериадок упал с орла и сломал ноги, Пиппин - ушел в самоволку и присоединился к банде гоблинов, а вернувшийся в Шир Фродо не смог застрелить Голлума и с горя зафрендзонил Сэма.

"A raw, intense, and haunting portrayal of the emotional turmoil and psychological human destruction on those affected by war, and not really about war itself, “The Deer Hunter” brings together marvelous performances, terrific direction, and incredibly woven screenwriting to create a deeply harrowing yet beautifully subdued story that comes from such a personal, intimate place that it makes the experience all the more heartbreaking to watch unfold. Even at a length of almost three hours, I was still utterly enthralled from the opening frame to the last, as the journey of all these characters, one just as compelling and highly complex as another, made for something completely special and it definitely pulled a particular emotional resonance with me that I had honestly never felt with any movie before.

"Oscar Movie Marathon: Movie #79 out of 96
84%
Out of all the movies I’ve seen in this marathon without any question, this was the one I was struggling to find out how I felt about it the most and went so back and forth (I have never felt this all over the place with a movie in my life and it does make me want to rewatch)? One of the way more controversial best picture winners when it was announced (if you look up the movie this was a very polarizing win considering how the subject matter was very taboo at the time talking about Vietnam this early).
One major thing that I love is the performances, everyone is giving their all and one of them is of course Christopher Walken, do I need to mention he’s one of the most bizarre yet endearing actors to ever grace cinema. Besides that statement he legit gives a really damn good performance and was easily my favorite in the movie his Oscar was 100% deserved. Robert DeNiro is also really damn good in the role with a shit ton of great scenes to look scared and even confident within especially the Russian roulette scenes with Walken. Meryl Streep, now this is more like it when I hear that she was nominated for 21 Oscar’s (a way better representation than boring ass Out Of Africa thank you for making me think she sucked even if it was a horrible character). While she’s small in the movie, she really makes an impression with what little screen time she gets. Even smaller actors like John Cazale & John Savage leaves an impact on you as well. I will admit I do like the huge contrast from the opening where it’s all happy go lucky and when we go straight to Vietnam it’s like a huge tonal shift to practically hell that your stuck in. I will say out of all the Vietnam movies I’ve seen, this easily feels the most depressing, sad, and brutal one I’ve seen even more so than Platoon, Apocalypse Now, and Born On The Fourth Of July. I also really like how this addresses all parts of the war before, middle and after and kind of reminded me of a 70’s version of Best Years Of Our Lives but with the Vietnam War. This movie also has great cinematography and editing as well Michael Cimino had a great vision for what he wanted especially having the Russian roulette scenes being so tense.
One of my major complaints I have is this movie is it loves to drag out scenes and it feels way too slow. This wasn’t a boring movie at all since it did keep my attention but I noticed that it took us 25 minutes until we finally get to the wedding and even the wedding feels so dragged out (I wouldn’t complain but the movie constantly drags out and it’s 3 hours long). I get what they were doing, they clearly wanted us to know these characters on a personal level and how happy these characters were before the Vietnam War, but goddamn did you have to have that wedding sequence be 45 fucking minutes. This movie is also weird to talk about since it feels both nothing is going on and a ton is happening at the same time. I think another thing I don’t like and why I prefer something like Platoon is that I don’t feel like I get to connect with is that it while Platoon had its dark moments, it didn’t feel overly miserable like this movie. I joked about how the wedding goes on for 45 minutes but that’s the only time in the movie where any levity is located, one we go straight to Vietnam. No levity at all and it never lets up at all. I feel mixed on how the Vietcong are treated overall, it feels like they try to make them out as savages which I thought was kind of barbaric (I know they made up the Russian roulette thing since this never happened but overall it was very effective). The musical score was kind of odd for me, some places feel so lovely in certain areas and odd in others (the odd part I think of is the heavily choir where Robert is killing the deer).
This is a movie I was so up and down watching but overall, it’s a movie I don’t think I’ll forget easily, not only memorable but just never leaves me. It’s a more brutal take on the war and while I do prefer other Vietnam movies, this one was still a very good one in its own right and worth a watch.",4.0

"QUINA MASTER MASTER MASTER PIECEEEE!!!! No li fico més estrelles perquè no es pot. De fet a una altra de les meves pel·lícules referents com The Big Lebowski, té moltíssima influència de The Deer Hunter.
Parla dels fonaments humans. De l'amor i l'odi. De l'amistat i la traïció. De la família, el dolor, la pàtria, etc etc etc. Però sobretot parla de la vida y de la mort. Però el més interessant és la reflexió que hi fa: En quin moment deixem de viure?
Crec que cap pel·lícula ha aconseguit captar els ferides psicològiques com ho fa Cimino aquí. Retrata la Guerra del Vitenam de la manera més terrorífica possible amb el concepte de “It’s all about the one shot”. La guerra és una ruleta russa. A la guerra les teves possibilitats de morir son d’una entre sis. I tot té a veure amb el “ONE SHOT”.
Aquest film ha estat el primer que després de molts anys m’ha fet plorar. No defenso que per emocionar s’hagi de fer plorar, però la proximitat amb els personatges que crea durant tota la pel·lícula i que culmina a l’última escena és d’un nivell altíssim.

Mais problemático ainda por tê-lo visto ao lado do meu irmão gêmeo, o qual compartilha comigo o mesmo carinho por histórias como as dos personagens Michael, Nick e Steven – além do interesse por Michael Cimino, cineasta que esbarramos pela primeira vez em uma sessão de ""O Ano do Dragão"", promovida por um cineclube de Florianópolis (era segunda-feira, se não me engano, dia mais chuvoso de janeiro de 2018).
São três horas de duração, três personagens principais, três fatias específicas da vida deles – cortadas por elipses elegantes.

"Can we get a remastered edition with better sounding/looking gunshots? Have modern special effects spoiled me?
If they remade this today, in addition to improved FX, it would start an hour in, just before the guys ship off to Nam. And it would probably be called RUSSIAN ROULETTE. I don’t know if it would be better than this movie, just like I don’t know if we needed a whole hour of DeNiro, Walken, Streep and the rest of the gang being happy so we could truly feel the despair that follows.
I do know I wish that extended setup had more going on. There’s some good character stuff in there, and it culminates in a beautiful musical performance but... I felt the length. Then again, there’s something poetic about seeing these people just mill about, plot-free, when we know they’re very likely headed toward a world of pain.

"Sooo, this was on telly...
My dad was never very good with names, with titles or plots when it came to movies. Often halfway through a film he would suddenly remark ""I think I've seen this"" and still be surprised by the ending. He remembered odd details, very specific scenes or moments, not necessarily important ones. One of the things he remembered was the ""Can't take my eyes off of you"" song. Whenever that song came up somewhere he would turn to me and ask, ""hey what's that film with this song? I think it's about Vietnam. Was it the film where Al Pacino was like a hunter and they were forced to play Russian Roulette? What's the name of that film?""
Well, Al Pacino is Robert De Niro and the film is ""Those who go through hell"" if we literally translate the German title. I had last seen this one ages ago and my memory was not much unlike my dad's. I forgot what an odd and fascinating structure Michael Cimino's film has. We spend almost an hour with the wedding, with singing ""I love you baby"" and people dancing to Russian folklore. The way up to the hunting destination including the prank where one of the guys is being left behind takes up almost more time (five minutes maybe) than the actual deer hunt. And then one enormously effective cut shoves, no, blasts us right into Vietnam where we witness one shockingly chaotic moment until we find our three protagonists captured.
It's gurelling and cynical, though it treads a very thin line not to turn cynically comical. De Niro and Christopher Walken ground those moments with their intense performances. And Cimino still has an hour to go once De Niro forces Walken to play along with three bulletts in the gun.

It has some great moments (the roulettes, even if they are overused) but, overall, a disembodied, redundant piece that feels too self important and that could have used some good trimming to become the great movie it wants to be.

"For good or bad you can feel the runtime. When we meet this group of friends at a wedding, we watch them having fun and then the twists and turns of not just life, but a war hit them and change them. It certainly feels like a very somber full circle moment when we leave them at a funeral.
It's not an ""easy"" watch, but there are some really powerful performances in here. As with any piece on Vietnam, there…",3.5

"What can be said about Robert De Niro that hasn't already been said. This film is such a heartbreaking snapshot on how frail we all are as humans. It had been such a long time since I had last seen this from beginning to end I had forgotten certain sections of the movie. The opening from them leaving work, going to the bar, the wedding and the hunting trip goes on for so long I felt like two minutes had passed. I could watch another hour of that alone.
Enter the Vietnam portion of the film and as memorable and controversial it is, we do see the darker half of how humans can easily go down a road and never return. And even though Michael, De Niro's character, seems to come out of it unscathed, he really doesn't, and it shows upon his return home. He avoids the welcome home party and the scene in the motel when he first checks in shows us why he's arguably the great American actor ever.
The entire cast is, in a word, perfect. Cimino's best work and a film that sits atop Mt. Olympus of one of the greatest of the 70's and War films ever created.
Shattering.",4.5
"The rural working man's epic with a deliberate and hollow aesthetic of pride. Aimless and operatic in some irony-accented 'War and Peace' celebration of man while populated by the absent - drunk or lost or both.
Even the film's grave moral failing - that of the North Vietnamese being depicted as a very caricatured style of evil that feels out-of-place for a film better placed in its own nuance (though I'm willing to forgive the Russian Roulette stuff as a strong vision of ""the random"") - I don't believe it's entirely divorced from the perspective of its characters or the delirium of some unknown enemy as angry at you as you are at them. A sometimes bizarre ethical idea of the war that, to its benefit, never feels fully decided or dedicated to the proper ""hero"". Even the exceptional feels born from chaos and desperation rather than simply perusing and propping up a protagonist.
A remarkably fascinating cast in its dynamics - for every generational star (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep), there's an actor we'd never see on the big screen again (John Cazale, Chuck Aspegren, Pierre Segui). Most if not all of them are terrific in roles that are equally humble and demanding.
In frequent turmoil and debate following its release, widely praised and ever-divisive. A strange corner of American cinema stopped dead in its tracks not long after the fact. A haunted experience and the rare rural epic that the auteur could only then afford.",4.0
"I feel the character-writing is low-key bad due to how paper-thin a lot of the characters feel (making the overlong first act kind of useless), but the performances by DeNiro, Savage and especially Walken here are so terrific that you kind of don't notice that at all.",4.0
very good film - guess you’re never coming back from war quite the same,4.5
"The first act drags a bit during the wedding, although there are very important seeds being planted during that first hour. Aside from that, this film is practically flawless. What a trip. What an experience. Christopher Walken blew my mind. The first time he witnesses the games in Saigon made me cry. De Niro’s layered performance was extremely impressive as well; a head-strong survivor leading confidently yet barely holding it together at the same. A beautiful depiction of male friendship and the lengths man will go for his friends, and a harrowing display of the ramifications of war on a man, on a city, on a country, on a species.",4.5
"Strangely I've seen this film in pieces before but this was a first complete viewing.  And I struggled to get into it.  The first hour is entirely a drunken Russian Orthodox wedding followed by a deer hunting piss-up with a dead animal strapped to the car at the end.  I just couldn't develop any empathy for these guys based on that.  The prison camp escape is undeniable filmmaking genius though and has a thoroughly justified place in cinematic history.  Harrowing, believable and superbly performed.
But that's everything, Michael’s stoic return home, Steve’s hospitalization, and Nick’s suicidal behaviour, all felt too shallow because the characters didn't connect with me at the beginning.  And I know Russian roulette is psychotic, did we really need so many examples to prove the point?  Overall a deserved classic as one of the first gritty examinations of wartime PTSD but also one with quite a few flaws.",3.0
"This is this.
A real monster of a film. Three distinct in-tone acts divide this epic up.
We have the pre-war section kicking off the first hour. Like Days of Heaven also in 1978 we open with some hellish manual labor in a steel mill, the characters we follow working with harsh molten material. So much fun watching those guys in the bar. Cimino wants to build and flesh out a community, we have the extended wedding sequence which could be a twist on Visconti and the gorgeous steely blue exteriors as De Niro runs through the town like a mad man. The film really ascends in the hunting trip, maybe the last moment of joy here. A stunner long-take of Dzundza chasing after the car with the lake and forest in the background, Cimino showing off the epic landscape. Then we have their lil picnic with a momentous glacier as a backdrop, a hilarious conversation with Cazelle always forgetting his boots. Cimino will return to the deer hunt later in the film and some how to make it ever more miraculously beautiful. Then we have that final scene back in the bar, Cimino showing off with some great split diopters capturing the now more solemn mood.
Then we cut to the war. Beginning with raw spectacle, bombings and De Niro flaming down the Viet Cong. Another jump cut flipping the situation and revealing a grisly set piece; the riverside shack and its watery prison divided by a trap-door. The Russian roulette is what people remember most about this film for good reason, even on a rewatch it's still nerve-wracking. This doesn't work nearly as well without Cimino's choice of POW camp, this setup even allows the blood to fall into the water making things worse.
Back home, Cimino's thesis is showing the devastation on the community he took his time building up earlier. The second deer hunting trip is just a godly sequence. De Niro walking along the ridge, backed by clouds and fronted by his reflection in grey water has to be one of my favourite shots in cinema. Zsigmond just shoots the hell out of this sequence, De Niro tracking through the hills is awesome.
De Niro returns to Saigon which Savage said is going to hell and you feel that. The film's most tragic sequence is all shot at night and a total onslaught of perfect lighting. The streets and rivers at night at stunning, the gambling den is another great moment with how packed it is with men eager to see bloodshed. Walken's zombie-like appearance here is devastating, then when the film ends in twenty minutes there's the genius move with the credits that remind you how good things were before the war.
De Niro, Walken and Streep with some of their best work to date.
So much connective tissue between this and Heaven's Gate (I have as a much stronger effort though that is no insult to this film), like Zane pointed out the travel to a new region aspect, but also the wedding here is something Cimino evolved into the grand dances in Heaven's Gate, (there's also the intense violence and tragedy, these two films have some of the saddest endings out there).
A masterpiece.",5.0
"OBRA MAESTRA.
Empece a verla a las 11PM para ver media hora y el resto el siguiente día, pero me agarro del cuello y no me soltó hasta las 2 de la madrugada.
Prologo:
Con 3 horas de duración, The deer hunter -que por alguna razón tradujeron como ""El Francotirador""- se planta en la vida cotidiana de un pequeño pueblo obrero estadounidense rural, seguiremos la vida de 6 amigos de los cuales 3 se enlistaran a la guerra en Vietnam y 3 se quedaran.
Esta película se cocina a fuego lento, pero lejos de ser una cinta contemplativa, el primer acto donde se nos alimenta de la cotidianidad del grupo está para mi perfectamente dirigida, pues su propósito es darnos un punto de referencia para comparar la manera en la que la guerra de Vietnam directa o indirectamente ha cambiado/corrompido lo cotidiano.

They must have hoped that when it all was over,
they would just pick up where they left off,
only a little tougher, with victory still running in their veins.
What’s there, instead, is that they all prefer to handle this, alone.
They assume, all by themselves, that no one who wasn’t there will understand.
They’re probably right.
Someone volunteers to cook, just so they can be alone inside the kitchen,
making sure that no one sees them when they begin to fall apart
They start to hum, because they don’t know what to do when no one’s talking.
Before long, everyone inside the room picks up the tune, and begins to softly sing

"Another one of my all timers. Hands down one of the greatest films ever made. Also one of the most devastating. 
Earlier today when I found out it was Walken’s 80th I said to myself damn I should watch The Deer Hunter. 
Then MY WIIIFE of all people (if you know her she’s pretty much never going to suggest a war film) says let’s watch The Deer Hunter. I will never say no to that! Thank you Natasha Lyonne for posting pics of The Deer Hunter today, you damn beautiful angel you!
If you know me in real life I’m sure I’ve talked in many lengths and exhausted you on why I think this is one of the greatest films & war films ever made. 
The set up alone is one of the most brilliant ensemble character set ups of all time. The first hour of them getting off work, getting smashed after work and then the wedding truly says it all and it shows you where this film is going. The opening hour gets better every time I watch this. It’s so damn rich. 
From the friendships, the camaraderie, the wine spilling on the brides dress, the interaction with the green beret, the boys going deer hunting, to the final moment in the bar with ‘John’ (who to me resembles a Farley) he plays that sad little number on the piano and that transitions right into the middle of chaos in Vietnam. We don’t even see the boys off, it just jumps straight into the shit. Impeccable filmmaking. 
There the boys finally meet back up and are immediately captured. What follows is one of the most horrific sequences in cinema history. I know there’s plenty of other war films and other terrifying moments in them but this one really does it to me, every single fucking time. One of the best depictions of terror I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen this so much and it still puts my stomach and nerves in KNOTS. 
Then we get the aftermath of war and eventually coming home (or not coming home). Which again to me this is one of the best depictions of all of that as well.
They hype up our citizens in this country to go fight in their bullshit wars and this is the reality of that. Again the Green Beret in the beginning says it all. We send off people like this and then expect them to eventually come home and shake it off. Absolutely fucking impossible. Especially this war, there was no damn business of any of this except the business for the scumbags to profit. Lovely place. I could keep going but let’s not…
I can say this is Robert De Niro’s best performance but also that’s impossible to say because he’s about to have his 10th collaboration w/ Scorsese and well I’m just gonna go ahead and say all 10 are masterful because I know 9 are and I’m confident the 10th will be. This is De Niro at his finest no matter how you wanna rank it though. 
Also Walken, good god is he incredible in this. He’s so fucking gone by the end but that little piece of him comes back and it’s so brilliant. Plus this is the last performance from the GREAT John Cazale. He was sick during filming this and you can tell, he’s so thin, poor guy. Bless that man’s gorgeous soul, he’s always unbelievable. Don’t forget another Goat that’s in this: Meryl Streep. She shows you why too.

The performances were amazing and I can say that Christopher Walken definitely earned his Oscar for playing Nick. His character was the one that I ended up sympathizing with the most, and was gutted by what happened to him in the ending. Certainly heavy to watch, but I can at least say that I wouldn't mind revisiting this one again in the distant future!",5.0
"Winner of Best Picture for the 1978 Academy Awards, The Deer Hunter is a stunning achievement in 70's filmmaking as well as a staunchly anti-war film that is powerful, harrowing, well made and sad in equal measure.
Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage all give outstanding performances as a trio of friends who leave their homes in Pennsylvania to fight in the Vietnam War. The result is an epic film that is 3 hours long, yet never wastes a single frame.
The late Michael Cimino's direction is spot on this film and its a shame his later directorial films couldn't match the brilliance of this one. It is one of those films you must see at least once in your lifetime. This is also the final film starring John Cazale, who sadly passed away after filming.
Even after 44 years, The Deer Hunter proves to be an impressive film of the New Hollywood era. Brutal and shocking? Yes. Overlong and boring? No.
But definitely give it a watch",4.5
"Είδα ξανά τον Ελαφοκυνηγό στο αγαπημένο μου θερινό της Αθήνας μετά από αρκετό καιρό και κατάλαβα γιατί θα είναι πάντα η πρώτη ταινία που μου έρχεται στο μυαλό όταν με ρωτάνε για τις αγαπημένες μου ταινίες. Ο Ελαφοκυνηγός ξεκινάει με έναν γάμο και τελειώνει με μια κηδεία. Ο κύκλος της ζωής από τον Μάικλ Τσιμίνο. Και τι κύκλος. Παρακολουθούμε μια παρέα παιδιών μεταναστών στην Πενσυλβάνια της εργατικής τάξης. Νέοι, ωραίοι, με όλη τη ζωή μπροστά τους. Μετά τη δουλειά τους στο εργοστάσιο πηγαίνουν για μπύρα και μπιλιάρδο, τα Σαββατοκύριακα πηγαίνουν να κυνηγήσουν ελάφια. Μερικοί από αυτούς πρόκειται να παντρευτούν. Η ζωή όλων θα αλλάξει για πάντα όταν αποφασίσουν να καταταγούν για να υπηρετήσουν Θεό και Πατρίδα στο Βιετνάμ. Η ταινία αποτελείται από τρία μέρη αφηγηματικά. Το πριν, το εκεί και το μετά. Το αγαπημένο μου σκέλος όσο και αν φαίνεται αργό ή αχρείαστο στον θεατή του σήμερα είναι για μένα το πιο συγκινητικό και το πιο όμορφο αυτής της κατά τ'άλλα αψεγάδιαστης ταινίας. Η καθημερινότητα τους και η ζωή τους πριν βιώσουν από κοντά την απόλυτη φρίκη. Το τέλος της αθωότητας. Όχι Βιετκόνγκ, Ρώσικη Ρουλέτα, ζούγκλα, βασανιστήρια και μια κόλαση επί γης. Γάμοι , μπιλιάρδο, χοροί, έρωτες, κυνήγι. Αυτά είναι πράγματα που πρέπει να αφορούν 4 αγόρια στα καλύτερα τους χρόνια. Δυστυχώς το Βιετνάμ λειτούργησε και θα λειτουργεί για πάντα ως η μεγαλύτερη πληγή στην ιστορία του Αμερικανικού έθνους. Παιδιά που απώλεσαν κάθε αθωότητα, άντρες που έμειναν ανάπηροι, κατεστραμένοι σωματικά και ψυχικά άνθρωποι. Τρομερό παράδειγμα η παρουσία ενός βετεράνου στον γάμο στην αρχή. Ένας ζωντανός νεκρός, χωρίς καμία όρεξη να σχολιάσει το τι έχει δει εκεί. Ο Ντε Νίρο τον χλευάζει περιμένοντας να του πει για μεγάλες στιγμές γενναιότητας ίσως. Πόσο λίγο μπορεί να φανταστεί τι θα συναντήσει εκεί. Όταν κοιτάς την άβυσσο κατάματα γίνεσαι κι εσύ κτήνος, πόσο μάλλον όταν μπαίνεις στην άβυσσο ολόκληρος και δεν σταματάς να πέφτεις. Καταφέρνει να επιστρέψει στην πατρίδα διαλυμένος. Σχεδόν σαν φάντασμα περιφέρεται παντού με τη στολή του βετεράνου. Κουβαλάει το τραύμα του και πλέον δε μπορεί να σηκώσει όπλο ούτε απέναντι στα αγαπημένα του ελάφια. Ο χαρακτήρας του Κρίστοφερ Γουώκεν περνάει ακόμα χειρότερα. Μόνος στη Σαϊγκόν και κουφάρι του εαυτού του θα καταλήξει να παίζει τη Ρώσικη Ρουλέτα που τον έβαλε να παίξει ο Ντε Νίρο για να ξεφύγουν από τους Βιετκόνγκ. Είναι γενναίος και τυχερός ή μήπως προσπαθεί να σκοτωθεί με κάποιον τρόπο επειδή η ύπαρξη του δεν έχει κάποιο νόημα πλέον; Ο τρίτος της παρέας επιστρέφει σακάτης και ζει σε ένα κέντρο αποκατάστασης για να περάσει το υπόλοιπο της ζωής του. Ο Τσιμίνο σκηνοθετεί αθόρυβα το τέλος της Αμερικής και του Αμερικάνικου Ονείρου. Και για αυτό το υπέροχο πρώτο μέρος είναι ακόμα πιο δυσβάσταχτο να το παρακολουθείς όταν ξέρεις τι συμβαίνει μετά στην ταινία. Ποτέ δεν θα είναι ξανά τόσο ευτυχισμένοι. Ποτέ δεν θα ξανακυνηγήσουν χωρίς να βιώνουν τον τρόμο του να σηκώνεις όπλο. Ποτέ δεν θα χορεύουν ανέμελοι το Can't take my eyes of you . Κράτησα για το τέλος την υπέροχη ιστορία του Καζάλε. Ο μεγάλος αυτός ηθοποιός διαγνώστηκε με καρκίνο πριν αρχίσουν τα γυρίσματα και κανείς από την παραγωγή δεν ήθελε να τον δεσμεύσει. Εκεί επενέβη η Μέριλ Στριπ που ήταν ο μεγάλος έρωτας της ζωής της και ήθελε να είναι δίπλα του στις τελευταίες του στιγμές, είναι συγκλονιστικό το πόσο καταβεβλημένος φαίνεται στην ταινία και παρόλα αυτά παίζει υπέροχα. Επίσης δεσμεύτηκε ο ίδιος ο Ντε Νίρο να πληρώσει την ασφάλεια του Καζάλε ώστε να γίνει η ταινία. Δεν ήθελε ούτε στιγμή να γίνει η ταινία χωρίς το συγκεκριμένο καστ. Ήταν ο απαράβατος όρος του για να γυριστεί μια ταινία που έχει ψηφιστεί ως η πιο καταθλιπτική ταινία όλων των εποχών αλλά για εμάς που την αγαπάμε είναι μια ζεστή αγκαλιά από τον Τσιμίνο και όλους τους υπόλοιπους συντελεστές κάθε φορά που επιστρέφουμε. Πιστέψτε με, δε γίνεται να δεις αυτό το αριστούργημα και μετά να μην βουρκώνεις κάθε φορά που ακούς το I love you baby σε κάποιο γλέντι γάμου. Απλά δε γίνεται.
You're just too good to be true

"I had seen the first hour of this in the pre vax days when I was still in Portland. I was so immersed in this world and how lush and romantic and flawed everything was. My wifi cut out just before the POW scene got going and it may be the most I’ve ever been pissed that a movie wasn’t able to be completed in one sitting because I could tell it was on its way to becoming an all time fave. 
Flash forward approx a year later and I’m sitting in the Secret Movie Club theater watching a 35mm print with approx 25-30 other people. I’m worried I’m gonna be bored because I’ve seen the first hour already. Was I a LITTLE bored?? Ya, but not because it’s bad, because I was so struck by the world and characters that it never left my brain to begin with. 
Now that I’ve seen the other 2/3, I can safely say there ain’t nothing like this that I’ve seen. Even after more than 40 years, this one still fucking hits hard at every turn. The first act is so lush and beautiful and messy. The second is so chaotic and intense and stark. The third is so cohesive and painful and tender.

"This movie will crush your soul.
The Deer Hunter starts off seeming like a dumb movie with a great cast, but then it suddenly switches tone completely, and when the main character of the film returns, the places from the beginning of the film felt completely different, they felt confused, sad, lonely.
Speaking of sadness, holy shit, this is up there with the saddest films I’ve seen, thanks in most part to the Oscar worthy performances from De Niro and Christopher Walken.
The most interesting thing about this film is how it portrays Saigon in the middle of the war, it’s interesting to watch just how it supposedly was then. And not just that, all the Vietnam scenes in general in this film are very well done!
Shocking, tense, and it leaves you speechless. That’s The Deer Hunter in a nutshell.",5.0
"Masterpiece (Top 1-3 of the year quality)

The Deer Hunter is both a war film and an epic, but I would hesitate in joining those two words together. The war scenes take up a relatively small portion of the 3-hour run time, but the resulting trauma is felt long after its immediate impact. The epic side of the film comes from the rich character drama, spanning years in the lives of three men sent to fight in Vietnam and their friends back home in a blue collar Pennsylvanian town. Mike, Nick, and Stevie go on colossal journeys, and it is a testament to Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage’s acting that the distant start and end points for each character are so effectively bridged by every moment in between.
Back home, these men’s lives are heavily rooted in tradition and ritual. They work 9-to-5 manual labour jobs at the local steel mill, its hulking metallic structures cropping up all across this industrial landscape, permeated in smoky greys and blues. Their regular deer hunting trips are meditative retreats, allowing them to bask in the cold, harsh beauty of Pennsylvania’s rocky terrain. Out of all these men, Mike abides by the strictest ethos – “one shot.” That’s all it should take to kill a deer, finishing off a job cleanly and painlessly. It is also apparently also the same number of chances one should have for anything, as Mike grows sick of Stan’s forgetfulness and refuses to lend him his spare hunting boots. While his friends recklessly shoot their way through the mountains, Mike prowls around like a silent predator, only taking his shot when he is sure of his mark. His methodical hunt is underscored by choral music, imbuing it with a transcendent spirituality that can only be found in the heart of America’s wilderness.
Though Mike’s faith is rooted in his principles, he too belongs to the same Russian Orthodox church as his friends. It seems like almost every minute of Stevie’s ornately traditional wedding is filled with key character moments that efficiently set up their arcs. Stan lashes out at a man dancing with his girlfriend, revealing an immaturity that justifies his non-participation in the war effort. Nick asks Mike to have his back even at the point of no return, as he recognises a strength in his best friend that he himself lacks. It is the same resilience that attracts Linda, Nick’s girlfriend, as she and Mike share furtive glances across the dance floor at the reception, thus setting up a complex development in their relationship further down the track when Nick fails to return home.
Noticing a returned army veteran at the reception bar, the men approach him with respect. When they ask him what fighting in the war is like, his only response is a dismissive, despondent “fuck it”. He is an empty shell who has seen worse things than any of them can comprehend, foreshadowing their own futures. In one final goodbye, the men gather at a bar and listen to John’s poignant piano music. As if realising that this is the last time any of them will all be in the same place with their innocence intact, they silently sit and listen, soaking in what will soon become a nostalgic memory. It takes a long time for the film get to the war, but this lengthy setup is both necessary to feeling the emotional weight of what has been lost, and utterly enjoyable as we grasp onto the last vestiges of normality.
A harsh cut to an exploding Vietnamese village brings us forward in time, deep into the conflict. Mike, Steve and Nick have already suffered greatly, but compared to what’s to come, this is nothing. We watch as they are tortured physically and psychologically, break free of their POW camp, and are rescued by a helicopter. Were it not for the subsequent separation, they may have all been able to make it back home intact. But with Steve’s legs amputated, Nick’s temptation into a Saigon gambling den, and Mike’s survivor’s guilt, their bleak futures are set in stone.
In a marvellous mirroring of act one, The Deer Hunter’s final act returns to scenes of hunting and religious ceremonies, though these rituals are tainted with trauma. Mike’s steady hand is gone, as he is now unable to kill a deer in a single shot, and in place of a wedding the men commemorate their lost friend in a funeral. Steve, the man who once bristled at dirty jokes about his wife, is so full of shame over his injuries that he can’t even face her anymore. Nick, a man who once delivered a hearty rendition of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You”, becomes a pale, gaunt zombie with no recollection of his life back home. Mike, the man who doesn’t believe in second chances, returns to Vietnam to give one to Nick. “One shot,” Mike reminds him. “One shot,” Nick smiles back. And that’s all it takes to end things cleanly and painlessly, like a deer marked for slaughter. Even with his identity recalled, the suffering is too much to handle.
Seeing how little the focus The Deer Hunter places on warfare, its questionable authenticity barely matters. Michael Cimino is most of all interested in masterfully depicting the extensiveness of the Vietnam War’s psychological destruction, far beyond its immediate impact. The POW scenes are certainly terrifying, but the truly disturbing moments are those which reveal the permanent impact of war on the relationships between these men and those who cannot comprehend the horrors they have witnessed. There is no glorification of American nationalism to be found here. Just a dark, despairing view of a conflict that left its surviving soldiers worse off than its deceased.",5.0
"I’m not going to wear a scarf with a tuxedo.
Yes Steven had the best line. 
Christopher Walken is a total baddie in this. The whole wedding scene in the beginning had me dying over what a sweetie he was. Glad he got to do some dancing. 
Anxiety through the roof with this whole Russian roulette business, every time I thought they were done with it they came right back harder than ever. Jesus.
While there is a fair amount of screen time given to the Vietnam War, I think the intro of the guys in their hometown works really well in lending your sympathy towards them as you watch their inevitable descent into madness, cruelty, and survival.

It's the specificity. These very particular people in this very particular place. Using the plight of immigrants as a way to simultaneously convey the pride and patriotism of the wartime effort while also plainly showing the unrelenting damage that was done to the communities and people after is a sly kind of genius.
Michael Cimino was able to make en emotionally potent tale about the varied effects of Vietnam without making any defining statements on the war itself or the people who signed up to help. He didn't make an Anti-War film with The Deer Hunter, he made a Pro-People one.",4.0

"The fifty-first Best Picture winner and dear god is it bleak.
Yeah, I guess it's technically a war movie but it's not about the war itself, moreso the effects it has on the regular joe who is the one who goes over and does the actual fighting. This in turn affects their lives back in their home town and it spirals out from there like a disease.
There is little happiness in the story, even from the beginning. There's a wedding but we see things already starting to deteriorate between the characters in the first act. Women are being struck by men, men are missing their own wedding because of spending time at the bar, risking their lives by racing a truck immediately, wanting to fight a man back from the war because he wasn't positive about his experience, and much more. It's stunning to me that people think that the wedding scene is boring. Yeah, it's slower and more deliberately placed that you'd expect but a lot of important stuff happens in it!
I don't know how much of the third act is supposed to be literal or allegorical. The repeated use of Russian Roulette seems like a metaphor for American society and what is expected of people in it. Make these choices or else. This is going to sound so silly but during the wedding scene, they play the song ""Korobeiniki,"" mostly known in the West as the Tetris music from the popular Game Boy edition and it made me think about the characters as blocks in the system. They're falling into place and once everything is set up and filled in, these people disappear just like a completed line in Tetris. It's not a perfect idea and it's clearly not intentional since this film predates Game Boy Tetris by over a decade but it kinda works, I think? Maybe I should try to get some more sleep tonight instead, heh.
It's an interesting post-Vietnam artifact and it's still relevant today. Don't take the film literally and you'll probably get even more out of it. And don't expect easy viewing. It's stressful and bleak.",4.5

"Cimino sure loves his wide angle environmental shots. Every other Vietnam film I see I get the feeling like they can’t possible add anything more to the subject, but then I’m struck by another one. The Deer Hunter was one of those new Hollywood classics I never got around to. This sure was nothing like what I had in my imagination. It’s a three hour journey of men before, during, and after war. One of the only war films other than the The Thin Red Line that highlighted the panic attack experiences that many soldiers suffer from during these traumatic events and actually making you have an anxiety inducing moment along with them. The perfect balance of maintaining tension here is incredible. De Niro and Walken give some of their best performances and the rest of the supporting cast is brilliant as well. It’s one of those films that feels pointless to talk about because it’s eternally carved into the canon of cinema that whatever I could possibly say has most likely been said to death.",0.0

"Несколько лет назад не смог продраться дальше первого акта с этой разухабистой свадьбой. И вот, наконец, исправился перед собой за эту ошибку. Первый час всё ещё мне кажется утомительным, но я понимаю, почему он такой, и даже не буду отрицать, что именно в таком виде он лучше всего и работает на дальнейшее повествование. В итоге благодаря этому резкий переход к Вьетнаму ощущается как удар, от которого тяжело оправиться не только героям, но и зрителю. А полный неимоверной печали акт трети вообще не позволяет сдержать слёзы. И, естественно, чудесный эпилог: то ли воодушевляющий, то ли по-грустному издевательский - тут уж как посмотреть. 
В целом же, очевидно, тяжеловесный и опустошающий фильм о вечной русской рулетке, вечных последствиях войны, в которой нет выигравших: кто-то лишился конечностей, кто-то - души, а кто-то - всего и сразу. Одним остаётся оставаться в этом аду до последнего выстрела, а другим - возвращаться домой в надежде вновь вернуть былую жизнь. Да вот только война - даже не конкретно вьетнамская, а любая - легко лишает этой надежды, ведь несёт лишь боль, смерть и слёзы. И оправиться от её призрака очень сложная задача.
P.S. Уокен, конечно, потрясающий, не могу это не отметить. Однако печальнее всего осознавать, говоря об актёрах, что это был последний фильм Казеле. По сути снялся в пяти больших, потрясающих фильмах и в каждом запоминался и был хорош. Эх, эх, эх",4.5
"Despite a slow start The Deer Hunter lived up to the high expectations. De Niro in this was truly great, as was Walken in the supporting role who put on a performance for the ages and deservedly won an Oscar. I also liked the way the film had 3 different acts similar to Full Metal Jacket where we first saw a more personal side of the characters, to them then going into war followed by a dramatic final hour. And finally, that Russian roulette scene might just be one of my favourite scenes of all time.",4.5
"I watched The Deer Hunter for the first time last week. I had always been reluctant to visit this film for a variety of reasons, spanning from the terrifying runtime to its genre, which is one I do not tend to enjoy. Is this really a war film though? In my quest to fulfill my expectations, and after the first hour had gone by, I told my mom ""Oh alright so Now they are going to Vietnam"". How happy I was to realize as the remaining acts unfolded that Hell No I was not watching Apocalypse Now 2.0, that here Vietnam was relegated to an ever-present background and used as a tool to tell the stories of the characters, and not the other way around. 
The first part of the film seems never-ending in the best possible way, in how it envelops you completely and doesn't let you look away from the utter mundaneness of the scene, from the familiarity of it all. I am neither from Slavic descent nor a 30 year old part-time hunter, and yet the universal motifs of tight-nit camaraderie and shared dreams are present in every minute of this; anything else becomes unimportant. By the time the wedding was over, I was overcome with the feeling that I had always lived in 1960s Pennsylvania, unbeknownst to me. I couldn't stop thinking about how smart a move it was on Cimino's part to introduce the protagonists in such an unhurried and caring way, but still in a gripping enough manner that it wouldn't really bother the viewer if the film never took a turn and instead remained focused on its initial location and early conflicts.
The closest The Deer Hunter gets to resembling a conventional war film is during a roughly 1-minute scene in which De Niro shoots here and there for a while; he is then reunited with his two life-long friends. Their finding each other alone was, at this point, enough to stir something in me. The ensuing scenes are elucidating: war has been going on for a while now, but we Don't Care about that, look at what it has done so far. After being struck by the image of Steven's wrecked self and given approximately 1 second to recover, we are mercilessly thrown into what is one of the best scenes I have ever seen put on film. I would like to note that at this point in time I had no idea what Russian roulette was or how it worked, the only reference I could turn to being Rihanna's 2009 hit, so I watched the whole thing quite confusedly. The emotional reaction it aroused in me, though, was unaffected by my not understanding shit. I had tears in my eyes by the time it was over. 
I am finding that I really dislike making structured reviews so I would rather like to mention a few other things from the film that affected me so deeply that it scared me: Nick's parents' birthdays, Michael driving off unseen by his friends after coming home, the veteran's ""Fuck it"", the spared deer, Michael's ""Remember the trees?"".

De Niro / Michael regge da solo tutto il film, il personaggio è talmente eroico che non esita a rischiare più volte la sua vita per salvare quella degli amici, e l'interpretazione di De Niro è superba.

I honestly can't remember when was the last time I disliked a movie so much.
A waste of potential from HUGE EMINENCES like De Niro and Streep, but every single character down to the last creditable performance in this movie feels flat and awkwardly written, let alone the acting part.
Dialogues are awful, the story is extremely slow and confusing (at least for me; okay, the aftermath of war, and then? spoiler alert: nothing.)
Cinematography was okay but much more like whatever, editing is goddamm awful most of the times (and okay, I get it's the late 70s, but by then we already have masterful pieces by Scorsese/Schonmaker and Coppola/Murch!) And 3 hours? Holy damn, you could've easily cut 50 minutes from it and still be the same bad story but at least we can get to watch another thing to wash this off.
I think that my biggest two issues with this movie are 1) how ""casually"" and ""victimized"" they portrayed the American intervention in the Vietnam War and 2)the fact that it won Best Picture in '78. (Seriously Academy, what the fuck?)

"THE DEER HUNTER (1978)
""A trio of Pennsylvania steelworkers have their lives changed forever after serving their country by fighting in Vietnam.""
I've been relistening to a lot of Type O Negative as of late, so I needed something dank and depressing to watch!
Confession: the first time I watched The Deer Hunter, I was simply not a fan. I was in my mid-teens and just found it uninteresting, even downright boring. I didn't bother to take the time to deconstruct and analyze it; yes, if I could go back and kick my own ass, I would. The second time I watched this in my life, which was just earlier today, it was as if I was watching a masterpiece for the first time ever, blinders off. After broiling over it in my head, I have come to a steady conclusion: The Deer Hunter is an amazing piece of cinema; somewhat flawed in some retrospects, but overall a genuinely saddening, powerful experience.
At the end of the day, this isn't simply a movie about the Vietnam War. This isn't Full Metal Jacket (1987) or Apocalypse Now (1979). This is a parable about many things: how in extreme circumstances, pressure will define a man; repression; the brilliant underlying symbolic context from the usage of Russian Roulette and how it reflects upon violence & the war itself; dissolution of friendship; there can even be argued some homosocial bonding thrown in the mix (taken mainly from the various scenes of gratuitous male nudity and some of our central characters being too close). Basically, there's a lot to draw out of the card deck in regards to themes.
Let's settle on the Russian Roulette portion, shall we; it's easily the most recognized memorable aspect. A slight flaw in the way it's depicted consistently being fantasized and exaggerated; ironically, it's also the films most triumphant strength because it brings the cycle of how superfluous the Vietnam War full circle (or full spin, if you will). When Christopher Walken's character Nick breaks out of his AWOL traumatic trance and recognizes Robert De Niro's character Michael the second time they're playing Russian Roulette together in Saigon, it's such a defining moment in the film. Russian-American Nick eventually smiles because he finally remembers Mike, but instead of a happy ending where he quits the match and goes home with his best friend, he still raises the cocked gun to his temple, fires the shot, and kills himself. Do I have to even explain why this is such an incredibly potent message? Upsetting and even provocative, but mighty in delivering a statement.
Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken are the strongholds of the cast. The chemistry in their friendship is heartfelt and it's what amplifies the pulling of the heartstrings by that climactic act I just mentioned earlier. I think Meryl Streep did an excellent job too. You think she's going to drive a wedge between Mike and Nick being Nick's fiancée, with Mike having conflicted feelings for her; but this isn't the case. She's actually utilized more as a bridge (and no pervs, I don't mean in a sexual way).
Admittingly, the pace for the first hour is a bit slower than the remainder of this three-hour epic; it delves into the lives of these steelworking friends in a small Pennsylvanian town, doing what you'd expect blue-collar townies would do in 1967: drinking beer, getting drunk, streaking, playing pranks, spewing vulgarities of every variety- the mood is established to make you settle in to this environment. But after two drops of red-wine spill on a wedding dress during a marriage ceremony signifying bad luck, after we hear the haunting melody of Chopin's ""Nocturne No. 6 Op. 15-3"" being played on a bar piano, we unexpectedly get shifted to the horrors of war. In a thrilling display of disbelief and tension, we witness Mike use a flamethrower on a ruthless bloodthirsty NVA soldier. The mood has now dramatically been re-established with gorgeous cinematography to boot.
The Deer Hunter can be interpreted in many ways, but I highly recommend if you haven't watched it (and even if you read this spoiler-filled review) to watch it for yourself, draw your own conclusions. Now, on a final note: Peter Steele was a godsend for the music industry and all seven Type O Negative albums are glorious!",4.5

Wow...I haven’t loved a movie this much in a long time, I was really blown away. The Deer Hunter is 1978’s best picture winner, and it stars Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, and Maryl Streep. During this 3 hour epic film, we see a group of friends and their times before, during, and after the Vietnam War. The first hour shows the group before the Vietnam War, and there is a 40 minute wedding sequence where we get to know all these characters with such little dialogue, it was pretty amazing and I really felt like I was there with them. Once we establish the characters, they go to Vietnam and wow it’s horrifying. The war sequences are brutal, for those of you who have scene the movie I think you know the scene I’m taking about in particular. I was literally shaking and on the edge of my seat, once again it made me feel like I was there. The final hour is about how the war can fuck up someone who was perfectly fine before, and once again it is pretty hard to watch, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off the screen since the characters are so interesting and the acting makes it seem so real. The final “standoff”, as well as when they go deer hunting at the end have easily already gone down as some of my favorite scenes in movie history, holy shit it was just fantastic. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, but oh my god Christopher Walken might have been even better especially during the end. Overall, The Deer Hunter is easily one of my favorite movies of all time, due to its suspense, great acting, how epic it was, and it’s storytelling, and getting to see it in the theater was amazing. It’s Best Picture win was well deserved, everyone should watch this if they haven’t already.

I am conflicted to be honest. On one hand this film has some amazing performances and some very strong scenes. On the other it can also be very slow. I was expecting the film to be more about the Vietnam War when in reality scenes in Vietnam only take up a fraction of the runtime. Unfortunately, the best scenes are exclusive to Vietnam. A lot of the scenes (particularly the wedding and Robert De Niro’s initial return to the US) seem to drag on forever. However, the strong moments in this film are truly exceptional; Particularly the Russian Roulette scenes and the ending scene.

"As much as Mr. Cimino is hellbent on the first set piece testing and prodding the audience to the point of exhaustion, this remains a testament to the falseness of America's many promises and innuendos to the young people who feel obliged to their country so much so as to give their time, bodies, and sanity to fighting their political grudges out in the shit. De Niro, Walken, and Streep are legendary in this. And I haven't liked anything Streep has done in going on twenty years.
Some critics will have you thinking that Cimino really didn't deserve to win what he did for making this film, as his ultimate fall from grace clearly displayed how excessive and idiotic he was, clearly.

"I've lost count of the number of arguments I've had with so-called 'friends' about the best Vietnam film, as this is hands down simply sublime and the only winner of that argument for me.
Less a film about war as it is a film about the effects of war both on individuals and a community, it's got a cast to die for who all bring their A game and some. Do we need a hour at the wedding at the beginning? Of course we don't - but it adds so much to the characters (I'd never noticed Walken offering odds on the pool shots before, foreshadowing his characters descent) and the community.
In fact, I'd argue that this beginning allows room throughout the rest of the film - witness De Niro sit in silence in his motel room on his return. It's completely wordless (and heartbreaking to watch), but we already know so much about how and why he's feeling like this because of that time spent at the beginning, seeing how he relates to those around him and understanding now why he can never ever go back to that world.
If I'm going to split hairs, it's the marginalising of Nick and Steven after the war in favour of more time spent with De Niro's Michael that is potentially a mis-step, however again on this viewing, I would argue that that's because it's the most 'real' of the situations the guys found themselves in. Whilst Nick and Steven had their own crosses to bear due to severe mental or physical disability, Michael had none of these and unusually, he had a whole community to support him on his return......making his alienation, which was just as real and just as painful as the others, even more heartbreaking.
It's a stunning 3 hours, wonderfully played, with so much context and subtext (I can't even think about John Cazale in this, with him and everyone knowing he was dying throughout filming.........), that it adds up to an utter classic that on this viewing has got even better. A masterpiece (and I don't use a word like that often).",5.0

"Y'a des choses qu'on prend pour acquis dans la vie. Aujourd'hui, j'ai écouté The Deer Hunter pour la première fois, et je me suis rendu compte pour la première fois, pour vrai, du talent gigantesque de Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep et Christopher Walken. Les trois sont devenus des personnages plus grands que nature, des icônes, presque des caricatures d'eux-mêmes. Les revoir dans The Deer Hunter, avant la consécration, dans des rôles de gens ""normaux"", ça fait quand même un choc. D'autant plus que Cimino construit son film en empilant les non-scènes, en évitant les grands speeches dramatiques et les débordements d'émotion, en nous montrant le small talk de ses personnages et la transition entre leur image publique et privée, ce qui les révèle bien plus que n'importe quel monologue grandiloquent. La scène dans laquelle De Niro revoit Streep pour la première fois depuis son retour est un mini-chef-d'oeuvre de dialogue banal, de gestes manqués, d'émotions qu'on tente désespérément de garder à l'intérieur. On se souvient souvent plus de ce film pour les scènes de roulette russe, mais ce qui va me rester en tête, c'est le chaos organisé des premières 90 minutes, pendant lesquelles tout le monde boit, crie, tombe, rie, pleure, comme si Altman avait pris plus de coke que d'habitude, avait oublié ses scénarios à la maison et avait décidé de tourner jusqu'à ce que quelqu'un lui dise d'arrêter. À travers mes années de cinéphile, j'ai souvent été déçu des ""chef-d'oeuvres classiques"" américains des années 70 (Coppola me laisse bien froid, Friedkin est trop brouillon, Scorcese extrêmement inégal), mais là, je pense que je viens de tomber sur mon X. J'ai failli enlever une demi-étoile pour le ""God Bless America"" de la fin, un peu trop gros, mais The Deer Hunter est juste un film beaucoup trop immense pour être réellement gâché. Sa valeur ne peut pas se calculer en étoiles anyway.",5.0
"I was a tender and naive 19 years old when I first saw this movie in the theatre.  It blew me away.  And along with Apocalypse Now, jolted me into awareness of the devestation and futility of the Vietnam war in particular and war in general.
It was also my introduction to two significant actors: Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep (this was her first film).
I remember very little about the movie from seeing it the first time, with one exception.  I preserved a vivid recollection of the stark contrast between the carefree life of a group of friends in America before going to war and the life altering traumatic impact on these friends from being in the war.  
It was fascinating to observe two friends with identical experiences in the war impacted in such opposite ways. For one, a renewed value for all life was gained; for the other, life was cheapened and robbed of all its value.
Almost 40 years later, this film  has preserved itself very well.",4.0

"A great piece of filmmaking with a superb cast. It's hard to imagine five or six American actors today who could compete with the ensemble of DeNiro, Streep, Walken, Cazale, Savage, and even the unsung George Dzundza. Under Michael Cimino's direction, they craft a gripping realism that really draws you into the lives of the characters. The film is lengthier than it needs to be, however. I don't think I needed to attend Steve's wedding in real time just to understand that these guys are good friends. After a while you find yourself begging for the war to begin.
If you're looking for a film that quintessentially captures the experience of the Vietnam War, this is not it. Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, or Coming Home would be better contenders for that title. Here too much of the wartime plot centers around Russian roulette, which I highly doubt was a universal experience among combat veterans. The Deer Hunter is more of a human drama of friendship, honor, and love that just happens to take place during wartime, more akin to something like Doctor Zhivago. The story has its flaws, particularly in its third act, but still it's so compelling you can't take your eyes off the screen.",4.5

The development drew me in completely I was in it the entire way 100,000,000% invested, it made everything about the movie 10x more impactful and real.
The deer hunter is an important work of art that represents the impact of the war on a group of a young closely knitted men that are more brothers than friends it conveys the psychological and physical and traumatic aspects of war in 3 different ways:
1: disconnection and distanced/unfamiliarity of the past life
2: what damages it can have on a person's body and how not all PTSD comes in the forms of psychological distress but can have the exact same effect if not worse
3: complete loss of oneself trying to rid the thought of killing from one's mind by torturing himself or in this films case putting himself up for auctions to be used to do something like a soldier is used to go to war and to fight for their country  (sort of like the soul has disconnected from the vessel)
Each one is as destructive as the other despite each progressively sounding worse, this movie does it in such a way that it WILL touch, hypnotise and reminisce in your mind forever.. The movie somewhat gives you PTSD with how beautifully its filmed, performed and shown.
(HERE I GO INTO SPOILERS SO DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE)
(I will have a marker for an end point of spoilers so if you wanna read on scroll down super fast )


The title of the movie really seems like nothing much but it reflects the 3 points of PTSD that are shown in the movie.
And Nick becomes the deer that is hunted by Mike not to be killed but to be found to bring back home with everyone and drink or be comforted whilst the memories of war will go away (we all know its not that easy if we've been to war or not)
when he finds the deer (nick) because nick has gotten to such a point of remorse and loss of his self and repulsed by killing something other than him (his past by disconnecting and forgetting it) and the fact the only thing he remembers now truly is the brutal scenario he and his friends found themselves in together with the Russian roulette so he resorted to that. as well as what could be dissociative amnesia or the fact he views everyone as an enemy including himself now because everybody is dark cold and horrific to him now he tries and gambles his life with 0 hesitation and when he finally remembers their conversation about it taking only one shot to kill a deer nick repeats one shot smiles and shoots himself like he's the deer.. Not a care in the world just some animal with a dark past.. A piece of meat.. To nick his own life was as good as a deers life was to Mike.
At that moment nick remembered part of his past whilst also realising how easy he could make it all go away, he was already dead inside but when he realised the only way he thought he could get rid of his past he shot himself as an escape.. if you wanna take any sort of hope and happiness from that scene Nick died with the last living memory being of and about his friend. His brother.

"Amazing film and riveting experience. Some of the best and most intense moments I’ve ever seen: crafted and executed perfectly. Immense performances all round, especially Christopher Walken and of course de Niro. 
Only fault I have with it is the pacing; it dragged a tiny bit for me (the wedding especially) , although I still really enjoyed the start of it and the dynamic between the main characters. This film was amazing at portraying the effect of vietnam on the characters- showed with how much of a contrast there is between them from the first and last act.

"Ten a bien recibir de mi parte un abrazo de amigo. Cuando estalle la guerra estaré en la trinchera contigo.
El cazador de ciervos, traducido a medias en España como El cazador, es una película que se elevó con cinco Óscars en 1978, entre ellos, el de Christopher Walken como mejor actor de reparto. Narrada en tres episodios bastante distinguidos, el difunto Michael Cimino nos canta una canción antibelicista utilizando una férrea amistad entre tres jóvenes que deciden alistarse a la guerra de Vietnam ajenos a lo que ello supondrá tanto para sus vidas como para la de sus familiares.
Perteneciente a la denominada corriente del New Hollywood (junto con Francis Ford Coppola o Martin Scorsese, por ejemplo) Cimino retrató una parte tan cruenta como pesimista de la historia norteamericana, historia aposentada como toda grande civilización en la guerra. Alejándose del cine bélico cuyos personajes son fuertes héroes que batallan contra los malos y regresan victoriosos, el director se centra en un carácter más humano, más realista y más turbio enfocándose en personas normales que experimentan el horror de una guerra tan insensible como la de Vietnam en pequeños altercados que no buscan espectacularidad ni sobresaltar al espectador con apabullantes secuencias de acción, sino con pequeñas muestras de violencia que poco a poco irán quebrando las personalidades de nuestros protagonistas mientras intenta prevalecer un sentimiento más poderoso que el odio: la amistad.
Siendo una producción tan alejada de los cánones bélicos, es difícilmente clasificable como tal, aunque tampoco sería correcto ponerla como drama familiar (en este caso comunitario, del pequeño pueblo de Pensilvania, ortodoxo y de raíces rusas) o un atormentado romance. Es, más bien, un coming-in-age que sigue la evolución de una amistad y de los tres componentes principales de esta: Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) y Steven (John Savage). Basándose en el marco de la guerra de Vietnam, se sigue la pista del cabecilla, Michael, en tres episodios que metafóricamente significan la evolución personal de una persona en tres etapas: antes de la guerra, plagada de chanza y juerga, como la juventud, el período durante la guerra, como descubrimiento personal y, quizás, ruptura de la personalidad, representante de la madurez y, finalmente, la vejez indicada por las vidas seguidas tras la guerra.
Aunque tenga una duración extenuante (183 minutos) y un ritmo lento, se pasa en un respiro por el descomunal despliegue de medios, un guión muy adecuado y un mensaje pacifista puramente bello. Todos los personajes poseen una personalidad única, no resultando ninguno plano, usados para reforzar la construcción de los personajes principales y poder conocerlos más como personas. El tema principal es el sentimiento de fraternidad manejado en primer plano por el personaje de Robert De Niro, personaje tan humano que desde una primera instancia empatizamos con él por una construcción verídica, con sus aciertos y desaciertos, sus buenas y malas decisiones, con las que nos involucramos automáticamente siguiendo las idas y venidas que atañen su mente.
Con un guión laborioso y correctísimo de Deric Washburn sin el cual la condensación de la historia original habría sido imposible en menos de tres horas, se nos introduce a la historia de una manera muy singular. Comenzando con una secuencia de una fundición donde trabajan nuestro gran grupo de amigos el director ya nos pone en situación de lo que es y lo que vendrá. En primer lugar, nos enseña el carácter industrial y obrero del pueblo, en segundo lugar, lo sacrificado y trabajoso del oficio pero aún así la felicidad de sus trabajadores y, en tercer y más importante lugar, mediante un altísimo contraste de oscuridad predominando con colores rojos y negros brillante y fuertes, un augurio de lo que vendrá. Los colores, sinónimos de la llama y la oscuridad, del dolor de la guerra que, con la baja iluminación, refuerza ese ambiente opresivo y de carácter destructivo. La fundición no es otra cosa que una metáfora de Vietnam.
En su primera parte se recrean las borracheras y divertimentos del grupo de amigos pocos días antes de que tres de sus integrantes acudan a la llamada del deber. En este planteamiento, se muestran los personajes y lo más importante, las relaciones interpersonales que mantienen unos lazos de amistad tan fuertes, centrándose en los más relevantes. Aunque sea un período aparentemente feliz, Cimino se empeña en transmitir pesimismo en el espectador influyendo psicológicamente en el mismo con una atmósfera casi decadente incluso durante la boda, siendo el punto de choque la misteriosa aparición del boina verde durante la fiesta nupcial. Fiesta nupcial grabada de una manera absolutamente genial, con un gran control de extras a manos del veterano Buddy Van Horn, con coreografías impresionantes y planos muy armoniosos al servicio de aparentar una falsa calma que se rompe constantemente por el nerviosismo de los personajes. El personaje del secundario de lujo John Cazale (Stanley) es el principal encargado de mantener una atmósfera incómoda, perturbando a los demás personajes a la par que el personaje de George Dzundza (John) equilibra la balanza. Este último tiene una importancia inexorable, ya que muy livianamente marca los ritmos de la primera y la tercera parte casi pasando desapercibido, muestra de ello es la secuencia en la que toca el piano en la primera parte o comienza a cantar God Bless America en la tercera parte. Este planteamiento es una clase maestra por parte de Michael Cimino.
El siguiente arco, el nudo, Vietnam, el quid de la cuestión y la parte más recordada. Jamás había visto en una película bélica retratar los horrores de una manera tan cotidiana. Es decir, lo que sufre nuestro trío protagonista se expone mediante episodios aislados e irrelevantes para el conjunto de la guerra, con una crudeza impactante (inolvidable la escena de la ruleta rusa) donde se indaga en las personalidades llevadas al extremo, las decisiones y la inhumanidad de ambos lados y, aunque suene cursi, el poder de la amistad. Estas vivencias para los personajes son un impacto súbito en sus formas de ver la vida, distintas para cada uno y escenificadas en tres pequeños capítulos individuales que siguen la pista individual de cada uno por Saigón, centro neurálgico de EE.UU. en Vietnam. Esto, para nosotros, supone un jarro de agua fría que se estanca en la incertidumbre e interés sobre el devenir de Michael, Nick y Steven. Con los pasos de ellos, nos adentramos en los daños colaterales de un conflicto que ha afectado a una gran cantidad de inocentes, incluidos ellos mismos, mártires engañados, reforzando el mensaje de paz que Cimino consigue transmitir de manera tan dura como poética.
La tercera es, sin duda, la baza más potente de cualquier cineasta para dar un mensaje como este: las consecuencias gráficas de la guerra. Cimino huye de centrarse en los 'héroes' que vuelven a casa para pasar a las relaciones que mantienen con otros bajo su nueva capa de personalidad. Meryl Streep como Linda o Rutanya Alda como Angela son los complementos vitales para los que vuelven, para reproducir el daño hecho por los protagonistas tras su marcha. Son los personajes femeninos los que ponen el compás final a una desdichada epopeya donde el sufrimiento es compartido injustamente. Los personajes masculinos, como John, Stanley o Axel (Chuck Aspegren) pierden gran parte de la potencia que tenían en el primer arco, quizás debido a una mala masculinidad que retrae los sentimientos y no permite el avance en las relaciones. Por ello, el personaje de Dzundza vuelve a brillar al romper eso, rompiendo a llorar para dar paso a ese esperanzador, pero con el tono amargo de la derrota figurada, himno americano. Cierra con el tema principal de la amistad a través de los personajes de De Niro y de Walken en un duelo escénico inolvidable que se codea con los más atroces traumas de la guerra; una personalidad destruida y una mente distorsionada. La fuerza que tiene esa última ruleta rusa arrolla al espectador, en parte, por una perfecta armonía de barbarie y cotidianidad, mostrada mediante una gran cantidad de extras perfectamente colocados en plano que evocan el terror de la guerra mediante una expectación alegre de un juego mortal. Este sentimiento llega a su grado máximo de insanidad gracias al árbitro chino (Po Pao Pee).
El empleo de la fotografía de Vilmos Zsigmond es apabullante y, curiosamente, en las partes exentas de guerra donde la genialidad alcanza sus cotas máximas en las escenas de caza mostrando los preciosos paisajes boscosos de las montañas de Pensilvania. Cimino las aprovecha de forma sabia para indagar en la psique del personaje de De Niro, antes y después de la guerra, utilizando grandes panorámicas valiéndose de elementos del escenario para retratar los sentimientos. Sentimientos agigantados por una banda sonora conmovedora de manos de Stanley Myers, y un John Williams inolvidable haciendo las delicias componiendo el tema principal. El simbolismo a través de la figura del ciervo es el resumen más representativo de la evolución de Michael, usando la simbología nativa americana (patente desde el primer arco, citada por Robert De Niro) hace presencia del renacer. Lo nuevo en lo que se ha convertido el protagonista. Una maravilla.
Solo un Robert De Niro en plena forma podría haberse hecho cargo con tanta maestría de un personaje tan complejo como Michael que, lejos de necesitar apoyo de personajes secundarios, se convierte en un auxilio recíproco en pos de hacer un dibujo completo de todos. Christopher Walken está inmenso también, con una evolución antónima a la de su compañero, sabe controlar todos los registros necesarios para golpear al espectador con un testarazo seco con poca potencia ejemplar del cascarón vacío en el que termina convirtiéndose, como un tambor de revólver con una única bala, con un disparo. Mery Streep, sin embargo, me vuelve a decepcionar con una interpretación plana que no transmite mucho más allá que deseo sexual (equívocamente en cuanto a los deseos de Cimino). Por suerte, un año después compensaría con Kramer vs. Kramer (Robert Benton, 1979).
Siendo sincero, es una película bastante especial que se fundamenta en un género, pero no llega a serlo, con un mensaje bonito y alejado de los clásicos bélicos brindados por Hollywood en las décadas anteriores. Supone un problema si no se conecta con la historia y los personajes pero, si se hace, se va a experimentar un viaje emocional guiado por una amistad preciosa a través de los escondrijos más siniestros de una guerra donde no hay ganadores ni perdedores, solo destrucción y víctimas.",4.0

"It hurts to see a movie try so hard only to come up short. The Deer Hunter has some issues, but effort definitely isn't one of them.
I would even say its biggest problem is trying too hard - they try way too hard to make the characters likable in the beginning, giving us generic likable blue-collar dudes and expecting the audience to care about them by spending an overwhelming amount of time tagging along with them instead of actually crafting meaningful character relationships. And then there's the little fact that this movie is three whole hours long (at least 30 minutes of that could have been trimmed). And for all their efforts, they couldn't bother to give Meryl Streep an actual character to play?
The instance where their hard work pays off is the INSANE first Vietnam scene. That whole Vietnam segment in the middle (and the segue into it) is stunning, to say the least. Performances are phenomenal, cinematography (specifically: locations) is insane, and the writing is quite good - it's three hours, but it hardly ever drags despite some fluff. This is a very solid, if bloated and flawed, examination of the horrifying effects 'Nam had on soldiers' psyches.
I also took off a half-star for the ending. C'mon, guys. You're better than that.

"Watched this film today, the first time in over 30 years and I came to pretty much the same conclusion as all those years ago. It's ok, but it's nothing special and don't believe for a second it's the 'powerful' masterpiece a lot of people claim it to be. Deer Hunter, sadly didn't reach one on the ricter scale.
In fact and at the risk of upsetting fans of the film, I'd go as far to say I found it all a little pretentious. The script, the actors, the direction all seemed to be trying a little too hard to be tightly knit and bonded working class.
And whatever anybody says the wedding scene is too long and it's nowhere near as entertaining as the wedding scene from The Godfather. Watch and learn Michael Cimino, watch and learn.
That's my first criticism. My main gripe is the way the opinion makers view American films that star actors like De Niro, Streep and Pacino. Whenever these actors make a new film people it's frequently the same old diatribe, brilliant performances all round, best acting ever.
I don't quite subscribe to this school of thought. Yes they are decent but they are far from being in a league of their own and in Deer Hunter De Niro put in an adequate performance, nothing special. Am I alone in thinking his range can be somewhat limited.
And as much as I love Walken I can't for the life of me see what he did to earn an Oscar for best supporting actor. Yes he demonstrated real emotion on a coupe of occasions but an Oscar? Really!
Mel Gibson in Gallipoli, I’m not ashamed to say moved me to tears. Although to be fair he had me reaching for the sick bucket in We Were Soldiers.
I sincerely believe people would think differently about American films if they took the time to watch films made outside of America. As the saying goes 'you really should get out more'.
To see the horrors and the brutality of war, the destruction of community look no further than Russian classic Come and See. Shows up Deer Hunter for the overrated drama that it is.
Oh! and as for THAT final scene, I'm hoping it was supposed to be ironic! Whatever it was all about I'm glad I had the sick bucket handy - CHUNDER!!!",2.0
"I hate to be that guy, but “The Deer Hunter” is too long and it hits the same notes too many times. This is a powerful film, but in certain aspects I feel that it is a one-trick pony.
War impacts everyone, including those far away from warzones. “The Deer Hunter” does a tremendous job of establishing a normalcy to smash. The viewer sits through a very naturalistic wedding, which fits into the larger context of everyday life in a steel mill town somewhere in western Pennsylvania or northeast Ohio. A group of friends work the mill, dress for the wedding, get sloshed, and ponder what their military service will soon entail. Three of the friends have volunteered for service in Vietnam. Hard cut to a warzone in Vietnam. The rural mountains and small town sensibilities of the US are replaced by the realities of war: civilian casualties, life as a POW, and torture. The experience leaves the friends scarred both physically and mentally. None of them will ever return home entirely. From now on, those men and their loved ones will be fighting a secret war to claim back their sound mind.
One man is physically disabled and he’s obsessed about “fitting in” and “not belonging” because of his physical state. His wife slides into a deep, dark depression. One man returns home and is reluctant to engage with large crowds, he hesitates to accept acknowledgement, and he begins to reject violence—even in the form of deer hunting, a sport that he always loved. And one man never physically returns home at all, opting to surround himself with death and pain, because it’s the only thing he really knows now.
I’m not sure how controversial this will be to say, but I almost feel like my own viewing of “The Deer Hunter” would have improved if the entire second act in Vietnam was cut out. All the best stuff in this film involves the domestic drama that occurs in America, and the focus of the film is on how soldiers, their parents, their lovers, and their friends deal with the trauma of loss and grief. This isn’t a Vietnam War movie about war and combat, it’s a movie about personal loss on the home front and psychological trauma. It’s a story about tragedy and grief in the wake of an unsuccessful war.
And I know this movie is famous for the whole Russian roulette thing, but for the life of me I don’t understand why Cimino returns to it again and again. Ok, I’ll buy it as a form of torture to be used upon POWs for the sake of dramatic purpose. But it’s also a popular underground blood sport in Saigon and apparently all of South Vietnam? What? The Vietcong are just that nuts I guess? It just seems so far removed from the naturalism of the rest of the film, which I guess might be the point. I don’t know, there are certain scenes here that just seem to last forever.
Also, that’s not how you hunt deer. You don’t chase down a deer and shoot them from like 25 feet away. You sit in a stand all morning or you create a blind in a spot that you’ve observed or that you’ve previously used to track deer. And if you are actively tracking, you maintain distance.
Also I thought it was funny that these guys are a short drive away from the Rocky Mountains in the Rust Belt. We don’t have snowcapped mountains in Appalachia that look quite like that…",3.0

"really a poetic take on war, but the first half just brings it down.
I don't think it's bad by any means, just the everything up to the RR scene is just a slow burner. I get that it's setting up the characters for you but I wish it was a little shorter or a little different. it's the reason I give this only 4½ stars, which isnt bad but that's just what's keeping it from 5. Maybe on the rewatch I'll appreciate it more and bump up the rating but these are my initial thoughts.
on the other hand the RR scene and onward is phenomenal, I love the performances and the tone shift from that point in the movie and I really liked the movie overall. This will be a movie that I'll probably change my opinion on when I revisit it, but for now that's my opinion.",4.5
"A war epic that’s more about home, and how the concept of home can be irreparably altered by trauma, than the war itself. It (in)famously spends an inordinate amount of time introducing our characters and the small blue-collar Pennsylvania town where they live, but that *is* the movie. We can’t get a sense for what these men will lose without really showing what it is they’re losing. Besides, it’s Cimino expresses a Coppola-esque knack for directing crowd scenes (but with the half-heard naturalism of Altman) which make things like the epically long Orthodox wedding setpiece a total joy to watch. It’s all laden with symbols too, all setting up the rituals and myths and superstition that will fail our would-be American heroes during their time in Vietnam. The impossible to miss sense of fate, or doom, pressing down in the first half makes the wildly improbable coincidences throughout the rest of the film go down much easier — it’s a Greek tragedy through the lens of working class America. Similarly, it all makes the historically inaccurate depiction of the Russian roulette barbarism that dominates the Vietnam section very effective. It’s a necessarily freaky, weird, hallucinatory touch that really sells the trauma and themes of fate and luck (or lack thereof). 
And of course the whole thing is just stunningly beautiful. Vilmos Zsigmond had a long carrier of turning out stunning imagery, but this might just be his opus. Stoic religious chants can elevate even mediocre imagery, but the scenes of De Niro stalking the deer amidst the cloudy heights of the mountain range are truly transcendent.",4.5

"The Deer Hunter raconte l’épopée de 3 amies et leurs bandes qui vivent une vie paisible en Pennsylvanie qui vont partir pour la guerre du Vietnam 
Mais ce n’est pas un film de guerre classique y’a même très peu de scène de guerre ( peut être 30min 45min max sur 3h de film) cependant le film excelle pour nous montrer toute les conséquences et l’horreur de la guerre, que ce sois l’aspect psychologique ou physique
La photographie du film est exceptionnelle presque tout les plans sont à couper le souffle 
Et que dire du casting De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Christopher Walken…
Je dois vraiment souligner les perfs incroyable de Meryl Streep, De Niro mais surtout Christopher Walken qui joue le personnage le plus important à mon sens et le plus complexe 
Cimino a choisis d’être à l’opposée du rêve american en se centrant sur des personnages appartenant à une petite communauté ( des slaves je crois) de la classe ouvrières, on est en pleine immersion dans leur quotidien avec beaucoup de figurants notamment la scène du mariage qui est superbe, le contraste de la vie avant/après guerre est saisissant 
La scène de la roulette russe est au PANTHÉON des plus grandes scènes de l’histoire du cinéma sans aucun contestation

"I’ve had this on DVD since like 2018—some guy in Goleta was giving away his collection at like .50 cents a pop for rent money and I indulged him even though it was mostly stuff I didn’t care about. I got this and Se7en and Platoon and Rumble Fish for like a buck fifty and never watched any of them. Power of expectations I suppose—I moved home at the beginning of the pandemic and asked my dad over and over again if he’d watch this with me—he said it was WAY too fucked up (like…this won Best Picture dude it’s not Lars von Trier or whatever). First hour and a half I’m like…what gives? Breaking Away working class bro-fest meets Fandango style bros living it up before the draft—literally my dads two favorite movies (besides Caine Mutiny Humphrey Bogart plus Sure Thing John Cusack). Then halfway through I realize. Baffling—just so rare to see something relatively sensitively mounted beef it so bad in the back half…becomes so insanely fucking stupid to the point of inanity, such a bizarre tough guy fantasy, the kind of drivel you’d imagine these kind of dudes imagine would happen to them in Vietnam (maybe that’s the point but like…) Still, not exactly a macho fantasy my father would dislike, necessarily, just downbeat in a way that’s at odds with his memory of his time spent in the armed forces, the hunting scenes looking vaguely unlike his time spent in Pennsylvania raising a family (literally filmed in Washington State where he grew up/also raised kids—Pennsylvania is fucking flat bro). If this thing was truly realistic all the guys would look vaguely like Chris Farley like 2/5 of the gang do as opposed to a bunch of famous Italians/New Yorkers and it would be about a bunch of fucking amish people…these are maybe some of the things my dad would have said if we watched together, my dad who loves Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia but hates movies that are “critical” about western involvement in wars overseas, my dad who doesn’t want to be reminded of male self-destruction as his best friends all leave this world before him, leaving him behind, my dad who escapes into cinema like a kid into picture books (or I guess iPad YouTube time), watching Top Gun Maverick over and over again and Bruce Willis RED and all these kinds of banal boomer fantasies that his life never panned out to be.

"""I'm so glad you're alive.""
I'm actually a little bit mad that this was pitched to me as an anti-war film. I'm pretty sure the Vietnam war doesn't take any more than half an hour, especially if you're only counting the scenes that are actually on the battlefield.
This is really a film about everything else - or rather, everything else that matters to men. Some of the popular negative reviews here proclaim the two hours either side of Vietnam to be boring, but I actually found it to be the other way around. I don't like these main characters, but I enjoy watching them fuck around, just Guys being Dudes™, & the fact that this eventually becomes a deconstruction of Guys being Dudes™, using the war as a catalyst to explore what's really going on inside the Men Hivemind only serves to prove to me that this really isn't about the war at all. I'll happily sit & watch these guys hunt deer for 60 minutes, & then watch them have PTSD for another 70 after a brief interlude of pure terror.
The tension throughout most of that second half is impeccably palpable, but the span of time between Michael leaving Vietnam & finding Stephen is agonizingly slow. There's a purpose to every scene, & I probably couldn't cut it down significantly, but it really is just a lot of Bobby De Niro stumbling around going ""I do not have PTSD! I do not!"" while Meryl Streep goes ""I do not understand how to support either you or me through this emotionally turbulent time!"" & that's not dramatic when it's going on for 20 minutes. Maybe 7 would serve it better, & then we could move on to those incredible last 15 minutes all the more fresh-faced for it.",4.0

"The Deer Hunter is s tough watch. Those three hours felt like an eternity due to significant pacing issues and numerous unnecessarily long sequences, such as the wedding scene at the beginning, which lacked the emotional importance it should have had. This movie follows the basic three act structure, with the second part undoubtedly being the strongest. The russian roulette scene is an absolute standout. Insane performances delivered by Christopher Walken and Robert DeNiro. The third part served mostly as a parallel to the beginning, attempting to illustrate what has changed compared to the outset, but executed so boring that I felt very unsatisfied. However there were those amazing and intense scenes again, especially notable for the great acting but also the camera work and the editing. Some great music in this movie too.",3.0
"For a while, I was expecting the whole film to be as dark depressing as I've heard, and then the Russian Roulette scene arrives...and a few more sequences of so appear. I think it's a horrid game, and the scenes made me uncomfortable, mainly for the reasons the film wanted me to feel from its tension and darkness. Still though, really dark stuff, and I never want to play it. Anyways, sorry for the grim opening, but I'll try to be a little lighter for the remainder of my review...
I don't know if it needed to be three hours, and I can understand why some would think such sequences as the wedding should've been trimmed. For me, with only a few times I felt the length, I wasn't bothered by it, and I think the director's approach was to be with the characters' emotions during their time, as the film's scenes are rather extended moments linked together as a chain. What seemed to be a happy wedding and getting together for a hunting trip turns around after the seventy-minute mark with the Vietnam War and the lead's aftermath. Instead of being a simple linear plot, the film's more interested in its main leads and their thoughts of what they went and are going through. The actors, I thought, added additional material from the screenplay through their smart expressions, and never once were the performances just okay; all were from good to great, including Christopher Walken giving one of his best in his career as a changed man. I also like the cinematography not trying to be epic in scope but being personal, like how it portrays a small town or its surroundings; it doesn't get enough credit for it. For as uncomfortable it gets, I think it's a well-done drama through risky decisions as there's more underneath the surface, and I lean more on the positive side. A major recommendation, although be prepared for some of its scenes.",4.0

"Honestly, lost me with the Russian Roulette shit! Like I thought the belaboured start was pretty great, setting us up for some real horrors of war shit, and then they just... Made up a particular horror of war that never happened? Idk, I worry this is a real CinemaSins-ass criticism, but it seems so contrived and over the top and demonising that I had to look up whether this kind of thing happened, and of course it didn't. Like there was plenty of other horrible shit in that war! And then when that became the central motif for the whole film (after a few excellent scenes back in Pennsylvania) I just felt so out of the whole damn thing. Walken and Streep were great.
Now reading a bit on Wikipedia about the critical reaction at the time, like, I don't buy Ebert's suggestion that it works just fine as a symbol of war regardless of it's historical reality, because whenever it comes up, in the jungle or in Saigon, it's just madly cackling, sadist Vietnamese folks reveling in the violence and torture of it all. To say it's just a metaphor of the horror and brutality of the war, and then depict all that brutality perpetrating by the Vietnamese (and one random French guy), is not a neutral statement about war as such. Seems like my girl Pauline Kael was more on the money.
Anyway, could have been a great film if they cut out the middle half and rearranged some stuff, probably, idk.",1.5
"Classic auteurist grandstanding and a layered, self-contradictory work of conservative mythic deconstruction/revisionism. At its heart, Cimino’s novelistic male weepie is a masterfully orchestrated cinematic opera of powerful, visceral effects transmitting some severely ill-judged notions of national victimhood and self-pitying machismo. Everything centers around three protracted rites-of-passage that culminate in a fractured psychic panorama of working-class America: 1) an hour-long Russian Orthodox wedding that gives Cimino license to outdo The Leopard via The Godfather; 2) the “Russian Roulette” sequence, a deliberately (and jejunely) symbolic microcosm that exonerates American aggression through the spectacle of dehumanization perpetrated by the Othered VC; and 3) the climactic funeral/group paean that, whether you read it as sincere (like Cimino) or ironic (like everyone else), gradually deflates into mawkish kitsch. There is a difference between disapproving of a movie on a purely ideological basis (hardly constructive, if you ask me) and pinpointing a case of dramaturgical hypocrisy; my position is predicated entirely on the latter. J. Hoberman framed this as ""a masterpiece of neurotic projection,"" succinctly identifying its crippling tendency to self-cancel the overriding project (deconstructing hallowed American myths — of the working class, of American Exceptionalism, of masculine ritual, of the glory of war — through myth-making) through a host of internal contradictions expressed by way of form, drama, and representation.
And yet, this is a consummate model of film craftsmanship. Zsigmond's lush, tactile photography of Rust Belt America married with Cimino's persnickety, lived-in portraiture of Pennsyltucky life persuasively conjures an authentic pictorialism whose heightened nature hardly belies its capacity to engross. De Niro, Cazale, Walken, and company sell the troubled macho beats with an earnestness that translates to conviction for the teenage-boy outlook on masculinity, and the homosocial bonding within the repressed milieu subliminally proposes an intersection between hypermasculinity and homoeroticism. Scenes gracefully flow into each other while momentous junctures linger like vivid impressions of a mostly forgotten memory, and the amorphously structured drama never registers as inchoate so long as it strictly focuses on primary elements like character, relationships, and human themes.
I despised this as a 14-year-old snot and, hopefully, am no longer prone to faux-elitist posturing or forced contrarianism. It may still be suffocatingly self-important, a miasmatic stew of unreconciled metaphysics and ostentatious display, but there is clearly something here, something worth reckoning with. That does not mean I like it — nor that I think it is ""good"" (or ""bad"") — but that in its own way, it's certainly essential.",0.0

“One shot is what it’s all about”
A haunting tale of post-war life. The brilliance of this is the movie starts off with a group of these guys who are just bros. A charismatic and tight knit group of friends who are just bros being bros. But where the events of the film take all of the characters in the end is where you really get to see how war impacts people differently, maybe it’s some specific high that you can’t get any other way (insert iconic scene here), or maybe it’s losing a limb, or just feeling like you’re lost in life, every way these characters are impacted is riveting. We see a wide range of how these characters deal with different outcomes of the war, its relatable because every damn mofo dreams of being a hero and fighting for their country with the boys but this movie paints a raw picture of how that would unfortunately likely pan out. Not too sure I’m on board for the overarching editing choices here (this is a disguised complaint about the wedding sequence being too long), but overall this is a solid watch, and a thematically rich war film with one of De Niro’s best performances.

"graphically depicts war as a traumatizing, dehumanizing, and horrifying experience for American soldiers while portraying the Vietcong as thriving sadists, nothing more than perpetrators of this experience.
we are to interpret the two minutes of screentime allocated for American terror as an antidote to imperialist justification -- but in a three-hour run time, this amounts to a few helicopters blowing up a few straw houses -- oh wait, sorry... it turns out these were North Vietnamese helicopters! imagine that, any depiction of American brutality and senseless slaughter was absent from this movie! this, of course, is followed up by a twenty-minute scene in which the Vietcong are portrayed inflicting the absolute worst, inhuman and meaningless violence upon a few American soldiers. a rather centrist approach to this conflict that is so painfully of its time. as if Cimino was trying to propose war = bad strictly because of the pain and trauma endured by Americans who should not have been there in the first place, with no thought or sympathy for the suffering and independence of the Vietnamese. in other words, war is bad because it takes American lives. this isn't to invalidate the fact that the Vietcong inflicted some truly horrific acts of violence upon the Americans and South Vietnamese, but to not contextualize the causation of such acts is to portray the Vietcong as subhuman, unworthy of a cause, and therefore justifying Western imperialism and white supremacy. i mean, the title quite literally suggests De Niro's character hunting animals! is that not alarming?",1.5
The ending :((,4.5
"""The Deer Hunter é, simultaneamente, um dos mais fascinantes filmes sobre a guerra do Vietname e sobre o impacto dessa guerra na América profunda. É também, e apesar do evidente e sentido desencanto, uma reafirmação da ideia de comunidade e do seu sentido mais nobre, na linha do que o cinema americano clássico fez nos seus melhores dias. A afirmação não será pacífica (ou, pelo menos, já foi menos): ilustres críticos e analistas um pouco por todo o lado, e também em Portugal, correram o filme a pontapé. E nem vale a pena estar a fugir com o que toda a gente sabe à seringa: grande parte das reservas que se levantaram ao filme foram de natureza política. Prendem-se com o retrato racista e quase provocador (em função da opinião dominante) dos combatentes norte-vietnamitas, que vemos, no filme, nas mais atrozes práticas. Podia argumentar com o facto dos vietnamitas constituírem um elemento acessório do filme, mas já agora resolva-se o acessório antes de se ir ao essencial.
Como é que os defensores do filme de Cimino descalçaram, ao tempo, esta bota ideológica? Em primeiro lugar, alegando que as qualidades de um filme não se medem pela sua verosimilhança, nem tão pouco pela sua verdade histórica. Retomando uma comparação que não é minha, mas que acompanho, Eisenstein está a milhas da verdade histórica nos seus retratos dos capitalistas em Outubro, sem que, no entanto, a qualidade panfletária da obra a impeça de ascender ao estatuto de ""filme maior"" na história do cinema. Em segundo lugar, a visão que aos espectadores têm dos vietnamitas, corresponde, dizia-se, a uma visão mediatizada: ""Eles existem meramente para objectivar os medos Ocidentais em relação à raça amarela"", escreveu Gilbert Adair, num ensaio intitulado ""Hollywood's Vietnam"". Last but not least, a história, que é por vezes cruel para com ideias feitas e verdades definitivas, demorou pouco a demonstrar que as atrocidades em guerra não são um exclusivo de ninguém e que os vietnamitas não estavam, como povo, isentos da atracção pelo papel de agressor. Cada um tirará destes pontos as ilações que muito bem entender, mas julgo que estas três razões concorrem para desvalorizar, ou pelo menos matizar, a pertinência do argumento “historicista” com que, tantas vezes, se confrontou ou pretendeu “arrumar” The Deer Hunter. E passemos ao essencial.
Lançado no mercado americano um pouco antes de Apocalypse Now (a rodagem do filme de Coppola começou antes, mas foi longa e os problemas de pós-produção atrasaram ainda mais a sua estreia), The Deer Hunter tem uma estrutura narrativa muito mais clássica do que o filme de Coppola, com um protagonista (Michael/De Niro) com estatuto muito próximo do do herói clássico e que Michael Cimino descreve nestes termos:
""Michael tem reticências em relação aos seus amigos, é um chefe natural, mas é sobretudo um homem de princípios, tem uma ética vital bem definida, que aliás exprime quando fala de caça, mencionando o princípio de um só tiro. Michael tem uma afinidade espiritual com o veado.
Nunca se é bom caçador se não nos metemos na pele da presa, se não nos identificamos com o veado. Ele tenta fazer partilhar a sua ética a um dos seus amigos, mas a sua tentativa fracassa. Ele não a pode guardar só para si, mas ao mesmo tempo ninguém a pode também partilhar.""
Não é difícil, julgo, reconhecer nesta conjugação da ética e da solidão dois dos atributos do herói clássico do cinema americano. Como clássicos são também os elementos fundamentais do filme. A acção do filme de Cimino ocorre numa pequena cidade industrial da Pennsylvania e numa comunidade operária de emigrantes russos, dela se destacando um grupo de amigos cujo percurso se cumpre num período temporal anterior e posterior à experiência da guerra no Vietname. A acção é marcada por três elementos simbólicos, o casamento, a caça e a roleta russa. Mas em qualquer um dos três actos do filme, Cimino quer e consegue que prevaleça o mesmo princípio: fazer um filme em que o elemento físico seja primordial, captando personagens em primeiro grau.
A sequência do casamento, cujo centro é a longa cena do baile, com a inscrição e a insistência nas marcas étnicas – e é inescapável estabelecer de passagem um paralelo com a sequência do casamento que abre The Godfather de Coppola – combina, como escreveu Richard Combs no Monthly Film Bulletin, a afirmação do carácter dos personagens com o sentido dramático, que resulta da estranha aparição do ""boina verde"" ou com o simbolismo trágico das gotas de vinho que caem e mancham o branco vestido vestido de noiva de Angela.
Foquemo-nos no sinal que é a irrupção no casamento do boina verde. De Niro tem nos braços Meryl Streep. Dançam esse prodígio de mobilidade horizontal que tem por título Can’t take my eyes off of you. Ela é a namorada de Christopher Walken, o melhor amigo dele. Os corpos de De Niro e Streep enleiam-se, colam-se um bocadinho, nem um fio de ar entre eles, febre a mais. De Niro, que nesse The Deer Hunter, é homem de one shot, um tiro só, oscila entre o ânimo perpassante que o acomete e a lealdade ao amigo. Disfarça, embaraça-se, inclina-se para ela, convida-a para uma cerveja.
“I’ll get you a Rolling Rock, é uma boa cerveja, a melhor que há”, diz De Niro ao vestido rosa de Meryl Streep e, num eflúvio erótico, arrasta-a do salão do casamento para o bar. Streep, com o tímido sorriso de mulher que sabe o que quer, mas se defende de acessos de paixão, De Niro de olhos e cabeça a derramarem-se no colo dela, a Rolling Rock já na mão, e é quando entra o inconvidado boina verde. Sinistro, silencioso e sub-reptício. Traz na farda um prenúncio de Vietname. E De Niro sabe, ao vê-lo, que a Rolling Rock que tem na mão, é a última cerveja antes do inferno.
Segundo Cimino, a longa sequência do casamento está no filme, tão demoradamente, por razões pragmáticas: ""Com efeito é uma ideia pragmática para resolver o problema funcional do desenvolvimento dos personagens. Na maior parte dos filmes contemporâneos, há um ou dois personagens principais; aqui há pelo menos uma meia-dúzia. Para permitir ao público conhecê-los bastante bem, e sem que ele se dê conta, de maneira subtil, era preciso conceder-lhes um mínimo de presença no écran. Não se fica com a ideia consciente de que os personagens são apresentados através do casamento, mas é isso que se passa, de facto. Além do mais, se não se sentisse nada pelos personagens, a experiência bélica não adquiriria ela mesma nenhuma significação real e profunda. A função dessa hora é fazer-nos partilhar a sua vida, antes de nos fazer partilhar o seu pesadelo.""
Na sequência da caça, Cimino estabelece a que foi considerada a metáfora central do filme – o princípio do one shot – que depois é transferido dramaticamente para a mecânica da roleta russa. Para alguns críticos americanos, a roleta russa é, em The Deer Hunter, uma metáfora da atitude da nação americana, que dá tiros em si mesma. Para Cimino, no entanto, mais do que a metáfora do suicídio de uma nação, a roleta russa ""é um meio de dramatizar o elemento do acaso que existe em toda a guerra. Não há mais razão para que morra um homem do que outro. Eu quis comprimir a experiência quotidiana do combate, essa impossibilidade de calcular as hipóteses de sobrevivência... Longe de simbolizar o psiquismo de uma nação inteira, quis resolver o problema de exprimir num mínimo de minutos o horror do combate.""
Mais do que as cenas da roleta russa, há duas caçadas de The Deer Hunter que são cenas da minha vida. Admiro-lhes a filosofia do “One shot! Two shots is pussy” (traduzo, não traduzo? Olha, não traduzo). São cenas simétricas: na primeira De Niro, um só tiro, mata o veado; na segunda renuncia ao seu “one shot” e funde-se com a Natureza.
A simetria e o equilíbrio são centrais em Deer Hunter. Além da simetria e equilíbrio o que lhe chega dos actores, em particular de De Niro, John Cazale (um soberbo contraponto ao “heroísmo” dos seus companheiros, tão cínico e sinistro como John Carradine nos seus melhores papéis) e Meryl Streep (cuja fragilidade é, por sua vez, ética e esteticamente sincera), radica também no contraste entre tempos longos e tempos breves, que relevam de uma estrutura musical, de resto ""comentada"" pela própria utilização da música na banda sonora. Lembro, primeiro, a jubilação física que corresponde à canção que todos cantam no bar de John, antes do casamento de Steven. De Niro e Christopher Walken estão a jogar snooker, enquanto a juke box debita o Can’t take my eyes off of you. De Niro, Walken e os quatro amigos, numa coreografia de jovens machos em noite sabática, jogam, bebem, cantam cada um para seu lado, até que o refrão os junta num coro de i love you baby, and if it’s quite alright, I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night. A amizade e a confiança deles queriam ficar ali, guardadas para sempre. Ficariam se o filme não os tivesse destinado ao Vietname que lhes secará a voz na garganta.
E recordo, por fim, a mais audaciosa cena sentimental do filme, depois do funeral de Walken. O sentimento de uma reconciliação desejada desenha-se nas notas do God Bless America, trauteadas primeiro por John, depois por todos, pela voz emocionada de Streep, pela farda já inútil de De Niro, pelo inteiro grupo que é, se quisermos que seja, a América.
The Deer Hunter é a viagem de uma nação (simbolizada numa pequena comunidade) ao fundo de si mesma, encenada por alguém que tem um sentido da comunidade comparável só ao de John Ford. Com Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter forma o painel definitivo sobre a guerra do Vietname. Incontornável. Até hoje ainda insuperável.""

"You remember the trees?
You remember the mountains? You remember all that? 
De Niro the mountain man = an immediate 5x oscar winner! I really do think this is one of the best performances in his entire career. It’s such a brutal exploration of the psychological effects of returning home from a living hell, and maybe not even returning at all. 
Very well paced honestly given its three hour run. Those landscape shots of the mountain ranges were incredible, but what was also impressive was the intimate proximity the camera could get with De Niro as well in any location of the film regardless of geographic complexities.",4.0

"I was unsure what to watch but I saw that The Deer Hunter was on TV, starring Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza, and directed by Michael Cimino.
Now, I loved this movie after my initial watch of it and I'm pleased that it held up just as well on the second watch. I don't want to call The Deer Hunter underrated because the majority of people who have seen it hold it to a reasonably high standard but it's one the greatest movies of the 1970s, and that's fucking impressive because 1970s is a lot of people take as the best decade in the film history. Robert De Niro was absolutely phenomenal in this movie but let's be real nobody on god's green earth thought he wouldn't be because he's one of, if not the greatest actors of all time. This movie to me is 100% a stable when it comes to the war genre, however, it's also a fantastic phycological drama. The way this movie was crafted will always not be anything short of amazing, from the acting and screenplay to the cinematography and camera-work, this movie nailed it. I do have one medium-sized con about the film which, unfortunately, holds my score back a bit and that is I do not believe that this movie needed to have a runtime of 3 hours and 3 minutes but at the same time I think the film had good enough pacing for viewers not to feel that runtime too much. I find the overall story to be very stylistic and I think the actual storytelling was great. A deeply stunning and impactful piece of 1970s cinema that more people should talk about. My score remains the same so I'm going to give Michael Cimino's 1978 ""The Deet Hunter"" 4.5/5 stars.",4.5

"The Deer Hunter is quite possibly one of the hardest films for me to articulate my feelings towards, it’s runtime and uncomfortable subject matter definitely don’t make it any easier to talk about but they’re not the root cause, it’s all about how it’s delivered. For a war movie, only about a quarter of it actually takes place in a warzone, yet it’s still undoubtedly a war movie, yet it acknowledges that war doesn’t start and end with combat, there’s only one scene where actual combat takes place to add to this thesis. This film is the pieces surrounding a war movie that are usually taken out for brevity, brought to the forefront and expanded upon until it imitates the war epics of the time without resembling them at all.
What the film instead chooses to do with its unconventional structure is to weaponise the tropes of the war genre and give them genuine weight, the film slam cuts from Pennsylvania to Vietnam in the blink of an eye, completely skipping over your expected “descent into madness” character arc. After an hour spent with these characters at home, intimately getting to understand their dynamics, we’re immediately dumped at the culmination of their war trauma, then the film does it again by sending them back home as soon as the Vietnam arc is resolved. This abrupt pacing leaves us to fill in blanks of what caused all this offscreen trauma, all it gives the audience is the aftermath.
What this leads to is one of the most subtle and sensitive portrayals of PTSD, courtesy of one of Robert De Niro's most authentic performances, we only get a full look at him before and after war, there’s a clear dissonance between the two, one that’s entirely conveyed in his mannerisms and interactions rather than awkwardly trying to get us “inside his head”. The film realises you don’t need to show an entire character arc for it to pay off cathartically, all you need is fully realised characterisation and the film will do the rest. And naturally, the final act is one of the most bleak yet cathartic conclusions ever put to film, perfectly capturing that feeling of knowing that a happy ending isn’t on the horizon, but being completely helpless to stop it.",5.0

"Another moving classic I've managed to knock off my watchlist this weekend. A fairly simplistic story about three young men who hunt deer's and want to escape their small town for the larger than life war experience in Vietnam, yet encounter the brutalities of the war that affects them individually in different ways.
Many criticisms of the film seem to be that it has little rewards and a lacklustre plot but I personally think it doesn't need a huge payoff and rewards for the audience for getting through the film. It's a refectory piece on how this war affected a generation of young men - similar to Dead Presidents in a way. De Niro, Walken and Savage's characters were still kids mentally when they decided to enlist for Vietnam, with very little life experience outside of their town, expecting the war to be their learning curve in life, yet before they’d even started they were destroyed in such a brutal manner. Sure this doesn't make for a rewarding watch at times, but it's hard not to appreciate Cimino's grounded perspective of how the war affected a generation of men in America - so I do find it a bit contrived that people are disappointed at the film for its storytelling aspects. The Russian roulette scenes were crazy regardless soooooo I don't know, I certainly found it maximising in rewards.
Am I the only one who thinks that Walken is in the same sort of league as De Niro in regards to career performances and acting ability? Maybe he hasn't dissipated into his roles quite as effectively as De Niro, but there's always an aura about him on screen.",4.5

Türchen 14:
""Das Drama ""The Deer Hunter"" ist doch bloß eines von vielen Kriegsfilmen.""
Das hab ich beim kurzen scrollen durch einige Reviews tatsächlich gelesen und wiederspreche da vehement, denn The Deer Hunter ist ein tief tragisches Drama dass ein paar Freunde zeigt wie sie noch vor dem Krieg eine Art Traum lebten. Sie waren glücklich und hatten sich dabei so vieles versprochen. Etwas zu lang im ersten Akt, doch durch einen extrem harten Schnitt wird der Zuschauer sofort aus diesem Traum gezogen und befindet sich inmitten eines erbitterten Kampf zwischen den Vietcongs und den amerikanischen Soldaten, der Freunde genauer gesagt. Wir sehen wie dann nach einer Gefangennahme der Ami Soldaten perverse und unmenschlich kranke Spiele mit ihnen gespielt werden. Spiele von denen sich keiner erholt.
""The Deer Hunter"" ist ein echter Schlag ins Gesicht von Drama, weil er die Folgen von Kriegstraumatas so schonungslos und offen aufzeigt, sie kein Stück verherrlicht und dabei richtig draufhält sogar im Gewaltgrad. Michael Cimino erschafft Szenen bei denen ich meinen eigenen Herzschlag bis in die Zehenspitzen spürte. Ich saß am Rande des Randes und meine Nerven explodierten regelrecht bei dem geistesgestörten Spannungsbogen den Cimino erschuf. Und in einer ganz bestimmten Szene am Schluss zuckte ich zusammen und war völlig am Boden zerstört vor Schock. Den Rest des Filmes saß ich mit offenem Mund da weil ich es nicht fassen konnte was dieser Film mit mir als auch seinen Charakteren gemacht hat.

"الفيلم ملحمي بموضوعه ومصائر الشخصيات الرئيسية فيه، وممتد لثلاث ساعات، ما يمكن أن يسمح بتتبّع المصائر وتحوّلاتها. وكان شهادة سينمائية مناهضة للحرب الوحشية تلك، وإن ضمن زاوية واهتمامات محدّدة جلبت له الانتقادات من مناهضين للحرب ذاتها.


في الفيلم ما يمكن اعتباره ثلاثة فصول: الأوّل في مدينة عمّالية فقيرة في بنسلفانيا، والثانية في فيتنام، والثالثة في المدينة الأميركية ذاتها إنّما بأحوال مختلفة تماماً جرّتها الحرب إليها من خلال الجنود العائدين وذكرى من لم يعودوا.

في القسم الأول نشاهد مجموعة من الشبان، أصدقاء في الحيّ ورفاق في المصنع، أمريكيين من أصول روسية، يملأ المرح والشغب حياتهم، نراهم يلعبون ويشربون ويرقصون ويصطادون الغزلان، يمضون وقتاً طويلاً في الحانات، يغنّون لفرانك سيناترا، يمازحون بعضهم طوال الوقت، أحدهم سيتزوّج، آخر يعد صديقته بالزواج إن عاد من الحرب، بل يستدرك قائلاً: حين أعود. ندخل في عوالم هؤلاء غير الآبهين بأنّهم ذاهبون قريباً إلى فيتنام، حيث الحرب التي لا فكرة لهم عنها.

في حانة، وأحدهم يعزف على البيانو واحدة من مقطوعات “النيكتورن” لشوبان، أصدقاؤه ينظرون إليه بانفعال تُظهره الدّموع. من صوت البيانو نتحوّل مباشرة إلى أصوات طائرات هليكوبتر وانفجارات، منتقلين إلى الحرب حيث الغابات والنيران والدّمار والحرائق، الرفاق أنفسهم نجدهم في الحرب، منتقلين بالزّمان والمكان بعيداً جداً عن أجواء الحانة ووقتهم الممتع فيها.

هناك، نجدهم أسرى لدى مقاتلين فيتناميين يلعبون القمار بالروليت الروسيّة، وهي تصويب المسدّس على الرّأس وفيه طلقة واحدة، ما يعني أن احتمال النجاة يكون ١/٦. بطريقة ما ينجون، وتنتقل الأحداث في فيتنام إلى القسم الذي تسيطر عليه القوات الأميركية. هناك، يضيع الرفاق عن بعضهم البعض، منهم من يُصاب ومنهم من تختفي أخباره. صائد الغزلان بينهم، وهو الشخصية الرئيسية في الفيلم، مايك (روبيرت دي نيرو) يعود إلى مدينته ويُستقبل كالأبطال، تبدأ الأحداث تدريجياً تتركّز في المدينة نفسها التي لا يعود إليها أحد الأصدقاء، ويعود آخر إنما بذراع واحدة ودون ساقين.

لعبة الروليت هي فكرة أساسية في الفيلم، إذ أنّها المحرّك الذي به تتطوّر الحكاية بشكل متتال، مرّتين: مرّة نرى فيها مايك ونيك (كريستوفر ووكين) مأسورين، يجرّبان هول الحرب الفيتنامية، ومرّة أخيرة وقد صارت الروليت لعبة نيك الاعتيادية التي يربح منها مالاً وفيراً في فيتنام، المرة الأولى هي نقطة انعطاف إلى القسم الثاني من الفيلم، إلى التراجيديا وقد حلّت على شخصياته إلى نهايته، والمرة الثانية كخاتمة تراجيدية أخيرة له. كأنّ اللعبة هنا تشير إلى حال المجتمع الأميركي إثر الحرب، حال الخارج من لعبة كاد يُقتل بها، بيده، مصوّباً المسدّد إلى رأسه، مصدوماً لما وصلت إليه حاله، كما هو حال المقتول، وقد يكون لاحتمال عدد الرّصاصات هنا معنى: ١/٦.

فالفيلم (The Deer Hunter) ليس تماماً عن الحرب في فيتنام، فلم نر منها غير لعبة الروليت ومحاولة الهرب، بل عن آثار الحرب على الأميركيين العائدين من هناك، وعلى أقربائهم، فمن عاد من الحرب من مايك ورفاقه تغيّرت علاقته تماماً بالمجتمع المحيط، لم يعد هنالك الرفاق المرِحون المشاغبون بل من تبقى منهم عاد بمشاكل نفسية أو بصدمات (تروما) امتدّت إلى ما بعد الحرب وإلى المحيطين.

وإن لم يكن الفيلم عن الحرب بل عن آثارها، إلا أنّ ما صوّره من الحرب كان منحازاً إلى الجنود الأمريكيين في مقابل فيتناميين بدوا كوحوش مرعبين، وقد تلقى الفيلم انتقادات لهذه الصورة. إن كان من موقف سياسي في الفيلم تجاه الحرب فهو أنّه ضدّها وبقوّة إنّما ليس لأن أميركا كانت قوّة احتلال هناك فظّعت بالفيتناميين، بل لأنّ الحرب عادت على المجتمع الأميركي بالويلات، وهذا ما نجده في أفلام عديدة، أميركية وغير أميركية، تنتقد حروب بلادها في أراضي الآخرين، إنّما لأسباب لا تتعلق أبداً بالضحايا من هؤلاء الآخرين، أسباب أقل إنسانية مما يمكن أن يظن المشاهد.

"The best war film I have ever seen. And what's funny is that it's more a drama than a war film. The film begins with an hour long introduction to the main characters we see them living their lives and enjoying themselves. A lot of people have called this part dull and boring and I understand where they are coming from but to me it introduced the setting perfectly and allowed me to get to know the characters. Then the next part takes place in Vietnam, it does not shy away from showcasing the horrors of war, we see women and children shot to pieces, blown up, men set on fire. Our three main characters are captured and are forced to take part in brutal games of Russian Roulette. In comes one of the most tense and brillaint sequences of cinema I have ever watched. I was absolutely hooked to the screen. We don't spend too much time in Vietnam maybe about 30 minutes and then we follow our main character back home, he realises how everything has changed and the scene where he cannot bring himself to kill the deer is one of my favourite scenes of all time. It's just so beautiful. He soon returns to Vietnam to save one of the other characters and the ending is extremely emotional, upsetting, poignant and shocking. The editing and cinematography was incredible, the acting was amazing. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage are absolutely superb. This is definitely in my top 15 films of all time. It was just amazing.

"The Deer Hunter appears on my list Best Picture Winners Ranked
Overstuffed, yet justified in its length, The Deer Hunter is a film with brushes of perfection in nearly every category, but fails to capitalize on some of its best assets. The cast is incredible, yet Walken and Cazale feel underutilized. Some of the direction and camera work is great, and other moments feel a bit generic. The plot focuses on important and captivating themes, but individuals scenes linger longer than necessary in a film that is 3 hours.
Despite my above comments, this is a very impressive film and a must watch for anyone interested in the effects of war or the Vietnam War in general.
One thing I really loved about this film is the naturalistic feel of the group scenes. Any scene that involves several characters at once is loud, conversational, and chaotic with different lines overlapping and cutting each other off. It builds a lot of validity towards the men's friendship and gives the wedding scene a genuine party feel.
Overall The Deer Hunter is a great watch, one that is fully deserving of its Best Picture status.
I don't like war films, should I watch this? - Maybe. Some people say this isn't even a war film but just a drama.

"One of the first Vietnam War heavy hitters that seemingly has a lower share of the acclaim, giving bigger applause to the works of Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, and Francis Ford Coppola. The Deer Hunter is a bit lopsided for some considering its lengthy opening to establish its characters, and its damaging depiction of the Vietnamese as if the war was completely one sided.
Truthfully, even as heavy handed as this becomes thematically and Cimino‘s, let’s say, extremely Hollywood approach to rural parts of nearby towns I grew up around, it pulled me in a captivated me in a way far few films do. I think the opening, even at its length, is pretty rare to see nowadays and maybe it just works for me so well for nostalgia sake. I’ll say this, to me, works very much as an anti-war film expressly because of a singular harrowing scene with the green beret at the wedding. “Oh, fuck it” he exclaims, which represent a fate and reflection that portray this war so well. Many knew of not what they were getting themselves into and had there even been advice these three men, alike most, were ready, unbeknownst the perils of war that were bigger than they imagined and stood above any advice they could have been given. Next, the visual motif of the roulette is exceptional in how it shifts meaning each time it’s presented. The cast is giving A+ performances and just a shock to see John Cazale being filmed so close to his passing.
The ending I feel almost at odds with because I’d imagine most take the song literally and not ironically, which maybe cast a dark shadow on its reputation, but in a way eerily similar to Taxi Driver. It sure feels dark in tone, where Michael (played by DeNiro) has come back from Vietnam completely changed in ways of violence but much more alike Nicky and Steven than he has before. The table and town are treating him like a god and that to me adds to the misreadings of war and patriotism today. There’s clearly a lot surrounding this that is worth a debate, but from how I see it The Deer Hunter is my favorite war film upon first watch and an easy 5/5.",5.0

De Niro in a beard is charming and young Walken is handsome but it can’t justify the 3 hour runtime, the lapses in between acts (when in every other instance insists to be shown in pain staking detail) and the fetishizing of American glory (singing the pledge of allegiance to the flag at the end, looking up to men in uniform…), objectification of women though male gaze (comparison of women at bowling alley to Linda, Nick’s jealousy of Micheal dancing with Linda…) and toxic male stigma that no one can understand what you’re going through so you shut yourself out to the outside world.

"Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken), 1978
""One shot?""
Harrowing in the fullest sense imaginable. De Niro, Walken, and Savage put forth performances that elevated the scene of acting at the time. Just incredible. Meryl Streep is also a very important piece to this picture, just fantastic. The first hour goes on a little too long but I suppose it's valid in terms of building our understating of how close all these characters are with one another. Once the pin drops and the film begins to focus on the Vietnam War then it really picks up the pace on all fronts. This was my first time watching this movie and I was really blown away by the majority of it.

1978 Ranked
The Deer Hunter is a devastating portrait of the effect war has on the psyches of those who fought and they communities they reside in. This is a film with a large scope that captures the sentiment before, during, and after the war. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep give A+ performances. The cinematography and production design is top notch. The Russian Roulette sequences are some of the most horrifying pulse-pounding ever made. It might not be the best Vietnam War film, because it doesn’t really provide much information or reality or from the war itself. It is more of a backdrop for the hellish journey these characters go through. Looking back on the 70’s, I think it might’ve been the best decade of Best Picture Winners.",4.5
"I'm thinking about the deer. Going to 'Nam. I like the trees, you know? I like the way that the trees are on mountains, all the different... the way the trees are.
I think, first and foremost, it’s important to acknowledge how fucking brilliant Cimino is in establishing what’s probably one of the most [brutally] realistic worlds ever established in film. Not one second did i ever think any part of this film was unnecessary because, obviously, i’m not a fucking idiot that thinks art has to be cut down in order to appease me (sorry that Seven Samurai tweet just ticked me off so much).
I wont say much because i’m pretty exhausted and my mom just gave me a headache but man. Trauma. Vietnam is nothing special in this film. It’s just like Pennsylvania. It was just an apparatus used by the film in order to establish the character’s futures. Of course you could argue if it’s a pro/anti Vietnam film (although i doubt if it was inherently pro-Vietnam it would be loved as much), but it just... doesn’t matter does it? Our protagonists are put through hellish trauma and we get to see how they deal with it. And it’s (frighteningly) beautiful. 
That score also deserves it’s own paragraph. So damn good. The first deer hunting scene with the choir music? Where every step Mike took went rhythmically with the hums of the music? Fucking outstanding. 
I will not be interpreting the final scene. But who knows? Maybe it’s just one massive case of Stockholm Syndrome.",4.5

"One of the most emotionally wrecking films I have ever seen, and all I could think to myself while watching was: 'this is why I watch movies, this is cinema...'
The Deer Hunter is quite possible the best-paced three-hour drama I've seen in my entire life. It's split up into three acts, each telling a story of pre-war, during the war, and post-war. I was a little worried about the story shifts in the first place, as it hasn't worked for me in the past, but thanks to Cimino's masterful direction, it prevails gloriously. The first act is all about friendship and hope, the second heads into the insanity of the Vietnam war, and the third shows the effects the war had on this group of friends. There were certain scenes in this movie, particularly the Russian Roulette scenes that left me clawing my seat with tension, it was simply riveting to watch. Robert De Niro gives my favorite performance from him, and I personally believe he deserved the Oscar, in fact, the entire cast was terrific, zero flaws there. The conclusion did something to me that very few films accomplish, leaving a mark, I will remember this films ending for years to come. It was satisfying, melancholic, dramatic, there are too many words to describe its devastating feel, I will never be the same after how well this film concluded, I am truly and utterly speechless.

"The Deer Hunter (1978)
The Deer Hunter follows Mike, Nick and Steven, who’re friends and co-workers at a steel mill and hunt for deer when they’re not busy. They leave for military service in Vietnam and fall into the hands of the Viet Cong, who go to a prison camp and force them to play Russian roulette while the jailers place bets against them. Yielding to fear and tiredness they give up, shooting the captors and make their escape. A few weeks later Mike returns home, but can’t reintegrate back into life as it was before Vietnam. He finds out Nicky hasn’t come back from the war, choosing to stay for some reason and sets out to find and rescue him.
-
Last time I saw The Deer Hunter was about four and a half years ago, at a time and age where I didn’t care for it too much or see how good it really was but I’m glad to have given the film a much deserved second chance (it was always going to happen, I rewatch most films because I really can’t trust myself to be consistent in my thoughts on them all the time) but I didn’t reckon I’d like the film quite as much as I did, enough to have it as one of new favourites, this time around. It’s one of the best and most powerful war films I’ve seen which is mostly down to how well the story’s put together, how much ground it covers, how many themes and ideas it handles for what’s really not much time. Three hours might sound and feel like enough time to focus on some people’s life before Vietnam, in the war and after but I’ve seen whole TV shows and miniseries that weren’t about as much, or weren’t as effective in all those stages as The Deer Hunter. It was such a good move for them to spend an hour at home, getting to know Mike and Nicky that the rest of it came as a shock. You might not like the first third, it’s an hour long and is just a wedding, the party and Mike, Nick and Steven’s last deer hunt before leaving for military service in Vietnam like I didn’t the first time I watched it but I came to realize how powerful and much-needed it was, to set up the characters and the rest of the film, to make us feel as close to them as we know they do. To be as happy for them, to mourn them and wish for them to be safe, as they were, as if it were real. As if we did know them. The second part shows us these people we’ve just gotten to know in the Vietnam war, sent to a prison camp, forced to play Russian roulette while the enemy forces bet against their lives. Those scenes are probably the most hard-to-watch out of the whole movie, you don’t know what’s going to happen, who’ll set off the trigger or find a way to escape somehow. People know about the Russian Roulette scenes but the iconography, the way most of us know what happens and we’ve all seen the stills of Robert De Niro holding a revolver against his head and of what happens to Nicky at the end, doesn’t take away from how powerful those scenes were, the quieter, much less famous scenes that you wouldn’t know if you haven’t seen the film were how those scenes managed to be as sad to watch and powerful as they were. The rest of it shows us why and by how much the war changed them and it’s devastating to see what happened, how they don’t quite fit in, or feel comfortable around people who love and have known them for years, choosing to stay in, to not reintegrate back into life as it was before Vietnam, staying alone up in the highway. The performances were great all around, Christopher Walken's earned him a much-deserved Oscar win for his supporting role but the performance I was most impressed by was that of Robert De Niro, which is probably his best from what I’ve seen. It’s such a quiet, aching performance that works given the film’s sad and quite mournful tone. It gets heavier as it went on, the Vietnam war, the time we get back home and realize nothing’s quite the same anymore, until the ending hits, the credits start to roll and those weights are lifted off. The Deer Hunter is a film which holds its legacy as one of the best and Cimino keeps Mike and Nicky's friendship at the heart of whatever story he’s trying to tell really nicely, it doesn’t waver from the stuff it wants us to focus on that moment at the expense of something more bold or shocking, it earns it. Very few war movies have shown the full substance of what happened in Vietnam, those which do have the glazed over look most Hollywood films are like now, when you think back to the likes of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket which had a basic, safe but good likeness of how Vietnam was in the late 50s and 60s The Deer Hunter takes its time. It doesn’t just head into the fray of Vietnam on the battlefield it fleshed out the characters as much as we need to care for what happens to them first.
-
The Deer Hunter’s problem wasn’t that it focused so much on life outside Vietnam but how sudden the change from Pennsylvania to military service to life back home was. One scene they’re in a bar, drinking, after their friend’s just gotten married then two seconds later we’re in Vietnam, in the middle of a battlefield, about to get caught and sent to a prison camp, before we know it they’re back home. These changes in setting were badly set up, too quick and jarring when they could’ve just shown us how it moved from one scene to the next and how the characters got from place to place so it didn’t feel like it was competing or not from the same movie.
-
The Deer Hunter’s a well-managed, sad and powerful movie that brings out the best in its director and leading actors. I didn’t feel bored or like the film was re-treading its steps for the sake of being a three hour long movie, it had to be at least to set up the characters and what’ll come from the story to make us feel as close to them as we know they are to each other.

That's why the first hour of the film, something I once saw as completely undisciplined and self-indulgent, now seems…",4.5
"I'd Like to Thank the Academy, or: my Academy Awards Best Picture project - part 51 (of 92 or 93)

Those who have been following along with this project may remember how I once said that William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives was one of the best films dealing with the effects of war on veterans. I forgot until now just how much Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter blows that one out of the water.
I mean, the only seemingly calm one is Robert DeNiro's character, Michael Vronsky, who at least on the surface came back from Vietnam more or less unscathed (in reality he's probably ramming his mental walls in psychological agony, but we'll never see it, except in his inability to shoot a deer towards the end). Not like John Savage's physically wounded character, Steven Pushkov, who wouldn't go to see his wife after he came back (deferring himself instead to rounds of bingo at the hospital), and certainly not like the brilliant Christopher Walken's psychologically tormented character, Nick Chevotarevich, who is so mentally damaged he hasn't left Saigon and feels the incessant urge to play Russian Roulette with anyone who is mad enough to join him.
These people are broken; they've reached a point of no return, and each actor does wonders with their respective parts. You can see that Christopher Walken, in particular, couldn't seem to shake that role for years, and he truly hasn't been the same in any part he's taken since. Truly a master, and yet today we poke fun at his erratic style and his odd-choice enunciation. We've truly forgotten just how great he is, and I'd say he easily overshadows Robert DeNiro in this film, but not by much.
Everyone of course gives it their all, including the above, and the fantastic Meryl Streep & the talented John Cazale, who died of lung cancer not long after production on The Deer Hunter ended. It's a shame because I think he had the chops to take his performances to great heights. He was great as Fredo in the Godfather trilogy, and I liked what I saw of him here as well. Not to undercut Streep's performance either, she was phenomenal.
The story itself is broken into three parts: 1) the character intros and lead-up to Vietnam, 2) their hellish experience in Vietnam, and 3) the return and final disillusionment & trauma for all the characters involved. Each scene feels absolutely necessary to get us to the finish line because everything is important, and the film is perfect as it is. Michael Cimino and Deric Washburn wrote these characters as though they were people they knew (or maybe it was they themselves who had these experiences) who went off to fight in Vietnam and got so broken they couldn't piece their lives back together again. As someone who has never experienced war, I'm not 100% sure about that, but the film gives that feel nonetheless.
I only saw The Deer Hunter once before, and I never picked up on half the things I did during today's viewing, and for that, I'm glad I went the path of the Oscar™ winners. Tomorrow's film is one I've seen before more recently: Robert Benton's divorce drama, Kramer vs. Kramer. Keep your eyes peeled.",5.0

"1978

""The Deer Hunter"" is one of the first films to deal with the Vietnam War and portray its horrors. The focus is not really on the war itself, but on the characters and what the war does with them. The film takes a lot of time to introduce and establish the characters and that's why you build a connection to them and therefore what happened during and after the war has an even bigger impact. In fact, it takes 1 hour and 8 minutes for the film to show vietnam and the war, the time until then we spend with the characters at their homes, in a bar and at a wedding, and even if nothing special happened, I had a lot of fun with this first act. It shows the characters in a good mood and everyone has a great time, which, as mentioned, makes the later impact greater.
The second act takes place in Vietnam, but hardly shows the war itself, but rather the imprisonment and its horrors. These scenes are really heavy and especially the famous russian roulette scenes are really depressing.
The third act shows the characters after they left the war and the trauma they have. All of this is also very oppressive.
The film is just consistently well written, the direction is also good and the cinematography and score are fantastic too. Of course, the film has a great cast and outstanding acting. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryl Streep, George Dzundza and Chuck Aspegren all play outstandingly and really bring the characters close to you, no matter how big the role, and the actors also convey the emotions of the characters and you can empathize with them.

THE DEER HUNTER
One of the best films to show the arc someone goes through before, during and after going to fight in a war. I watched this with one of my closest friends as it’s one of his all-time favourites, and it certainly did not disappoint. The acting across the board is brilliant and probably my favourite thing about the film itself — De Niro and Walken are especially remarkable. I really admire the way the story progresses, and how, for a relatively big motion picture, the narrative decision to have the whole first hour of the film be a wedding ceremony is not only a bold choice, but an intelligent and meaningful setting for the first act. Another thing that was great about the film was how well its visual storytelling is — it may not have been as effective, but if this had been a silent film, it might have worked quite well. It also definitely did not feel as long as its three-hour runtime. The movie’s cinematography and score are beautiful, and the Russian roulette motif — particular the earlier roulette sequence — is ingenious. Ultimately, The Deer Hunter is a film with an arrayed scope, and one that leaves little room for specific flaws. That ending is beautifully captivating and moving.

"Earned it’s runtime, visually beautiful, and the story was layered beyond belief. We call him Robert DiGoated cause he’s goat, we call him goat. The friendship the bro’s had is something you never get sick of seeing, but Deer Hunter kept it so real showing the weird dynamics and drama that are inherent in lifelong friends. Ultimately it shows whatever weird stuff that comes into play cause you’re so damn close and around each other all the time really doesn’t mean anything cause love and brotherhood is forever",4.0
"A three hour epic about the horrors of war and the American vision, The Deer Hunter still feels like a very personal film that focuses primarily on male bonding and friendship and the inescapable suffering forced on so many. It’s long and has an undeniable scope and a potent critique of the Vietnam War that earned it a spot on many lists of best war films, but I often found myself thinking it played directly into the things it was trying to dismantle. All war films are bound to glorify war in some manner and that certainly happens here, with many being drawn to it for the promise of watching fighting, but it also perpetuates a certain idea of Vietnamese inhumanity and American purity, even if there is a recognition that it is often motivated by idealistic stupidity, and the message ultimately comes down to the same simple one as so many others- war is hell. Yet, for whatever misgivings I may have about those aspects, they all have a purpose and strengthen the film in their own ways. It’s a film that focuses on its characters and giving the basic worldview they could be expected to have, which makes sense as a way to make them sympathetic. It also leads to fun moments of the men singing and hanging out and heart shattering ones where they experience the consequences of war, alongside the tremendous Russian roulette scenes that are among the most difficult scenes to watch from any film. It’s a fairly simple film and most of the power of The Deer Hunter derives from its incredible performances, with De Niro and Walken putting in some of the best work of their lengthy and lauded careers and Cazale, in his final role, bringing an added potency to the conversations about mortality and proving he was a major talent gone far too soon, while others like Streep and Savage are similarly great in their roles. Even if it can be a bit uneven and, at times, unsure of what it wants to say, the deep emotional moments and intense depictions of brutality make it feel monumental.

"At the core of this demanding exploration of idealism and the casualties of war-driven inhumanity’s effects on a very small circle of friends lies the question of what still matters when it‘s all over and there seem to be only losses – of lives, innocence, sanity, of everything that defined your life once before.
And the before, the during and the after are narrated in long, realistic stretches of key events giving a sense of ""being there"" with the three core characters all the time and knowing them very well: happiness, madness and emptiness define the corresponding acts of the film, each of which is given roughly the same amount of time over the three hours It runs, uncompromisingly torturous and cruel to watch especially in the middle section.
In the end, the melancholy of the likely impossible task of connecting back to normal life after coming home, the palpable absence of your comrades as you knew them, the remoteness of everything familiar forces our protagonist (De Niro really at his prime) to embrace the person he is now and accept that whatever lengths he goes to, the clock can‘t be turned back. And as the credits roll, this tour de force leaves you with great melancholy to a wonderful, tender and sad acoustic score by maestro John Williams.
Like with all sincere war movies, it is by far not always a nice experience to watch what we are being forced to watch. But it is an important one. The Deer Hunter makes us care about the characters' fate while slowly pulling us into the abyss and – what is maybe even more important – trying to pull us out again.",4.5

For the many War on Terror War movies I’ve seen, they’re all riffing off this, or taking pieces of it because it’s one of the first to deal with the trauma and not the glory of war. Films like this are hard to talk about as a film, because a lot of it feels like showing off the cast with unreal performances. I think they are better than the film",4.0
"Top 100 Favorite Movies - click HERE
This is probably my favorite war movie I have seen so far, which is kind of funny seeing as the majority of the film is not set during combat but rather focuses on how it affects people both in and out of the war. The story follows a clear three-act structure: before the war, during the war, and after the war. The movie does a great job of establishing the characters in the beginning. While I've read a lot of reviews saying that the first act (especially the wedding scene) is overlong and boring, I disagree. Although it's long, I don't think that any time is wasted and all of what we see is important in setting up the story and our characters. The film does a great job of making the characters relatable, and empathetic. One of the first and one of my favorite scenes of the movie is when Mike, Nick, Steve, and all their friends are getting drunk in the bar before steves wedding. The characters all just seem so likable, and relatable; as if they could be your own group of friends.
After establishing and spending time with the characters in the ""ordinary world"", we jump to Vietnam. I don't really have much to add here besides the fact that it was basically perfect filmmaking throughout. Even people who dislike this film usually give credit to the Russian roulette sequence (which is near the top of my all-time favorite scenes in cinema history) The acting here is all excellent and really shows you the horrors the main cast face in Vietnam.
And then we come to the final act. I will say this is where my only problems with the film lie. After Mike comes back, I was starting to feel the length in this movie. But overall, I still think it was done really well. My two favorite parts from the final act would be the Deer Hunting scene. This does a great job of conveying to the audience just how much war has changed our protagonist, with him not wanting to hunt deer anymore, which I see as symbolism for the mindless violence that was the Vietnam War. And the ending, where Mike goes back to Vietnam to rescue Nick. I've been writing for a long time, so I'll just say that it was one of the most emotional sequences I have seen.
Overall this movie was great, and definitely deserves all the praise and acclaim it gets. If you haven't seen this classic, I strongly recommend doing so.",5.0

There’s some great and fun music all the ways through as well as some old catholic memories for me in the first act. It’s all fun in the beginning before it veers into more serious territory as it showcases the brutality of war in Vietnam and then meditating on the after effects of being in the war. Damaged psyches and personalities showcase the trauma that these characters now deal with as well as the new strains on relationships. It’s rough in some parts but is overall a entertaining but stark film that feels both shorter and longer than it really is.

"i've been wanting to see this film for a while, but the 3 hour runtime put me off. i'm so glad i finally got around to it though, because this was undoubtedly one of the most emotional, enthralling war films i've ever seen. i didn't feel like a moment was wasted, which is very telling considering a movie of this length. i grew to care for the characters in the first act, see how they live through the war in the second, and their subsequent reactions after they've left it. mike and nick were thoroughly fleshed out and i felt as if i was watching my own friends experience this. it was so interesting to see how the two men dealt with the ramifications of war - mike seemed so much calmer and slightly more ready to enter society, while nick seemed to find that the only way to cope was to keep going through the same adrenaline rush of roulette time and time again, never really leaving the war behind.
and man the performances from everyone were stellar! especially, of course, de niro and walken - even as big a fan i am of taxi driver, i think this is honestly de niro's best performance. i really could not take my eyes off him (and not just because i thought he looked attractive LMAO). academy awards all around man.
my parting thought is that i am that woman in the store that kept kissing de niro when meryl streep brought him inside to say hello. i'm kinning",4.5
"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a bleak and depressing movie that makes Coppola's Apocalypse Now look like a fun excursion on Disney's Jungle Cruise by comparison. Robert De Niro leads a brilliant cast in a story about how those who return from war don't always return the way they left and though the film has the standard inscrutable-evil Vietcong doing cruel and sadistic acts I don't think anyone watching this would believe this was indicative of the locals.
On a side note, I'm surprised that Russian roulette never became an Olympic event.",3.0

"An excellent, understated gem that aces its dual functions as The Great American Epic on Film and the landmark gritty Vietnam War film that paved the way for others like it. First of all, this film is soaked in verisimilitude to such an impressive degree. It was as if I were observing actual people living their lives, going through motions good and bad. The immersion is crafted in such a mesmerizing way that even the ""notorious"" wedding sequence went by in a breeze. Along with other extended scenes, it truly felt like a day in the life.
While the film's got plenty of tension later on, it also offers unexpectedly funny moments on top of moving poignancy to tide you over. All the actors did a great job, making their relationships and conflicts believable. Honorable mentions to Robert de Niro, John Cazale, and Christopher Walken, of course. Intelligent writing supports the subdued approach and feels consistent with the direction. While it's very much dedicated to an insanely rigid three-act structure, each act feels distinct and flows smoothly enough to strengthen the film's purpose in exploring how war changes people. Beautiful cinematography, lovely set design, great musical selections, and solid sound seal the deal.
Michael Cimino may have his excesses as a director but manages to harness them well enough so they don't take away from the final picture. That being said, the film could have been trimmed in spots and the narrative lent a tighter focus. Some characters are given short shrift and don't register as strongly. Even with the film going by quicker than expected, there's still parts in the last hour where the pacing's put on hold. And this is very much a film where you can automatically tell whether you'll love it or find it boring. Thankfully, I was singing praise within the first 10 minutes.
The Deer Hunter may not be a perfect masterpiece but it sure is a classic that quietly lands its target to be emblematic of a height of filmmaking that, instead of drawing attention for everyone to buzz about, simply lets itself be.",4.5
"This is a fucking SLOG and provides very little reward for your investment. A mere smattering of decent scenes doesn't go far in a 3 hour run-time.
For a film that's so revered it has remarkably little to say.
Opening with a brash, interminable 50 minute (!) wedding sequence, before even introducing your characters or giving you a hook, is suicidal filmmaking. By the time the (solid) Vietnam/Russian roulette sequences hit, you'll struggle to care, particularly with the thin, nothingy characters.
How this won Best Editing is a mystery (you could shave 40mins off the opening hour and lose nothing), and while I don't begrudge her anything, I cannot explain why (an unknown) Meryl Streep earned an Oscar nomination here.
I can understand why this film is significant - being one of the first major American pictures to depict the Vietnam war after it ended - but I really cannot fathom why it is so lauded.",2.0

""O argumento principal abordado por meio do antirrealismo reflete toda a energia perdida de uma geração que sofre as consequências da fome de poder a todo custo. Gradualmente o cinema americano passa a ser dedicado aos assombros da guerra, uma leva nova de cineastas que trata o totalitarismo com olhos mais esclarecidos, rompendo não só com isso mas com a tradição cinematográfica. Cimino foi um dos nomes chave para o entendimento desse cinema, um cineasta que prezou em analisar as raízes da violência independente do seu cenário. Talvez por isso O Franco Atirador seja o filme de maior sucesso do diretor, por se tratar de um filme tão amplo sobre o sentimento que todo um povo sentia no peito.""

Film ini ngepotray bukan hanya perang seperti filmnya Oliver Stone dan bukan mengenai psikologi saat perang seperti filmnya Francis Ford Copolla. Film ini sebenernya berusaha ngepotray betapa sulitnya jadi veteran. Tahap pertama kita ninggalin temen2 dirumah tahap kedua kita perang kalo selamat masuk ke tahap tiga yang dimana semuanya akan berubah, bukan dri sisi psikologis aja tpi juga akan merusak society. Gimana beratnya ninggalin temen disana, padahal cuma sejengkal langkah lagi untuk Michael selamatin Nick, tpi takdir ga bertemu.

"'The Deer Hunter', although it follows the whole 'war is bad, look at the what it does to people!"" cliche, it feels different. The storytelling is hard hitting and it never lets up once Michael returns from Vietnam. Speaking of Michael, this is an incredible performance from the greatest to ever do it, Robert De Niro. Never once do you feel like he's acting, it comes so naturally to him in pretty much every role but this is a special example from his filmography. All that praise and one minor but damning criticism is that this could've cut 20-30mins off and still had this same impact. The ending, what a fucking heartbreaking ending. Overall though, a great movie.",4.0

"I can understand the controversies around this film in 1979 and just how hard it must have ben for viewers, especially if they had any personal connections to the Vietnam Conflict to sit through this. Still though, The Deer Hunter is a haunting look not just at a war that pushed men to their limits on survival, but also the after effects and coming home to surround yourself with people who will never understand the pain and torture you and your friends went through. This is one of the best war films I have seen. I see it as anti-war. I love a film that makes you talk and come up with your own thoughts from the symbolism of the deer to the final scene that uses 'America the Beautiful' in a way that can be opened for interpretation. The Deer Hunter is challenge. It builds on its character and the love and brotherhood they have for one another and slowly rips it apart in the jungles of Vietnam to reveal true horrors.",5.0
"I don’t know if it’s because I watched The Conversation today, but this feels like a Francis Ford Coppola film. 
If there is one thing that The Deer Hunter does best it would be that it dilevers on every emotion. There are moments where it’s simply fun to watch and there are moments that are really scary. And the scary ones work the best in my opinion. The fact that this movie is three hours long helps with those moments not mixing together in an unnatural way. Every sequence of scenes takes its time and gives the next sequence more depth.",4.5
"Holy shit, what a film.
A 3 hour long drama that takes it's time. A full hour of the film is dedicated to getting to know the characters during a wedding and a subsequent hunting trip. After that, some of the men are deployed to Vietnam, and we're dropped right into hell. Since we have spent so much time with them, the drama really hits hard.
I really loved this one. I found it pretty damn captivating from start to finish, even with a long run time.",5.0
"This truly great film devastatingly captures the idea that you really can never go home again.
In its epic scope of 183 minutes running time, The Deer Hunter tells a story of what could be described as innocence lost for an entire country and yet the story always keeps these three boys that have to go to Vietnam in its center.
It's almost split up equally into a third spent at home in a working class town, then another third spent in Vietnam and as suddenly as we are thrust into watching the three of them over there, as suddenly are we back ""home"" again. Only, not really and at great cost.
The location photography is astonishing and lends an instant grandeur to the production value of the film. The existing Blu-ray is quite good but I still hope we'll see a 4K remastered version for its 40th anniversary next year, although I'm quite sure that my next viewing of the film will not be happening for quite a while.",4.0

"This movie just left me speechless.
It doesn't happen often that a movie has this much of an impact to me as the deer hunter did. I was a bit bored and dissapointed with the first hour of this movie. But after I saw the rest of the film I totally got why that first hour was needed and I really appreciated the movie for that. I don't even want to talk too much about this movie because it just feels bad for some reason, because the characters seem so real and it feels so wrong to talk about their lives when you have never experienced life the way they did. I can say without a doubt that Robert de Niro and Christopher walken give the best performances of their live in this movie.
I have never felt such an emotional movie experience in my life and I don't think I ever will. The Deer hunter is the best movie I have ever seen and not because it's an entertaining film, but because it's the most emotional I have ever felt during a film and then some.

"One of the most important and powerful films of all time! -?????????
Either this movie is just average, or it hasnt aged well. The first hour was great. I read a lot of people saying its the worst part, but its the only good part of the movie. I really felt, happy during it, and it reminded of myself, and my friends.
Then came the second hour. I was hyped for the russian roulette part, but it didnt give me any feelings at all. I wasnt shocked, scared or anything. It was more boring than the wedding. At this time the characters start acting like they have autism? They just dont act like normal functioning people. Its just weird.
The third hour is the aftermath. Which was a letdown too. The characters are acting even weirder. The ending was well done though.

"Aside from a few pacing flaws, I thought this movie was awesome. There were a few scenes where there was no talking and just background noise or music, and those were the best moments in the movie.

This movie further reinforces my opinion that Robert De Niro is my favorite actor, and I've never seen Christopher Walken give a better performance. Not even in Pulp Fiction.",4.5

"The lives of a group of friends in Pennsylvania change when three of them are sent to fight in Vietnam (Steven, Michael and Nick). The first hour is about their lives before going to Vietnam so the characters are presented, their personalities and concerns while Steven's wedding is held. All the story is well told and the way through it was clear from the beginning by taking its time to define the characters and relationship between them. It's all about the characters touched by the war they didn't ask for. A descent into hell.",4.5
"At 3 hours, ""The Deer Hunter"" does feel a bit overlong, but I get the impression that was Michael Cimino's point. The film's first-third, and a long portion of its final third, offer an in-depth examination into the lives of these characters, as well as how their lives were all torn apart by the Vietnam war. The film's middle section, which takes place in Vietnam, offers a deeply disturbing and violent look into the conflict, and while I'm not quite sure that it's an accurate depiction of what happened at that time, I don't think it has to be. ""The Deer Hunter"" is not so much a war film as a character study that shows how violence impacts them all.
Cimino does a phenomenal job placing the audience directly in the center of the characters' lives, creating a realistic world for them to inhabit and completely believable friendships and romances. The chemistry between the actors, and even the extras, is something to behold, and the attention to detail in the wedding sequence is wonderful. Individually, the whole cast does good work, specifically Robert De Niro and a heartbreaking but terrifying Christopher Walken.
While I would say that the film could have been shortened, I only believe it had to be by about 10 minutes or so, and the first third of the film should not have been touched in the slightest. If anything, the incredible attention to detail feels a bit cheapened by the fact that the climatic moment of the film happens very quickly, and with far too much build-up. Still, the final scene is as cynical as it is brilliant. This is a very good film, that's raw, brutal and uncompromisingly bleak.",4.0
"This movie never ceases to impress and move me no matter how often I have seen it by now.

"Short Review: Overall, the film has a phenomenal story that makes the entire experience worthwhile.
However, it is long and the film takes its damn time. The entire first hour is devoted to setting up the characters, and it includes what must be the longest and loudest wedding scene ever filmed. I seriously think a lot of this could have been trimmed. Things get more interesting when the actual war kicks off, and the ultimate payoff of the story comes in full circle by the end. The film drags a bit, and it can be a bit dry. However, the characters are very expressive, endearing, deep, and their interactions contribute to a hard-hitting conclusion.",3.5
"Character development is the focal point of many films, & when a film is lacking in it, it becomes the biggest flaw we take into account. The Deer Hunter consists of three acts that establish character development probably better than any other film I've ever seen. The performances are amazing. Robert De Niro, standing at the peak of his career, holds the core of the film together. Christopher Walken plays the man who is forever intoxicated by the dance of death. John Savage as a study in torment. & a low key but rock solid Meryl Streep. There are also many effective memorable scenes- the Russian roulette scenes are still intense to watch, the wedding, the hunting scene before they go to war, rolling down a tree in hope of a rescue, & the funeral scene. The Deer Hunter is a powerful piece of work that differs from other classic films about the Vietnam War. Platoon dealt with personality conflicts of the characters. Full Metal Jacket took you right into the heart of a soldier. But in The Deer Hunter, Michael Cimino invents a surreal game of Russian roulette to symbolize the terror inside the heads of men fighting a war they can't comprehend.",5.0

"As a high stakes gambler I feel represented, Nick is a role model for all of us",4.5
"The Deer Hunter succeeds largely on its authenticity, a portrait of a small town group of friends, their workplace, the bar they like to hang out at, the interiors of their dance halls and church, the exteriors of their streets and mountainsides. Michael Cimino and his team render this community and their lives with a spirit that feels genuine, then move the action to Vietnam where they maintain that level of detail. This approach suggests these men are the products of their environments, which is not a new statement, but Cimino makes his point effectively. It also helps to have this cast turning in fine work, but he crafts tense and harrowing sequences regardless.
However, I do think Meryl Streep’s Linda is a noticeable weak link, and the only aspect which feels like an obligatory movie element. I also found the experience to be overlong, but perhaps there are literary and thematic elements to be found upon a rewatch.

L'interpretazione di Christopher Walken ti ammazza veramente,4.5
"""When a man say no to champagne, he say no to life""
I flipped back and forth between a 3.5 and 4 for a while, and then the last 15 minutes hit and it became one of my higher 4-star films. What a great movie.
The acting is absolutely incredible. I find it really hard to believe that De Niro and Streep shouldn't have won Oscars alongside Walken, who absolutely deserved his win. Robert De Niro is the greatest actor ever in my mind, everything I watch that I haven't previously seen just makes it more and more clear. I need to watch more things with Meryl Streep because she's fantastic. Walken just has such a warmth to him in most of his roles but this one has even more than that, he changes so much throughout and it's devastating. I'm now 3/5 of the way through the legendary John Cazale run and plan to watch The Conversation over winter break to make it 4/5, Dog Day will be sooner rather than later too probably. He's an asshole in this though.
Yes, it is a long movie. Yes, it is slower-paced at times. But it is absolutely worth the watch and has a couple of the most emotionally devastating moments in it. The relationships are all incredibly genuine. It's just incredibly well, with some fantastic shots and a really good score. The dialogue is really really good and has some very funny moments in the first hour or so. Playing pool in the bar while singing ""Can't Take My Eyes off of You"" (not the Lauryn Hill version) is just incredibly good vibes. Finally, the car pulling away gag is never not funny, in movies or real life.",4.0

A Few Pithy Words:
I was aware of some things when I watched The Deer Hunter, and very unaware of others. I was aware that it was the most Oscar-nominated film in '79. I was unaware that test audiences hated it so much that the studio INVENTED the strategy of Oscar-baiting in order to trick audiences into thinking it was a must-see film. I was aware that Michael Cimino won for Best Director, but unaware he lied about his military service in the interviews leading up to the award. I was aware that it was nominated for Best Screenplay. I was unaware that it was cobbled together in 4 weeks with no input from Vietnam vets, no research, actors writing their own lines and whole scenes improv-ed.
I was aware the film was known for its great performances. I was unaware Cimino was one of those asshole directors who didn't trust his actors to act, instead surprising them by having them genuinely slap, spit on, and degrade each other, and putting real diseased rats on them or real rounds in guns. I was aware DeNiro was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but unaware he boycotted the Oscars that year when he saw the final film. And I was unaware that Vietnam vets protested outside the Oscars ceremony with signs that read ""No Oscars For Racism!""
High Points:
Vilmos Zsigmond was an accomplished cinematographer hot off an Oscar win the previous year for Close Encounters. There are moments here as well of real beauty. The middle section of the film is undeniably the most compelling part, with Cimino capturing a chaotic and oppressive feeling that is very fitting for the last days of Saigon. He splices in liberal archive footage and recreates some real scenes in Saigon that have tremendous intensity. And of course there are several performances that are very noteworthy, including one of the least-quirky Christopher Walken performances, a very solid DeNiro, and the highlight of the film: Meryl Streep. Streep's Linda is really the only character I found sympathetic or gave a shit about at all, and she brought layers to her performance that no one else did. It's clear she was going to be amazing.
Low Points:
A few quibbles before the big problem... Firstly, the film is an abuse of the viewers' time. Black title cards where the credits could've easily run over the opening scenes at the steelworks instead. Rambling scenes in bars and driving that have no bearing on anything and really do little to establish character or tone. A fucking HOUR LONG wedding scene that could've easily been 5 minutes. The entire opening third should've been less than 10 minutes long if the director had a tight script and knew what he wanted (he told the crew he didn't know and so staged a real 5 day wedding scene and filmed it all instead.) All I got from the start was to know a bunch of unsympathetic redneck assholes spend most of their time drunk and running around playing with guns. They're all possessive of women but don't actually respect them or treat them like they're on the same level. Then some of them go to 'Nam for really no discernible motivation.
Then we get to Vietnam and the problems compound. From the completely inaccurate military uniforms and positions to being filled with anachronistic cars and music to having laughable continuity between scenes, Cimino's reputation as a control freak seems mis-served here. There are a million details that he should've let experts get right. And then there's the racism. Every Vietnamese person is a desperate savage without higher brain functions or morality of any kind. The US soldiers look out for each other and are just trying to get by. The Vietnamese turn on each other constantly and focus on base desires, whoring with their babies next to them, extorting everyone they know, killing women and children without hesitation. Cimino has even invented a game for them to be fascinated by, and of course for the white men to be better at. It's completely baseless, and the very definition of ""othering"".
Final thoughts:
Cimino and his defenders have said the film isn't supposed to be accurate or true, and is just a metaphor. That's such bullshit. You don't spend so much time showing your crew documentary footage, recreating it, and splicing it into your film if you want to represent it purely as ""a metaphor"". You don't have your actors speaking Vietnamese and not subtitling it if you don't want to seem authentic.
You don't insist on actors actually doing the physical bits if it's all an analogy. This film is a prime example of an ignorant white man making no effort to understand what he was filming. It exploits the genuine tragedy and trauma of real vets to try to lend gravitas to its own narrative, oblivious to how insulting that would be to those involved on BOTH sides.
This film doesn't attempt to understand what was happening in Vietnam or how hard it was for both the North and South. It makes no effort to understand the real vets who served there and what their real motivations were. And Cimino himself is exactly the kind of scumbag to say whatever gives him more credibility, actually lying and representing he knew what he was talking about when he never even WENT to Vietnam. This film is a racist piece-of-trash vanity project from a Soldier-of-Fortune wannabe warrior. It snowed the Academy in '79, but we should all be less ignorant and wiser now. It deserves to have the legacy of a film like Birth of a Nation, only less accomplished.",2.0

Week 9: November 3rd-9th
ASC 100 Milestone Films Week
Directed by Michael Cimino. 
A whirlwind of a film. Something that manages to capture humanity at its most touching and its most evil at the same time. 
Something that shows you how PTSD can change you in such a visceral way. In a way that makes you feel like you’re THERE. WITH. THEM.
I’m honestly astounded and don’t know what to say. This was such a grounded, down to earth film. A long first act marries you into this group of wide-eyed, working class buddies who know nothing of the dangers of this life. It maybe ran a little long, but you get trapped in this idyllic simple life. 
And when you hear the piano, and see the friends gather ‘round and share one last moment...you know that nothing will be the same. 
What follows is an intimate brutality the likes of which is rarely captured in such a gut-wrenching, soul-scraping way. And the fallout of such, and how each person deals with such brutality after the fact, is immense. Addiction, denial, survivor’s guilt...it’s all here. 
This might be my favorite Robert DeNiro acting performance. He is immense, a character larger than life who looms over the narrative. And his support is impeccable - Christopher Walken gives the performance of a lifetime. I’ve never been so afraid and entranced as I was by the scene on the riverbank. And John Savage ties it all up, his recognizing eyes staring up at Mikey forever etched in my mind.

"Forget Apocalypse now, this is THE Vietnam War film.
The Academy continues it's tradition of ignoring Robert De Niro, who was second only to Christopher Walken in terms of his performance. In fact the comradery between the steel workers really helped immerse me in the film. This emersion was only enhanced by the films portrayal of working class Pennsylvania on both a stylistic and script level, the level of realism made both the story and characters believable when compared to other films like Apocalypse now or Full Metal Jacket. To me my favourite scenes occurred in the second half of the film showing the characters struggling to adjust post Vietnam. These scenes really cemented the films anti-war message and enhanced the characters and the setting.
On the downside, this film went on for a little too long. It's also further evidence that Meryl Streep is one of, if not that most, overrated people in Hollywood. Was not impressed in the slightest by her performance.",4.0

"“A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that but they don’t listen.”
The Vietnam War was a… strange armed conflict. Similar to the Korean War and both World Wars that came before it, the United States joined these conflicts late, mostly because they don’t have a reason to even be fighting in it. Yeah, they might’ve won them but have they ever lost one? Well, look no further than the Vietnam War. Their involvement in the war was a polarizing one, no doubt. But even when they had better weapons than the Vietnamese military, they were easily outmatched by the Viet Cong, since they used guerilla tactics and used the country’s dense jungle as cover, easily allowing them to hide themselves from the enemy.
In the nearly 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War, the United States’ involvement has been widely discussed. Ever since they joined the war in 1965, many U.S. citizens had opposed the war on moral grounds, and was appalled by the devastation and violence caused by the war. While many were opposed to the war as they felt like they lacked clear objectives and appeared to be unwinnable, others claimed that it was war against Vietnamese independence or an intervention in a foreign civil war.
From the U.S’ first involvement in the war by 1965 to 1973, millions of young male Americans were drafted into the Vietnam War; the draft was controversial, and has been widely up for debate since then. This would result in the ones who were selected for the draft dodging it by hiding in secluded areas or by running away to Canada to avoid it. I’m currently learning more about the Vietnam War, the draft in U.S. and how it worked, soldiers sharing their experiences and what happened after, and more. In class, we are currently reading The Things They Carried, a book consisting of interconnected short stories about the war. While I’m still on winter break until this upcoming Wednesday, January 3, I still wanted to do my own research on the topic.
Firstly, I started out with the basic stuff before watching Forrest Gump, mostly because I showed high interest in it, and since its titular character did fight in the war. I felt like it wasn’t really enough for me. Eventually, I then decided to watch The Deer Hunter, an epic war drama split into three parts: the first about a trio of Slavic-American friends who work at a steel factory, preparing to go to war. The second part is set during the Vietnam War, in which they are captured by members of the Viet Cong, and were frequently forced to play Russian roulette, and you know how it goes. The third part, which serves as the final hour of the film, sees these soldiers returning home from the war, and they’re struggling to readjust to civilization as things had changed ever since they left.
Although it sleazily extends the already long runtime to a little over 3 hours, this makes for a pretty solid story with a few soul-crushing moments that’ll for sure leave an impression on some people. The Deer Hunter was one of the first major films to depict the Vietnam War, premiering in Los Angeles in December 1978 before releasing in theaters in February 1979. Although it was widely acclaimed by many, in the 40+ years since then, some have called it one of the earliest examples of “Oscar bait”, a term used to describe movies that were made specifically to win awards at the Academy Awards, or Oscars.
What categorizes a film to be “Oscar bait” often have different characteristics, such as the following: epic period dramas that usually have a runtime of 2.5-3+ hours, frequently set against the backdrop of tragic historical events, are the most common examples of the term. They’re frequently seen in that way and often contend for the technical Oscar categories for cinematography, costume design, makeup and hairstyling, production design, among others. When it comes to The Deer Hunter, it first got a limited release, with showings heavily having Oscar voters in the audience just long enough for it to be eligible, and was given a wide release shortly after it got nine nominations at the 51st Oscars, tying with Heaven Can Wait for the most nominations of the ceremony, before it would go onto win five Oscars, including Best Picture.
As one of earliest examples of “Oscar bait”, I had fears that this wouldn’t be any good since this caused some controversy over its historical inaccuracies (and among other things). But I watched it and I really liked it! Sure it may be a masterpiece of cinema and I can consider it as such, and although I may refute that statement someday, I’ll stand by that statement. Well, it is one of the best films ever made and I don’t know if I can even stand by it. It’ll probably grow on me eventually.
Back in the 1970s, Michael Cimino was a well-respected director, having previously wrote and directed Thunderbolts and Lightfoot in 1974, in addition to notably co-writing Magnum Force with John Milius in 1973. The former got only one Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for its co-star Jeff Bridges. There has been a considerable amount of debate, controversies and conflicting stories about The Deer Hunter’s production history and I’ll try my best to go over whatever I can find.
Cimino’s direction is beautiful. It showcases the before, during and after of what being in a war can affect a person’s life. Throughout its 3-hour length, we see how our main characters were greatly affected by the Vietnam War after being there to serve their country. Writing the film was a challenge for Cimino, since he had to fire co-writer Deric Washburn during location scouting. He was eventually given screenwriting credits by producer Michael Deeley, while Cimino was uncredited -- though he was credited among the other writers when it got a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the Oscars. The story behind the film’s screenplay differs between claims from Cimino and Washburn. 
Cimino revised the script and added elements of Russian roulette into the story, something that would generate controversy from many people. This was criticized as being both contrived and unrealistic since in actuality, there has been NO documented evidence of Russian roulette being used in the Vietnam War. According to AP (Associated Press) reporter Peter Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the war, he wrote this in the LA Times:
“In its 20 years of war, there was not a single recorded case of Russian roulette… the central metaphor of the movie is simply a bloody lie.”
Later on, Cimino countered that the film wasn’t political, polemical, literally accurate, or posturing for any specific point of view. Despite that, he also claimed that he had news clippings from Singapore that allegedly confirmed that Russian roulette was used in the Vietnam War, and did not specify which article said that. Some critics, including Roger Ebert, as well as some of the cast and crew, had come forward to defend Cimino’s claims, although some weren’t fully convinced with the stuff that he said was true or not. What makes this situation more complicated was that Cimino frequently referred the picture as an autobiographical or “personal” film, and later investigations revealed many inaccuracies in his accounts and reported background.
On top of that, the ending had caused a heated debate among critics following its theatrical release, and it would soon raise the question of whether the ending was -- ironically or not, as a “critique of patriotism or a paean to it.” I’m not fully convinced that Cimino tried to turn down claims that The Deer Hunter was a political film. However, in a 2007 interview with Cimino that I watched a few minutes ago (as of me writing this), he spoke of his intentions for this scene:
“The ending is really, not meant to be so much a statement of patriotism, but a statement of communion. When people are in trouble, as they are when they're very troubled and sick inside, spiritually very sick, they need, sometimes to do something together. In this case it's make a sound. And they sing that song because it's a song that every American child knows by heart, because you're taught it in school. Everybody knows the words of ""God Bless America,"" and so it's a communal sound, and they begin to sing the one song they all know from grade school on. And you never forget those words as long as you live. And so they sing... the one song they happen to know happens to be ""God Bless America,"" and it reunites them as a family. It becomes a family communion. Instead of a Last Supper, it becomes a first breakfast, if you will, of a new family. It is breakfast that they're eating. It's not the Last Supper, it's the first breakfast.""
Again, I am not fully convinced that Cimino’s statements and alleged claims were true or not, considering that his career unfortunately took a dark downfall following Heaven’s Gate, a 3-hour Western epic that would be his next project, originally considered as one of the worst films ever made due to its notoriously controversial production history. I may wanna check that out someday but for now, let’s continue on with this.
The cast of The Deer Hunter is pretty stacked, with performances from Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, and a young Meryl Streep early in her career, having starred in Julia the previous year. All five gave out incredible performances here, with Streep receiving her first Best Actress nomination and De Niro receiving his second Best Actor nod and third overall Oscar nomination, having previously been nominated in the former for Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, and previously winning in the Best Supporting Actor category for The Godfather Part II, while Walken won for supporting actor, and he deserved it.
Now… the technical aspects are incredible. The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is beautiful and well-done, while Stanley Myers’ score is also really good. John Williams apparently did the film’s main theme, which I’m really surprised by, considering that he didn’t do the main score. Would it be more cool for the latter to do the score instead of Myers? Maybe, but he probably wouldn’t be interested even if he could. Anyway…
The Deer Hunter dives deep into mature themes such as friendship, survival and the psychological impact of war. Friendship plays a key role in the first two hours of the film, showcasing how the three main characters -- Nick, Steven and Mike -- always tried to stick together even during the war. The theme of survival plays a major part in the second act, showing how even when they’re forced by members of the Viet Cong to play a deadly game of Russian roulette, they always try to survive even in the harshest conditions of the Vietnam War. By the third and final act, the film goes really deep into the psychological impact of the three protagonists caused by the Vietnam War, and portrays the trauma, physical injuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder that they have to go through.
Alongside that, The Deer Hunter also exposes the atrocities of combat and how it can have a great impact on the human mind. Nick, Walken’s character, was the most vulnerable to the horrors of war, and left him so traumatized that he couldn’t even recognize Mike, and by time the final 10 minutes begin, it’s really devastating because he ends up taking his own life by falling victim to Russian roulette, and it shows how being forced to take part in the game by members of the Viet Cong had severely damaged his mentality. Although the Russian roulette elements of the movie still remain somewhat controversial, it’s no surprise that Walken’s final scene in the film is shatteringly devastating, solidifying this as one of his finest performances in his career.
I would like to mention that the first hour of the film is like a mirror image of The Godfather’s opening scene, where it takes place at a wedding while viewers are introduced the characters. Yeah, these two movies are VERY different but it’s crazy to think of that, considering that this film takes an hour to introduce its characters before they go to Vietnam. The deer seen throughout the film can be represented as a challenge for a prize, and it imbodies the innocence of Nick’s pre-war life that he never got back. From part of an essay that I read, the film can also be seen as an angelic allegory. Mike displays ""powers"" that are parallel to biblical angels. His lack of any religious reverence as well as divine self-perception would soon lead to a metaphorical fall in Vietnam.
I noticed that whenever Nick survives games of Russian roulette, he believes himself to be God, and feels like he’s invincible and would seem like he wouldn’t actually fire a bullet up until his inevitable death. Also from this same essay that I read, Nick is an allegorical symbol for imperiled humanity in need of salvation, thought it would need more explanation to make more sense. The Deer Hunter also serves as a theological statement about the problem of violence towards humanity and the necessity for hope in God, especially when Mike is completely unable to save Nick from taking his own life right in front of him, and the fact that he couldn't recognize his friend until his final moments.
Although its historical inaccuracies are still a hot for this movie, The Deer Hunter is easily Cimino’s best film and one of the most important in the war genre, especially since it was one of the first to depict the Vietnam War -- which ended three years prior to its LA premiere. I’m surprised that some people today don’t like it. Whether you do like it or not, it’s completely okay with me. We all have different opinions.

It’s subtle foreshadowing like this which makes me smile.
The deer hunting scenes of this film utilises Chekhov’s Gun quite literally because they are in no way a waste. We are told in the beginning “you only need one shot”.
As time progresses with several games of Russian Roulette I realised what this meant, and low and behold, it comes full circle.

"It's fascinating that this film was widely endorsed while ""Heaven's Gate"" was condemned when they seem so similar. They're both huge, unruly epics that don't succeed in everything they do, but do so much that they succeed more often than they fail. Both films seem to me to work better if you stand a few yards back from them and take in the big picture than if you focus on the details.
Did the Viet Cong ever force American soldiers to play Russian roulette? I highly doubt it, but does that really matter? Russian roulette is a metaphor for the capricious destruction of war, and this isn't claiming to be a documentary about the Vietnam War. The metaphor fundamentally works in this story, especially in the way it ties back to hunting and the way the impact of the war differs between Robert De Niro's and Christopher Walken's characters.
I gather a fair number of critics did see the similarity since after the near universal rejection of ""Heaven's Gate"", many backpedaled on this film. I think it should have lead them to be more circumspect about their rejection of ""Heaven's Gate"".
Anyway ... I don't see this as a film that's really about the war itself. It's about how that war and the way it shattered the fabric of American society impacted the kind of Americans who weren't really on any particular side of the political conflict. People in communities that were largely held together by rituals like the opening wedding sequence and who's ideals centered around their philosophy of hunting. It's about how they might rebuild after their community is shattered by violence and loss. That it largely succeeds at doing this across such a huge, three hour canvas is ... impressive.",4.5

The long wedding scene and the slow build-up in the first hour made it hard for me to stay engaged. The transition to Vietnam felt quite abrupt, not quite connecting the dots for me. While the movie aimed to build relationships within the group, I struggled to feel that connection. Despite understanding its hype, this film didn’t hold its water for me.
All though I do want to add that the Russian roulette scenes are the highlight of the movie and it was the only thing that’s stopping me from disliking this movie, it was beautifully crafted. The last act was incredibly awful in so many ways.",2.5
"Great in that it stands out from its Best Picture winning peers in its much darker tone. Not as great in that it is very similar to its peers in its unnecessarily long run-time. However, the setting and great cast/performances make this extended time not as frustrating as it may be have been in many other films like it. And of course I would be remiss not to mention how amazing Christopher Walken is in this, fantastic stuff from him.",3.5
"When it comes to famous films Deer Hunter always seemed a bit under the radar to me, maybe it’s because I’m so young it’s not really mentioned like it was when it released, but Dinero’s filmography is usually referenced in the light of Scorsese and The Godfather and I just never hear anyone mention how incredible this movie is. 
The Deer Hunter is pretty much a masterpiece it’s not quite there, it’s very close, I’m not even sure what it is exactly, but the ending could’ve been better to a degree, but with that said it was still one of the most impactful movies I have seen in awhile. The meandering hangout vibes was excellently executed along with getting us to really understand the characters, the town and how they relate to America in that particular time. It was simultaneously a great character film that was also able to comment on the horrors of Vietnam, not only what it did to the people of Vietnam but to the troops who were sent there on our side by our misguided government. 
The deer Hunter shows the complexity of how war affects the world on a micro and macro level while also making time for interpersonal dynamics to unfold between our characters in a way that really carries the film with this incredible cast. Robert Dinero, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken. Honestly can’t get much better than that. All of them give really special yet underrated performances.

The first roulette scene was one of the most harrowing sequences in a film I’ve seen for some time, I’ll always remember that along with this film’s heartbreaking ending. Just Loved the atmosphere and the story a lot, wish more films were made like this.",4.5
"I think this is the only notable Vietnam film I hadn’t seen even though I’ve had it on my watchlist for years. A 3 hour run time is enough to turn me off to any movie no matter how high the praise (still never seen Titanic for the same reason). I honestly didn’t have a hard time getting through this one, though. The first hour leading up to the war scenes was still a lot of fun, which centered around a group of good friends getting absolutely annihilated every waking moment they weren’t at work. The second act followed 3 of those friends in Vietnam and the hell they encountered while they were there. Some of those moments were seriously anxiety-provoking which I didn’t expect going into this. 
I walked away really enjoying this one and understand why it’s so highly regarded in the war movie genre. This might have been scored a half star higher, but they were drunkenly shitting on the Eagles in the first 10 min, so I’m not rounding up. Everyone really hates us, man. 
Closing remarks:
- Young Meryl Streep was kind of a dime. 
- Russian roulette looks fucking electric.",4.0
"Working at the steel mill then going to a best friends wedding then have a boys hunting trip on the mountain then off to the Vietnam war, what a busy weekend. The beginning of this film is busy with lots of folks living contently, while watching I thought this section of the film was overly long but afterwards I was glad that the ecosystem of Clairton, Pennsylvania had a chance to breath before the wonderful hard cut into the cruelty of war.
The set design of the POW shack on the water is great, not only is it unique but it assists in selling the evil, inhumane and disgusting truths of war. This entire scene is iconic. 
The intense forced games of russian roulette, show sadistic captures and their lack of care for life. The fragility of life, the amount of chance at play in life, and ideas of fate are on full display.
Russian Roulette is a jarring contrast to Michaels one shot principle. 
The trauma of war wears heavy on the men. 
Nick ( Christopher Walken) is broken from war and is enraged at the city when he finds an underground group playing Russian roulette as entertainment, he initially shows them how pussy they are in comparison to the traumas he endured but this trauma breaks him, leaving him a cold shell of his former self. 
The return home is harsh, nothing is the same as before. The image of Michaels home decorated with welcome home banners feels cold and a dejected, Michael chooses to isolate himself from the celebration. 
After Michael continues with much toil and trouble trying to reconnect the group back home, we are left with poor results everyone is still trying their best regardless of the underlying sense of pain, regret and broken sprits. 
The entire cast and their characters, the earned runtime, the cinematography, the mountain, the locations and wardrobe choices, the score, the metaphors of life and death, The Deer Hunter contains many elements I throughly enjoyed.",5.0

"""The Deer Hunter"" achieves the rare feat of being a three hour film that doesn't feel bloated and self-indulgent, which is especially impressive given that, unlike Michael Cimino's decidedly chubby ""Heaven's Gate"", it's not a epic. Besides a few scenes in Vietnam, the film feels very intimate, a feeling intensified by the fact that it's the unshowy home life in the Pennsylvanian steel town which is at the centre, the heart, of the movie. And none of those early pre-war scenes outstay their welcome, or feel surplus to the story's requirements. It's the tangible sense of these people's ordinary humdrum lives that makes the rupture caused by the war feel so painfully tragic. That and the exquisite Deer Hunter theme as played by John Williams, which on its own is enough to reduce grown steel workers to tears.
Just as with Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" and Jake La Motta in ""Raging Bull"", Robert De Niro proves that he's at his most affecting and powerful when playing characters not entirely unlike himself: shy, awkward, introverted, largely inarticulate. What's most impressive here is that Michael is the character through whose eyes we see most of the film, and yet De Niro doesn't let us inside his head much more than he does his supposed friends. He remains enigmatic, someone whose personality the viewer has to piece together from fragmentary moments, gestures, looks. An exceptional performance in one of the great films.",5.0
"The Deer Hunter (1978) (#79 on AFI's 100 Best Films of 100 Years list): 4 out of 5 stars - Finally, a film worthy of this list! Christopher Walkin shows his gifted acting ability as a 29-year-old in this hard hitting, gripping war drama. DeNiro is good, but it's Walken who steals the show and puts it on his back.
My only complaint about this film is that some scenes simply drag on too long. The opening wedding scene, while fantastic, went on for 45 minutes. They could have easily cut it to 20, 30 tops!
This film is gorgeously shot, from beginning to end. The middle portion in Vietnam is some of the best drama ever put on film and keeps you gripped tightly to your seat. Certainly deserving of being considered one of the all time greats and probably in the top 5 greatest war films of all time. Another one that I hadn't seen that I should have by now.",4.0

Meryl Streep and Robert de niro were great, as well as Christopher walken. the ending really took me by surprise. it was really abrupt and I think they could have ended it earlier or at a more mellow moment. I felt myself getting emotional a lot about John Cazale. I'm happy to have seen all of his films now but everything with him in this movie and Meryl Streep is very bittersweet",4.0
"One of the greatest films to look at the effects of the Vietnam War. It shows it in three installments. The first part looks at a group of friends in a small steel town in Pennsylvania before heading off to War.

"B—
Although The Deer Hunter features flashes of well-balanced storytelling, it is profoundly inattentive. Following several buddies who volunteer and suffer through the Vietnam war, the story's beginning is comprised of a protracted wedding ceremony. Despite constituting an hour of the runtime, exchanges are peppered so abruptly amongst relentless celebration that their significance is easily forgotten. On the other hand, the trio's experiences in Vietnam are exceptional, using overcrowded setpieces, hysterical acting and incessant close-ups to produce immense claustrophobia. Alas, the final third unravels the second act's raw authenticity with thematic confusion, especially in an ending that laughably implements 'God Bless America'. In spite of claims that ""The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam"", it then seems surreal that the Russian roulette sequence evidently symbolises the historical conflict's arbitrary and unnecessary violence.",2.5
"This hit me a lot harder than I was expecting it too. Deer Hunter is a very well put together movie seeing as it is perfectly structured in my eyes. There are 3 parts to this film. We spend the first hour of Deer Hunter getting to know the characters and then we see them in the Vietnam war. After that, the rest of the movie is devoted to showing the effects of the Vietnam war on the characters and how it changes them. The whole cast gave great performances and the script itself is amazing.",5.0

"The Deer Hunter suffers under the weight of wanting. I want to like this so much more than I do, but I just can't love it. There are huge pacing flaws, plot threads that are left entirely unexplained, and a historically non-factual and damaging representation of the Vietnamese. Yet the base interpretation surrounding the scares of war and how it tear about humanity and individuals to levels that make us unrecognizable, paired with the undeniable powerhouse performances, makes it impossible for me to not respect the hell out of this feature.
This movie is too damn long. It does not earn this three hour run time. The biggest eye sore in the regard is the entire first act, and the wedding in particular. The wedding from The Godfather, this is not. The Godfather uses it's opening act wedding to establish relationship, character traits, story threads, and so much more. Here? There are no substantial plot threads. All of the interesting character work is actually in the bachelor party the night before, or the hunting trip after the fact. Everything that's accomplished in the wedding could've been wrapped up in five to 10 minutes, tops. But combined with the bachelor party and the hunting trip, this first act lasts for an hour and 10 minutes. that's a long time to build up going to Vietnam in your Vietnam War movie. As much as I love the song, I really didn't need all of these scenes so we could here ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You (I Love You, Baby)"" not once, but twice. Heath Ledger did it better than Christopher Walken anyway.
But these pacing issue string throughout the whole movie. There are plenty of scenes that could've been trimmed back, or cut out entirely. But it's all the more egregious when the second act in Vietnam goes by in a black, with minor to no explanations on timelines. The How or why are absent a lot of this middle part. How did these friends get separated, how did they find each other? What happened that led them all being deserted in the jungle together? How did they all get saved? How did they not go home at the same time when they were injured, and rescued, at the same time? Outside of the POW sequence, the entire war segment feels flawed. Even within the POW sequence, and the greater Russian Roulette theme, the portrayal of Vietnamese people is not great. This whole macabre scenario is a fabrication. There is no documented evidence of the Vietnamese, soldiers or their culture at large, forcing Americans/POW endure these torturous Russian Roulette games. This grotesque third world portrayal of the culture is damaging.
But with all of that said, damn the thematic work being accomplished here is powerful. The performances are stunning, and will knock you on your ass. As much as the Russian Roulette signature through-line of this film may be insensitive, it's a tremendous analogy for the hopelessness, and uselessness of war. Actions are irrelevant, consequences are inevitable. The ravaging of the soul, and the psyche, is eternally irreparable. It's a systematic destruction of the individual, and society at large. There's no grander purpose other than vain pride and ego. It also beautifully ties into the showcasing of how individuals are unique, and break in different ways. Trauma, and PTSD, impact us all in different ways. Whether that's becoming a shell of your former self, turning to drugs and coping mechanisms, or worse. We all yearn for support in stressful times, but what happens when the strain becomes so strong that the mind breaks entirely? The Deer Hunter is a fantastic representation of the fall of man in this regard.
Let's also list the way in which this is great. John Savage, John Cazale (in, sadly, his final film), Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, and Christopher Walken. Yes, you read that right, I gave Walken top billing. Why? Just watch the scene in which he cracks at the military hospital in Saigon, or his final scene in which he's completely lost himself as a heroine addict and suicide warrior. Walken is mesmerizing and steals every scene he is in; totally deserving of his Oscar. De Niro is of course also terrific. The way he performs throughout the POW sequence is spellbinding. Watching him turn fear into anger as he's slapped across the face, violently screaming as is he's challenging, daring, the bullet in the gun to fire and kill him. Streep is of course a rock. She's vulnerable, but self assured, and it's no wonder why this was the first of her many Oscar nominations in her storied career. In all honesty, there's tremendous acting throughout this movie. A great ensemble performance all around. I just wish the actual ensemble got to bounce off each other more as most scenes in the film devolve to one on one moments. Powerful moments, to be sure, but not as strong as it had the potential to be.
The Deer Hunter is a good film, worthy of its Best Picture win. I respect the hell out of it for so much of what it's saying and doing. I just wish the film was cut back, tightened up, and that the second act in Vietnam as related to the war and the people was handled with more grace. Then this could've been an all-timer for me. As it stands, it's good, and worth of a recommendation, but falling short of greatness.

"An incredible movie at the beautiful Academy Geffen cinema. It sweeps you away into this life -- Cimino might just be the most American of filmmakers since Ford. And nobody loves the immigrant experience in the same way that he does. When you see this and Heaven's Gate... the way he films dance and music and the shared experience - it's breathtaking in its scope and power.
There are such shocking moments in this movie. Scenes that shock the hell out of you even today. Christopher Walken is like some sort of otherworldly presence in this movie. From his little jump/dance over the beer to his harrowing Russian Roulette scene. And that Deniro didn't win anything for his performance is utterly crazy.
Watched after reading the new Cimino biography - the balls on Cimino to push this movie through and change cinema the way he did. An artist with his art all pushing in the right place. Wonderful experience.",5.0

Okay but that wedding looked lit,3.5
"I feel like this film has way too much meandering nonsense to warrant its bloated runtime, but when we get to the Vietnam War scenes, the film really grabs you and forces you to see some terrible shit.
The ending scene between Mike and Nick was heartbreaking to see, but by that point I was sick of the film. It genuinely sits on scenes for way too long, and I tried hard to find the deeper implications but a lot of it felt pointless. Once I got the point of the character-driven scenes, they just kept going on and on and on. The impact of that final scene in Saigon when Nick pulls that trigger on himself is lost on me because of how much it was dragging before that. It's a shame too because I genuinely was shocked by what happened there! Seeing Mike wail as Nick dies in his arms is a heart wrenching moment.
I get that the runtime is supposed to be dedicated to character development, but at a certain point I felt that I understood the idea. These are blue collar guys who have a lot to look forward to in their youthful lives as they settle down in their hometown, but Vietnam is going to destroy all of that. I didn't need a whole hour or so of a wedding where they insult each other, drink beer, and laugh. I got it early on, and wanted the film to move on, and it never did.
Reading other reviews, I can kinda understand how these elongated character scenes build them up, but like I said, at one point does it get overdone? There's only so much casual cursing, drinking, and singing that can be done to tell me these are normal guys who are gonna lose it all for a fucked up war.
The performances across the board were great as expected, but I do feel disappointed. I think cutting an hour from this film is definitely doable, and it would help keep people's attention for longer.
There's also noticeable green screen/blue screen effects in some of the shots and it just pulled me out of the experience. And my god it's glaringly obvious when they just insert Vietnam footage that they clearly didn't shoot.
For now, Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket hold the crown as the best Vietnam War films I've seen. I get that they aren't the most authentic view of Vietnam, but they capture audience attention and get their ideas and themes across in a way that doesn't feel redundant.

"Yeah, it's undeniably great. A haunting and intense film about the affects of war. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken are brilliant in a cast of perfect performances. It drags a tad in the second half, but that's about it. I loved how this movie took its time in immersing you in these characters and their lives.

Most a második nézésére viszont konkrétan ez az általam teljesen elfeledett eleje tetszett messze a legjobban, ahogy elmerülünk ebben a kisközösségben, az valami egészen csodálatos. A film többi része is erős persze, leszámítva az utolsó jelenetet az énekléssel, amiért levontam egy fél csillagot.",4.0

"Amazing film all around. The emotional impact definitely is at its strongest and it hits you after the credits. This was one film that I needed to check out from the new Hollywood era and I can say it was worth it. The runtime might look daunting to you especially the first 30-45 mins of the film which is the slow paced period but it’s definitely worth your time once the Vietnam sequences and aftermath comes along. The performances are superb from De Niro, Walken, Cazale and Streep. Definitely one of the best films of the 1970s and one of the greatest war films of all time.
I can’t wait to watch more New Hollywood films 🙌🏾",5.0
"Funny that 3 of Michael Cimino’s 7 films have protagonists named Michael, and 3 of those other ones have real people as protagonists. That name haunted this viewing for me, a viewing that more clearly than ever revealed to me what a thorny, unlikable protagonist this film has. Interactions like Michael getting called a control freak and then two seconds later leaving the conversation he’s in the middle of just to open a trunk his friend is trying to open, or staying in a motel to avoid his “friends” celebration for his return, or his suggestion to Nick that they leave Steve behind in Vietnam, or the extent of his advances towards his best friends girlfriend, etc. have a potency to me now that they didn’t before, and paint a painfully vulnerable picture of a person, perhaps the person that made this very film!
The Deer Hunter is obviously an amazing, freewheeling, compassionate and vividly true to life movie, but these days I think special mention needs to go to its finale, which I now think is one of the best in cinema history. Its stubborn refusal to make a definitive or easy statement of itself is what makes it work; its seamless portrayal of communal empathy and pain in a manner so spontaneous that it truly comes alive is what makes it one of a kind.",4.5
"Certainly the most unconventional war movie ever. The film has a wedding scene that’s 40 mins long and then they go Deer Hunting and boom next thing you know they are in a POW camp. Then next thing you know we go back to the hometown. It’s a breath of fresh air. How many war movies do we see the whole basic training part, the first battle scene, the hanging out in Saigon scene. This film has non of that and it’s very bizarre as far as where it decides to focus it’s 3hr run time. I absolutely love the film though. It’s a masterpiece and so hard to watch. It takes an emotional toll.",5.0
"This needed to be as long as it is to establish enough character for us to care as much as we do. The entire wedding sequence establishes so much and not just about each individual, but where they come from, why they make the choices they do and the atmosphere of their small town. I was far into this part, mesmerized by the extravagance of it all, before I realized I must be halfway through the movie. It really goes by fast and nothing is taken for granted. It's heartbreaking for sure. Some of the scenes are so intense they had my heart pounding. And the ending was perfect. I can't really think of any reason why this wouldn't be a 5 for me.",5.0

"*Dans le cadre du Ciné-club Post-Moderne – choix de Pascal Plante
14 août: Introduction & discussion post-séance avec Pascal Plante
Ma bible de cinéma. Cette œuvre colossale de Michael Cimino sur l’avant-pendant-après Guerre du Viêt Nam (la première œuvre cinématographique majeure abordant ce conflit) se targue de réunir l’une des plus incroyables brochettes d’acteurs de la décennie la plus faste du cinéma américain : Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep et John Cazale y sont tous à leur apex. Cimino amalgame les paysages de la Pennsylvanie, de l’Ohio et de la Virginie occidentale pour donner naissance à la ville ouvrière de Clairton, composée majoritairement de sidérurgistes d’origine lituanienne, férus de chasse et de grands espaces, de confession religieuse russe orthodoxe : un portrait atypique de « l’Amérique profonde », si chère au cinéaste, qui nous rappelle, ce faisant, que les États-Unis sont bâtis à la sueur des immigrants… et que ce sont eux, encore et toujours, les victimes absurdes des conflits politiques armés. La ville de Clairton et ses habitants demeurent figés dans le temps, mais les survivants de la Guerre, eux, s’en retrouvent à jamais changés. Jamais un « God Bless America » n’aura été aussi sinistre qu’en épilogue de ce film dévastateur… Revoir The Deer Hunter pour moi, c’est un peu comme retrouver ses vieux amis. Certes, ils ne sont pas exempts de défauts, mais ils vibrent avec tant d’humanité qu’il est impossible de ne pas leur être empathique. Il ne me suffit aujourd’hui que d’entendre quelques notes de guitare classique du thème mythique pour me remuer dans tous mes états. – Pascal Plante

"Michael Cimino sokat emlegetett klasszikusa, a vietnámi poszt-trauma filmek abszolút etalonja. A háború egy Isten háta mögötti iparváros orosz-ukrán negyedéből szedi majdani áldozatait, ahol a céltalan mindennapok elől menekülve három fiatal tróger annak reményében jelentkezik önkéntesnek, hogy valahol máshol még ők is számíthatnak valakinek.
A teljesen átlagos, szürkeségükben is megmosolyogtató figurák életében a háború borzalmai más-más módon csapódnak le, és az amerikai álom cinikus, ám annál realisztikusabb modellje nyer bizonyítást: csak a legkeményebb maradhat talpon, a többiek bukása törvényszerű, és valóban, Michael (Robert DeNiro) nem csak a háborút éli túl erős lélekjelenlétével, hanem saját barátait is - ráadásul még ""a nő"" is az ő karjaiban landol, ám mindebben mégsincs semmi felemelő.

"I was deeply moved by this epic film in many ways. I wouldn't call The Deer Hunter a Vietnam film, and I would hesitate to even call it a war film. More than anything, I saw the film as an exploration of how war affects the lives of people, not just the people that actively participate in the war, but also the people close to them. If you go into this movie thinking it will be a war movie, you'll be disappointed. It's a drama, a flawed drama about flawed people in a flawed town participating in a broken war. I loved every second of it and was captivated profoundly by it. It is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.",5.0

"With gorgeous cinematography, grand production values, and an A+ cast, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a film that's as much about the Vietnam war itself, as the effects on the communities of those who never came back as themselves.
There's one considerable issue with it, and it is the runtime. There's absolutely no reason this film stands 180 minutes long - not when the first half, though enjoyable for what it is, could've been cut down to something between 30 and 50 minutes.
There's a cut somewhere that makes of this the timeless masterpiece it could've been, it's just not the one we got. Still, another classic off from my watchlist.",4.0

"The burdens of friendship
An anti-war film that broke me. Oftentimes called one of the best motion pictures of all times, The Deer Hunter manages to drastically combine a moving story about friends with the psychological consequences of a war. Including a raw strength, always intensely close to the authentic characters, it had me in tears several times while trying to process the bluntness of such writing and filmmaking. 
We see a happy group of friends in a small industrial town with the usual problems a group of friends can have. We hear ""I love you Baby"" at a wedding, we see smiles and joy. A piano and four men dreaming while listening to it. 
Then a cut. 
Next sequence: an exploding village, the slaughter, the terror, the torture, the affection on the friends. We see true loyalty. 
Not just was this one of the most brutal cuts in history of film but it also showed the brachial powerlessness one has in all this madness. Feelings disappear, the friends become silhouettes. 
Without a doubt Robert DeNiros greatest performance along with Once Upon A Time In America. Despite the fact that it was a tragedy I don’t want to go through again, it must be said that it plays wide up there in the list of the best anti war movies. Important classic. 
""God Bless America""",5.0
there's about 45 minutes of Good Movie in this but otherwise yeah it's a movie! I don't think any of it is bad or even necessarily wasteful but even though i'm very aware of all the things this is going for I can't help but feel it's disappointingly surface level and poorly paced. Structurally sound and De Niro and Walken are great (sadly a little let down by the brilliant Cazale's last performance) I just can't think of this as much more than just a resounding Neat.,3.0

This film has been at the top of my watchlist for so long, so I’m happy that the pod forced our hand and made us watch it. The Deer Hunter’s portrayal of PTSD is so real and mellow that it’s impossible to fathom that this came out in the 70’s as it depicts the condition better than films today. On the other hand, the film does exploit and typecasts the Vietnamese as crazy lunatics which has aged extremely poorly. 
The film is a bit too long as there is a good amount of unnecessary fluff (for character development). But I thinking splitting this up in two days made for a much better viewing experience.",3.5

Bobby de Niro’s character is the only one who feels real and even then there’s some questionable moments in his performance.
I don’t get the point of this film, where does deer hunting correlate to Russian roulette in Vietnam. Nothing on the war itself. The whole close knit brotherhood thing that’s going on doesn’t connect on any level. As well as the community they derive from it all just feels pointless. 
I was just so disappointed, I usually enjoy films of this sort but when the characters are bland, the story is aimless and the pacing is so off it’s just not worth watching this film outside of that one scene.

I don’t think there’s a single articulate conversation had in this movie.

The *deer hunting* scenes are actually pretty cool but they collectively comprise about 5 minutes of this painfully, painfully 180 minute film. Oh and also there’s real-life documentary footage from the Fall of Saigon that serves no narrative purpose other than to exploit the raw emotions of its 1978 audience and remind you that Cimino is an Oscar-baiting hack.

"Tre giovani operai (Mike, Nick e Steve) vivono in serenità le loro vite fino all'arrivo della chiamata alle armi in Vietnam. A seguito degli orrori del conflitto, i giovani reduci dalla guerra affrontano le conseguenze psicologiche arrecatogli a seguito della tragica esperienza.
Il genere cinematografico war-movie è contraddistinto da un nutrito numero di capolavori cinematografici, ritenuti tali per la loro capacità di coinvolgere appieno lo spettatore facendolo quasi sentire nel campo di battaglia al fianco dei soldati.
Quest'ultimi vengono spesso ben caratterizzati, ma vi è una pellicola in particolare in cui lo sviluppo dei personaggi rappresenta la punta di diamante di un vero e proprio capolavoro del cinema: ""Il cacciatore"", nonchè il film più celebre del regista Michael Cimino, che firma un'opera sontuosa entrata di diritto tra i migliori film della storia del cinema, e non è per nulla eccessivo definirlo tale, poichè la pellicola eccelle sotto ogni punto di vista, a partire dalla regia di Cimino, per poi passare agli inconfondibili accompagnamenti musicali, per poi passare alle pressocchè perfette interpretazioni dell'intero cast che presenta attori del calibro di Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro e Christopher Walken, premiato con l'oscar alla miglior interpretazione da attore non protagonista. Il film venne premiato con altri 4 oscar: Miglior regia a Micheal Cimino, miglior sonoro, miglior montaggio e l'ambito premio al miglior film.
Con un totale di 5 premi oscar l'opera di Cimino è particolarmente apprezzata tutt'ora, e come tutti i grandi capolavori del cinema anche ""Il cacciatore"" non sente quasi per nulla il peso degli anni, in quanto tratta la tematica della guerra con freddezza e spietato realismo, mostrandone gli orrori.
Bisogna però precisare che ""Il cacciatore"" è un film di guerra atipico, poichè non si focalizza sulla rappresentazione degli scontri a fuoco nei campi di battaglia, ma mette al centro del racconto i soldati ed il mutamento della loro mentalità a seguito degli orribili eventi vissuti nel corso della guerra del Vietnam.
Eventi che vengono rappresentati attraverso una grande potenza visiva ed espressiva, infatti questo lungometraggio presenta una delle scene più intense di sempre, che vede protagonisti Mike (Robert De Niro) e Nick (Christopher Walken) obbligati ad affrontare l'atrocità della roulette russa, cotretti dunque ad affidare le loro vite al fato.
Quella di Micheal Cimino è dunque un'opera monumentale, un vero e proprio capolavoro del cinema che ritrae con estrema lucidità brutalità la guerra, ovvero la più grande assurdità partorita dalla mente umana.",5.0

"I came into this film thinking it would be a film about the Vietnam War, but was surprised by the lack of action and Vietnam, bar a few notable scenes. However, in a way The Deer Hunter is still more about the Vietnam War than so many other films. The Vietnam War isn't just what happened in Vietnam, an important and irrevocable part of it is how America and her people were forever changed, and by showing the before and after Cimino succeeds in illustrating this. I do think this film could have been about 45 minutes shorter, the first hour particularly takes its time. This film has so many great performances and characters but I think my favourite would have to be John Savage's Steven.",3.5

This is a movie of great moments. This is its biggest pro and biggest con. There are iconic and awesome sequences (the wedding in the beginning and all of the Vietnam scenes are stand outs) but there are also multiple times this movie drags which is a shame because the parts where it drags are parts that Cimino could have really done some interesting synthesis of ideas and explore the characters more deeply.

"""All he's got is that stupid gun he carries around like John Wayne."" - Michael Vronsky (Robert De Niro)
The Deer Hunter is the 1978 war drama directed by Michael Cimino. The film stars Robert De Niro, John Cazale, Christopher Walken, John Savage, and Meryl Streep.
Overall: The Deer Hunter is an absolute masterpiece of cinema and one of the best war films ever made. The russian roulette sequence is one of the greatest scenes in film history. It is a marvelous symbol for the war. The game of Russian roulette is dangerous, hard, violent, and random - just like war.

Definitely a film worth checking out down the line.

"A brutal, sometimes tedious experience. Masterfully acted by a powerhouse company, though the film is perhaps too long for it's own good. One of the finer Vietnam pictures, though APOCALYPSE NOW may still be my favorite, mostly as it takes the psychological underpinnings of war in interesting directions.
That being said, the totality of that experience feels truest in THE DEER HUNTER, especially the types of men who actually did serve in Vietnam and how that experience altered them beyond their imagination. Heartbreaking film, also maybe de Niro's top 3 performances??",4.0

sei lá pensando naquela coisa espiritual do deniro caçando e na comparação entre as duas viagens apresentadas no filme sei lá, acaba sendo um negócio quase religioso mesmo, toda a meditação e toda a solidão apresentadas ali... o filme apresenta um holismo inacreditável, também, atrás de toda fábrica tem uma montanha em cada montanha caçadores e ""presas"" e isso é presente no filme inteiro, a cena pro final da televisão e da janela explicita bem isso, é de uma grandiosidade absurda que eu não consigo nem falar sobre direito, impossível

"First I’ll note that I watched this in 20-40 min bursts at the end of my nights during a vacation in Norway. (I’m writing this from Oslo. We move to Stockholm for a couple of days tomorrow before coming home.) Still, I think this was fine: I am capable of breaking up a viewing and still getting it, and it allowed me to take what I was watching and roll it around in my head a bit. Also, watching this in some full 3-hour chore of misery wouldn’t have changed my opinion.
Which is, I found this movie pretentious and mostly artless - a brutal combination. Pretension can be fine if arty; lack of art can be sharp if not pretentious about it. But both? No, thanks. Scenes were either too long or lacked too much; I never felt like anything was quite right. The film is seemingly one idea (Russian roulette) stretched into a three hour movie to say just the most basic ideas of war: brutal, random, effecting, blah blah. DeNiro was great though.

There's just some magic to it I guess.",4.5
"I went into this movie expecting a kick-ass Vietnam War movie, but what I got was something I had never seen before in a film.
The first hour of the film seemed pointless to me, just a group of friends from a little town in Pennsylvania. They work together, they get drunk together, they celebrate together. But the first hour was my highlight for the entire movie, as it portrayed the fact that the people heading to Vietnam were just ordinary joes. They weren’t heroes, they were just ordinary guys with ordinary lives with their own best friends. The film does this so well, and emotional attachment to each and every one of the friends is created just like that. 
The Vietnam scenes shocked me in cinematography, brutality, and realism. And the Russian Roulette aspect highlighted throughout the entire movie was one of the centerpieces. It made your hands sweat, it put you on the edge of your seat, and more importantly, it connected you to every character. 
There is so much to this film that is unique, as it highlights war for what it really is instead of showing war as an opportunity to shoot some people who are in the same scenario as you are in. 
The fact that this film simply didn’t end with the group of friends simply going back home was crucial. Again, this showed the effects of the war on its participants and their family members. The psychological effects set upon the soldiers are especially well done too, and this is showed in Steven wanting to “go home” but then insisting on staying in the US Army hospital after losing three limbs. 
Too many individual foreshadows and quotes stand out to be mentioned, every single one is moving.
This film hit me like no other film I have ever set my eyes upon. To give this movie under four stars is to utterly insult a masterpiece that showed a crucial event that’s brutality is blatantly overlooked.

"VIETNAM’S GATE: REDUX
Michael Cimino knows how to make a long movie (or how to make a movie long)- that’s for sure.
He assembles an amazing cast for his drama on the Vietnam War shortly after the war is over. The acting is very strong (of course, since we have Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, Meryl Streep and John Savage in the mix). The trauma of the hopeful, motivated boys that come back from Nam as broken people…",4.0
"Really, really exhilarating filmmaking. The camera captures so much in that first hour — the molten river flowing on the forge ground, the church spires rising everywhere above the town, the raw dynamics of a group of male friends — some doomed to war, some not — simultaneously eulogized and questioned in every moment with so much skill and sensitivity it kind of takes your breath away.
There’s two ways I can approach what follows,
in the shit, so to speak, and in the aftermath: 

One would be to say that Cimino tips too far into exploitation/action movie territory, stylizing and amplifying the violence in an uncomfortable, sensationalised way when he could have just portrayed the very real horrors that actually took place in the Vietnam war to similar effect.

The other would be to say that Cimino is at that point elevating the film beyond naturalism and taking it into a mythic realm, portraying the real chaos and nihilism of war and the effect it has on the human psyche through an unreal approach.

Either way, this is one of those film bro movies that really is that good.",4.5

"Does a long duration confer importance?
No, but you’d think so here. Nor does it provide much insight despite ample opportunity.
The film seems to have half an envious eye on the scale and structure of The Godfather but still manages to reduce a series of occasionally brilliant vignettes to stranded miniatures in an epic of run-time alone (next stop: Heaven’s Gate).
The allegorical allusions grate, the characterisation is poorly served in the first third, and the early comradeship being split asunder by war is wearisome. You know well enough that the ‘youthful’ joshing machismo will be sent to Hell and tested, come Vietnam. 
Schisms of excellence are not reward enough when you have too much of not a lot.",3.5

"""Fuck it.""
In honour of Mr. Cimino's recent passing, as well as the 4th of July, I feel it's only fitting to watch this film today. I've been meaning to watch it for probably months at this point, but for one reason or another I kept putting it off. I wish that I could've seen a Cimino film while he was still alive, but I suppose it's better late than never.
This film is like some kind of tribute to 70's Coppola. Vietnam, De Niro, Cazale, you've got them all.
In no uncertain terms, this movie reminds me of ""The Neon Demon"", in that it's so much about loss of innocence and subtextually almost has the feeling that this is entirely a metaphor for the loss of virginity. In killing the deer, penetrating flesh with phallic-shaped bullets, and forcing the innocence of the beast to cease to exist. And this being the first time, of course, there's blood. Once the act is finished, you change forever, there's no turning back, very similar to our characters after their experience. Even the amount of time dedicated to the initial war scenes, and how soon it happens after the wedding, makes it almost seem like it's a single night spent consummating the marriage. There are some other minor connections that were made, but I think I've made my point. I don't know if it was intentional or not, if maybe this is a coincidence made entirely because of human civilization being so entirely driven by sex and the similarities appear everywhere, or what, but it sure seemed that way to me. ""They'll throw you in the pit"", after all.
Though the third act drags a little, this is 3 hours that really doesn't feel much like it at all.

"wow i'm writing another long review about the deer hunter who would've guessed.
the thing is i will never run out of things to say about this movie and genuinely if you bring it up i could talk about it for hours lmao. and none of the reviews i've written about this even scrape the surface of the thoughts and feelings i have for this movie- i can guarantee this one will not either. and it's interesting bc i find myself torn now between writing an analytical review where i explain some of my thoughts or talking about just how much i adore this movie and how much it means to me. i love so many films but there's literally none of them that could surpass the way i feel about this one on so many levels. it is so so meaningful and personal to me. so i'm gonna try to do a bit of both. 
i think on a craft level i love how this harkens back to older hollywood epics and directors like david lean with its length and the amount of time it encompasses. there's something so deeply satisfying about watching a film this long that, in my opinion, is completely justified in its length. after watching it, you truly feel like you've experienced a rich and layered story. i also love how completely 70s it is in its themes and the topics it chooses to focus on such as masculinity and the complexity of relationships. while the vietnam war is pivotal to the events of this movie, it is not really a war movie at all nor does it try to be anything like other war films. to me i think it's really a film about love and trauma and violence and the experience of living in small towns where everyone is somewhat intertwined and overlapped with each other. and yes i do think understanding the queerness of the film is vital to understanding the film as a whole and mike's character development throughout in particular, how he relates to his feelings and how he resigns himself to give up his repression for nick, even if by the time he does so, nick no longer feels worthy of that love himself. i could literally go on forever about this topic and why queerness is so central to this film, both in terms of sexuality as a whole and gender roles. 
the visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning and it's really not surprising to know that cimino was a painter before making this. i think the first third does an incredible job establishing the characters and fleshing them out because i am so emotionally attached to all of them, and they all have such detail and nuance in their personalities and development. it's these small things adding up that really make the movie so vivid, captivating
and distinct. i mean i could easily write multiple paragraphs about just this topic alone. to isolate one tiny example of this, i wanna point out the scene where linda is crying at work and mike totally fails at connecting with her or making her feel better because he tries to comfort her like he would comfort nick rather than just letting her feel sad alone which is what she wants. linda is a lot like mike and they both know logically that neither of them would want to be comforted like nick would. they both know what mike is trying to do and that it's not gonna work. 
obviously this film is so unbelievably devastating and heartbreaking but it's also so beautiful and emotionally resonant for me. i think the recurring theme of this review is just that any given element of this film is something i could write an outlandishly long review on all by itself. but that the emotions and deep love i feel for this film ultimately eclipses all of that and is the most crucial thing to me. there's really nothing like this film for me, not even close, and to me it's the biggest example of how art has been so significant to my life. this will not be the last time i write a ridiculously long review for this where i ultimately only get a few points across of what i'm feeling. so i guess i will end this with some random miscellaneous thoughts:
-criterion WHEN! seriously i know they could make such a beautiful cover for this! 
-john cazale is amazing here and somehow manages to play such a fascinating and distinct character with very little screen time. 
-i am constantly thinking about the fact that this movie was made by a trans person. makes so much sense in a way that i couldn't even begin to fully examine in one paragraph. 
-the costume design in this movie is so purposeful and specific for each character. even the use of hats and hairstyles can tell you so much about their demeanor and temperament.

Didn’t feel the runtime at all with “The Deer Hunter”. it does a perfect job at getting you attached to these characters with the first act and has a very great home feeling too it.

"Absolutely has the scope and ambition of a great movie, but that's not the same thing as being a great movie. Not to say it isn't a good one: it looks terrific, the cast is uniformly strong, there are effective emotional passages, and it is entertaining throughout.
On the other hand: for something so intensely self-serious its themes can be heavy-handed and some of the plotting is fucking ludicrous*; its depiction of Vietnam and of the war is pretty racist**; the movie's deep commitment to trying to create a detailed, authentic portrayal of working class America in its extremely long opening act is undercut by casting a bunch of polished Hollywood actors; there's a tension between that desire for realism and its propensity as it goes along to present a more heightened reality, even going into full-on genre movie mode in places***.

*I last saw this as a teenager, and it's weird how I just sort of accepted the idea that the protagonists are forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors, and then later one of them just sort stumbles upon an underground Russian Roulette ring and becomes embroiled in it, as a normal, if tragic, thing that could happen to someone in real life
**I don't think they mean it, exactly, but it's hard not to read the movie's antiwar message as ""war is bad because Vietnam is a hellhole and the enemy soldiers were scary monsters who were intensely cruel to the innocent American troops""
*** Which it does a good job of: the war sequence, my misgivings about the politics aside, is thrilling, and it turns into an effectively moody noir during the last stretch",3.5

"I've been working my way through the AFI100, starting at #100 and working down. So far, this has been the third Vietnam War film on the list (alongside Platoon and M*A*S*H), and they've all been so different. This is my favorite yet.
I used to live in a grey, down-on-its-luck, Polish-founded, Rust Belt city, just a couple blocks from the Polish-speaking Catholic church at the center of town. My best friend was the son of Polish immigrants in another Rust Belt city and he was raised in Catholic orthodoxy. While the parallels aren't exact, this struck a chord with me from the opening scene.
It's gorgeous in every way - the cinematography, the coloring, the light quality, the film stock. I was particularly impressed by the detail to mise-en-scene in every scene, and loved the long shots and slow push-ins. The wedding scene is almost the first 1/3 of the movie - which is such a strange choice - but it works, and it's so well done.

Absolutely fucking bleak. One of those films that leaves me feeling nothing but anger and an extremely deep sorrow. While I take issue with the way this film is solely focused on the impact The Vietnam War had on white American dudes, and the ways in which that subsequently dehumanizes every single Vietnamese character, I have to admit how much of a good film this is. Top-tier masterpiece level acting, writing, cinematography, editing, directing. You name it. The way time passes in his fascinates me. One moment you’re in the bar drinking with your buddies and the next you’re watching women and children get blown up in a rainforest. And the ways the final act portrays PTSD destroyed me. While the trauma of these characters doesn’t even slightly resemble my own, the way their lives are impacted are identical. How concerned everyone is about you at first, but then how they all drift away when they see how fucked up you are. Constantly choosing to relive your trauma just because it’s the only thing that feels normal. The ending scene is perfect, gave me chills.",5.0

The way it tackles the value of life and the decision making behind pulling the trigger. It really puts into perspective the whole idea of war, more specifically that war. In a way a Russian roulette is the perfect analogy for it.
I always loved the first act, the was Cimino shoots those wedding scenes, it’s hard to believe it isn’t a real wedding.

A lot of what's shown here could be considered cliches of Vietnam war depictions (rooms full of limbless soldiers, city streets crawling with prostitutes and gambling, insanely fucked up gratuitous violence) but de Niros and Walken, with Streep in a strong supporting role, are the lifeblood of this story and the story is really fucking good.",5.0

"It's a secret that was known to some of the greats of the past: how to construct a work of epic grandeur out of the most infinitesimal pieces of poetic interiority. Griffith and Stroheim knew the secret; Walsh knew it, too. The most spectacular moments in The Deer Hunter, those moments which acquire the dimensions of myth, seem to become punctured by the realist principles of Cimino's direction, but this piercing realism is paradoxically what makes those mythopoetic moments feel vivid and mysterious, or that which gives them a latent meaning. 
The immensity of the film, its magnificent poetry and sadness, can be located in the way Cimino manages to forge a precise and meaningful relationship between these aspects of realism and myth. To make cinema in this way does not require an artist with Cimino's degree of ambition, but it does require an artist with an enormous sense of patience, which is probably why Scorsese's similar attempts to create epic cinema feel dead and inert by comparison. With this film, Cimino announces himself as both a genuine heir to the classical greats and a brilliant original: It's not so much a question of influence, more like a passing down of some ecstatic flame, or a knowledge of some dead language.",5.0
"Aquelas cenas no Vietnã, quando o De Niro carrega o amigo mutilado e deixa ele em cima de um carro no meio da multidão, são talvez o mais próximo que tenha visto do Cinema Norte Americano de fato filmar como terceiro mundo.
Uma multidão que anda, mas uma cena que não mexe.
E depois ele volta pra casa, uma cidade industrial que faz fronteira com uma corrente de montanhas digna de cartão postal, e tudo parece que vai se acertar. A música é serena, o movimento é austero, o afeto é verdadeiro. Mas não tem como acertar nada quando tudo ficou para trás.
Como disse nosso saudoso Rian Oliveira, um filme que não liga pra geopolítica, que liga apenas pro indivíduo e pros espaços que ele ocupa, e pro que fazem as elipses na mente dele. Tanto dos que viveram o escuro (vemos apenas um pequeno fragmento, não tem treinamento, não tem troca de tiro, não tem dinâmica coletiva) como dos que esperaram no escuro (sem saber de nada durante e muitas vezes depois).
E talvez a genialidade seja fazer um filme sobre a guerra que não torna tudo um jogo de prazer sádico-realista, mas sim em outro que a vontade é justamente que acabe logo.",4.5

"Pensando muito neste filme desde ontem. Na sensação resultante da totalidade da sua construção. Pois é um filme sobre o seu efeito final, sobre a multiplicação de todos os seus signos, caráteres, paisagens. Um romance histórico, de alguma forma, em que o que os personagens fazem, e o que apreendemos das elipses entre o que vemos, é resultante de uma cultura e de uma natureza: a aberração que é os EUA, feito de imigrantes desterritorializados, mas delirantemente fiéis à sua terra nova, devastada por um inédito modo de capitalismo. A organização sempre aflitiva do espaço das cenas nos EUA gera como resultante lógica o absoluto caos irracional da montagem das cenas no Vietnã. O que resta é o subtexto, o caráter da psicologia dos personagens, que se molda de forma absolutamente coerente ao mundo que os cerca. É essa a tragédia.

Mudando de assunto. Infelizmente a cada ano que passa diminuem as chances - se é que elas sequer existem - de um filme-romance histórico sobre a geração da minha mãe, a geração que hoje tem, ou teria, entre 50 e 60 anos e veio do interior de São Paulo. Nós aprenderíamos muito com uma visão de ambição totalizante e detalhismo psicológico e cultural dessa geração trágica em que muitos se perderam entre um tradicionalismo insuperado e uma liberdade inconclusa.

"Un grupo de amigos pasan juntos el mayor tiempo posible: beben en su bar favorito, salen a cazar y festejan a uno de ellos por su matrimonio. De este pequeño grupo destacan tres hombres, Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken) y Steven (Savage), pues han sido llamados a pelear en Vietnam.
The Deer Hunter es de esas películas que llevaban años en mi watchlist, ahora que tuve la oportunidad de verla quedé realmente decepcionado. Como fan del cine bélico he visto todo tipo de historias, sin embargo, encuentro en esta película una serie de problemas que dan como resultado una propuesta superficial, de duración excesiva y con la que conecté poco.
Sin profundizar en todo lo que no me gustó, menciono algunas situaciones. El resto de los amigos: Stan, John y Axel son irrelevantes; Linda (Meryl Streep) es parte de un triángulo amoroso simplón; las elipsis son abruptos; Los diálogos y las interacciones entre los personajes principales transmiten poco.
Aciertos, pocos. La primera escena de la ruleta rusa; la fotografía, especialmente la que retrata la vida nocturna de Pensilvania y la ambientación de Vietnam.
Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979) y Full Metal Jacket (Stanley Kubrick, 1987), son a mi parecer, películas enormemente mejores para hablar de esta guerra y sus estragos en el soldado estadounidense.

"The Deer Hunter is an exhausting film, not solely because of the overlong runtime but rather because of the shaky pacing, and the unfocused, loose narrative structure. Despite all that, it remains a deeply empathetic and moving piece of cinema, deploying incredible thematic depth and intimate exploration of war from a completely different perspective accompanied with powerful performances of the ensemble cast. The opening hour of the film, containing a 40 mins long wedding sequence serves as an introduction to the characters, we are made aware of their nature and whims along with their insecurities and dilemmas, this joyful sequence does a decent job establishing characters and their relationships however runs for a bit too long. Strongest aspect of the film is the intersecting characters arcs of Mike and Nick played by De Niro and Walken respectively. The war changes both of them into completely different people, witnessing the brutality, violence and hell first-hand engraves an unforgettable trauma in their minds which they seem to never recover from even after returning home. The effects of war are not only present as the brutality on battlefield but they also echoe back home affecting society as a whole, even after the battle ends, it manages to leave never healing mental scars because the war that wages inside every soldier is a never-ending one.",3.5

"Pretty solid Vietnam War flick. De Niro was great and I loved Christopher Walken. Sick young stud in the beginning (who knew) and then he had a great performance as the War changed him. Lots of slow moments to be honest but so many great scenes. Russian Roulette scenes throughout the movie were so well-done, couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Fucked what war does to a man.

"The Deer Hunter is a good movie that focuses on the mental and physical (and even spiritual) consequences that war leaves on people, specially those directly involved into it.

"Damn this was powerfull, i was expecting this to be a standard war film with good acting (De Niro), but man i was wrong (not about De Niro). I absolutley love the fact that they are not in Vietnam before an hour or so has gone by, there is actually enough time to get to know and feel for the characters, unlike most other war films i have seen. 
My only complaint with the movie has to be that the pacing felt a bit slow at times, there are a good amount of things in this movie that deserve a 4/5, but there are also a good amount of things that deserve a 5/5 so therefore my rating is kinda split in the middle of the two.
Probably my favorite thing about this is how the characters deal with everything going on, during and after the war. It’s incredibly sad and horrifying to say the least and my god the acting really made it come through.

"Sei amici si divertono insieme per l'ultima volta prima che Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken) e Steve (Savage) partano per la guerra in Vietnam.
Michael e Nick lavorano in un'acciaieria e sono molto amici, insieme al loro gruppo passano le giornate lavorando, bevendo e andando a caccia di cervi. Michael, però, ha una filosofia: Un solo colpo, se il cervo si salva non si hanno altre opportunità.
Il Cacciatore ha, per la prima ora, una visione allegra e spensierata della vita per poi sprofondare negli orrori provocati psicologicamente e fisicamente dalla guerra.
Un film che parla di guerra senza riprendere le solite scene di guerra.
Un film che parla indirettamente di guerra, raccontandone gli effetti e riassumendo tutto nella scena della roulette russa tra Michael e Nick, costretti a giocare dai Viet Cong per loro puro divertimento.
il punto è proprio racchiuso in questo: la guerra è come giocare con le proprie vite, vite manovrate dai governi. Un gioco che non vede mai un vincitore.
Michael sarà totalmente cambiato al suo ritorno in patria, provato psicologicamente farà di tutto per salvare il suo amico Nick che ha perso totalmente la testa dopo l'esperienza della roulette.
Steve, al contrario di Nick, è l'esempio degli effetti che la guerra ha sul corpo, ormai costretto alla sedia a rotelle.
Il vero cambiamento avviene quando Michael torna a caccia e sbaglia deliberatamente il colpo, lasciando vivere il cervo. Non vuole più togliere vite, non è più capace dopo gli orrori vissuti.
In tutto questo caos la vera protagonista è l'amicizia, l'amicizia che, nonostante il crudo finale, non smette mai di esistere. L'amicizia che è l'unica arma rimasta nelle mani dei tre veterani e degli altri tre amici che hanno subito il cambiamento.
The Deer Hunter è un capolavoro sia dal punto di vista del cast, sia della trama. Le interpretazioni di De Niro e Walken sono al limite del reale, tra le migliori in assoluto. Lo sviluppo dei tempi del film rende ancora più apprezzabile il cambiamento, la morale.
Spezzare il film in due parti, prima simpatica e poi tragica, rende significativa la rottura psicologica che avviene nei personaggi.
Importante la firma riflessiva che da Cimino, un film di guerra puro e concreto, diverso dagli altri ma efficace allo stesso modo, dieci e lode.",5.0

The Deer Hunter (1978)
🏆94%
For some reason, I thought this movie came out in 1974. Robert De Niro was in the early stages of his career, and I thought it came out around the same time as The Godfather: Part II. Still, I was intrigued to check this movie out. What I got was a little different than I expected.
The reason why I docked points off of the movie is because the footage from the movie looked blurry and grainy. I don't know if the movie always looks like this, or if it was the low quality of the platform I watched it on (I did not pirate it). Regardless, it was distracting. Also, the middle portion of the movie did not hook me as much as the beginning and end. However, the rest of the movie is incredible. The story is fascinating. It is a deep delve into the psyche of how events can change people. Michael goes through a change and notices the world around him change. While I did really like the beginning, when the movie was set up, I thought the 2nd half was superior to the first half. When Michael returned home, I was invested in the scenes and there are some deep emotional moments. The characters are all well developed. I like Michael's arc of getting involved in war and how it affects his world. I really like his interactions with the other characters, such as Steven and Linda. I especially like the relationship with Linda. Linda herself is a great character who is kind and helps Michael improve and readjust to society. Steven is interesting, as he gets married, then loses his legs when Michael returns home. Seeing Steven in a wheelchair is pretty upsetting. Nick is the most complex character of the movie. He starts out buddy buddy with Michael, but then, is involved in an intense climax. The Russian Roulette game between Michael and Nick is intense because Nick does not remember Michael, and Michael is desperate to help Nick regain his memory. That just makes Nick's death all the more sadder, as he loses the game of Russian Roulette. The acting is phenomenal across the board. It is weird seeing a younger Meryl Streep, but she crushes it, along with Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and everyone else.
The Deer Hunter is less action packed and more dramatic. However, it has a great story, memorable characters, and gut-wrenching emotional moments. I definitely recommend this movie. It is a great watch and will leave an impact on you.

"I went into The Deer Hunter with pretty high expectations, and I ultimately came out fairly disappointed. I understood what the film was trying to convey (impact of war on soldiers, in this case through the Vietnam War), but it fell flat due to the underdeveloped, one-dimensional characters and needlessly-bloated length.

The first hour of this movie is a long wedding used as setup, and that itself is nothing bad if handled well. However, in this film, the characters are barely different from one another and just have nothing about them that's particularly interesting. Plus, the sequence goes on way longer than it needs to be; them yelling F-bombs, singing, and dancing repeatedly become meandering real quick. Other scenes that try to give development, like DeNiro complaining about Cazale not having boots or the gang driving off when one of them pees at a tree, fail because they go nowhere and can easily be removed. A truly-masterful film like The Godfather, which also has an opening wedding sequence, would use the wedding to present memorable characters (Don Vito, Michael, Sonny) and develop them, their dynamics, and conflicts (Michael's entire arc, Bonasera repaying Don Vito, Sonny's hot-headedness, War with the Five Families, etc). It does all this and so much more in less than half an hour, but in Deer Hunter, we spend an hour with these characters, yet I still feel like I barely know them.
The middle chunk set in Vietnam is mixed for me because it is the best part of the film, but because the characters were barely given development before, I don't really care about them. As a result, even the famous Russian Roulette scene, which is considered to be one of the best scenes in film, barely did anything for me. I barely felt tension because I didn't care much about what would happen to these characters. Without that necessary drama, it just feels hollow. Plus, if the film wanted to touch upon how war changes people, maybe show the characters gradually change so we can directly see what war did to them and why they are so different (Apocalypse Now, for instance, shows the gradual loss of humanity throughout due to war such that we can understand Colonel Kurtz). Instead, all that development is done off-screen, and we're thrust into Russian Roulette with barely any set-up.
Slight Spoilers in this Paragraph
The third act has the soldiers returning and everything being different for them, which is, again, a good idea, but it has poor execution. For one, DeNiro's character barely feels different when he comes back, aside from not shooting the deer. He seemed like he was very different in Vietnam during the Russian Roulette, but when he comes back, he just feels like the same guy as he's catching up with everyone. Also, that love triangle was really useless, especially since Christopher Walken's character doesn't even see Meryl Streep's character again. The romance and even Meryl Streep's character could easily be removed with barely anything changing. Lastly, when DeNiro faces off against Walken for the last Russian Roulette scene, I wish we saw how/why it seemed like their characters switched from when they were in Vietnam. Again, it appears the development is shown off-screen, which is just so infuritating. The film albeit ends on a poignant, ironic note of praising America despite how much it damaged them.

Overall, I was pretty let-down with this film; I got nothing out of it from a thematic standpoint despite its intentions. I will say that it does have beautiful cinematography, an excellent musical theme, great performances, and a few Russian Roulette scenes were decent. Nevertheless, I can't bring myself to say that I liked The Deer Hunter very much.",2.0

"The theme of the “one shot” is what captivated  me about this film. I took away 3 interpretations for the “one shot” metaphor that reveal themselves in the 3 characters that went to war: Mike, Nick, and Steve. 
Mike saw “one shot” to mean “if you can’t be killed after one shot then were destined to live” as if surviving one shot was the call to pursue a life. In the first Russian Roulette sequence Mike survived the “one shot” and felt he was given the right to live. This idea is reinforced by his eagerness to survive, the line “forget him” when speaking of Steve because Steve was supposed to die by the Roulette “one shot”, and his going home and pursuing Linda. 
Nick saw “one shot” to mean “after being confronted by death (one shot), you’re as good as dead.” In the same Russian Roulette scene Nick also survived but he reacted differently because of his perspective on the “one shot”. Nick stayed back because he was already dead in his mind and the dead don’t have the ability to choose to go home and they don’t have anything to live for. The difference between Nick and Mike’s interpretation of “one shot” is further exemplified in their final Russian Roulette scene where Mike sees hope when Nick remembers “one shot”, whereas Nick saw it as confirmation that he was meant to be dead and made it so. 
The third interpretation is shown through Steve and I think this is the reality of “one shot”. The impact of the Russian Roulette on Steve showed that both Mike and Nick’s interpretations were active at once. Steve was confronted by death and survived it. A part of him did die and was left in Vietnam, which exemplifies Nick’s one shot. Yet he still came home and tries to live a life because he survived like Mike did and was granted the right to live also. Mike understands this as shown in his inability to assimilate back into his old life and community but he doesn’t want to believe it as shown when he seemly misses the deer in his last hunt purposely to reaffirm with himself that his one shot is right and he has was granted life just as that deer was. But Stan kills a deer after taking a billion shots at it which goes completely against what Mike wants to believe and he uncharacteristically (although foreshadowed) lashes out at Stan for challenging those beliefs (just an interpretation of the scene. He lashed out for another reason). Nick also understands that you can still live after confronting death because he sends Steve money so that he can continue his life.

"The acting in this movie is top notch. One of the ""Must See"" movies of the 70's.",4.5
"One of those films that is great while you’re watching it, but then reaches a completely new level once it finishes. It’s three hours long, which can be daunting for some people, but I encourage you to watch it because you won’t regret it. 
At first glance, it seems like just another film about the Vietnam war. However, as you watch it, you realise the war is more like a backdrop and the story is a lot more intricate. 
Pretty much everything about this film is perfect. The music is so emotional and well done, the pacing is basically flawless and the cast is something else: Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken are on another level, but everyone else doesn’t do much worse. Finally, the cinematography is breathtaking at some points; there’s a shot of Robert De Niro hunting a deer (crazy, I know) and he walks past a body of water which creates a reflection of a soldier, mirroring his time in Vietnam. This, and many other shots, are really great. 
The only problem I do have is that I feel like some of the themes aren’t fully fleshed out. It doesn’t take too much away from the experience but I feel like it would be a perfect film otherwise. To be fair though, it would be even longer so I don’t blame them for cutting some stuff out. 
Oh yea and Robert De Niro is naked for like 10 seconds for some reason.

"Finally got around to rewatching this an holy heck am I glad to have done so. When I was younger I remember enjoying it on a surface level whereas watching now I appreciate all of the slow character building, and the amount of subtext that is going into it. It does not give us everything as a viewer. It prefers to play out like an observational documentary in places leaving you to think about the relationships between, Michael, Nicky and Meryl Streep's characters. Heck they are just the A List. The other parts such as Steven add to the tapestry of the film layering to those tortured experiences of the characters. Equally the characters they come back to who just do not seem to understand the experiences they have been through. De Niro's change is the most subtle, but you know there is one even before he shows his own friends the intensities he has been through with their own game of Russian Roulette. Walken's drastic change is all the more impressive. You can see the mental anguish he has almost gone through in between moments that leaves him a shell of himself. These performances are all compellingly rich.
There are moments that get critiqued with the film. On my first watch there were moments that appeared bloated, but when rewatching now that bloat is superficial. On rewatch there is some much to explore some of those most subtle of character moments and changes in characters. I know there are some historical gripes with the films depiction of savagery, but to me it allowed us to get inside the PTSD the three characters are experiencing. The brutality of war and anguish is needed in this film, and it just so happens that Russian Roulette is the shorthand. We can be wary that something like this may not have happened, but still realise that what they have been through is a lot. We only have a sense of foreboding for our three lead actors before our the end of act 1 as our three friends jovially go about talking with the soldier at the bar. When it comes to the controversial Russian Roulette of it all, I'd like to see how else we can get such rich character stories.
Great film, but it is important to note those historical inaccuracies in something so compelling.",5.0
"Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER has long been on my mental ""I know, I know, I need to watch it. I know. I KNOW."" list and I've finally found the right time and mood to take it in.
There are two fundamental truths about the film that co-exist within me:
1) I will probably never watch it again outside re-viewing certain clips and scenes.
2) The amount of skill, talent, and vision contained within 183 minutes staggers me.
The movie was, in general, what I've always expected it to be: an epic wartime actor's showcase about trauma. The few elements that surprised me are the things I love most about it though. I mean, it's super fucking melodramatic and theatrical in its plotting and use of symbolism, metaphor, and elevated reality. The way the story's laid out is rooted much more deeply in the classic stage than it is any sort of contemporary realism. Which is a breath of fresh air for me. And the final scene — my favorite in the whole movie, a rarity for endings — puts everything that came before in a new light, one much more rooted in jet-black irony than I ever would've expected it to be while simultaneously succeeding at a character-based dramatic level. It's dizzyingly beautiful shit.
What a cast and crew. I can hear Martin Scorsese's voice in my head, repeating ""What a picture. What a picture."", which is always a solid sign I watched something important, or cinematically valuable to me in some way.
But yeah, probably won't watch this again. Or at least not for like 12 years.",4.5

He delves in a lot further than just exploring the damage to the individual psyche, but how that can change an entire community and essentially erase a small town’s culture forever.",4.5

Best Picture Winners: 51/94",4.5
"The fortunes of film reception are quite interesting in that Michael Cimino's great flop Heaven's Gate has, for all its flaws, received a greater resurgence, while his great Vietnam War masterpiece The Deer Hunter has received a downgrade in reputation, notwithstanding it seems to be still well-rated. I loved Heaven's Gate, though I do not think it a masterpiece. I think that has earned some well-deserved love, and Charles Elton's recent biography on Michael Cimino is an interesting perspective on a much maligned director and up till now a much maligned film.
But to me there is little doubt that The Deer Hunter is the superior film, and it is to my mind a moving, deep, searing, unfolding, at times very majestic film (especially in the hunting sequences). I wonder if it is now becoming the underrated picture. [Of course, from early on it has received various criticisms for being fascist, racist, pretentious, etc. I don't quite agree with any of these, but I can understand them to some extent.]
The pacing of the film is long for a three-hour drama, and the structure of it is quite clear, both the town, the Vietnam interlude, and the post-Vietnam interlude. It has a certain clarity that allows for various complexities, oscillations, turns, moments, scenes of dramatic impact. I find the wedding scene long enough for the kind of film The Deer Hunter is, and the deer hunting sequences and the Russian roulette sequences are as brilliantly timed and directed as they were back in the day.
Of course, ever since The Deer Hunter we have had plenty of searing, graphic depictions of war. Apocalypse Now exceeds it in surreal madness, and Full Metal Jacket has a particular cold brilliance in both its halves. But even these films, as they might exceed The Deer Hunter in some way, can't quite, or aren't quite trying to get to the particular mix of Cimino's film.
Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is some of the finest he has ever done, and Michael Cimino's direction has a certain majesty and honesty to it. I like Deric Washburn's script which seems to have been translated well into the film. The acting is very good here, from De Niro, Walken, Cazale, Streep, Savage. Stanley Myers' music is superbly haunting. Peter Zinner's editing is spectacular, especially since he edited the first two Godfather films, and while he should have won an Oscar for editing for those films, he earned, IMO, a well-deserved Oscar here. I think this movie earned the Oscars it got, including Best Picture, though Days of Heaven would have been just as good as a Best Picture win.
The ending of ""God Bless America"", whether ironic, patriotic, or whatnot, does have a certain poignance, especially after all that has come before it.
Roger Ebert in his early review of the film spoke of it this way:
Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" is a three-hour movie in three major movements. It is a progression from a wedding to a funeral. It is the story of a group of friends. It is the record of how the war in Vietnam entered several lives and altered them terribly forever. It is not an anti-war film. It is not a pro-war film. It is one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made.
From what I have seen, some criticisms of the film seem to have wanted the film to be something else. Maybe if it were, it might have done some things better. Maybe it would have been less offensive. But I suspect it might have lost that particular mix of melancholy and searing, harrowing feel that is part of Cimino's film.
Perhaps I was just very receptive, and built my hopes up. But on first view my hopes are satisfied.",5.0

"Is there anybody on Letterboxd who lived in a Pittsburgh steel town during the Vietnam War that can confirm whether or not dudes were this fucking exhaustingly obnoxious? The amount of hollering and grab ass and drunken sing alongs in this honestly just wore me the fuck out. I get that it’s meant to more powerfully delineate the contrast between the life and energy of the first half and the PTSD misery of the second, but come on. I mean Jesus Christ. 
The second half gets more oppressively maudlin than I typically care to partake in and the Walken devolution into high stakes Russian Roullete heavy hitter simply does not play. It comes off as fairly goddamn ridiculous honestly. 
But this is simply too well acted a film to be overly negative toward. All the DiDi Mao shit still packs the same punch it must have 40 years ago when this came out. Anyone who bags on DeNiro can watch that sequence and kindly get fucked. John Savage and Walken are both terrific and Cazale is his typically intriguing slimy, skeletal self. And it can’t be overstated how damn gorgeous Bobby D looks in this. With his crisp, mustacheless beard and various hats. Guy looks like a million bucks, as does the Vilmos  Zsigmond cinematography.

"My first watch, somehow. What a strange film. I have to say I was invested in the characters and I think that's due to the distinct 3-part structure:
Part 1 tells us everything we want to know about the guys, the steel town, their version of male bonding, and why De Niro's Mike will always be a loner. Part 2 drops us in Vietnam - or at least the Cimino version. In Cimino's Vietnam, the Vietnamese are represented as completely deranged and savage (and obsessed with Russian Roulette, I swear if there were any more Russian Roulette in this film it would be called The Roulette Player). He clearly doesn't have much of a budget to show combat or anything nuanced, thus we go straight to some kind of P.O.W. setup with sadistic games. Part 3 is the homecoming and reminded me of The Best Years of Our Lives. There is even a character in that older film who refuses to take his uniform off - or rather doesn't seem to know how to exist in the world in civilian garb. De Niro's Mike never seems to take his off after the war.
Without getting into spoilers, the end kind of loses me. I was so distracted by the obsession with Russian Roulette and its symbolism that much of the plot machinations rang false. Still it's an epic, a big swing, and undoubtedly the Vietnam film that all of America in the late 70s could get behind - not quite ready for what Coppola and Oliver Stone would later show us, but still so deeply traumatized by the experience and the way it fractured our country. A place where ""thank you for your service"" can rest uncomfortably next to ""man, that was fucked up over there"".
A side note on Christopher Walken. In this film, he is one of the most physically beautiful men ever captured on film. He's has Fred Astaire's build, is graceful, but most importantly has an air of eternal innocence about him. This makes his corruption by war the more heartbreaking.",3.5

Expected a genuine masterpiece, and ended up being bored to death for most of the movie.

Then, the Vietnam part and that famous Russian Roulette scene came to raise the interest and save the movie, because after that second act, it’s just boring sh*t after boring sh*t all over again. (Except for the hunting part, and maybe the ending)
And I didn’t fully understand the treatment of the characters psychology, and the actual meaning of that Russian Roulette. (« One shot » ok but...??)

With its reputation preceding it as one of the greatest war films ever, it’s no surprise that The Deer Hunter is a fiercely powerful piece of work, even a whole 44 years after its original release.
With excellent performances from the three leads (De Niro, Walken and Savage), we see the dehumanising effects of war, and the tragic aftermath it leaves behind in civilian life. The Russian Roulette scenes are now infamous, and remain as gripping and disturbing now as they were back then. I gather from other sources that these events are not true to life and did not actually happen during this conflict, but these scenes are still affecting.
The supporting cast (which includes the ever-wonderful Meryl Streep) add some much-needed chemistry to the whole affair.

All around, Deer Hunter is a quintessential anti-war film with an authentic veteran narrative, one of De Niro’s most solid roles, Cazale’s last, and my favorite Meryl Streep performance.

It’s that it all feels so haphazardly stitched together, and even in isolation, the pieces just aren’t that interesting. Close your eyes when Robert De Niro is talking to Meryl Streep after coming home, and it just sounds like the most banal melodrama dialogue.

"Forrest Gump told more truth about the Vietnam experience than The Deer Hunter.
Now before you thrust your six shooter at my head and demand that I pull the trigger, let me explain…
While The Deer Hunter solved the puzzle as to how American cinema would regard the first war that was unquestionably a loss for the home team (as an immense, random, suicidal tragedy only suffered by our boys in uniform), Forrest Gump told us that sure the Vietnam vets had their pain to work through… but in the end, they turned out OK. And this is true - they did. Even the most wounded of the two Lt. Dan was able to buy himself new legs and a bride with all that imperial plunder. Not so for the mopey Pennsylvanian hicks who, in a moment of forced irony, mourn by singing God Bless America to close out this film.
I remember hating this movie watching it for the first time as an 19 year old kid, but of course I would, because it is slow-going and rarely doesn’t end a scene without lingering for a couple seconds. Now as an adult, I can admire how 70’s the filmmaking is - the technical effort from Cimino is first-rate. The acting is top notch, except for how Christopher Walken is miscast (he already looks crazy before he goes to Vietnam) and John Savage (who, in scenes with two of the most legendary actors of all time, only came with two tools, wide eyes and clenched teeth). The script’s dialogue is authentic and has a refreshingly natural sound with its simple language (although it is debatable that fits with how operatic the direction and story are).
I still want to roast the movie for how it found a way to regard Vietnam without necessarily disagreeing with the imperial premise behind it (isn’t losing terrible?). It is still too melodramatic, too insular in its opinion of how those devious French Indochina foreigners ruined the rural American male, too indulgent in its directing by subjecting the audience to a wedding for an eternity with only one quick story set-up (Mike will bring them back), it is relentlessly depressing… but it’s… not as bad as I remembered it being.
But.
I feel like whenever America fucks up bad, we always seem to turn our attention to rural white simpletons as the cause. Electing Trump is said to be their fault, not Democrats who failed to abolish the electoral college even after they were burned by it, or the evidence showing that the wealthy overwhelmingly supported Trump’s candidacy with both money and votes. It’s always these damn bumpkins who go along for the ride - never mind who is driving the big ol' bus of imperialism in the first place.
The core problem of The Deer Hunter is how this could be a story about literally any war - and would be a better story if it was focused on, say, World War 2. Isn’t it more tragic that people were run through World War 2 to come out the other end permanently disabled or psychotic? Everybody is celebrating, except you don’t get your legs back. That was an aspect of The Irishman I appreciated - how it tied Frank Sheeran’s criminality right back to the war worth fighting. Whereas this movie created a weird standard where we are only allowed to cry about the fallen if the war itself is lost. Which of course all of America’s wars of choice are lost from here on - because the real “victory” goes to the .1% of weapon hustlers who profit off them, not to the public. We can still see this toxic attitude towards “America losing” in the Afghanistan pullout that unsurprisingly, all the media already mostly forgot about only a few weeks later despite their universal condemnation of how it doomed Afghan women or something. We are still only allowed to care about victims if it means the wars can keep going, or if they are our own.
This movie figured out how to make an essentially establishment Vietnam movie without being laughed off the screen like John Wayne’s The Green Berets - it cannot be gung-ho, but it can crowd the Vietnamese people off the screen by excessively focusing on our own victimhood, to the point where it is forgotten that it was our luxury to invade in the first place.
To the degree the movie thinks about Vietnam as a people, it is to regard them as suicidal gamblers who leave their women as single mother prostitutes. Hey, maybe this perception of Vietnam is actually why America lost that one? But if America had a different, more realistic idea of Vietnam, they would not have booked a ticket in the first place.
And then we would have been robbed of great war cinema, like Forrest Gump.",2.0
"I vividly remember as a five year old kid, my Dad getting ready to go to the Drive-In with his mates. I asked him what he was seeing and he told me ‘The Deer Hunter’. I had no clue what that was, but asked him the next morning if he liked it. He told me it was as good as anything he had ever seen. No idea why that has stuck with me all these years. But each time I watch this film, that memory pops back into my skull like it was yesterday, despite being over four decades ago….
This is a cinematic triumph. In world building, in character development, in casting, in acting, in the power of a movie to live in your memory long after the credits roll….

"I know parts of this were filmed in the general Pittsburgh area but I never got around to watching it. 
De Niro with the Stillwater outfit, he pulls off blue collar cosplay way better than Damon though. 
Nice seeing Christopher Walkin playing an actual person. I like him amped up but this is great to see. 
The cut from dark bar Frankie Valli to bright morning was perfect. 
The most accurate Western PA (Russian, Slovak, Polish, Czechoslovakian, etc) wedding I’ve ever seen put to film. It also helps that much of the era is perpetually in a state of early 1970s. The idea that people wanted this first hour cut down seems insane to me. 
I didn’t realize John Cazale died so young, what a shame. But the stories of Streep/De Niro fighting to keep him in are nice, it’s a great performance. 
The cut from the piano playing at the bar to Vietnam, brutal. 
The contrast between the camping trips and the little house with the mill looming over it is so stark. The camping trips, even with any drama that happens, feel so relieving like a weight being lifted. 
I can understand how this film could have upset people because of it’s unfair portrayal of the Vietnamese. That being said this film is firmly anti war in my opinion, that doesn’t excuse the portrayals but it does make it a harder movie to pin down because of it. 
The authenticity of Russian Roulette happening doesn’t bother me as much because it’s such a solid metaphor, who cares if those matches actually happened. 
Reading now that the God Bless America scene was interpreted as anti American by the right and too overtly patriotic by the left is very funny. 
Reading about Cimino is funny too because every story is him saying he butted heads with someone and then did all the work himself. Who knows what the actual story is but to see it come up repeatedly made me laugh. 
It’s also ridiculous how hard he tries to sell it as apolitical. I’d love to know if that was actually his stance or if it was a marketing move to say that. It’s politics are muddy and that’s part of what I enjoyed about it but it’s certainly not apolitical. 
As I write this I realize that the first roulette scene with its action hero end sets you up to be caught off guard by the final roulette meet up. You expect your “hero” to save the day somehow but the gut punch of the inevitable ending hits harder because of that previous scene.

I was always scared off by the length of this film but the pacing is actually spot-on. Such an agonising watch.,5.0
"""El cazador"" de Michael Cimino es una película de tres horas en tres grandes movimientos. Es una progresión desde una boda hasta un funeral. Es la historia de un grupo de amigos. Es el registro de cómo la guerra de Vietnam entró en varias vidas y las alteró terriblemente para siempre. No es una película antibélica. No es una película a favor de la guerra. Es una de las películas más impactantes desde el punto de vista emocional. Comienza con hombres trabajando, en el horno de las fábricas de acero de un pueblo en algún lugar de Pensilvania. Suena el claxon, el turno ha terminado, los hombres se dirigen a una taberna para tomar una cerveza. Cantan ""I Love You Bay-bee"" junto con la gramola. Todavía es de día en el último día de sus vidas que les pertenecerá antes de Vietnam.
La película se toma su tiempo con estas escenas iniciales, con la acería y la taberna y, sobre todo, con la boda y la fiesta en el American Legion Hall. Es importante no sólo que conozcamos a los personajes, sino que nos sintamos absorbidos por sus vidas; que los rituales y ritmos de la boda parezcan algo más que simples detalles étnicos. Y lo consigue.
El movimiento inicial se alarga; es como la celebración de la boda en ""El Padrino"" (1972), pero celebrada por gente trabajadora que ha venido a comer, bailar y beber mucho y a desear suerte a los recién casados y a despedirse de los tres jóvenes que se han alistado en el ejército. La fiesta dura lo suficiente como para que se emborrachen todos los que van a hacerlo, y luego los recién casados se van en coche y el resto de los amigos se van a las montañas a cazar algunos ciervos. Se habla de lo que significa disparar a los ciervos: Todavía estamos en un punto en el que disparar a algo se supone que significa algo.
Entonces Vietnam ocupa la pantalla, de repente, con un muro de ruido, y el segundo movimiento de la película trata de las experiencias que tres de los amigos (interpretados por Robert De Niro, John Savage y Christopher Walken) tienen allí. En el centro de la película se encuentra una de las secuencias más espeluznantes jamás creadas en la ficción, cuando los tres son tomados prisioneros y obligados a jugar a la ruleta rusa mientras sus captores apuestan sobre quién se volará, o no, los sesos.
El juego de la ruleta rusa se convierte en el símbolo organizador de la película: Todo lo que se pueda creer sobre el juego, sobre su violencia deliberadamente aleatoria, sobre cómo afecta a la cordura de los hombres obligados a jugarlo, se aplicará a la guerra en su conjunto. Es un símbolo brillante porque, en el contexto de esta historia, hace superflua cualquier declaración ideológica sobre la guerra.
El personaje de De Niro es el que, de alguna manera, encuentra la fuerza para seguir adelante y para que Savage y Walken sigan adelante. Sobrevive al campo de prisioneros y ayuda a los demás. Luego, finalmente, regresa a casa desde Vietnam, rodeado de un silencio que nunca podemos penetrar del todo. Se siente vagamente tocado por el deseo de la chica que más de uno dejó atrás, pero no actúa con decisión. Es un ""héroe"", saludado tímidamente, con torpeza, por la gente del pueblo.
Se demora mucho en ir al hospital de veteranos a visitar a Savage, que ha perdido las piernas. Mientras está allí se entera de que Walken sigue en Vietnam. Le había prometido a Walken que nunca le dejaría en Vietnam. Ambos pensaban, romántica e ingenuamente, en las muertes de los héroes, pero ahora De Niro regresa en un contexto totalmente diferente para recuperar al Walken vivo. La promesa era cosa de adolescentes, pero ya no hay adolescencia cuando De Niro encuentra a Walken todavía en Saigón, jugando a la ruleta rusa profesionalmente.
Más o menos a estas alturas de la crítica es habitual alabar o criticar aquellas partes de una película que parecen merecerlo: los actores, la fotografía, el manejo del material por parte del director. Hay que decir, supongo, que ""El cazador"" dista mucho de ser impecable, que hay momentos en que sus personajes no se comportan de forma convincente, detalles inverosímiles sobre la estancia y el destino de Walken en Vietnam, ambigüedades innecesarias en el personaje de De Niro. También se puede decir que la película contiene actuaciones muy conmovedoras, y que es la mezcla más impresionante de ""taquilla"" y ""arte"" en el cine estadounidense desde ""Bonnie y Clyde"" (1967), ""El Padrino"" (1972) y ""Nashville"" (1975). Todo ese tipo de observaciones se vuelven irrelevantes a medida que se experimenta la película. Te atrapa, te lleva contigo y no te abandona.
Se dice que ""El Cazador"" trata de muchos temas: Sobre la unión masculina, sobre el patriotismo sin sentido, sobre los efectos deshumanizadores de la guerra, sobre la ""mayoría silenciosa"" de Nixon. Trata de cualquiera de esas cosas que uno elija, si lo desea, pero más que nada es una máquina de ficción desgarradoramente eficaz que evoca la agonía de la época de Vietnam.
Si no es abiertamente ""antibélica"", ¿Por qué debería serlo? Diablos, todos estamos en contra de la guerra . . . ahora. En lo que insiste ""El Cazador"" es en que no olvidemos la guerra. Termina con una nota curiosa: el canto de 'God Bless America'. No les diré cómo se llega a ese momento concreto (el desarrollo de los pasajes finales debería ocurrirles como los acontecimientos de la vida), pero sí quiero observar que la letra de ""God Bless America"" nunca me había parecido que contuviera tal infinidad de posibles significados, algunos trágicos, otros indeciblemente tristes, algunos pocos aún desafiantes y esperanzadores.",5.0

"Led effortlessly by Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, 'The Deer Hunter' was a nice surprise to watch. Like 'The Green Mile,' this movie is three hours long but uses its time well. The story never drags, nor does it bore you with what's going on. Furthermore, 'The Deer Hunter' features one of the saddest, keyword: saddest, character arcs I've seen in cinema. Nick (played by Walken) is a beloved character here, and to see him undergo the cruelties alongside his friends Michael and Steven (De Niro and John Savage, respectively). He becomes entranced by the game of Russian roulette, which acts as a vital theme in this movie as the three leading men are metaphorically living their lives with this game. Finally, Stanley Myers' score is fitting and gorgeous to hear. Great job to everyone involved!!",4.0
"The Deer Hunter is a tale of three parts, each seemingly more infernal than the last. 
First we meet a group of 5 friends that share an unbreakable yet shaken bond. Most of people of the small town of Clairton, Pennsylvania are simple blue collar families. When Michael, Steven and Nicky enlist in the Army, they get the gang together for their ritual deer hurting trip, one that was successful but seemed to have a morbid air about it. Once in Vietnam the three quickly find themselves captured and imprisoned by ruthless members of the Vietcong who force them to play deadly games of Russian roulette while they face excruciating conditions. 
Seriously some of the most raw and authentic emotionally charged scenes i may have ever witnessed totally living up to the hype most people built around the film, the second act is an absolute masterpiece even the extended scenes are incredible. Especially John Savage in my opinion quite literally gives more emotion to his character than you’ll ever see. 
Somehow they manage to escape but once the group returns home things turn for the worse, Mike has issues Re assimilating into normal life again, Steven finds his body in disrepair and Nicky has vanished back in Vietnam. Mike not having a great go of it sets off in search of his lost comrade but Nicky has become deranged and no longer in control, which leads to one of the most beautifully shocking moments in cinematic history. 
Christopher Walken was exceptional, an absolute unconscious effort by a living legend. Robert De Niro executes another amazing role giving us a very on point portrayal of the emotions and ptsd many dealt with after Vietnam.",4.5

"ROBERT DeNIRO
Part 3:
Vietnam War
How the fuck is this film so loved?
Bloated as all hell, long for the sake of being long and ultimately uninteresting, this film is a portrait of the oh so evil Vietnamese doing evil things to the oh, so poor, so innocent Americans. Fuck it!
I don't know why, but De Niro got so many turds under his name. He should've known better. Actually, at least he's the one person who did any good for this film, everyone else fucking sucks. This film could've been cut to 90 minutes and it would've been so, so much better. Nothing at all happens during its first hour or so, and if you come at me saying it's supposed to ""introduce the characters"", then I'm gonna have to disagree. Overlong scenes of wedding dances, quick moments (that feel long) focusing on characters that aren't important, and just scenes that feel out of place and heavily disjointed.
When things start happening, it's just... trying to rewrite the United States as the victims, really. Poor Vietnam...
Michael Cimino's pretentious and amateurish direction helped to doom this overrated flick. Can't get the love at all... maybe, just maybe it's a film worth of re-watching in the future, knowing it comes from an one-dimensional point of view. De Niro's performance is still pretty great though, even after I completely lost interest in the story of the three douchebags.

Apart from Analyze This, which was pretty fun and reached its goal of simply being a fun comedy, I guess I picked two of the worse De Niro efforts to begin my marathon with. At least this one still had some rare good moments, opposed to Limitless being complete shit from its very beginning to its very ending.
Maybe it has something to do with politics too, I won't lie. I'm too goddamn tired of politics, because this divisiveness just won't take us nowhere. That being said, I'd still agree a lot more with Serpico exposing why the police force is crappy and should either be remodeled or abolished, opposing The Deer Hunter's point of view of the Americans being the ones that suffered injustice through history.",1.5

"« Aux États-Unis, tout finit par des films. Mais pour Michel Droit, ""Voyage au bout de l'enfer"" est davantage : c'est un évènement qui a valeur d'exorcisme. Il annonce que le peuple américain se réveille de son sommeil suicidaire. » (Titre du Figaro Magazine, 21 avril 1979).
Même si la séquence du mariage est aujourd'hui juger un peu longue, perso je la trouve passionnante. On nous présente les personnages, leurs tourments et un bonheur que l'on sait éphémère. Au loin, la guerre du Vietnam semble déjà présente notamment lorsque Steven, Mike et Nick discutent avec les trois recrues. Privilège d'être appelé, fierté affirmée, mais derrière ces faux-semblants se dissimulent déjà la peur de ne pas revenir. La peur face à l'inconnu. Nous ne sommes pas dans un patriotisme acerbe où personne ne saisit les enjeux de cette guerre. L'action se passe en 1968 et le «mythe» du Vietnam a déjà pris forme. L'Amérique s'enlise et ça commence à se voir. Alors, ce trio rumine et agit même comme des petites frappes devant un béret vert. Comme s'ils souhaitaient prouver leur valeur avant le grand départ. Se rassurer. Puis il y a cette tâche de vin sur la robe de mariée et puis cette dernière scène avant l'enfer. Ce morceau de piano sonne alors comme une oraison funèbre. Pour une fois, tout le monde prend acte de ce départ imminent, matérialisé par une des plus grandes transitions de l'histoire du cinéma. Et ce n'est même pas moi qui le dit mais Philippe Rouyer.
Concernant la guerre, tous les passages sont saisissants. Cimino réussit parfaitement à transmettre rapidement ce sentiment d'horreur et de pertes de repères. À l'époque, ça a beaucoup jasé sur la prétendue véracité de ces fameuses séances de roulettes russe. Cimino disait avoir eu des témoignages qui allaient dans ce sens, d'autres soutiennent le contraire. Avec le recul, « peu importe » puisque Cimino l'a surtout exploité métaphoriquement pour décrire un sentiment de terreur et matérialiser en une poignée de minutes le choc psychologique d'un combat qui dure depuis des années. C'est évidemment une idée de génie. Ce segment est volontairement le plus court pour prendre le temps de revenir sur les conséquences. The Deer Hunter est bien un film-fresque excellement mis en scène et interprété mais surtout immensement bien écrit. On observe donc trois destins brisés : un estropié à vie, un qui sombre dans la folie et l'homme faussement bien. Le destin de Mike est celui le plus répandu dans le ciné américain (The Visitors, Heroes, Taxi Driver, Cutter's Way). Vu qu'aucune blessure visible ne peuvent témoigner des horreurs de la guerre comment faire part de son expérience ? Sur ce sujet, sa relation avec Linda (Meryl Streep) me paraît d'une absolue justesse.
Beaucoup de critiques ont incendié ce film pour son patriotisme lors de sa sortie. Comme si Cimino avait voulu donner « bonne conscience » aux spectateurs Américains. C'est évidemment un contresens lié à cette fin qui nous raconte en réalité la déliquescence totale d'une Amérique dont l'innocence est perdue. L'histoire d'un home-movie (cf Thoret) où l'Amérique profonde ne sait plus réellement vers qui et quoi se tourner. Le seul point où je peux leur donner raison porte sur la représentation manichéenne des Vietnamiens. Sadiques, violents, sans compassion, quasi sans âmes: ils expriment plus que jamais le contexte de production (1977/1978) malgré l'explication possible (en faire une métaphore de la violence et du choc traumatique). Et même ça, à la limite, c'est beau de constater les fragilités d'un film. C'est un défaut qui nous rappelle plus que jamais son contexte et c'est aussi un élément qui est exploité pour fluidifier le récit, accroître l'horreur et nous offrir un troisième segment en tous points sublime sur le plan symbolique.
Plus fort que The Visitors, Coming Home, Go Tell the Spartans, Who'll stop the Rain, Heroes, Cutters Way, Taxi Driver, Birdy, Platoon, ou encorr Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter est définitivement le plus grand film américain sur la guerre du Vietnam.

"(SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTS) 
I wish I liked this a bit more than I do. What’s frustrating about it is that there’s lots of elements that should’ve made this a masterpiece for me. But as it is I just think it’s pretty good. 
The acting here is superb. Robert De Niro gives one of his best and most powerful performances in this. He captures the mentality of someone who’s been damaged by war really beautifully. The same can be said for Christopher Walken who is also fantastic here. Despite her smaller role I also think Meryl Streep is fantastic. I also really like the late John Cazale in it. 
The cinematography is also stunning here. This is a fantastic looking movie throughout. I also really like the soundtrack here too which has a great sense of melancholy to it. 
The writing here is also interesting. I like how the film is almost broken down into pre, during and post war. You get a really great sense as to what’s changed in the characters. I also like how the film doesn’t go over the top with how it portrays the after effects the war has had on people. It very much could have and I’m happy it didn’t. There’s also some really powerful and intense moments here. There are some moments which hit you like a tonne of bricks.
My biggest flaw comes in the pacing and length of the film. This film feels incredibly bloated to me. It drags really hard in spots and I did find myself getting a bit bored. Especially at points in the second hour I found the film a bit boring. It just makes you lose interest in my opinion. I get that this isn’t supposed to be an intense war movie per se (because it really isn’t) but I just think that if the film was a bit shorter I would probably have liked it more.
Overall though, I do still think this is good. There’s lots of fantastic elements but I just think some of it gets lost in the films lengthy run time and incredibly slow pace. I get this is more of a character piece and a psychological drama as opposed to a war film though. I would still recommend it but I don’t quite see in this what other people do.",3.5

"A rare “classic” that manages to feel way ahead of its time in some regards, and painfully outdated in others. The Deer Hunter is a film that seemed to understand the psychological ramifications of the Vietnam War on Americans, way before the country at large really started to acknowledge it, but also features a horrendously one-sided and racist portrayal of the Vietnamese that it’s hard not to look back with quite a bit of disdain. It’s a shame because there’s so much else that The Deer Hunter has going for it. The two central performances are obviously outstanding (especially Walken who really blew me away), there are incredibly tense (albeit somewhat repetitive) scenes of Russian Roulette, and I was never bored despite the gargantuan runtime.
That being said, you could easily shave off 40 minutes from the first hour or so of this movie and it would be so much tighter. Cimino insists on hammering home the dynamic of the central group of friends long after it’s already been established. There are random, drawn-out scenes that feel like they could be cut with absolutely no detriment to the film at large, and ultimately bog down the rest of the movie.
I actually like the idea of a Vietnam War movie that spends very little time in Vietnam, but I would have much preferred more of what the third act brings, than the non-stop hooliganism of the first that just becomes tired very quickly. Overall, a film that I can completely understand the praise for upon release, but one that I think is due for a lot more scrutiny in hindsight, especially when compared to some of the other classics of the 70’s that can be appreciated equally if not even more when you watch them today.
I can’t quite say The Deer Hunter has aged well in that sense at all.",3.5

Week 11 - Christopher Walken
One of those “you’ve never seen that??” that I’ve been meaning to watch for years so I’m glad I finally saw it. Wasn’t expecting it to be as long as it is but I think the acts are all broken up nicely so it flows well. Most of my issues are within the second hour, and I think if some things were different I’d like it more. But overall I’ve got mixed feelings, but it has a great cast. This is the youngest I’ve seen Christopher Walken, so it’s nice to know he wasn’t always an old man. 
EDIT: This article is a long read but absolutely worth it. It provides a lot of the context regarding the messier portions of the film. Again sometimes how you interpret something can change it’s context. The Deer Hunter feels like it can be be debated as much now, as it was 40 years ago.

"Strange to say about a three hour film, but this is made with an economy of expression. The first hour is essentially one long scene with virtually no dialogue. The movement from place to place...

Equally strange is how much the guys in the film aren't ever established beyond being a stand in for small town American youth in general. They are cyphers, and especially in DeNiro and Walken's cases, remain so.

"אי אפשר פשוט לנשום בשום סצנה של רולטה רוסית

לקראת סיום הסרט הייתה סצינה כל כך טובה שאני הייתי כל כך בתוכה שאחרי כמה זמן הייתי צריך להזכיר לעצמי שאני רואה סרט.
דה נירו באחת ההופעות הגדולות שלו ובכללי כל המשחק בסרט מאוד מרשים ואיכותי. הבימוי והצילום מעולים, כמו למשל סצינה שדה נירו צד ורואים אותו מרחוק עולה על הר שמעל אגם, כשבאגם השתקפות של כל ההר וברקע ההר יש ערפל. נשמע מסובך אבל זה יוצא ממש יפה.
הבעיה הכי גדולה שלי עם הסרט זה שהוא פשוט מרוח מדי, אם הוא היה יותר קצר הוא היה יותר טוב. למשל אין צורך לעשות סצינת חתונה בתחילת הסרט של 40 דקות, כל הזמן חשבתי שעכשיו זה כבר יגמר אבל זה פשוט לא נגמר. שמעתי שהבמאי שיחד מקרין כדי שיעשה את הגרסה הקצרה פחות טובה כדי שהגרסה הארוכה תקבל ביקורות יותר חיוביות. מבאס שזה קרה אבל אני מאוד מעריך את היצירתיות של הבמאי.
סתם שתדעו שדה נירו פשוט פיסכופת והוא ביקש לשים בסצינות של הרולטה רוסית כדור אחד אמיתי באקדח כדי ""לחמם את האווירה"". הבמאי עדיין כמובן בדק שהכל יהיה בטוח כדי שלא יהיה תאונה אבל זה לא משנה כלום",4.0
I really don’t get it. This film asks a whole lot of its audience and not only on asking to power through the lengthy run time. There are so many silly or questionable actions or lines of dialogue that completely break you out of the emotion of the film. I also felt that for a three hour film it really struggled to develop its characters. The jump from a group of boisterous lads to completely shattered and cold soldiers is…,3.0
"I couldn’t quite make out what I thought about Deer Hunter immediately after watching it. Besides from the intense roulette scenes it seemed overinflated and even a little vacuous in places. I couldn’t quite understand why I was spending three hours with these people or why I should care.
However, in the time that’s passed since I’ve not been able to shake it. It’s such a poignant deep dive into PTSD and the horrors endured at its source. It does so much more than hang it’s hat on its iconic scenes; especially it’s sporadic, almost disjointed structure that feels so thematically relevant to the characters at its core.
I thought it was incredibly bold to spend the first hour of the film basically hanging out at a wedding. It’s the only section of the film that’s set out in a ‘standard’ format and VERY little happens; but that’s important because it’s the last ‘normal’ moment that these characters will ever feel. From this point it’s just a collection of scattered scenes that almost feel cobbled together and this perfectly correlates with their fractured mental state, especially the vague disconnect that the Vietnam scenes have in relation to the rest of the film.
And the performances? DeNiro is always perfect but this might be Walken’s best role. There’s also a rare John Cazale supporting role; such a phenomenal actor taken far too soon.",4.0
“You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about”.,4.5
"(DVD)
Despite its status, I found it very underwhelming. I appreciate it for being the first film to depict the Vietnam War realistically and graphically, showing the effects it had on soldiers, but its story did not captivate or satisfy me.
The first hour of the film is painfully slow. It could have been condensed considerably while still providing all the setup it needed. The wedding went on for so long I thought I was watching a Godfather movie. Things become more interesting once the characters are in Vietnam with an extremely brutal and uncomfortable scene of Russian roulette that the film is famous and controversial for. These scenes in Vietnam don't last too long though as we move on to seeing the characters once they return home.
Overall, while parts of it are good and the performances are excellent, The Deer Hunter did little to impress me. It's slow, bloated, often boring, clunky and not as effective as it could have been with its characters, story or themes. Did not live up to its reputation at all.",2.5
"I wanted more of the lads singing Can’t Take My Eyes Off You in the bar. Why did they leave that bar?
But on a serious note, Robert De Niro is SO GOOD in this. The 70s were all for him, what a decade for that guy. The rest of the movie is very solid, nothing I was expecting and a lot of very down to earth and likeable characters! It’s not really about the war at all, more the profound effects it had on the people involved.
Will I watch it again? Not for a while at least, but it’ll stick with me until I ever get round to it.
Favourite scene: the gloriously shot deer hunts 🦌 ",4.0
"It would have been a lot better if it was about an hour shorter. The wedding took too long, and I would have liked them to spend longer in Vietnam.",3.5
Very slow start. They didn’t need to spend an hour with the wedding at the start. But as soon as they got into Vietnam I thought it was great. The characters were really likeable as well.,3.5
"I have seen this long time ago and all i could remember was it was really slow paced, a some man with hunting rifle and of course a first Russian roulette scene. I still think it is overrated. When ever I want to watch a war movie I go to Full metal jacket, or Hair or Apocalypse now...There are just too many films I would rather watch before this. This one is too long and too slow for me and I like slow. I wish there was one single character I like in this but there is none and I think that is my main problem. They are all unlikable lunatics and as film progress they become more and more crazy. This fredo guy was specially annoying, what ever they gave him to do was just to make him even more annoying (that wife knockout was brutal to watch). On a plus side DeNiro was pretty great in this and scenery shots were awesome. I really enjoyed them a lot (town shots, mountains, Russian wedding and church...)",3.5
"What makes this movie worth watching is the social rituals, the sense of how the social fabric of society is woven through such rituals. The rituals contain the power and people are moved and uplifted by their participation in them because they are what we have to protect us against the void. (The film also shows how these rituals can feel oppressive if we feel alienated from the society we live in.)

"I think the biggest compliment I can give to The Deer Hunter is that I would have watched three hours of whatever was going on during the first act of the movie. I guess I’m in the minority, but I think the following two acts, while strong, were not quite as fresh, as deeply human as the first one, where the Vietnam war was not yet a reality for the characters but still felt like a palpable presence. The cast was crazy good.",4.5
"This was much better than I expected (I had modest expectations not only due to the reevaluations of Cimino over the past decade, which had many shift to preferring Heaven's Gate, but also from the runtime, which seems excessive until you actually watch the thing). But man, that first 65 minutes or so pre-Nam is so key to the effect here. The wedding and hunting scenes establish these characters, their dynamics, and most of all, their distinct corner of Pennsylvania,…",4.5
"No war has been explored through cinema as much as the Vietnam War has been. The psychological impact of the war on its participants (and on culture as a whole) has spawned some of the greatest films ever made (Apocalypse Now ffs). And The Deer Hunter does manage to hold its ground among these masterpieces.
The best aspect of this film is its character development, supported by brilliant performances. The cast did a remarkable job indeed. The narrative structure is a slightly unconventional in the sense that it is episodic and uses the episodicity to chronicle the way characters change over time. You see DeNiro now in America chillin around with his buddies. Next scene you see him in Vietnam, probably a year or two later and he's a completely different person now. Often characters reappear after a long time and actions of the characters in each episode allow us a glimpse of the psychological changes they've undergone since the last episode.
On top of that, there's that legendary scene with the Russian Roulette (fictional though, RR was never prevalent in the Vietnam war, or anywhere I hope). Really well done, that. I have issues with the way the film treats Vietnam and the Vietnamese, but nothing serious here. I really don't see why they had to go so heavy on the Russian Roulette thing in this film, but it works kinda I guess.",4.0

The famous Russian Roulette scenes have retained their ability to shock and cause extreme tension.

"From the AFI's top 100 best movies of all time.
A film about the war's consequences.
The movie could be divided in several sections that maybe don't go that well together.
The first part gives the viewer informations on this group of people and highlights the personality of the role leader. 
Then it became an action movie (the escape scene) but it didn't last long.
The main part of the movie is builded around De Niro (great interpretation) and his desire / sense of guilt / struggle with going back to a normal life.
The final section gives the movie an epic tone that maybe were missing in the previous parts.
The movie's length helps to understand the development of the characters and I didn't find it excessive.
For sure a great movie. But it was impossible not to compare it with other 'Nam War movies that I belive are superior to this one.",3.5

"RIP John Cazale. This was his final film before his untimely death. He acted in many great films in the 70's and his presence will always be missed. The Deer Hunter is a story about a group of friends from Clairton, PA. A small town, most of them work at the local steel mill before deciding to enlist in the Army to fight in Vietnam. It is pretty tough to watch at times but it spins a tale worth telling. It is shocking and heartbreaking and the performances in it are insane thanks to De Niro, Cazale, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken. Exciting film. 3.5 out of 5.",3.5
"I've always assumed The Deer Hunter would be an overrated movie and that it would be a bloated mess that thought itself as more poignant than it really was. While some of it is true, I couldn't help but feel some depressed emotions by the time the friends raised a glass to their fallen brethren. The Deer Hunter isn't about Vietnam, we hardly spent time there. It's more concerned with the horrors of war and what it does to a human. For the most part, the film does it really well, on the other hand, a film like Born on the Fourth of July really digs into that subject matter.
The Deer Hunter feels messy. Each hour is more or less dedicated to BEFORE, DURING and AFTER the war. A solid hour to get us acquainted with these characters does feel a bit much. I appreciate the artistry in having the viewer pick up on a lot of social cues in the wedding scene without much dialogue, but this could have been a leaner movie. Just because something is 3 hours long does not make it an ""instant classic"" or ""important"" by any means. I don't need to see the bride and groom walk around an altar with crowns above their heads. Small details like this taken out don't change the emotion you feel towards these characters at all, instead, it makes a 3-hour movie into something more or less 2:45 or 2:30.
Then we get to Vietnam and we are almost immediately POWs. Then the famous scene of the film happens and much to my surprise it was still pretty intense. It's hard to go into a movie you haven't seen, but know exactly how the next scene will play out. I couldn't get a grip on the PTSD that Walken's character feels because the Russian Roulette sequence is one and done. I felt like we could have spent a little more time with them captured, to show how they're mentally beaten down. Being thrown almost directly into the mess feels like a missed opportunity. With that in mind, I found it hard that Walken would re-live the Roulette scenes and that he would become famous for it. No skill is involved, it's pure luck and he somehow manages to do this for months and when DeNiro finally shows up it just so happens to be the end? I understand the emotional need and pull for this, but reality set in pretty quickly for me and I didn't buy it.
The third act has DeNiro try to put his life back together back home. He purposely drives past a welcome home party because he can't face his friends after the horrors of war. Too much too fast and he prefers a small and quiet re-entry to life. He strikes up an emotional bond to Meryl Streep, one that felt underutilized in the first two thirds. There is something in this film, a sense of loss, a sense of not being able to get back what once was...it feels genuine. We all have things in our lives that we would like to have back, it could be something as silly as our youth or a long lost friend. This film nails that aspect and the ending feels depressingly poignant.
The Deer Hunter is a messy film with spotlights of brilliance. I would put most of that mainly on the talent of the cast and the relatability of the content. I might have never fought in a war, but I know what loss feels like.",3.5
"This is a movie I really wanted to love, but sadly I just couldn’t get into it. I'm not one to have these sorts of hot takes usually, and I'm actually a big fan of Heaven’s Gate, so I had high hopes for The Deer Hunter, considering it's regarded as Cimino's best work.

"This movie’s all in the build ups and reversals. For instance: for most of the movie it seems like it has one type of structure, giving us the impression that no matter the improvisational feeling of some of the (mostly earlier) scenes the pacing of the film is very precise. Until the final bit in Saigon, the film is virtually palindromic. The ‘Nam scenes take place directly in the center of the film, and it’s here that Cimino plays with the audience’s understanding of the film. See, in many ways, the film is like an ultra long-form version of the Kuleshov Effect. The exact same chaos and quietness of the small town is seen on both ends of the war sequences, but with profoundly different results. Whereas in the beginning the chaos is lively and fun, after DeNiro’s return it feels viscerally stressful, even before his trauma starts to bubble over. This is how the final ‘Nam stuff REALLY hits, because the pace and structure has made us expect the opposite to happen. We aren’t prepared to be thrust back into the fire, so we’re already on edge for the climax. The movie knows when to ease you into things and when to give you absolute whiplash. Being toyed with has never been so rewarding.",0.0
"What a truly brilliant film. Viewed in its time, it might have been seen more straightforwardly as three young men from small-town Pennsylvania being thrown into the Vietnam War. But seen over 40 years later, every American shot, meant to establish the normalcy, the rough-but-honest background of these characters, is a glimpse of a destroyed, nearly-forgotten world. It wasn't the Vietnamese who destroyed places like Clairton, Pennsylvania, it was American business interests -- the same forces behind the Vietnam War. The characters' cozy immigrant Slavic community (either Russian or Lemko -- it's never quite clear -- would these identifiers have meant much to people who already knew who they were anyway?) stands as an example of the many communities shattered by the deindustrialization, disillusionment, economic recession, and crisis of faith following Vietnam. A world meant to seem static, unchanging, forever quintessentially American, has become another truly quintessentially American world -- a depopulated, scarred, abandoned landscape filled with high cancer rates, depressed people, and unemployment.
Would it have been possible to predict these things in 1978? Some people certainly did, but it must have seemed implausible at the time.",4.5

"Robert De Niro is the CEO of Acting
This film has always been a daunting mountain for me. It’s over three hours long and one of the most highly acclaimed films of all time which makes my expectation for it very high already. After finally watching it, I can confidently say that the hype is worth it. The Deer Hunter tells the story of three steelworkers whose lives are changed forever after their service in the Vietnam War. This film has some of the most intense scenes in cinema. The film features many sequences involving the highly dangerous game of Russian Roulette. The way Michael Cimino designs each of these scenes is almost Hitchcockian with how expertly it manipulates suspense via its sound design. It makes the innocent click of a gun with an unloaded chamber one of the most heartpounding sounds ever as the audience grows increasingly more aware as they sit on pins and needles waiting for the next click. This use of sound affected me so much that as I was writing this, a plastic water bottle on my desk made a little pop as the air compressed in it and my heart stopped for a second. This film is one of the very few war related films that does not glorify war itself. It actually barely spends any of the runtime at war with most of the film dedicated to the impact that the war puts onto the characters. Even the scenes at war are not glamorous in the slightest as we can see the emotional and psychological barriers being torn down in front of our very eyes. This is strengthened by the many strong performances in this film. While Robert De Niro gives an absolutely outstanding performance, the true standout is the silently melancholic Christopher Walken. He steals the show as his character arc is the saddest and most gut wrenchingly realistic. I have always loved Walken for his unique style of eccentric acting but that is nowhere to be seen in this role.

Yet the bulk of the film, set in Pennsylvania, isn’t about the horrors of war, but it’s effect. It’s the one gorgeously shot, beautifully acted Vietnam story about the loss of the soul, of the self. The pack of young men who shipped out after the wedding on the weekend never really came back. And neither did America.",4.5

"This movie is about rituals. Some are every-day and mundane – going to work, eating and drinking with friends, dancing at a wedding reception or going deer hunting. And some are more steeped in symbolism – a wedding ceremony, a funeral, or a game of Russian roulette. Each ritual, to one degree or another, touches fundamental qualities that make us human and give our lives purpose. This exploration of ritual is what makes The Deer Hunter such a profoundly moving film.
Sure, it’s long at 3 hours. But I for one loved the first act, where we spend an hour getting to know our characters and seeing a Russian Orthodox wedding. Many have complained that the Vietnam scenes were unrealistic and/or “factually inaccurate”. Frankly, I don’t care that it’s completely implausible that our 3 main characters would all end up together as POWs, nor do I care whether Russian roulette was a common practice in Vietnam at the time. We’re talking about a STORY here, a parable, and I’m completely fine with taking artistic license to get the story told.
And in the end, what is the message of this parable? Is it pro- or anti- war? Patriotic or cynical? Uplifting or pessimistic? To me the movie is sufficiently ambiguous on all those issues, and, like all great movies, offers more questions than answers. To me, we are witness to the tragic arc of three young American men. They follow the rituals they have been taught or they developed on their own, and react to the random acts of love, hatred, indifference and violence in their individual ways. And in the end, we see a group of friends, eating and drinking and singing “God Bless America”. Was it patriotism or cynicism that prompted the song? Who knows? But we are witnessing a group of survivors who, for better or worse, will depend on their faith in country, religion, community and their rituals to try to make some kind of sense out of this life. To some that may seem naive and misguided, but for them it's all they have.",5.0
"The Deer Hunter adalah sebuah film drama perang yang dibagi menjadi 3 babak:
Babak Pertama (Pra Perang) :
Babak ini bisa dibilang babak paling lama dari 3 babak yang ada, penonton akan diajak berkenalan dengan 3 sahabat yang bekerja disebuah perusahaan besi yaitu Michael (Robert De Niro) Steven (John Savage) dan Nick (Christopher Walken) ketiganya mempunyai inisiatif untuk mendaftar wajib militer di vietnam setelah pernikahan Steven terlebih dahulu.

Tiga pemuda tadi juga bersahabat dengan Stanley (John Cazale) John ( George Dzundza) serta Axel ( Chuck Aspegren), ke-enam orang ini sehabis bekerja mereka selalu menghabiskan waktu bersama dengan penuh keceriaan nongkrong disebuah bar dan melakukan perburuan rusa yang menjadi sebuah identitas tersendiri bagi mereka ber-enam tadi, pada babak pembuka ini sang sutradara benar-benar ingin menggali dan memperkenalkan 6 pemuda ini secara detail mulai dari kisah persahabatan mereka,percintaan antara Steven dan Angela (Rutanya Ada) hingga jenjang pernikahan serta cinta segitiga yang melibatkan Michael,Nick dengan perempuan bernama Linda (Meryl Streep).

Babak Kedua (Perang) :
Pada babak ini tidak begitu lama dan mempunyai durasi paling sedikit scene langsung berpindah pada medan perang di vietnam, penonton diajak untuk menyaksikan 3 pemuda Michael,Steven dan Nick apakah mereka mampu bertahan hidup ditengah perang yang sedang berkecambuk.

Babak Ketiga (Pasca Perang) :
Pada babak terakhir ini bisa dibilang ini adalah babak paling klimaks dan menyentuh, pada babak ini lebih berfokus pada karakter Michael yang diperankan De Niro, penonton akan diperlihatkan Michael yang berhasil kembali ke kampung halamannya setelah mengikuti wajib militer di vietnam disambut bak seorang pahlawan oleh penduduk setempat tapi disisi lain Michael justru merasa kesepian,depresi dan dihantui rasa bersalah mendalam karna janji yang gagal ditepati kepada Nick salah satu sahabatnya.

The Deer Hunter tampil sebagai sebuah film drama perang yang anti mainstream, dimana kita sering melihat film perang yang selalu menghadirkan adegan tembak-tembakan yg megah tapi lain halnya dengan film ini, The Deer Hunter lebih memilih menyajikan film perang dari sisi lain yaitu mengupas dampak apa saja yang ditimbulkan perang terhadap orang orang yang terlibat didalamnya, disini kita bisa melihat 3 sahabat Michael,Steven dan Nick yang mendapatkan pengalaman perang yang tragis dan pilu mereka justru malah menjadi tahanan perang tentara vietnam hingga dijadikan sebagai sarana hiburan dan perjudian lewat permainan Russian Roulette, Russian Roulette sendiri adalah sebuah permainan mematikan yaitu dengan cara memasukkan peluru pada sebuah pistol revolver lalu diputar agar pelurunya muncul secara acak saat ditembakan dan diarahkan pada kepala, karna Russian Roulette inilah 3 pemuda tadi mengalami pengalaman yang tragis dan kelam hingga berdampak pada perubahan sifat mereka.

Akting serta Chemistry antara Robert De Niro,John Savage dan Christopher Walken begitu memukau mereka berhasil menggambarkan apa arti sahabat sesungguhnya dari mulai janji serta saling melindungi satu dengan yang lainnya, aspek lain seperti Cinematography yang indah dan sejuk diliat mata melalui pemandangan bukit serta alam disaat pagi hari dikala 6 pemuda tadi sedang berburu rusa, Scoring yang mellow dan menyentuh tidak menggebu-gebu cocok dengan nuansa perang yang kelam.
Pada akhirnya The Deer Hunter adalah salah satu film drama perang klasik terbaik walaupun terlihat pro amerika tapi terlepas dari itu semua film ini adalah sebuah tontonan drama perang yang penuh dilema,ironi,menyedihkan dan tragis bagaimana perang memberikan impact yang luar biasa terhadap orang secara fisik dan psikis, ini bisa diliat dari seorang Michael dia bisa pulang dengan selamat setelah perang justru malah merasa depresi bukan senang sungguh ironi bukan, bahkan saat dia diajak Linda untuk bercumbu Michael pun tidak mampu, tidak heran pada jamannya film ini mampu merengkuh 5 Oscar sekaligus.

The Deer Hunter is one of the first war films that was critical of the American's involvement in the Vietnam war; whose success and acclaim led to the birth of other great Vietnam war films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Born on the fourth of July. The movie is an excellent war drama that follows a three act storyline featuring events before, during and after the war.
The cast is outstanding featuring great performances from the likes of Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Savage and the late John Cazale. Cimino's direction is very well done and with precision even if it doesnt hit the note every single time you wanted it to. The cinematography is also masterfully done with one or two shots in particular being some of the very best that I have ever seen. The music gives the film a calm and relaxing feel espcially during the final act which was very much needed after the gruesome second half. The pacing for the most part was pretty good with the first act being the only one that I felt was too long.
The first act of the film which is basically the prologue is a little long though quite necessary to set up the relationships and likeability of the characters. The second act taking place in Vietnam is easily the best part of the movie. The russian roulette scenes, whether they maybe true or not, were rather harrowing to witness and quite intense. The third act started off pretty strong but ends on a rather disappointing and predictable note. Though I was quite fine with it.
With regards to the russian roulette scenes on whether they are real or not, I tend to look at them in a more symbolic way. To me they represent all the tortures the soldiers have suffered during the war. The film is a tragedy about men under heavy pressure, how they react to such insane circumstances and how they change because of it. A lot of people have mixed feelings about it now, espicially after Heaven's Gate, and have even wondered if the film was truly deserving of all the praise that it got. I havent seen Heaven's Gate but The Deer Hunter is in my eyes a very well done tragic war drama that does deserve to be called one of the best films about Vietnam.",3.5

Week 20: New Hollywood Week
It’s The Best Years of Our Lives for the post-Vietnam/New Hollywood generation, and it’s also an honest-to-goodness classic. Masterfully directed by Cimino, with incredible performances from everyone involved, it’s a very honest and very human look at the aftermath of war, and how working-class communities were and are chewed up and spit out by them. The grim scenes in Vietnam and the aftermath in Pennsylvania are hard to stomach, but with De Niro, Walken, and Streep’s performances they’re impossible to forget. Christopher Walken especially, in spite of how you think about him today, earns all his praise and his Oscar in this, looking as lost and vulnerable as I’ve ever seen him. 
It’s not an easy film, but a necessary one, and one still leaves an impact forty years later (and yep, I started crying at the end). It’s also a great legacy left behind by John Cazale and Michael Cimono, as well as a great entry from some of today’s most iconic performers.",4.5

"Scavenger Hunt 32/Film 16/Robert De Niro movie where he is not a con
I have to say the version I watched on Amazon Video had terrible sound quality, almost under water like, so this did have an overall impact on my watch. 
Some of the tensest Russian Roulette scenes committed to camera in a mighty fine performance by all involved in particular Robert De Niro who is excellent in this role. The film is gritty and real and probably a real hit home for anyone involved in the Vietnam war as it displays the horrors experienced during and after the conflict. 
A long film but not one that drags, I will watch this again, hopefully with better audio.",3.0
"I like what Roger Ebert said: the film “gathers you up” as it goes along. Vietnam has obviously been done to death but this does manage to feel like its own thing. The characters are credible and the film shows how, despite coming from the same background, people will always react differently to the horror of war. There’s a lot of small, seemingly insignificant moments in the film that only become powerful in the context of the whole. The final scene with De Niro and Walken is about as gut-wrenching as anything in cinema.",3.5
"The Deer Hunter follows Robert De Niro as Michael, Christopher Walken as Nicky and Meryl Streep as Linda living in Pennsylvania. Michael and Nicky work as Steelworkers in a factory. Nicky finds love with Linda but all of these events change drastically when Nicky, Michael and their friends are called to Vietnam to fight in the war..
Not that I can relate to it, or possibly comprehend what the experience could even be like but The Deer Hunter is the greatest war film I have ever seen, infact it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen. De Niro gives the performance of his career in my opinion as does Meryl Streep, and as does Christopher Walken it's some of the most incredible acting I have ever seen. In the opening act, we are taken on a slow paced hang out with these characters through the dreary wet Pennsylvania where the roads shine from the aftermath of constant rain and dull cold weather, we get to know them. We know that these men live for punching out of the factory at the end of the day, they take pride in the roughness of the stubble on their jawlines, the bitter taste of alcohol as it swashes through their mouths every evening in their local hangout bar, the tightness of their plaid shirts buttoned over several vests and the echo of a gunshot amongst the mountain range when they go hunting together only to return to work the next day and brag about how well they did in the process and be so happy to repeat it the following day. They never consider what it could be like if things were to suddenly change or what things are like outside their world because they're the every man.
Which is why I love the depiction of war in this film and it's effects, we see how drastically it can change a persons mindset, how it can make them instantaneously suicidal or how it can have an everlasting negative effect on them mentally for the rest of their lives.
Not only does it tell the tale of war, but the seedy, dark fall through the cracks events that can happen during war. I'm not going to give away anything, but there is a constant re-occurrence of betting on games of russian roulette in this film which is the example I'm driving at.
These are some of the reasons why I think this film is incredible, but if I were to say more it would simply tarnish the experience that this film unfolds in it's sprawling 3 hour run time, The Deer Hunter is a powerful and ever so compelling film and I encourage anybody that hasn't watched it to seek it out.",0.0

"To be honest, I kind of felt it lost a bit of steam after the first Russian roulette scene, as before that, I loved how Cimino set up this hyper-masculine world where all the characters bond with and compete with each other. The ending was very powerful, however, as it subverts the ending to John Ford's The Searchers. In that film, Ford suggests that in a cycle of violence, you can do a lot and a little at the same time by being the bigger man as Ethan, in his final moments sees that Debbie can still be redeemed. In Cimino's film, Michael believes all the time that Nick is worth redeeming, but ends up being otherwise, and instead of leaving the interior like Ethan does in The Searchers, Michael stays with everyone inside at the end of The Deer Hunter.",0.0

"The Deer Hunter is carefully constructed around 3 main plot points: 3 ceremonies that each mark a turning point in the film: It starts with a wedding, then more than an hour into the film we have the infamous Russian roulette sequence, and the film ends with a funeral.
The wedding recalls shades of The Godfather: like Coppola's epic, here we have a long sequence that serves not so much to push the narrative forward, but more as an extensive opportunity for characterization. In The Godfather, Michael has just returned from war, but this film’s Michael is just about to go to war. Like in The Godfather, we get to know every character, the power relations, and the community that they live in as a whole. The main difference here is that Coppola's introductory wedding sequence is considerably shorter than Cimino's and it lays the seeds of the narrative somewhat better. As the wedding sequence finally ends, the main narrative begins in Vietnam.
As pointed out by many critics, Russian roulette can be read as the main metaphor of the film, a metaphor for the war itself with all of its unnecessary and senseless brutality, randomness and inevitable physical and mental damages. This scene is not only the film’s most memorable scene, but also the most important one in the film’s structure. It is the turning point that we get back to in different ways multiple for the rest of the film.
The Deer Hunter is also comparable to yet another Coppola masterpiece, Apocalypse Now as you can all guess. If Apocalypse was about Vietnam (oh sorry Mr. Coppola, you're right, ""It was Vietnam""), The Deer Hunter is not so much about 'Nam itself, but more about before and after it. The film ends with the [remaining] characters, who at the beginning of the film were singing wedding songs as they were sending their friends off to Vietnam, singing ""God Bless America"" after their friend’s funeral. An ironic ending indeed!",3.5

"What could be the greatest way to send a message about war through the film?
Kubrick pinched the irrational reality and made a satire, Coppola magnified the craziness out of war and made cinematic experience of cruelty and horror.
They emphasized and highlighted the war itself, but here, The Deer Hunter presented us another way: go biographic
When you want to see the war, you don't just see it, you should look what came before and what comes after. Like what Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson does well, The Deer Hunter goes chronologically, from before the war to within it, and after it.
Its scale might be smaller than Apocalypse Now, but it still manages to feel as powerful, one of the most powerful films I've ever seen actually. And it's not because of its visual galore; it's that emotion .
Emotionally powerful, Deer Hunter play very well, sure in the first chapter it shows main characters hanging out so they talk and chat a lot, loudly. But when it brings out emotion, people don't talk. I can say acting were great enough but something about the whole tone  of the film itself had something magical in it.
However I'm not tryna talk down on its visual side. Cinematography here is just as great, that mountain shots where they went deer hunting, short but powerful cabin scene, they did a great job.
Ever since I first saw russian roulette, it became one of the most horrifying things ever in the world. Everytime I see it in movies, dramas, books, it always gets me, as  badly as it can. And it's the main element throughout the whole film so personally I can help but fascinated by this film, more and more. My hands got sweaty as possible when the film is over. 
Robert De Niro with those beard and uniform, hunting jacket was one of the best looking roles of him, and he did it again, his performance was beautiful here. Seeing young Meryl Streep was such a pleasure, although in my opinion she doesn't impress me that much in this.
De Niro, John Cazale and Christopher Walken made such impressive performances. Traumatic, that moment where you can see the sorrow under the laugh, friendship.. I shed a tear watching this film. 
Yes, this can be considered slow-paced, sometimes too dragging, but I really like that way. Despite of its slower-paced moments, less-frequent war scenes, it remains not only one of the most powerful film I've ever seen but one of my favorite ones.

I can't explain why. Just seek out the opportunity to experience it this way whenever possible.

"With director Michael Cimino’s passing yesterday it only seemed natural that this would be the perfect time to finally revisit his most famous film The Deer Hunter. I was a young teenager the first and up to now only time I’d seen the film before and I think I’d seen it in a horrendous TV version back then and while I remember liking it then my memories of it are incredibly hazy and as such this viewing was quite the revelation. This was a huge even movie when it first came out both critically and commercially and it’s hard to imagine now that something this slow and introspective would be something of a blockbuster today. The closest equivalent I can think of would be American Sniper, but that movie wasn’t nearly as interested in challenging its audience as this is. In many ways the film feels like a response to Francois Truffaut’s assertion that there are no true anti-war films because the visceral thrill of battle always reads as thrilling rather than off-putting. I don’t know that Cimino was specifically trying to make an anti-war film with this but he does seem to have sidestepped that issue by using Russian roulette as a metaphor for the danger, trauma, and secret thrill of a tour of combat. This did cause something of a critical backlash in that it was a fictional element which was thought to vilify the North Vietnamese and leave the audience thinking that the war was worthwhile, but this somewhat misses the point. The movie was not interested in re-legislate the validity of Vietnam so much as to examine the scars it left on those who fought it. The movie does have some problems. I like that the movie takes its time but the people who claim it’s “too long” aren’t completely off the mark and it maybe could have stood to lose fifteen or twenty minutes. Also, every actor in the movie seems to be about five to ten years to old for the roles they are playing. These are theoretically supposed to be 18-20 some year olds getting drafted right? Why are they being played by guys in their mid-30s? Also the way the Christopher Walken character breaks down at the end seems… more poetic than logical. Still, these are minor blemishes on a powerful and interesting film from a director who showed a lot of promise before he was brought down by a combination of a fickle public and his own hubris.",4.5

"SOME SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW
I am a heartbroken man. Regardless of his reputation among the film industry, one couldn't knock down Michael Cimino's ambition. He had an eye that many would commend. You don't believe me? Then do yourself a favor and during this Criterion Collection sale, purchase Heaven's Gate. Then you'll change your mind.
He wasn't a favorite director of mine, but he directed two great films. The previously mentioned Heaven's Gate is an underrated masterpiece of Cinema. The hatred it received destroyed Cimino and it wasn't needed; Heaven's Gate is a beautiful bloodbath of Epic proportions. But this one means more to me than any other film.
I hope he realized that somewhere, some guy worshiped this film. This man called it the greatest War film he had ever seen, he called it a Masterpiece of World Cinema. This man owes a lot of inspiration to this film and I wish he knew that. I am this man.
I love The Deer Hunter more than any film I have ever seen. I can't explain why I am so attached to The Deer Hunter. I can never understand why I call this ""my favorite film."" But it is. Perhaps it's because when I first purchased the film, I wasn't expecting a film with this much caliber. But 7 viewings later, it still amazes me, floors me, hurts me, and makes me want to continue my film journey.
We start the film with our protagonists and their group of friends preparing for a wedding of one of their own. Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steve (John Savage) are heading to Vietnam to fight in the ongoing war that took so much from many people. Before their leave, Steve is marrying Angela; a woman we know little about. But she's not important until the end.
Besides the three main, we have Stan (John Cazale), a man too ill to fight alongside his friends, Axel (Chuck Aspergen), a lovable oaf, and John (George Dzundza ), a friendly bartender, rounding out the core group of men. We are also introduced to Linda (Meryl Streep), who is Nick's fiancé. Michael has unrequited feelings for her, but tells no one.
Can I stop to say that John Cazale is the greatest supporting actor of all time? The man knew his time was up during the filmmaking of The Deer Hunter. He knew that he may not make it to the premiere of the film and yet, you cannot tell at all that he is a man fearful of his future. He looks as though he's comfortable with his untimely end. He looks like a man who wants to give the greatest performance he can give. And he is amazing. Thank you.
Vietnam. Our three friends are separated, reunited, and captured. They fight for their lives in one of the most iconic film scenes of any film: The Russian Roulette scenes. They are frightened. They know they won't make it out. Steve is too weak and scarred to continue. Mike and Nick have to fight, every pop of the trigger symbolizes them losing their sanity. The changes they will future inhabit. Michael, in one pivotal scene, goes from realizing he wasn't going to make it, to laughing like a maniac, to killing every single man who held him and his friends captured. This is his change. That scene proves that Michael will never be normal again. His friends are the same. Steve is too injured and emotionally gone and Nick has become too scarred. He loses himself.
They escape. But once more, they are separated.
Time passes and Michael is sent home, a changed man. Instead of being the stoic leader of the pack, he has become a mute to all that happened to him. He hasn't heard from Steve in ages and Nick has gone missing. Linda keeps him company.
Suddenly, Michael finds Steve and tells him that he may know of Nick's whereabouts. Thus begins the greatest last 20 minutes of a film.
Michael goes back for his friend, into the underbelly of Hell; where he almost died. Nick is in danger and he knows it. The last scene in Vietnam is heartbreaking.
SPOILERS:
He finds Nick. He has become a zombie, succumbing to his surroundings and losing himself. He has become a player in Russian Roulette. He doesn't recognize Michael. And he doesn't recognize himself. The only way Michael can help him, is to play him in this evil game. Michael is in tears, praying to anyone that Nick will remember him. And then for a split second, Nick remembers. And the gun is pulled and Nick is no more. Did he unknowingly kill himself?
No, he knew. He saw the pain Michael went through in those few seconds of realization. He couldn't handle his own pain. He needed a way out of this cycle he was living in. He found it in a gun. And he is at peace once more. This, ladies and gentlemen, is my favorite scene in the film. Morbid I know, but it's so powerful. The whole film makes you feel horrible. You will cry. You will feel nothing but pain. It is a beautiful film. I still cry at the end. It is just so God Damn perfect.
Let's talk about the score conducted by Stanley Myers. How beautiful of a score is this? It matches perfectly with the tone of the film. When Michael heads back into Vietnam, to save Nick, the music is fearful and foreshadowing. When Cavatina plays, we are graced with hope. With memories. With regret. Stanley Myers' score is beautiful.
Vilmos Zsigmond's cinemotography. Nothing beats this from him. It is jaw dropping on how intense and gorgeous the film looks. He deserved the Oscar for this, no question. This is his best.
Cimino's direction is ambitious, like stated. He isn't afraid to make you squirm of The Deer Hunter's source material; he is bold. His dedication for the art of film is expressed in this. You will be missed.
Christopher Walken's best performance in any film. The best supporting actor performance I've ever seen. He is so believable that it's not even funny. It's disturbing. It's real.
However, Robert De Niro not only gives his BEST PERFORMANCE IN A FILM (YEAH I SAID IT), he gives one of the greatest performances in all of Cinema. He is heartbroken, he is tortured, he is a shell of a man he once was. He is disturbed, he is scarred. De Niro makes it all believable. Michael is one of my favorite characters in Cinema. Just fantastic.
The Deer Hunter is an American Masterpiece. It is the greatest War film I have ever seen. It is the most influential film I can ever take from. It is my favorite film. It is my film. It is such an amazing experience and I implore you to take the time to watch this film. Rest in Peace John Cazale, Vilmos Zsigmond, and now you, Michael Cimino. You forever changed my life when I purchased this DVD at an FYE years ago. Thank you for the experience you gave me and thank you for creating this great film. Thank you for all you've done for Cinema. Thank you so much.

"This is one of those few undeniably great, impactful films that I have a real internal debate about. Some of the criticism of it is very valid: it's undeniably arch and manipulative, at certain points it's shamelessly melodramatic and a bit unsophisticated in its moral attitude. The depiction of Vietnamese still grates as well...
HOWEVER, so many elements of this film are totally compelling...it has a clear point of view and everyone, from director to the actors and everyone in between, commits to it. It's a great White Male Working Class opera of camaraderie, loss, regret, hope. Taken on its own terms, it's hugely involving and difficult not to be swept up in. Even the borderline incongruous musical theme stays with you in the end and somehow seems just right, in spite of its tearjerking quality
Cimino is a difficult filmmaker to truly love but is undeniably talented and it shows here...this is one of De Niro's best 2-3 performances, same for Streep and Walken. Vilmos Zsigmond's camerawork is astonishing at times, what an artist. It's essential, even if at times off-putting, viewing",4.0
"Robert De Niro finds himself firmly entrenched within the friend zone, and spends the better part of 3 hours trying to fight his way out of it.
What do you do when caught in such a circumstance? Well, if you're Michael, an American born steelworker from Pennsylvania, there's only one thing you can do. So pay close attention, because there may just be some tips here that prove useful in your dating ventures.
1. Dance with your best friend's girl at a wedding
2. Buy her a drink
3. Then another
4. And another
5. Try to kiss her.
6. Fail (don't worry, it's all part of the process)
7. Hunt a deer
8. Go to Vietnam
9. Get traumatized
10. Ditch your friend in a foreign country (make it seem unintentional)
11. Return home
And, well, you're pretty much set. Play your cards right and satisfaction is guaranteed. Remember, confidence is key. Never back down when a gun is pointed at your head. Bullets can only kill if you let them. The American spirit can conquer all.
Good luck, and God bless!",4.0
"3 hours of a great portrait containing a great cast and great performances by Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, and especially Robert De Niro.",5.0
"Still an emotional masterpiece...
I did not like the depiction of the Vietnamese characters, but the movie was made in 1978...",4.5
"I suppose nowadays Michael Cimino is considered a “one-hit wonder,” having reached Oscar glory with The Deer Hunter and then becoming a laughingstock after his anticipated follow-up, the ambitious Western Heaven’s Gate, tanked both critically and commercially (though now its legacy is being re-evaluated by modern critics and audiences). The director’s downfall is unfortunate, considering most look upon The Deer Hunter favourably compared to other Best Picture winners, and it certainly is a very, very accomplished film in its own right. Having been made shortly after the Vietnam War ended, it deals with the traumas of that awful period with a striking immediacy that still feels relevant in a contemporary context. We can understand the dislocation and destruction that permeates the final scene, which is marked by a futile rendition of “God Bless America” at the wake of one of the characters. The song manages to join together the hollow remnants of war with the illusion of hopeful patriotism, but we know that it’s just an illusion. We’ve been privy to a shattering of bone and consciousness for the past few hours, and no matter what crutch we choose to lean on, there’s no taking away the reality of such horrors.
The tripartite structure of the film has received some criticism for giving the film excess bloat; the first act alone, which focuses on the celebration of a wedding, seems like an hour-long test of endurance. Yet it’s necessary to build these characters from the ground up, and you could also see it as a dexterous method of giving the audience a false sense of security. The move from the Pennsylvanian steel town to the fields of Vietnam is jolting, and the brutality of the Russian roulette scenes are even further accentuated by this abruptness. If it doesn’t “flow” by today’s standards, well, I don’t think it was ever meant to. This is not cinematic comfort food.
What perhaps doesn’t hold up the most is Cimino’s resistance to nuance. Over the years, filmmaking has embraced subtler ways to tell these kinds of stories, and so The Deer Hunter hasn’t aged as well in that respect. It telegraphs. It clobbers. It doesn’t seem to want a deeper interpretation than what is presented on the screen. When De Niro holds up his rifle bullet, his “This is this” speech is a clear foreshadowing of the bullet hiding in the guns of the Russian roulette games. And the bullets are the physical manifestations of the psychological trauma of wear, rending the tissues of our being in one fell swoop. What else can be said?
Despite its obviousness and its length, this is still a hard-hitting film. It knows how to sweep you into its undercurrent and hold you there. De Niro, Walken (who deservedly won an Oscar, say what you will), Savage and Streep are all fantastic and make you believe in their characters. Was Cimino a fluke? It’s hard to say. Maybe he was. Or maybe he never had this kind of material to work with again.",3.5
"For some reason I don't think I'd ever watched this all the way through. A real slow-burner - a film that you don't realise quite how much you've been enjoying it until it finishes.
I loved the first act and how well the friendships and community are portrayed. It is the least eventful act, but the most important. It's what gives the third act such impact.
Michael Cimino manages to take the story of a group of friends, and use it as an example of how war affects communities generally as well as use it as an allegory for the effect on America as a people.
The characters themselves are played well, and are deliberately superficially written, and really they have to be. This isn't a film that gets inside of the heads of its characters, it's a film that uses the protagonists to tell a story. The town is the character that gets developed by the script.
This really is a companion piece to Apocalypse Now. Both because of their allegorical approach to similar subject matter and because they are brilliant examples of film-makers being utterly over-indulged and finding brilliance as a result. They come within a millimetre of being preposterous and bloated but absolutely work.",5.0
"War Films are something that can be portrayed in many different ways. Whether its a War Comedy like Three kings or War Drama like Apocalypse Now there really Isn't just one way to portray the idea of War.
Which is why the 1978 Drama The Deer Hunter is so drastically different that any War Film you will see in fact I wouldn't even call it a war film its a Drama about friends and how there relationships, viewpoints in life and above all attitude Before The War, During The War and After the War.
All segments have different tones to them but the movie as a whole is an absolute masterpiece for many reasons.
First of all the acting is spectacular from everyone. This might the most realistic portrayal of War Heroes I have ever seen. One of the reasons being because the film gives us time with the characters before they go off to war.
This gives us time to get to know them better and get a sense of there lives all 3 characters drastically change before and after the war. Robert Deniro, Christopher Walken and John Savage all perfectly portray the roles of not just people fighting in a war but real people.
Meryl Streep and John Cazale also do fantastic job in there roles as well. The movie is also filled with so much different emotion from all actors. Humor, Passion Love Depression Turmoil and Its also handld perfectly.
The directing is some of the best ever!! The way the director was able to tell this story is fantastic.
As I said the movie is spilt into 3 specific acts. At first the movie is just about a group of friends and the daily adventures they get into but once the war comes in everything changes.
This is a very realistic way to show the horrors of war and how much it can fuck up someone's life and change some drastically and whole heartedly,
The way the director did this was excellent the screenplay however is the best thing about this movie.
Every scene is amazing in this film there Isn't a single scene I wasn't into and I can get very bored with War Movies sometimes (Just not my thing I don't know why) But this film does a great job of keeping you interested the whole time.
The strongest thing about this film is the bonding between the 3 friends which is one of the best bonds I have ever seen in a film because of how realistic and drastic there friendship changes.
The scenes of Deer Hunting is some of the best scenes of the movie you can really see how close all of these guys are and the bond they have Is very strong in all of the scenes.
There are many emotional moments in this movie as to be expected I will admit some scenes made me tear up a bit because of how well the movie is written some of the best dialogue in a war film ever by far.
The movie is really about life and how 1 event can change everything which I really do love.
They also did a great job with not making things too Hollywoodized which would of been easy to do and I'm happy they didn't go in that direction.
The cinematography is amazing the scenes of War (Which there aren""t many) are perfectly handled they are extremely graphic and you really get a sense of how this was like hell to them.
The film is also beautiful to look at all of the set locations are so detailed and I loved it.
Besides a great soundtrack there Isn't much of a score but when Its there its great.
The editing is something I was a little worried about the movie is 3 hrs long but it NEEDED to be that long in order to tell the story right.
In many ways this movie does feel like 3 different movies but there all put together into 1 movie and there all fantastic.
There are some fantastic subplots in the movie that are also great such as a subplot between Streep and Deniro that works very well and another one that I don't want to give way or else it ruins one of the best scenes early in the film.
That's why the movie succeds as well as it does while the movie could be about War its hardly about that its about the power of friendship and the difficulties that an event in there life bring and its fantastic and compelling to watch.
If your not a fan of War Films watch this movie I guarantee it will have an impact on him it certainly had a great effect on me.

"At certain points in the wedding sequence you find yourself wishing the film would move on. Then it does.

Such a powerful film.,4.5
"Epic depiction of the anarchy state of mind that existed for soldiers during Vietnam perfectly captured in the disturbingly long roulette game that highlights and arrests viewers. It's such a prominent feature that's length and fatalistic repetition really captured my thoughts as I'm sure it does to many. The film is a dark depiction of the troubles of war and post war it's where a lot of the films concerns lay, prominently displayed in the final hour, highlighted by how much that experience has not only warped them but irreparably so. That said the first hour could have used a bit of trimming, it seems like one of the films that achieves its grandiose status in part for it's content but also for it's elongated runtime. Despite how powerful the film undoubtedly is, I'm surprised I wasn't as gripped and shaken as I probably should've been in the quieter moments (excluding the roulette scenes).

The Deer Hunter is the best non-existing Stephen King-novel that's been adapted to the screen, featuring everything he's great at; an overlong prologue, an intense middle part, characters that feel a little cheap before things click into place, a harrowing third act and a great ending.",4.0
"Finally, after five years and two attempts, I watched The Deer Hunter all the way through. It can be a tough slog of a film as it's split into three very distinct sections across it's three hour running time. The first part focuses on a group of steel mill workers in a small industrial town in Pennsylvania. All set over roughly 24 hours, we see the friends leave work early in the morning, go drinking before one of them gets married later that day, the wedding party at night, and finally an excursion into the mountains the following morning to hunt deer.
It's a very slow start to the film, and at times I was struggling to see the point. Hardly anything here advances the plot, we merely observe these characters, along with their female companions, and while certain relationships are hinted at being more complex than we see, not much light is shed on them. It is only when the credits roll that I truly understood how deliberate this was, and how powerful it would become.
Three of the men in the tight-knit group are preparing to go off to Vietnam to serve in the war going on at the time, played wonderfully by Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken and John Savage. DeNiro, undoubtedly the main star of the film, gives one his best performances ever, as a quiet but firm man. Walken arguably steals the show as more of an outgoing, happy go lucky type who by the film's climax is a changed man. John Savage however, in retrospect not as big a name as the other two, shouldn't be counted out, as his performance was incredible also.
The second part of the film shows the three in Vietnam, in a cut that truly throws you into the deep end of the horrors of war. Here enters the infamous Russian Roulette sequence, in which our main characters are captured and forced to play the deadly game. It consists of placing a single bullet into the chamber of a gun, and holding it to your head, firing at random, a true game of life and death. The scene is probably the most intense thing I've ever seen in a film, with various characters slapping each other for real, understandably riled up and emotional. DeNiro and Walken truly made me believe in this moment to the point that I have to again, not only call this the most intense moment I've seen in a film to date, but perhaps one of the best, period.
There's more to the Vietnam section that just this scene though, and the raw feel that is achieved by filming on location, made it all the more impactful. The third and final hour of the film focuses on one of the characters returning home, dealing with the fallout from the atrocities that have taken place, the fate of the other two unknown. This is another powerful part of the film, in a much subtler way, really getting into the emotional damage of war and the repercussions of it. John Cazales plays one of the friends who didn't go to Vietnam and also gives a fine performance in what would be his final film role, he was dying as they made the movie. Meryl Streep also plays a pivotal role as one of the women back home, who has an important arc from the beginning until the end. Along with others she serves as a center point from which the transition can be seen from before and after Vietnam.
By the time the film is over, the perhaps at face value slow, even boring first hour, makes all the more sense. We get a real, untouched, gritty slice of what the lives of these people were like, before, during, and after a traumatic experience. I imagine on second viewing the beginning will be a lot more enjoyable, as I can appreciate getting to see all sides of the story, and relaxing a little with these guys, before everything goes south.
The fact that the guys go deer hunting, and that it's very close to who DeNiro's character is, plays little to no part in the overall story. But it does serve as a harrowing piece of symbolism towards the end, and is very much a device to reveal a part of his changing psyche.
Overall it's one of the best films I've seen without a doubt, and an instant all time favourite. Raw, captivating, and haunting. True cinema.",5.0
One of the best films ever released. The film tells the story of a group of friends and the impact of what war does to people. The film begins the day of a wedding of Stevie played by John Savage who along with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken are going off to serve in Vietnam. When they are there they are held as POWs and forced to play Russian roulette by their captors. After their escape they are separated and their destinies are all different. Director Michael Cimino has everything working on all cylinders and delivers a perfect film and sadly this was the last time he was successful at this level.

I find myself drawn to the stark, and somber portrayal of the Vietnam war, devoid of the embellished heroism so often associated with American narratives.
Instead, it lays bare the grim reality of their trials and consequences.
In this film, I witnessed the very essence of that struggle laid bare. What began as a merry gather-around that nearly warmed my heart, swiftly descended into a nightmarish abyss, ensnaring my senses to the point where time lost its grip on me.

And the ending—a perfect ending—is total film school shit on paper but performed by some of the greatest actors of the generation it just works. A testament to execution being everything.

The ingredients are just top tier. The acting, the directing, the locations. It's slow, but it needs to be. I was blown away by the scale of everything. The Pennsylvania mountains felt just as open as the streets of Saigon felt claustrophobic. Can only imagine that on the big screen.
What's making what would have otherwise been an easy review for me hard is actually not the messy politics, the overly vague character building (or lack thereof), or the fact that the Walken plotline becomes completely implausible. It's a fucking movie -- I want to be entertained and to feel. It did those things, so I don't really care.
Instead, it's that arguably 2 of the most important moments -- the final faceoff and the God Bless America bar scene -- left me a bit lukewarm. I think just in general I wasn't a huge fan of the 3rd act. I may have just convinced myself that those aforementioned narrative flaws were more consequential than I thought. But the meat of this just had so much going for it. Once they go to Nam through the first scene back home with Meryl is just A+. Yes, the prison camp stuff is definitely super racist and the characterizations are lazy. But fuck if those weren't some of the most brutally engaging sequences I can remember on screen.
Writing this has been helpful for me. 4. A really strong one. Just missed the extra .5. One of those very good movies you never want to watch again. Gonna need some palette cleansers before braving Apocalypse Now. Congrats if anyone read this far.",4.0

"The last hour and 10 minutes of this film are masterful. The hour and 50 minutes before that range from dull to good. The performances and score are strong throughout. Whilst I understand the only way to make a film like this emotional is to build up the characters slowly as if we've known them for longer then the film's runtime, that does come at the cost of good pacing and general enjoyment. There are some great scenes within this film but as a whole I didn't love it and would probably never watch it again. I can see myself rewatching certain scenes and especially the ending but I would not classify this as a masterpiece.

"Some of the smaller inaccuracies regarding working class life in western Pennsylvania in the 60s/70s are to be expected: the all-wrong accents (Cazale comes closest to capturing the nasal whine of classic Picksburgh-ese), the long haircuts that no steel worker would've been wearing in the late 60s, or the Russian Stanley being given the Polish nickname Staś (which -- why aren't they just Polish anyway, if you want them to be truly archetypal Pittsburghers?).*
But these pale in comparison to the film's greatest inaccuracy regarding working-class steel workers: none of them, I promise you, could afford a rusty Cadillac that happens to also work as a teleportation device able to transport a carload of men to what is clearly the Pacific Northwest for their deer hunting trips.
I was always too big of a wimp to join my dad on his deer hunting trips, but even to my second-hand experience the hunting scenes just ring deeply phony. Don't get me wrong: those sweeping vistas are beautiful and the hunting sequences are fantastically shot. But real deer hunting for these guys would've been a lot of un-cinematic sitting around in a deer blind, downing Iron City. It's quite apparent that Cimino prizes the operatic, the dramatic, the Biggest and the Most, over the truth.
And I guess whether this movie works for you or not hinges on that tendency. Probably most people, especially those not of my western PA heritage, can and will look past the choice when it comes to the hunting scenes. But how you get past the portrayal of Vietnam as a country whose national pastime is apparently Russian roulette, and the complete abdication of any responsibility to even so much as acknowledge the atrocities Americans committed in the Vietnam War--instead depicting the North Vietnamese as monsters of bottomless cruelty, seemingly without reason--I just do not know.
I get that the game works as a symbol of the senselessness of war, but it's a symbol being deployed in the midst of an actual depiction of that war. If Cimino didn't want to show the actual senselessness of war in a way that didn't glaringly misrepresent what happened in Vietnam, I wish he would've just done what so many other filmmakers were doing at the time and filtered Vietnam into a pulpy horror flick.
It's a shame because so much about this film is fantastic; structurally and technically there is some straight-up masterwork going on, enough so that I'm still rating this pretty highly despite all my misgivings. The building is beautiful, but the framework is rotten.

"Really thought I’d love this movie but it’s just ok. It has a stacked cast I love De Niro and walken in this they are fine fine actors. However the plot has a lot of scenes that just go nowhere and are unnecessary.
      An hour into this film all you have seen is a group of guys get drunk hang out and one of them gets married in a very traditional way. It then thrusts the group into Vietnam and jumps right into them being captured. Personally I wish they had shown what lead up to it that’s what I wanted to see personally. It does show one fight prior to it but it’s just one guy throwing a grenade at civilians and then getting lit on fire in a fake looking way. The torture scenes after that though were fantastic. Those scenes were top notch and iconic. When they shoot those guys and manage to get out it was very exciting and awesome. However after that it gets really really slow again. The point of the scenes after that is to show the effects of war on the guys and show how damaged they are.

   The movie does a good job of this it shows the ptsd they have and how Micheal Dosent want to see people even joking about shooting eachother (Fredo). It also shows Micheal not wanting to go to his party snd being aloof. It shows Stevie’s wife being shocked at how much her husband changed. It also shows Nicki still being in Vietnam. Micheal then goes back, plays in a gun roulette game with him and wins in the most shocking and iconic scene in the movie.  
Overall though this movie while boasting a strong message and iconic shocking scenes it is a slog. It is way too long for what it is and wastes a lot of screen time. The few iconic scenes in it are great but not enough to make the whole movie really worth it. Defenitley watch that roulette scene though.",2.5
"the biggest takeaway from this movie for me is honestly that its painfully long. the first hour is really boring and just abt nothing memorable happens, and then the vietnam stuff breathes some air into the plot and held my interest for a little while but dies down again towards the end. that being said, while it isnt an enjoyable watch for me, it is a movie that i like a lot more when i think abt the journey as a whole. the mundaneness helps to make it more of a slice of life, and does a good job of taking you from the innocence and hope of prewar, to the violence and cruelty of the soldiers’ experience, and then to the irreversible change and trauma of the individuals returning home. so while i didnt enjoy the watch, i cant say that it didnt take me on a realistic path that a lot of americans went through. the third act is definitely painful, both in its boringness at times but more importantly in the pain of the main characters who began the story as relatable young people. i did feel the roulette stuff was a little silly at times, especially at the end as i cant see how it was advantageous for robert de niro to engage at all, and i think christopher walkens ending could have been done in a more impactful way. still, the movie left me with a really dreary and dreadful feeling that made me feel it deserved a better rating than i originally felt.",3.5

"A simpler time, when the good guys drank Rolling Rock and the bad guys drank Miller.
Some very impressive parts to this but altogether I don’t know that I found it that moving. I’m sure I’d have felt differently as a viewer when it first came out, only a few years after the Vietnam War still fresh in everyone’s minds. My favorite part of this movie was the first third which did a great job of establishing this crew of friends and their robust blue collar life and community, blemishes and all. I think this movie is working at its best when it’s capturing all these details and glances at the margins of the frame (the flirtatious girl at the dance, or the fight over the phone).
It’s hard not to appreciate Cimino’s style. I’ve only seen two of his films so far, but I really enjoy his raw messiness, his baroque maximalism. It’s interesting to compare with Coppola. Watching this movie I was constantly thinking of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, both of which I prefer to this one but I appreciate them more in contrast by seeing how Coppola makes choices that Cimino differs on. Particularly, Coppola’s blocking and editing and how he uses both masterfully to reinforce the narrative of a scene. This movie felt like a directors cut filled to the gills with Cimino’s precious scenes. I really think you could edit this down to a better film that’s probably in the 150 minute range. For some reason, would really love to see the Friedkin version of the Vietnam scenes, especially with the European guy.
Love the shot after the wedding of the three guys walking down the street on top of the hill. Also love the wedding reception and the dancing. I really appreciate Cimino’s love for using as many extras as possible and I think it adds tremendously to the texture of the world. I think he takes it from Kurosawa. But at the same time, I would’ve appreciated that more selectively. When everything is dialed to a 10, you eventually stop hearing.",3.0

"A tragic yet powerful film about the effects the brutality of war can do to the soldiers involved and how such soldiers try to cope with such effects.
The three main characters’ transformations from cheerful and rowdy to solemn shells of themselves was heartbreaking, especially that of the character Nick. It gets even more tragic in comparison to the friends who stayed behind, who are still cheerful and rowdy in contrast to the more thoughtful Mike.
The Russian Rollete scenes were always suspenseful and never boring, as they really made the audience feel the weight of the situation. My brother and I were watching the film, giving some commentary about it, but those rollete scenes made us pay attention. The final rollete scene shunned us to silence for a couple of minutes after it was over.

Falando especificamente desse filme, a mensagem de como uma guerra pode provocar problemas sérios na mente de soldados é incrível, e como o governo americano não se importa muito em cuidar do lado mental desses ex soldados que vem de guerra. O Cimino nesse quesito foi muito bem. Sem contar que nos filmes mainstream americanos atuais é difícil a gente ver relações humanas como vista na primeira hora de filme entre os personagens.

"Though this one takes a while to get going, it's one of the most intense and demented war pictures one is ever likely to see. The first portion of the film is about three friends, Michael, Nick and Steven who are all from a small town. They all go deer hunting, and we follow the drama in their love lives and daily existence learning about them in their normalcy before things change. Once they enlist to go to Vietnam things go from decent to depressing as most suffer horrible fates once captured by the enemy. It's very hard to watch in places, and the thing is the acting is so superb that it feels real. Also getting to know these Men in daily life adds an extra dimension to the characters and makes this all the more shocking. It's one of the ultimate anti-war films and although quite epic it's more than worth it. Just be patient as everything does have a point, and this is one of those films that one never forgets after viewing. A cinematic triumph that is not only disturbing but it really does relay the horrors of war that were often unspoken.",4.5

The tonal shift of this film is absolutely soul-crushing, to the point where the final 3rd of the film is completely devoid of solace.

Too many chaotic scenes of blokes drinking, dancing and fighting that don’t advance the plot or say anything meaningful. And I have to say, I don’t get on very well with De Niro in that mode. There are better moments when they return from Nam, good storytelling depicting the men each losing something to the war, but by that point it’s already died a bit of a death.",2.5
"hits hard, but like a blunt hammer - I think the end lacks some complexity, it turns into too much of a morality play by the end, with a stoic American hero merely observing the horrors that befall his fellow countrymen. 
That said there are some bits that highlight and elevate the material - the opening wedding sequence is infused with a dramatic irony and the detail of them being Russian is a lovely touch. The Russian roulette stuff is also a great device, and the fact that in the original script it wasn’t connected to the war seems inconceivable, given how well one informs the other.",3.0

I'm honestly a big fan of this, I think it's such a good classic but it's really shitty in many ways, like you will get close to nothing out of this as a history film due to the historical inaccuracy, but as a drama film? As for the performances? It's amazing, it feels so real, the wedding part is my favorite it just makes me so happy but from there it all goes south and I get sad so it's not fun anymore. I honestly think it's really worth the three hours of your day that it'll take, there are many iconic moments and well there's De Niro that's always a plus

Wasn't disappointed by the actual film just the pacing which is hard to get through at times most memorably the wedding sequence which drags on for ages.
The acting is obviously outstanding Robert De Niro is truly one of the greats and i am now experiencing that.
7.9/10",4.0
"IMDB top 250 challenge 51/111.
Let's look at 2 common views about The Deer Hunter that I cannot get behind:
1. ""It's boring"" What? The 3 stages of the characters never allowed me to be bored at all. The first part of the wedding and the friendship amongst everyone had me enjoying myself so much I wasn't prepared for the 2 massive gut punches that followed. And believe me, there's nothing boring going on during and after Mike's stint in Vietnam.
2. ""It's too long"" Looking back at the history of film, there are so many productions put to screen that are around the 3 hour mark. Yes, that is a long time to sit and watch something, however, it is all down to what you do in that time. Cimino never wastes much screen time as the 3 vets go through physical and mental changes. I was always engaged with what was going on and never felt it dragging at all. If you don't like long films best to avoid things like the LOTR trilogy, Schindler's List, The Green Mile and The Wolf Of Wall Street (don't actually - they're all great).
Granted that this is told from one side and doesn't necessarily have a balance to it. I took it as being from Mike's perspective and his experiences around that time. De Niro carries a lot of the story by having the most screen time but let's not forget the ever impressive Christopher Walken who gets to show off his skills as a trained dancer even if it was part of a drunken escapade at a wedding. The flick of the switch in the latter stages is where he really begins to crank things up in what is now an iconic (and sometimes parodied) scene.
I would argue that there are a couple of moral issues as to how all of the Vietnamese people were portrayed on screen and also unchecked domestic abuse which felt like it was put in there for the sake of it.
Over the course of 3ish hours you'll feel elated, horrified and then emotionally wrecked by the end. A very good anti-war film despite some of its moral flaws.",4.0

La película tarda en arrancar 1h15 y no precisamente por desarrollar personajes (esa boda..). Luego, tras 20 minutos en el fango, se va a las tres horas con poca justificación, ya que aparte del drama psicológico de los dos protagonistas que si está bien dibujado, todo lo que rodea a Streep no está contado con naturalidad y se extiende de manera anodina. En general, muy irregular para mí gusto. Eso sí, recomiendo la intra historia del rodaje y ese acto de amistad por parte de Robert hacia Meryl y el difunto John Cazale.",2.5

This unique film directed by Micheal Cimino is truly something to remember. I knew that it would be great, but it turned out to be so very much more than just that.
With an unforgettable cast including Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage and Meryl Streep; the acting was phenomenal. 
One of the most touching aspects of this film was actually the music. One particular stand alone piece being so very memorable with each scene it follows. With one of the most tense and emotionally acted scenes I’ve ever seen in film, and a painfully amazing climax, the narrative flows seamlessly.
I love this film, and I will never forget this first time watching it and how much it’s affected me emotionally. Personally, I feel that it deserves to stand among the very best of cinema.

It’s crazy that so many people have retroactively decided that this movie is bad. Yeah, the politics are kind of murky, but there is so much beauty in this movie that I’m willing to accept that.  One thing I didn’t notice the first time I watched this is how this movie focuses on noise—industrial noise, combat noise, nature noise, wedding noise.  Apparently the composer of the soundtrack wrote the music to match the pitch of the ambient noise of the movie so it would fade in and out with the sounds of explosions and stuff. Very cool way to approach scoring a movie. It also makes the quiet scenes stand out even more.",4.0
"The Deer Hunter oder bei uns ""Die durch die Hölle gehen"" ist ein Epos, das die Euphorie auf den Vietnamkrieg und die daraus entstehenden grausamen Folgen zeigt.
Michael, Nick und Steven sind gute Freunde und arbeiten zusammen in einer Fabrik in einer Kleinstadt. Alle drei haben sich freiwillig für den Krieg rekrutieren lassen, und ihre letzten Tage stehen bevor. Steven heiratet und zusammen machen die drei einen ihrer Jagdausflüge. Doch in Vietnam angekommen, merken sie schnell, dass ihr Leben auf dem Spiel steht, und die Chance nach Hause zu kommen gleich bei 0 ist.
Michael Cimino erschuf hier einen Anti-Kriegsfilm, der sich zum größten Teil gar nicht mit dem eigentlichen Schauplatz des Grauen beschäftigt, sondern die körperliche und vor allem physische Belastung der Soldaten in der Gefangenschaft sowie dem Leben nach dem Einsatz zeigt. Cimino teilt das Geschehen dabei in drei Akte, die von Freude, Angst bis zur Trauer übergehen.
Christopher Walken gibt eine wirklich beeindruckende Darbietung ab, und zeigt uns als Zuschauer wie qualvoll dies für alle Beteiligten damals gewesen sein muss. Verdient hat er sich den Oscar hier zu Recht. Ebenfalls dabei ist Robert de Niro und was soll ich noch sagen, der Mann überzeugt in so vielen verschiedenen Rollen, er kann einfach alles spielen. Die weibliche Nebenrolle wird von Meryl Streep verkörpert und auch sie liefert ab.
Die Musik wurde von Stanley Myers komponiert und lädt uns trotz all der Tragik zum Träumen ein.
Die Bildqualität ist dabei gerade im ersten Drittel in den eher hellen Szenen ganz gut und hat nur in ein paar vereinzelten dunklen Szenen ein paar Schwächen. Schärfe ist auf einem soliden Niveau, wobei gerade Close-ups etwas besser kein könnten, aber wirklich meckern kann man hier nicht in Anbetracht der 45 Jahre, die der Film nun schon alt ist. Hier habe ich schon schlimmeres gesehen.
Der Ton ist dabei leider nicht so wirklich gut, und Dialoge sind trotz der tollen Synchronsprecher teilweise sehr dumpf und wirklich Surround Sound kommt nie auf. Schade eigentlich.
Ein toller Film, der mit interessanten Charakteren überzeugt, sich aber zu Beginn für meinen Geschmack wirklich zu viel Zeit nimmt und dadurch sehr langatmig ist.
Sehenswert ist The Deer Hunter für alle Fans von De Niro oder Anti-Kriesgfilmen aber natürlich trotzdem.",3.5
"I decided to watch one of the big ones today (well okay I started it yesterday and finished it today), so how do I feel about this best picture winner?
Overall I thought it was okay, about halfway through the film is when my interest peaked, everything else just fell into place per se. When it ended I was looking back at the film thinking, ""Hmm, did that first hour of character build-up really need to be an hour long, those elongated scenes of the wedding and the trick of letting their friend back in the car only to speed away?"".
Also, I was surprised at how the Vietnam stuff only comes down to three scenes, the intro, the Russian roulette scene, and the chopper rescue. Not a complaint but just an interesting observation, I didn't expect the Vietnam war film to feature so few set pieces of the actual war.
Directing and cinematography wise this movie knocks it out of the park, when that one mirror shot happened, I was instantly thinking of that other mirror shot in Bobby Zee's Contact, wouldn't be surprised if that was a direct influence. Then there's the amazing forest establishing shots that have this wonder smokey light fog across the image provided by Mr. Zsigmond, and you can't forget the steelwork in the intro with the lava and sparks flying everywhere. That little acoustic theme tune by Stanley Myers is beautiful and fits the mood for the easy-going civilian life so well.",3.0

All the A-listers in this - De Niro, Walken, Streep - are such babies! Nevertheless, they're fantastic and a big part of what makes it work so well. This is very long - I've been to actual weddings shorter than the wedding scene. But it's effective and so well directed. Every scene works and is necessary. It's so beautiful to look at and portrays the era and emotions so well. War is Hell. American imperialism corrupts to an absolute degree both within its borders and around the world.

"Of all the films about the Vietnam War, The Deer Hunter breaks my heart the most. Even though it predates all of the biggest films made about that war--Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Operation Dumbo Drop--it was still more interested in the people's lives before and after the war than the war itself (the second act of the film showing the war is the briefest portion of the film). Focusing on the impact that the war has on the soldiers and their friends and families makes this movie's impact so much stronger.
I've had conversations with friends that feel like the pre-war sequences run on too long, especially the wedding, but the wedding is actually one of the reasons I love the movie so much. We spend such an immersive amount of time living with these characters, having a good time with them, but knowing the shit-storm that's on the horizon, that it's beautiful and tragic at the same time. We know that it will never be this way again. They all have fun, and it feels like they actually are at a wedding, getting drunk and dancing (the booze they drank was real and the scene was filmed over five days), but every now and then--when they run into a soldier in the bar who has returned home from the war, when a pal plays a somber tune on the piano--it shocks them back to the reality that they are about to leave and some of them might not be coming back.
All war movies force me to reflect on my dad, and what it must have been like as a Marine over there in the conflict, but none more than The Deer Hunter. Seeing characters so irrevocably changed by what they saw, that it spills over into their families, makes me think how lucky our family was that he got to come back at all. I mean, the family wouldn't be here at all if he hadn't, but it also makes me grateful that he was the type of person who could hold all of that traumatic shit inside of him while maintaining an at least somewhat normal family life. So many soldiers don't get that. Even ones that make it home still leave so much of themselves back in the jungle, or desert, or beach.
A time-spanning story with many great characters, incredible performances all around, and a final scene that gets me choked up every time, make The Deer Hunter an all-timer for me. It's one that just leaves me staring at the screen for a few minutes after it's over every time I watch it. Grateful for movies that can have that impact on me.",5.0

"I last saw this movie about 20 years ago on VHS and all I remembered was the long ass wedding scene. I also kinda remember the weird special effect where — when characters successfully shoot themselves in the head — blood spurts like a garden hose out of the bullet hole, not the exit wound. Was that what the bandanas were for??
It may be because I know too much about the making of this movie, but something about it feels deeply inauthentic. It seems like man set about making a Very Serious Movie and then managed to convince everyone he had (with the help of marketing genius Allan Carr). It's the American Beauty of its time – capturing the fucked vibes of the era with startling emotional accuracy, while somehow feeling totally insincere and borderline fraudulent*
But the images Vilmos Zsigmond captured are so incredible they're almost profane. And what Cimino pulled off (in the Vietnam segments especially) demonstrates a proficiency with scale that probably only of a handful of directors have ever achieved (Griffith, Ford, Cameron). I just think it's insane that a movie can move you on a spiritual level while simultaneously insulting your intelligence. I'm starting to think that may be the Cimino Signature™️

*Not really borderline. Cimino lied about the genesis of the idea. He said it was his original concept. It actually came from a comedy spec script about two buddies who do Russian roulette in Vietnam (lol). He also insinuated that he served in the Vietnam War when he was only a reservist years before. He insisted that there were press clippings about instances of Russian roulette really happening in Vietnam but refused to show them to anyone. Then he tried to steal credit from the guy he hired to write the new, darker version of the script. The background of a movie is usually incidental imho, but one that draws emotional power from its apparent authenticity does lose something when you realize the dude who made it was literally, if not artistically, kind of a fraud.",3.0

"In a vacuum, The Deer Hunter is perhaps a good movie. The characters are believable, the cinematography is good, and the plot flows somewhat well, although even the most patient viewers will probably find certain parts to be overly slow.
However, I choose to give this movie one star because of the broader context under which it was made. To be clear, I am referring to the perverse falsification of the history of the Vietnam War that began to take place not long after the war's end. While the plot of The Deer Hunter is not quite as absurd as later movies like Rambo (a revanchist power fantasy featuring an American with almost superhuman abilities slaughtering armies of Vietnamese in order to find POWs that, in all likelihood, didn't exist in real life), as it was made in 1978, when America was still grappling with its loss in Vietnam, it is still fundamentally propagandistic in many ways. The clearest examples of this unsurprisingly come during the scenes that take place in Vietnam. The first thing viewers see there is a village being destroyed, and civilians massacred, by a communist Vietnamese soldier. Shortly after that, the protagonists of the film become prisoners of the Vietnamese and are forced to play Russian roulette by their sadistic captors. While both scenes are hardly out of place for a war movie, even if they give a quite one-sided view of the war, it was not lost on me that both scenes resembled pictures that, to many, portrayed the brutality of the Americans and the South Vietnamese: the first scene echoed pictures and stories of what happened at My Lai, while the second had a moment resembling the famous video of a communist sympathizer being shot by a South Vietnamese military officer in Saigon.
Moments like those mentioned above reveal the ideological substance of The Deer Hunter. As most know, the Vietnam War became less and less popular the longer it dragged on; by the later years of the war, it was hardly just left-wing college students or radical Maoist organizations that were opposed to American involvement in Vietnam. Among other things, extensive media coverage of the war is often credited with this. Even those who did not have any male relatives serving in Vietnam could hardly avoid seeing the news about death counts and atrocities committed during the war. And, while the stories about those returning from Vietnam being spit on or called 'baby-killers' are often overblown, it is true that pictures like those mentioned in the previous paragraph exposed many to the truth of how the United States was conducting its war in Vietnam. As the war ended, many were discontent with how the US had lost and/or how they had been lied to by their government. In light of this, The Deer Hunter's reversal of such imagery is made all the more insidious, portraying the Vietnamese as the ones responsible for such atrocities and the American occupiers as the primary victims of their aggression. The movie's end, featuring the main characters sitting together singing 'God Bless America', says it all; it is meant to show ""real Americans"" unified in their love for their country and their sadness over the defeat in Vietnam. (No idea how people think that was supposed to be ironic or an argument against jingoism tbh)
Finally, it would be wrong for me to not mention the racist portrayal of the Vietnamese in the film. While almost all American-made movies about Vietnam are centered around American soldiers, the Vietnamese in this film are little more than either props or sadistic villains, designed to show Americans the 'barbarism' of their former enemy. The second to last scene almost seems to imply that Nick has become debased and 'savage' as a result of being in Saigon for so long, playing such games; while such criticisms could also be levied against Apocalypse Now, in that one, it was more strongly implied that Col. Kurtz was always capable of such things, while in The Deer Hunter, it is portrayed as Nick losing his humanity because of being in Vietnam.",1.0

"Self Anointed Film Critics (SAFC)
Week one - Nicholas (Niko)

Proper war movie
The degradation of the three main characters lives hits hard.
Countries recruit naive ill prepared soldiers to fight and die for stained ideology. From excitement to anticipation to extreme loss. The 3 yutes became like the guy in the green beret, he knew not to say anything of them because they wouldn't listen and need to experience war to fully understand.
Michael goes from the 'hunter' to a man who can no longer shoot a deer - life holds so much weight for him. The beauty of combat and killing are gone.
Michael hates Stan for carrying a gun as he knows he uses to prey on the weak and give him an ego stroke for his own insecurities.
Segue: Stan would never point his gun or threaten anyone who he deems superior.
Stan never went to war, he doesn't understand the violence and turmoil the others went through that's why he brandishes his gun about like a fool.
Michael tries to bring everyone back home but fails to do so because everyone has suffered massively due to the war.
Nicky suffers from survivor's guilt and the mental capability to remember his loved ones. He couldn't bare to face the ones he cares about in a fractured state. Russian roulette was his way to numb the anguish and dance with death because he knows he should be dead already if it weren't for Michael.
Stevie lost his limbs, can't work and is traumatised by survivor's guilt. As soon as he returned, he knew he didn't fit - he can't resume work, he can't relate to anyone as nobody else went to the war except his two mates presumed dead and he's haunted by the presence of a child that ain't his own. He ran to war because Angela, his wife, was having a baby that weren't his own and what he ran away from eventually caught up with him. Veteran hospital he doesn't feel so alone.
Michael trying to save Nicky and Nicky taking his own life because it is all too much stresses the multitude of effects that the war had. Only Nicky died but many lives where negatively affected such as Linda is left without Nicky - the man she loved and Stan whom continually loses the respect of the others because he didn't go to the war.
Ending with the national anthem is showing how patriotism is radicalism through Rose tinted glass and has such an abject effect on the world (fall of saigon), capitalism (Nicky practically nearing death every day and sending money to Stevie until he died as well as the nurses laughing when they drop medicine on the floor which they will eventually give to vets that risked the lives) and communities (Michael and that small town in Pennsylvania).",5.0

Lembro que quando assisti a Circle of Danger do Tourneur sai melancólico e cabisbaixo, disse que era o filme definitivo desse sentimento de mal estar e impotência da guerra - lá relacionado a 2ª WW. Porém, The Deer Hunter é tão massacrante quanto. Ainda estou engatinhando na filmografia de Cimino, mas já é perceptível seu interesse pelo proletário e pelo marginal desse Estados Unidos ainda ressacado das turbulências dos anos 60 e que encara um caminhão de perturbações políticas que implodiram na virada de década.
Seus 3 protagonistas são a cara da Nova Hollywood, com complexidades que desafiam qualquer arquétipo e provocam desconforto a cada decisão tomada. A volta ao Vietnã por Michael é perturbadora, mas ao mesmo tempo necessária para enfrentar seus demônios, atravessar a barca do inferno e revisitar seus traumas. É difícil até pensar outro filme que crie um gatilho tão poderoso e simbólico em um ato repetitivo ao longo da obra como a roleta russa aqui. A cada clique na arma, uma tonelada de traumas é liberada e sentimos o peso daquilo.
É difícil dizer que é um filme SOBRE a guerra, quando Cimino faz questão de reforçar as semelhanças entre todos os espaços que seus personagens interagem. O fogo da indústria e o fogo do Vietnã, as fumaças das montanhas e as que pairam sobre a guerra, o mal-estar indigesto dos ambientes e das relações e tudo mais.

A group of working-class friends decides to enlist in the Army during the Vietnam War and finds it to be hellish chaos – not the noble venture they imagined.
This is one of those movies that I just don’t understand the love for. I mean it’s got some good stuff in it. The acting, cinematography and a lot of memorable scenes. The entire cast is extremely good and stacked. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep being the big ones. A lot of the cinematography especially the outdoor shots were all insanely beautiful. The direction by Michael Cimino is great and it shows in a number of scenes. This film is filled with plenty of good moments especially character moments.
Unfortunately it’s also filled with a ton of filler that it overstuffs the film and creates an absurdly long runtime. Almost a third of the film was dedicated to a wedding and there were plenty of scenes of what was supposed to be character development dialogue but in reality it was just meandering filler. There’s a lot of great moments but there’s also a lot of unneeded moments.",3.0

Zwar sind die Szenen in Vietnam (Die im Krieg und die in dem Russian Roullet Club) fantastisch und haben eine ganz andere Atmosphäre, so finde ich die restlichen Momente langatmig, leider auch langweilig. Gerade die Party Szene am Anfang geht gefühlt eine Stunde und sie will auch einfach nicht aufhören. Hinten raus zieht sich der Streifen dann auch wieder, gerade bevor es nochmal nach Vietnam geht und er wieder zurück kommt. Die 186 Minuten sind einfach absolut unangemessen und machen den Film viel schlechter als er ist. Es hätte so viel raus gekonnt was die Spannung ausbremst. Dennoch ist der Film am Ende gut. Das liegt an den fantastischen Darstellern und den harten Vietnam Szenen die fast schon nicht zu ertragen sind. Da wird der Film rau, brutal und sentimental.

A lot of the sections I could connect with were so far apart and strangely put together nonetheless. Really just generally inaccurate and shitty depiction of the Viet Cong/Vietnamese.

I felt like I had such an intimate awareness of who these people were and what their lives were like before they went to Vietnam and were, for the most part, destroyed. When I first watched it, all I cared about were the Vietnam scenes, which are, admittedly, still phenomenal upon rewatching, but this time around, all of their lives at home resonated so much more.

The Russian Roulette scenes in this are genuinely some of the most tense and stressful scenes I’ve ever had to sit through. I think I held my breath for the majority of the Vietnam segment. De Niro, Walken and Cazale all gave S tier performances and huge props to Michael Cimino for his direction. He somehow managed to make a 3hr film feel like your average runtime. The characters and their stories were so brilliantly constructed that it helped propel the film forward without ever feeling draggy, accompanied by the great score and cinematography I was so invested I never once thought “How much longer is left?” so kudos for that. I also applaud Cimino’s ability to balance both beauty and intensity between all 3 acts, showing things like the basic human instinct to crave and provide comfort while also delivering a very harrowing portrayal of PTSD and learning to face the burden of responsibility after war. Lots to take away from this and lots to love. Really fantastic film.",4.0

The actors, from De Niro, Walken and Savage as the doomed young soldiers to Meryl Streep's reserved performance as Linda and even Rutanya Alda as Angela, all of the people in this film sell the tragedy of it all.

"There’s a lot of fat on this, and most of it feels like it’s there just so that the cut to Vietnam feels as jarring as it does. There are also underdeveloped characters (Steve) and subplots (Linda, who has a light shed upon her but not in a way that feels a little dim), as well as a need to suspend disbelief, which isn’t always the greatest thing for a commentary.
That being said, I was taken by so much of it once the wedding stuff passed. The central scene and what followed is the heart of it, and is what really worked for me in the end. They definitely could’ve cemented the ending better but the events of it quickly became an integral part to giving closure to the narrative.

For the first major film about Vietnam, the war scenes weren’t super defined, which is/isn’t there mid fault. The performances are really great! De Niro had proven to us that he was a force to be reckoned with. But Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep quickly shot up as talents to look out for. Streep shines in her briefs scenes, prepping us for the career that is to come. This is still Christopher Walken’s greatest performance.

"It's once again a long time ago since I saw this film. I don't remember exactly when I saw it for the first time, but it must have been more than 12 years ago. But what shocked me about watching it this time is that there are still some stills that I still remembered. The film gave me a big impact of watching it for the first time. And I find that incredible if a film can do that to me. This film tells the story of a group of six friends. One of them is going to marry, while also going to serve in Vietnam. Two of his other friends are about to serve in Vietnam as well. And the film shows what a war can do to a human being, and how much of an impact it can if on your friends. This time of watching the film I noticed how incredible the opening of the film is. It opens very quietly. The film shows a couple of shots of a town in Pennsylvania. And it made me feeling living in this city. The first hour of the film is basically an introduction to all the main characters. And this part of the story showed me how great of a time they can have together. I must say that I found the first act a little too long. After 40 minutes I understood what the story is meaning to tell. And I love the scene with the soldier during the wedding. That moment showed already a little glimpse of how much you can change after serving in the war. But most of the first hour is very interesting.
What I will never forget is the entire sequence that plays out in Vietnam. I also totally forget that the action is very thrilling to watch. And yes, this is basically the most famous sequence of the entire film. I don't want to write too much about it, but I personally see it as one of the most thrilling and nervous sequences I have ever seen. I bite my nails whenever I hear a click of a gun. It's just so nerve-wracking. After the Vietnam sequence, the film goes back to home, The United States. And this part shows you clearly that everyone has changed. Even the people that didn't go to the war. This film shows in such a good way how desperate and alone someone can feel after fighting in a war. I almost forget to mention how great the cast is in the film. I personally think that everyone is great in this film. I love seeing John Cazale in the film. It's very sad to see that this was his last role. I love him as an actor, and I really liked his character in this film. He is in my opinion quite a disturbing character, but I loved how Cazle played him. Meryl Streep as Linda is such a real person. The way how she reacts to several moments feels so real. I should say, most of the dialogue feels very realistic. I believe that all these actors are friends in real life, they feel like real characters. This is one of those films that I do recommend watching. It's in the end hard to watch, but it is for me a very powerful film. The film has some slower pacing moments, but it does work for its story. And wow, the ending is incredibly powerful. I reminded the ending very well, and it still hit me. It's one of those endings I will not forget, and that makes it in my opinion a very strong film.",4.0

The best part of the Deer Hunter has to be its emotional undercurrent and simmering tension. While lots of this film takes place in quiet stretches of Philadelphia the aching pain of war pierces through the environment. Hundred of thousands of miles away from where The Deer Hunter’s most exciting scenes of death and violence take place. Vietnam isn’t portrayed by great set pieces of mass fire and gun shots. The greatest scenes in Vietnam are still all interpersonal. Mental games. Metal over mind and body. One gun. One bullet. Cimino’s masterwork,4.5
"one of the most emotional and beautiful depictions of the trauma and dehumanization that war brings.
the film most effectively shows this via the use of Russian Roulette. the game is the thing that sparks the post-war psychological damage of the 3 men. it's a game of life or death. this idea of life and death being controlled by one shot is what the meat of the film is. Russian Roulette both represents war and its long-lasting effects on soldiers.
after the war effort is over, the game that nearly brought these men to their demise doesn't seem to leave them. even after they leave the war, DeNiro and Walken continue to seek out the events. even after almost dying from it as the most brutal and amazingly acted scene in the film showed earlier. they're drawn to it like moths to a flame. war never really leaves. it sticks to soldiers like glue and feeds on their minds until they're nothing but husks of what they once were. not being able to recognize anyone or anything but the act that sent you spiraling in the first place. the event that was life or death in one shot.
the use of the song ""God Bless America"" at the end is ironic. after the nation sent these men out, destroyed any and all semblance of their being, and still managed to not get anywhere against the fight of communism in the long run, everyone still treats what happened to these men as an act of patriotism. to them, it was this great country that destroyed them forever, but that's the price to pay for freedom. it's the nail in the coffin for how utterly screwed up this country and its treatment of foreign affairs has always been.
a beautiful film with the best performance by Christopher Walken i've ever seen. despite some dodgy treatment of how Vietnamese people are represented in the film, which most of the actors and crew have apologized for, the film remains one of the best war films out there. another one to add to the list of films you should show any child who wishes to become a soldier when they grow up :D",5.0
"After the first two acts I felt like this was on for a solid 4.5 and was wondering where the pacing issues I’d seen mentioned were. Then the film seemed to run out of fuel. Not to say the third act is bad, or even not good, in anyway, but it really felt like it took a hit when compared to the previous two. The story was wrapped up great but it didn’t feel as engaging as previously; the acting was still amazing but I definitely felt it missed a certain actor’s performance for most of it and the pacing definitely felt like it had drifted away from that sweet spot the film had nailed previously. In the final 20 minutes the film is back to its best though but the other 40/50 minutes really detracted from the film as a whole - though that says more about the standard it set for itself than it does that section. Overall though, most things were amazing and I would be remiss for not mentioning the quality of the acting. One of my favourite De Niro performances I’ve seen, though I felt Christopher Walken’s topped it and the rest of the cast wasn’t far behind. Definitely a must-watch film for anyone though it does require carving out quite a chunk of time for it.

"The Deer Hunter by Michael Cimino can cause an impact with his images that shows the evident change of the characters, friendship, circumstances, acts, war, although beyond it being a movie of the war genre, it is more like the ravages that leaves the same, after all that, the war breaks everything.

It's decent. The first hour was really good. Although definitely slow, it really helped me connect to the characters. Then Vietnam happens, and there is a really great scene in a Vietnamese prison hut which I'm sure most people have heard of. That's the turning point of the film for me. After that, everything starts becoming less and less interesting. All the work the first hour spent developing the characters, slowly starts to trickle away. By the last hour of the film, I didn't really care about any of the characters. I'd lost almost all interest. It did save itself a bit towards the end and that final scene was chilling (gotta love a freeze frame), but overall it left me with a mixed feeling about the whole film. Like I said, it's decent.

"So weirdly I always assumed there was an intense reverence for this film considering its legendary status in cinema history even if it isn't as talked about as other films who've won Best Picture. In fact, as I've scanned reviews I was surprised to find many have lukewarm to negative feelings about it. Me, personally, I find myself somewhere in between. I agree with those that claim the wedding section too long and war section too short and find the almost exclusive focus on Russian Roulette while iconic a little puzzling. However, I must say what it was mainly set out to do it did perfectly. Namely, it displayed how we in America in specific small town USA toxically romanticizes military service without acknowledging the horrors of war. In fact, it does a great job in naming specifically who (lower class, blue collar America) are the victims of this and ultimately are the sacrificial lambs for many unjustified wars such as Vietnam and Iraq. Other than that, it then shows perfectly how those who've experienced war then are influenced negatively by it in the form of PTSD and reclusiveness and positively in the form of having a higher respect for safety, weaponry and human lives in general. Simply put, ""The Deer Hunter"" is not a perfect film by any means, but it was at the time an astounding reflection of what many of our veterans were lead to believe and what tragically affected them afterward.",4.0
"For a three hour film The Deer Hunter really does take some peculair liberties with its time management. Sometimes nothing truly stands out, yet scenes tend to drag on endlessly. As a result the surprisingly short Vietnam segment feels absurdly rushed and weirdly placed for such a pivotal part of the story. There is abundant setup but ultimately the only pay-off that's even remotely worthwhile is the final Christopher Walken one. Still, even then you can't help but wonder whether or not you might just have been tricked by the allure of a classic film that unfortunately just didn't seem to live up to its reputation.",2.5

As much as I love FMJ and Apocolypse Now, (my runners up) this is without a doubt the best war movie of all time. It’s so much more than just a war movie though. It’s so emotionally devastating and so human, it really does mean so much to me. For a film that came out in 1978 it really does touch on incredibly important subjects that were practically unheard of back in them days. The acting is so emotionally raw and realistic that it feels like it is actually happening. If you haven’t watched this movie and your a fan of war movies with a deeper meaning then there is nothing I can recommend more.",5.0
"Some thoughts:
-- This is still one of the most genuinely emotionally shattering movies I've ever seen.
-- As with almost every movie, I'm torn between wanting to apply repressed homoerotic analysis and recognising that this lens does devalue the importance of supporting equally important readings of non-romantic intimate homosocial relationships between heterosexual men. That being said, I'm taking bets on who is more closeted: Mike or Nick.
-- I've never really bought into the idea of this movie as…",4.5
"A classic epic that has many problems and contradictions. Scenes go on interminably, although it doesn't drag. The central theme of Russian roulette is an effective metaphor for war in general and the Vietnam conflict in particular, but it doesn't seem remotely believable. For a war film, the very long Act 1 showing the poetry of ordinary life in a small Pennsylvania steel town is probably the most engaging. The music is wistful, tear-jerking, powerful, but there are good party tunes as well. Most of it is over-earnest, sometimes to the point of being laughable, and the final climax is ridiculous and powerfully affecting at the same time. The message, that war fucks you up, is banal but the huge canvas, and De Niro's performance, make it powerful.
The treatment of Vietnamese and female characters is fairly shameful—they are there purely to point up the noble struggle and male bonding of the American men. Hardly surprising in a movie from 1978, although I watched Baby Driver (2017) a few days ago, and its treatment of women is no better.
The slow-paced wide-screen cinematography, with loads of sweeping panoramic detail, is a treat, and I would see it on a big screen if the opportunity ever arose.",0.0

"The Deer Hunter is nothing short of a devastating humanist masterpiece, and one of the last great american epics of the new hollywood era. michael cimino's meticulous directorial craftsmanship and magnificent screenplay (co-written with deric washburn) provide an excellent framework which is filled in by some of the most outstanding performances put to film in the 1970s. robert de niro’s tortured performance, stoic but full of rage and hurt bubbling beneath the surface, is one of his best, and in my opinion should have won him best actor at the academy awards instead of jon voight. meryl streep received her first academy award nomination for this film, and is absolutely terrific every moment she’s on screen. christopher walken’s oscar winning performance is truly haunting, and still stands today as one of his best. filling out the cast are great actors such as george dzundza, john savage, and john cazale in what would be the final role of his short but legendary career. the fantastic cinematography by vilmos zsigmond makes this film one of the most visually stunning ones i’ve ever seen, and lends the film an element of beauty in even the most harrowing of scenes. this is without a doubt one of the most deserving best picture winners in oscars history, and is an absolute classic that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible.",5.0
"For some reason, in my memory this film is much better (and more enjoyable) than it is in reality. Probably because my brain does what should have been done in the editing suite, and cuts most of the first half. I get the need to establish character, but nothing of consequence happens. Just a bunch of irritating men messing around before going to Vietnam, and far too much of a wedding party. With smoke-filled realism of life in a Pennsylvania steel town.
Which then abruptly jumps to Vietnam. Certainly the iconic Russian roulette scenes are memorable (and there are some excellent performances), but there is so little to really hold it all together in a narratively satisfying way.

"Harrowing. Not many other films can make me squirm quite as much as this one did. The Russian roulette scenes feel endless, something I wasn’t expecting because I’ve seen them before (in snippets and YouTube clips), and yet they had me on the edge of my seat. That is some good filmmaking. 
Yet the film also feels endless for its runtime. The first hour is simply too long and massively underutilized. Much of it is cheerful yelling, dialogue drowned out in what is a show of friendship. Yet the characters are all too underdeveloped before shipping off, and only once they are in Vietnam is when we get to know them. This is a failing of the film and makes it feel so much longer than it is. 
Still, it is effective and a slough to get through—in the best and worst ways—and paints a picture of the inanity of war. Other films since have done better, with sharper more clear messaging (Apocalypse Now being one) but that doesn’t take away from this film. 
The depiction can be disputed, yet hindsight is always 20/20. It’s important to view this with modern cultural context, and sure, Hollywood probably knew better when depicting the North Vietnamese, but understanding its failings, yet still viewing it as a cultural artifact of its time is still important. Thats all I’ll say on that.
 The Deer Hunter is harrowing and endless. A testament to how effective cinema can be. Not without its faults, it paints a picture of citizens broken, trying to reconcile with themselves as they are broken down and attempt to puzzle themselves back together.",3.5
"The tragic slice-of-life drama about a group of Pennsylvania factory laborers and life-long friends who are shipped off to the horrors of the Vietnam War to… become embroiled in an underground Russian Roulette ring? This is one of those famous and beloved films that is much stranger than our collective cultural memory of it, an odd marriage of naturalism and metaphor that perhaps doesn’t cohere very elegantly but is an ambitious and noble attempt to explore war trauma through opposing cinematic techniques, all wrapped in an indulgent 3+ hour package.
One of the final films of the Hollywood New Wave* was a mega-hit that begins with an hour-long wedding. Even within the artistic freedom of 70’s studio pictures this is just about the loosest shaggiest opening act imaginable, in which every piece of minor footage seems to have been left in the final cut including lots of little moments involving characters who only show up sporadically for the remainder of the picture (or in the case of John Savage’s mom, never again). I feel like there’s a better 150-minute movie in here**, with Cimino clearly unable to part with footage that I would easily chop right out, but it’s not my film and I support an artist’s untampered vision. The remaining 2 hours have a tighter focus despite the split that occurs, the Vietnam sequences intentionally refusing to align themselves with the rural Pennsylvania material, allowing heightened (and sometimes action movie) extravagance to inorganically exist alongside quiet human observation.
The last 30 minutes, when its somehow become a suspense-noir to save Christopher Walken from the underground Russian Roulette ring, are so hypnotically weird it does eventually tip over into “what the fuck?” territory. Does this metaphor of American men forced to place a loaded gun to their heads make any sense when tied to such intimate character work? Because the film has taken such great pains to apply a gritty realism to its small Pennsylvania town and its people, then I guess I’m just supposed to accept that Vietnam is some evil irredeemable hellhole where large groups of maniacal men bet on human lives? In the framework of the reality the film has established this is complete nonsense (and 100% ahistorical) on top of being very racist. The blind spot of the Vietnamese experience is an issue in most American Vietnam War pictures, but it might be the worst here by painting every single Asian man in the film as a gambling savage who “terrifyingly” speaks their native language un-subtitled (gasp!). Doesn’t play so hot these days.
While there’s a lot to admire about its impeccable photography and the many fine performances from its talented cast, this is Freshman English class-level discourse lest you not get the important point it’s making about a generation of white*** American men destroyed inside and out. This aspires to be an all-time great film and doesn’t ever quite get there, but it’s emotional honesty and strong formal qualities are appreciated nonetheless.

"The Deer Hunter has to be one of the best films on the Vietnam War.
It's presented in three story arcs. The first arc revolves around the main characters who are waiting to go off into the war. The second arc is about them in the Vietnam War. The third arc explores them and the way the war has affected them mentally and physically.
The acting of the cast especially Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken were brilliant. Their characters, at the start of the film are just young, happy and innocent people eager to go off into war. These eager faces are quickly changed when they go into the chaos upfront. The psychological trauma they endure inflicts very devastating effects on their lives. Their very nature of combat has vanished away by the war.
The story was amazing too, gripping with realism although the wedding scenes were a bit long, I understand that they need to set up the characters, their relationships and so forth but it really takes its time. The war scenes and most notably the Russian roulette scenes were incredibly tense.
The ending felt really ironic in a kind of way. Melancholic too. The extreme loss they have faced due to their now failing nationalism really hits hard on the sad notes.
Coupled with that are stunning cinematography and a serene musical score which is the exact opposite feeling I felt watching this film that somehow fits with the film.",4.0

Way too little time is being devoted to the actual war, which I found to be a little odd. The performances are solid, but they aren't enough to…",2.0
"Even those who generally like this film aren't so keen on two components. They include: the extended Clairton scenes (which has a first act around the fifty minute mark!) and refusing to develop Nick's irretrievable state as a Russian roulette pro. Several viewings later and that's never been an issue for me. I think the former works as an insightful look into milltown life and carefree kinship, while the latter creates such a wrenching dissonance because of that shift when Mike's not recognized by his friend. If we're speaking about the Art of the Transition, that was Cimino's strength, both in its diligent rhythms and swift resonance.
One moment can somehow encapsulate that in unison. Such as the farewell (without anyone speaking a word) as Chopin's Nocturne No. 6 gets plaintively accompanied by the slow pan over their wistful faces. The jump-cut into Vietnam isn't just a grueling structural change, but a situational havoc that can sting so deep. What stupendous acting, too, as De Niro and Walken try to reduce their potential deaths with stifled laughter (but are repeatedly withdrawn to anger after the Viet Cong slaps them) while Savage can barely contain his psychotic fear in the cage. A bloodcurdling sequence which hasn't lost none of its power.
That's the catalyst in order to destroy them. Despite two of them leaving Vietnam, it's clear the horrors of what they've seen have lingered. (One instance that's intense is Mike holding Stan at gunpoint after he threatened Axel in a facetious way.) As for Steve, now an amputee, it's keeping a distance from Angela (among a veteran's ward while she's bedridden) that seems vivid because he doesn't feel comfortable back home. Rounding this up is Linda as the town's loneliest girl (and Streep's tender portrayal of a life on hold) as she waits for Nick's return or Mike's affections.
Which gets clarified as Mike visits her and that beautiful acoustic version of ""Cavatina"" is played. (It's just perfectly placed after he refuses to be celebrated by not attending the welcome home party.) Context leading up to that reunion does matter, though, even going back to Steve and Angela's wedding (and I'll agree with those who feel Cimino could've trimmed the ceremonial stuff) but will gladly praise how it doubles up as a farewell of idealistic patriotism gone awry. ""Fuck it"", a pensive Green Beret soldier says to Mike after being asked how Vietnam was, and it's a blunt reaction that he'll soon understand. Arrive home and even his eponymous ritual doesn't feel the same anymore.
The unnerving metaphor in Saigon (""One shot..."") can also serve as a delicate reminder for when Mike and Nick used to hunt deer. And it's evident that Zsigmond's superb photography can depict the feel of these two different environments. Much of the traumatic grime is coherently shown (e.g. a soldier detonates a bomb inside a cubbyhole of scared villagers) while the exquisite landscapes back in Pennsylvania reflect upon a river as mountains loom overhead. By the end, however, I'm so moved by its declaration of regular folks who are changed by irregular pressures. That's what makes it immense.",4.5
"This movie truly blew me away. The build up was a small touch slow but really important to the character development. Once you leave PA, nothing is the same and your anxiety levels will reach new heights. This movie made me feel so lucky to be a millennial.

Not a happy film but my favorite 70’s movie by far!!",4.5
"The first hour is quite slow as it introduces the charachters and their friendships and relationships, however it picks up quickly from the 2nd hour. De Niro is outstanding as usual supported by a phenomenal performance from Walken and I also felt the actor who played Stevie did a great job also. That Russian Roulette part is goated, De Niro was on fire during that scene. You definitely feel it’s runtime in the first hour, but great film once you get past it.",4.0
"This! Movie! oh my fucking god I’m in love with it, everything about this just works for me.
I personally thought that the idea of following each of the three leads after war worked really, really well. It allowed the viewer to see how even when they all started in the same place, the war changes everyone differently.
I think that it was also intesting how it was able to show one person that was completely mentally changed by their experience, one person who became disabled, and the only one that seemed to reintergrate into society struggled terribly with PTSD and was a changed man because of it, even if he seemed “better off” then the other two. 
I liked how each of these stories was told with the right amount of emotion needed, it really just worked well for me.",5.0
"I keep saying its rare that I like war films. This fits very well into my little box of war films I love. Mainly I think because its not about war, Vietnam is just a supporting character in this film, this film is about the lives it ruins and those it leaves behind. And it is so painfully beautifully done. I think trauma is very difficult to do well in film, as you dont have that first person perspective, inner monologue to say what anyone is feeling, it all has to be done subtlely, or you go too far and risk bashing your audience over the head with it. This gets that balance just right, especially in that final act.
There is a very defined three act structure here, and it never feels like it's rushing along to the next one. Act one we meet our three men who have signed up to go to war, in the days before they leave as one of them gets married, and one of the others offering to marry his girl when he returns home. This first act gives us all the little everyday things, the relationships, the quirks, everything that makes these people, their town, everything about them who they are. The middle third is their time at war itself, with that final third the aftermath and how it has changed the lives of everyone irrepairably. Not just the men coming home, but their families, their friends, partners, people around them in town. It is a very bleak and massively unpatriotic 'was it worth' it kind of approach to war. The film actually ends with a patriotic song. And it just...hurts. An ironic and hollow dig at war and sacrifice where nobody wins. Everybody loses.",5.0

As much as I loved the idea, the depiction of the war scenes with it's consequences on the people and ofcourse with brilliant character performances (Specially Streep and Bob) I wouldn't call this as a favourite of mine but a great watch nonetheless.",4.0

The first hour of the movie was kind of unnecessary but other than that, it was a compelling story about some friends fighting in a war and then dealing with PTSD. It really shows how much damage a war can cause and that PTSD is a real thing that needs to be treated as fast as possible!

This is truly amazing. The way Michael Cimino directs this masterpiece really made this an uncomfortable watch. While you can really feel the length of the film, it is still very good and I found myself completely emerged into the story. I was emotionally invested into the story and the characters were very good. But the best aspect has to be the acting. Christopher Walken delivers in of the best supporting performances of all time. And the rest of the cast is great as well. I am pretty positive that Robert De Niro will stay my favorite actor for a very long time. I haven't seen enough Meryl Streep, but I can see why she is considered to be the best actress of all time. The Russian roulette scenes were super emotional and gripping. Even though I knew that there were going to be these scenes, I didn't know what to expect at all. So yeah, very sad, emotional and perfect.

"Le pitture rupestri sono preziose testimonianze simboliche della vita dell'uomo sulla terra. La caccia e la morte sacrificale dell'animale sono le prime esperienze umane ad essere rappresentate sulle superfici delle caverne. La morte è un esperienza assoluta, inserita all'interno di antichi rituali sociali di caccia e sacrificio. Uccidere è impulso primario che, se simbolicamente elaborato, rappresenta un' azione significativa, solenne, indispensabile per ristabilire la distanza tra uomo e natura, tra il limite umano e l'infinito del cosmo. Se prima la caccia era necessità ritualistica adesso è scelta culturale. Una scelta non priva(ta) della legge ancestrale che impone all'uomo di non prevaricare sulla natura sconfinante. Di questo il cacciatore è sempre (stato) consapevole.

Michael: ""Uccidere o morire in montagna o nel Vietnam è esattamente la stessa cosa ma deve succedere lealmente.""
Nick: ""Come? Un colpo solo?""
Michael: ""Un colpo solo.""
Nick: ""Io non ci credo più tanto a questa storia del colpo solo, Mike.""
Michael: Tu devi contare solo su un colpo solo, il cervo non ha il fucile, deve essere preso con un colpo solo. Altrimenti non è leale"".
Un colpo solo come simbolo di un antico codice vincolante che regola il rapporto uomo natura. Un colpo solo come simbolo di alleanza virile tra uomo e natura. Questo patto è invalicabile finché c'è la pace, finché si può andare a caccia. Ma quando dalla caccia all'animale si passa alla caccia all'uomo, quel colpo solo può diventare simbolo di follia e dell'odio dell'uomo verso l'uomo. Può diventare Gioco di morte in cui, se non salta la testa, salta la psiche.
La Roulette Russa appare per la prima volta nel racconto ""Un Fatalista"" di Michail Jur'evič Lermontov (1840). Non ci vorrà molto affinché questa tremenda pratica si diffonda tra le truppe dell'esercito russo e nei commilitoni della legione straniera francese in Nord Africa: non si uccidono nemici ma si ""combatte"" la noia e la melanconia con la morte. La morte, spogliata dal suo significato originario è inscritta all'interno di una stupida prova di coraggio. E nel 1885, quando la Francia prenderà possesso del Vietnam, si diffonde in tutto il territorio dell' Indocina Francese. Ed è proprio la Roulette Russa il gioco che ritroveremo tra i VietCong, come beffa nei confronti dei nuovi invasori americani, subentrati ai francesi dal 1955.
Ci spostiamo nella provincia più profonda e grigia della Pennsylvania. La nebbia e le esalazioni scure delle fumerie delle acciaierie sono parte del contesto entro cui si svolge l'esistenza di cinque amici, figli di profughi russi. Sono vite banali, tediose ma genuine. Le loro storie si intrecciano tra i vapori dell'alcol, le partite di caccia e feste e matrimoni in cui si cerca di dimenticare quanto sia duro (r)esistere. Le loro giovani vite vengono improvvisamente buttate nel carnevale di sangue e di follia della guerra del Vietnam. Il Vietnam come palcoscenico storico in cui si inscena uno dei più grandi scontri culturali della storia dell'umanità: da una parte i figli del benessere occidentale, giovani abituati a farsi la doccia due volte il giorno; a ballare; a guidare la macchina; a mettersi la brillantina sui capelli, a indossare vestiti all'ultimo grido; dall'altra parte una cultura che sopporta il peso schiacciante del sacrificio, che sa combattere nella giungla con una forza disperata, che sa scegliere di soffrire, che sa tollelare la sofferenza di generazioni spezzate dalla devastazione. In questo agghiacciante apocalisse sono catapultati tre dei nostri protagonisti. Se da una parte sono costretti ad abbracciare una guerra sporca, scorretta, folle, dall'altra sono schiacciati, derisi, vilipesi. E una volta catturati, sono costretti a giocare alla Roulette Russa. La scelta di costringergli a sostare in un gioco drammatico e fatale assume per i VietCong un profondo significato psicologico: ""Ci avete portato questo gioco, voi, figli dell'Occidente. Voi, figli di un consumismo che vi consuma. Adesso Giocateci voi. Voi, che portate la Morte e giocate con la Morte."" sembrano dirgli i VietCong. Il loro sguardo rabbioso e denigratorio come simbolo della sofferenza di un paese in ginocchio ma che decide di resistere e di lottare. Per chi scrive, nessun immagine è stata così tanto evocativa per descrivere la ""perdita dell'innocenza americana"" in Vietnam, come la definisce lo sceneggiatore Roberto Leoni.
Un colpo solo come testimonianza di follia che disumanizza l'uomo. Un colpo solo come simbolo della legge civile tra uomini e natura e che umanizza gli uomini. Ma un colpo solo anche come tentativo di iscrivere la vita all'interno di un progetto. La radice etimologica della proiezione insita all’interno del termine progetto implica una considerazione dell'esistenza su un piano temporale
non immediato ma appunto “proiettato”, cioè gettato in avanti. Oltre gli alberi dei boschi brulicanti di vita. Antichi come le montagne.

"It’s hard to add too much to this movie in a written diary entry because it feels so complete on its own. It’s a big, realized film about friendship, the myth of manhood and obviously the war in Vietnam. 
It’s hard to find a three-hour film that really makes perfect use of its runtime. The Deer Hunter does so by giving us three instalments in the half-decade or so we follow the group of friends at its centre. Anything drawn out is done so for a reason, as in both its myriad roulette scenes and in the scenes at the hunting cabin. You need to marinate in the stress, in the moments of bonding and the moments of awkwardness, not just note that they happen and move on.
This was the last movie I needed to round out seeing all of John Cazale’s work as an actor, and I wanted to mention it only to say... god damn.

"It's funny how time can change your perspective on a film. The first time I watched THE DEER HUNTER, it must have been the early 2000s, back in my teens when I was wanting to become a Serious Film Fan and see more of the canon classics. But though I recognised it was a hugely significant film, given that it was one of the first major cinematic depictions of the Vietnam War to come in the wake of the conflict, it never quite clicked with me on the same level as some of its contemporaries. In my memory, it was a film with a very slow, lethargic beginning and end, bookends to a thrilling middle sequence that's a harrowing depiction of the horror of the Vietnam War. Indeed, there was actually an even earlier time, maybe in the late 90s, when I attempted to watch THE DEER HUNTER when it was on TV, and that time I never made it past that opening wedding sequence.
But returning to the film now, I can not only appreciate that the whole film is masterful, but actually, it's those slower parts that make the film. The opening stretch is as intimate and evocative a portrait of working class small town America in the 70s as you could hope to find, utterly drawing you in and emotionally investing you in the minutiae of this world. Which then makes Michael's return to that world after coming home from Vietnam all the more tragic, when we see how in many ways he no longer fits there, how much appears the same and yet it can never be the same... but still with a note of hope that it might be possible to come somewhere close to it. And it's here, in these quieter, more pensive stretches, that we truly appreciate the power of Robert DeNiro's performance as Michael. It's less showy work than his more famous collaborations with Scorsese, but for my money this could be one of DeNiro's finest performances, so subtle and understated yet so heartbreaking.
Not that the Vietnam section is any less harrowing. For being known as one of the all-time great Vietnam movies, it's jarring just how small a proportion of the film actually takes place in the war, but that then shows how impactful what we do see is, a snapshot of pure horror and madness that with ruthless efficiency demonstrates just how veterans could be left so traumatised by their time there. The notorious Russian Roulette sequences provide some of the most chillingly believable performances of raw terror I've ever seen on film. John Savage and Christopher Walken's fear here is palpable, to the point I felt afraid for them despite the fact that 1) they're playing fictional characters, and 2) I already knew how the plot panned out.
But though THE DEER HUNTER isn't a war movie to the degree its reputation would suggest, it's very much a film about war, and the lingering effects it has on the human psyche long after the guns have stopped firing. And yet perhaps most of all, and what I loved most about it this time, is how it's a film about community, and the people who shape it by their presence or absence. A beautiful, classic film, with some of the best acting across the board that you'll ever see.",5.0

"Although the themes are timeless and prevalent, the overall story wasn’t enough for me to grab onto. I would say that the movie got better as it went.

I would say that wherever five minutes could have been added to a scene was which made the movie a real slow one for me.

"O Franco-Atirador é um estudo social trágico e poderoso sobre um período da história americana (a masculinidade, o patriotismo e todo o resto das coisas que ressoavam no decorrer da década de 70) e as diversas maneiras com que guerra pode afetar o ser humano. Tudo usando como exemplo três amigos de uma pequena cidade industrial da fria Pensilvânia.
Uma missão que Michael Cimino cumpre com muito vigor através de um logo cheio de dicotomias que se completam.
A primeira delas surge justamente na sua direção cheia de impecáveis planos longos, já que ele captura tudo com uma mistura - constante porém equilibrada - entre sensibilidade, tensão e violência. Um pacote estranho que pode ser resumido por quatro cenas que tem potencial para serem inesquecíveis: a despedida musical no bar; a primeira sequência de roleta russa; o confronto final entre Michael e Nick; e o último e mais americano café da manhã que eles poderiam tomar.
Além disso, o texto também se constrói em torno de diversos opostos de sentimentos, crenças e decisões. No entanto, o que mais me impressiona é ver a narrativa ser extremamente rigorosa (com a divisão de atos, por exemplo) ao mesmo tempo que parece ser vaga em diversos momentos onde as motivações dos personagens viriam a tona. É tudo muito misterioso e esclarecedor, já que o longa só abre mão do didatismo para que o espectador posso completar as lacunas com suas próprias interpretações. E isso, assim como acontece com Táxi Driver, ajuda na criação de um filme amplo e atemporal que pode mexer até com que já assistiu a história outras vezes.
Em outras palavras: eu não consigo dizer quais são os exatos traumas que fizeram Michael, Steve e Nick tô.arem suas respectivas decisões, mas tenho minhas hipóteses. Só que a graça é que o estudo desenvolvido pelo longa se mantém vivo mesmo se essas respostas estiverem erradas. Porque o impacto não está na explicação e sim nesse pacote muito mais amplo que Cimino e seu elenco brilhante (Robert DeNiro e Christopher Walken são forças da natureza aqui) transmitem na tela.

The film sits with these characters for over an hour before they’re seen on the frontlines and the aftermath is truly haunting.

YouTube review of The Deer Hunter... www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzDKRExqxkU
Wow a Michael Cimino film I actually really like!
If you know me, one of the biggest, most frustrating movie experiences I've ever watched was the notorious bomb Heaven's Gate, which was from the same director, a four-hour, overly pretentious, tediously slow western which was beautifully shot but had very little to offer and was two hours too long. Cimino's reputation was ruined due…",4.5
"A heartbreaking drama that's less about war and more about the effect it has on those who participate in it. The direction is fantastic, without a single shot wasted. And you can't go wrong with a cast that has De Niro, Walken, and Streep all working alongside one another.
There are a few issues with the pacing throughout, with some scenes going on longer than I feel they needed to, where as at times it jumps between others pretty abruptly, but the movie never failed to keep my attention, even when things were lingering, because it was just so good to look at.",4.5

"I have several thoughts about this film, and why this is gonna be stuck in my head for a long time.
First off, the whole Vietnam war and Russian roulette scene is probably one of the hardest moments in cinema history to watch. The way how we see different characters from their perspective which is greed, cruel, fear, anger, and at times, sadness got my emotions stirring up!
Story got very slow with mostly the first hour as we see the steel workers hanging out, go hunting, and eventually go to a wedding. I knew from the beginning that when the now husband and wife drink from the goblet and two tiny drops of wine fall on the bride’s dress, I knew there was a sign that it foreshadows what to occur with the protagonists. Viewing the horrors of war, and their friendship being teared apart; a big change to the characters after the war.
The themes of friendship never shattered me until the last hour of the film. Robert De Niro, John Savage, and Meryl Streep May have given their best performance to date, but it was Christopher Walken who brought tears, dread, and loss into the film. He was the main star of the aftermath of the Vietnam War. It’s a war film but by not showing too much of what happens during the Vietnam War, but it was more on the story of friendship, and the changes each character faced after the war.
I’ve been having thoughts about all my friends for a while after watching this film. But maybe in the future, I will have to show them about what happens when the war starts to take effect on all of us, and how all of us changed so much as we get older and older.",5.0
"[...] Auch nach über vier Dekaden kann Ciminos Die durch die Hölle gehen noch überzeugen. Zwar lässt sich der Film an vielen Stellen sehr viel Zeit, was besonders auf Kosten des Unterhaltungswerts geht, doch kann er an allen anderen Fronten überzeugen. Kostüme, Kriegsszenen und Soundeffekte können sich nach wie vor sehen und hören lassen und besonders letztere gehen durch Mark und Bein. Highlight sind aber unbestritten Christopher Walken und Robert De Niro, die mit das beste Schauspiel ihrer Karriere hinlegen.

"The Deer Hunter has unique choices in it as a film about war. Taking an hour of the film for setup in getting to know the lives of the main characters. At first, it made me question the editing decision (with one of the longest wedding scenes I've ever seen) but finishing the film I interpreted that the director wanted each hour of the film to show the dramatic difference war has had on these characters. With the war scenes, the director shows a short sequence of instilled visuals of combat we have come to know as war. Then he quickly transitions the film into a pain gripping scene of torture that our main characters have to fight themselves with the acceptance of death to escape but be forever scared by this trauma. The last hour of the film is the effects of war as Michael returns home trying to get re-accustomed to life after. Of the characters sent to war, I feel each one has a different depiction of a person at war. Steven I feel is the most realistic emotionally respond going war as someone not being able to handle under the pressure and circumstances, Nick being the extreme display of someone traumatized by war deeply disturbed and changed, and Micheal not being an average experience of a war veteran. For Micheal almost being unscathed from the war is almost as if the American depiction of a GI soldier smart, can survive, handle things under pressure and still be strong from time spent at War. I feel Michaels's character storyline is not likely and outcomes of war are more seen in the case Steven with their lives affected physically or mentally. This leads me to answering the question it seems as though the characters singing God Bless America at the end is saying war and death is America. In that war's effective gain America is to be proud of and honored despite the trauma and death it causes. I feel it is more a critical statement made with singing God Bless America at the end it is either represent the horrific trauma people at war go through or it is used as pro-war propaganda expressing dying for war is American and honored by America. The song's addition in the film is grand in symbolic value resonating the emotional tone of the film that is thrown at audiences.",3.5
"For the first act this felt like Heaven's Gate all over again: pretentious, dull, meandering, pointless. Then something happened that never came close to occurring in HG - the film found a focal point. That not only improved the rest of the film but made the first act far better in retrospect (though still a bit too long)
This is a Vietnam film in the same way Hamlet is a play about Denmark. The war is the backdrop not the subject. The real point is the effect of deep psychological scars and the different reactions to trauma. To chime in on the film's controversial aspects, it's portrayal of the North Vietnamese is neither racist nor non-racist. They're there as a gateway to the larger themes. Nothing more. Nothing less.
With Heaven's Gate, Michael Cimino tried to cement himself as a Coppola, Lean or Kubrick. In the process he destroyed his career, made a terrible film, and took down United Artists. The Deer Hunter suggests that that aim was wrong headed from the get go. His talents and instincts are far closer to Terrance Malik. This film reminds me of The Thin Red Line way more than it does Apocalypse Now.
It's a shame he didn't follow those instincts. I'd have loved to see this Ciminos career rather than the Coppola wannabe he became. What he accomplished here is great but there could have been so much more",4.5
"This felt so much messier the second time around. I used to not mind the length and the several dead-end, pointless scenes, but now I kind of do. The Deer Hunter just doesn't flow all that well, it's stumbling through a great core concept. For the amount of time spent in the first act establishing characters we don't get all that much. Yes they're blue collar workers about to face the ugliness of war, they drink, talk shit, and have their love interests, but there's no need for this long contemplation over a night of boozing unless you are going to fill it with interesting perspectives or new narrative steps, both of which are almost absent in The Deer Hunter's first part. I'll gladly admit that I enjoy that wedding night purely because of atmosphere and great music, so despite my previous comment it's not all for nothing. But Cimino goes on adding weirdly unfitting scenes, like the car gag and Michael's fight with Stan, and I don't much enjoy tension or fun just for the sake of it. Cut to Vietnam (still a fantastic cut in my book) and we get the film's most potent act with the infamous russian roulette scenes as the centerpiece. The later almost-encounter between Michael and Nick feels a bit too convenient perhaps. Now I'm no expert on mental trauma, but why would they even visit that place, and without Michael checking the Hospital? Third act is alright and works as the counterpoint to the first one. It's the result of the second acts effect on the first act if that makes any sense. As I mentioned I really like the concept here, showing the effects on war not only on the individuals who was there, but also on the communities around them. The three-act structure is also a great idea, but it has to be filled with worthwhile, meaningful content. Friends being friends doesn't need this extensive establishment. Michael Cimino just can't keep a very good focus on what he wants to say and when, but he's still able to make a film filled with several great scenes, stunning cinematography and a fine message. It's enjoyable, just not the captivating hate-letter to the Vietnam war that it could have been.",3.0

"Rewatched for next week's episode of Unspooled.
I planned ahead and got this from the library before I found out they had postponed it until next week, so I'll swap it out for Do the Right Thing tomorrow.
Does this even count as a Vietnam War film, being that only about 1/4 of the film takes place in Vietnam? If so, it's my favorite Vietnam War film. And yeah, I know it's unrealistic, and that North Vietnamese didn't force POWs to play Russian roulette against each other. But one of the marvels of this film is that Russian roulette is a metaphor for so many different things. On the surface level, it does represent the psychological and physical torture that was inflicted on POWs by, likely, both sides of that war, as well as in wars since. And obviously this psychological torture is crucial to the plot, as we see how Mike, Nick, and Steven all react to the trauma. But it also stands in for the two major themes (or one connected theme perhaps) of violence as sport, and gambling.
Of these two, the idea of violence as sport is easy to see (it's in the name of the title, after all), as we see early on that Mike has a credo when it comes to hunting, and considers himself a true sportsman. And of course, Mike is changed when he is put in a situation where he is the prey instead of the predator.
On this rewatch, I really picked up on the gambling theme (or perhaps motif is the better literary word). Within the first 5 minutes of the film, we see Nick wanting to gamble on everything, from pool games in the bar to the Steelers game on TV, foreshadowing the idea that he might be a gambling addict and giving another reason why he can't stop playing.
And both these themes are used in the film to give a harsh criticism of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnamese Civil War. The idea of such colonial interests (both from the U.S. and USSR) is represented by the Frenchman Julien, who seeks to exploit others for his own personal gain. For him, it's a game, and he and the other spectators having the privilege to watch others take a life or death risk feels like the U.S. and USSR throwing money over the heads of North and South Vietnam, sitting with a loaded gun between them. And to win this game, the U.S. put their own soldiers in the chair. Granted, the odds were a bit better than the 1/6 chance Russian roulette affords; only about 2% of U.S. troops deployed to Vietnam died as a result. And those odds were good enough for the U.S. to feel okay with gambling with 2 million American lives.
All this is to say that, like Apocalypse Now, the films works as a good story, and it also works as an allegory for something else. And ultimately I guess I prefer that over the more realistic version of the war depicted in Platoon.
De Niro and Walken both give insanely good performances, and Meryl Streep shows glimpses of why she would come to be the best American actress of her time, even if it's far from her best work. If I have a nitpick, it's that they chose to base the film in southwestern Pennsylvania, and yet De Niro, Walken, and John Savage are all from New York and all three speak distinctly with New York accents. Like, you couldn't throw it one Yinzer? I wonder how a pre-fame Michael Keaton would have been as Steven instead, sporting a thick Pittsburgh accent.",4.5

"“ONE SHOT”
The Deer Hunter is a film that emotionally destroyed me. I saw this long 3 hour slow paced drama movie about the war in Vietnam and how this disrupted the lives of a group of friends who lived in a small town in Pennsylvania. I must say that I’m glad I found the BluRay for five bucks because this has been one of the most profound experiences I’ve ever had in movies.
The Deer Hunter is an examination about how the war, specifically the Vietnam war affected the lives of the soldiers who enlisted and how tragic this could be to the ones who fought back then. Now, you might think that it’s hard to sit through a 3 hour movie but believe me, director Michael Cimino managed to excel this aspect because this movie to me needed at least 30 minutes more.
I’d say that the movie is divided in three acts, the first one was so interesting to me because the director show us a development of characters greatly made. We see the bond they had among them, you could tell that there was some tension because three of them were going to Vietnam but somehow this vanishes during the wedding of one of the friends named Steve. The Wedding sequence emotionally affected me because you could see the camaraderie and the happiness and everything that was good could just end once they were going to Vietnam. The second act begins abruptly in Vietnam and this is where the director shows the hellish time they had to endure, it contains one of the most terrific scenes filmed in Cinema’s history, I was so tensed and scared of what was going to happen with the Russian Roulette. Then we see the third act that sets after the three friends had finished their duties in Vietnam and coming back home is what they had been so longing for.
The director portrays how life has not even changed a bit but everything seemed so different to the eyes of Michael (Robert DeNiro) now this was perfectly captured because I could tell that there was indeed some PTSD and this is what saddens me because I believe most of the soldiers who comeback from war try to fit again in society but it just seems impossible. What happened to the three friends is something that I think that could happen to anyone who fought a war and the end of this movie just like I mentioned in in the beginning of my review, it left me emotionally destroyed and in a complete silence.

"Ah such a waste of potential. It's way too long. I like long movies but this is a bit of a bore, and I only just about cared for two characters. There's some good themes that I wish were better developed. If it was cut down then they'd be more effective. There are a few standout, gorgeous shots but mostly it's a drab affair. The Russian Roulette motif is good and fits the story perfectly. It's a tragedy really, it conveys how futile the Vietnam war was and how it destroyed the lives of young men who otherwise would have had a great and prosperous life.

"The Deer Hunter has forever been one of those classic films that I have never quite plucked up the courage to see through till the end - until now. 
In 2008, Optimum Releasing produced a DVD copy that truly is an embarrassment of a transfer. Yet I was desperate to find out what the fuss was all about. This desire, in turn, forced me to be subjected to poor sound quality and not a single option for subtitles. Each attempt (and there were many) to finish Michael’s Cimino’s beautiful, tough novelistic work was always infuriating. 
It required the big-screen treatment. With it’s 45th anniversary, a limited run at the local multiplex provided exactly that. 3 people. 3 hours. Silence within the auditorium. Without any distractions, I was finally transported to Pittsburgh, then to Vietnam and back again for a visually arresting, disturbing experience that broke my heart. 
It can be easy to lose focus upon such a tough, slow film at home. There’s the option to pause the DVD, check your phone or quit watching it altogether. But it almost feels as if it was purposefully designed to be seen on the silver screen alone. As if it needed to be experienced within one sitting. Trust me, if it’s showing near you, this is the way to see it.",5.0
does anyone have words to describe the feeling of watching this?,4.5
"Ricordato dai più come uno dei più grandi film di guerra quando in realtà è l'antiguerra totale, nelle 3 ore giusto una mezz'ora è sul campo di battaglia (Vietnam).
The Deer Hunter è l'inno all'amicizia e al sentimento, ai cambiamenti e la nostalgia, agli eventi che nel bene e nel male lasciano inesorabilmente il segno sul modo di vivere la vita.
E' allucinante la potenza che emerge nel contrasto tra i momenti di spensieratezza degli amici con quelli più macabri.
La roulette russa ne è sicuramente il simbolo, sia la prima coi vietnamiti che soprattutto quella tra due GRANDISSIMI De Niro e Walken.
Ma penso anche al matrimonio ubriachi, alle battute di caccia con un solo proiettile, all'impossibilità di sparare al cervo, alla pistola puntata in faccia all'amico che non ne capisce la gravità, alla perdita di braccia e gambe o ancora peggio alla impossibilità di riconoscere un amico..",5.0

"Best Picture #84 of 89
My BF and I watched this last night and had a pretty interesting conversation about the controversy surrounding it as well as the background for the story. We talk a little about how we interpreted the movie as well.
The Deer Hunter follows a man and his friends before, during and after the war in Vietnam. It explores their friendship and how they were all each affected by the war. That's the big message here, and I took as wholly anti-vietnam.
The russian roulette scenes where pretty high tension. And the three hour movie moved along pretty quickly as the story never lulled or slowed down. My interest never waned.
The Deer Hunter was no doubt controversial, but an important movie nonetheless.",5.0

"Ein Film mit Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale & Christopher Walken; hat 9 Oscar-Nom., 5 gewonnene Oscars, darunter Best Picture und dennoch hört man recht selten was zu dem Film (also ich zumindest). Nachdem ich den Film gesehen habe, kann ich aber beides ganz gut nachvollziehen.
Denn der Film dreht sich hauptsächlich um eine einzige Sequenz (als sie in vietnamesische Gefangenschaft geraten und dort zum Russisch-Roulette-Spielen gezwungen werden), die ganze Zeit davor wird einerseits gebraucht, um die Charaktere näher kennenzulernen und einen stimmungstechnischen Kontrast zu schaffen für ""die Zeit danach"", die die ganzen Konsequenzen aus dieser besagten Sequenz zeigt. Das heißt, dass 90% des Films extrem von diesem Geschehen in Vietnam leben und abhängen. Das klingt jetzt deutlich negativer als es eigentlich gemeint ist, denn ich denke, dass das von Cimino durchaus so gedacht ist. Es wird also vom Zuschauer erwartet, dass man permanent das Gezeigte mit den Geschehnissen in der Sequenz in Zusammenhang setzt, ohne diesen zusätzlichen Inhalt, wären die sonstigen Szenen oftmals eher langatmig und meistens Szenen, die man schon oft in Filmen mit ähnlichen Themen gesehen hat.
Was noch positiv hervorsticht ist die Regie insgesamt und speziell viele fantastische Shots, z.B. in den Bergen.
Nun aber zum Hightlight des Films, der ominösen Sequenz in Vietnam. Sie ist auf jeden Fall Belohnung für eher sehr realistisch wirkende depressive Stimmung, die man danach ""durchstehen muss"". Ich empfand schon den Aufbau der Sequenz extrem intensiv (die menschenverachtenden Abläufe zwischen Russisch-Roulette spielen und gefangengehalten werden im berüchtigten ""Pit"", die psychologischen Veränderungen, die schon stattgefunden haben und noch weiter fortzuschreiten drohen, der vermeintlich unausweichliche Tod durch das Russisch-Roulette nur noch als Frage der Zeit).
Diese Ausgangssituation wird dann immer spannender und unerträglicher, je näher der Ausbruchsversuch rückt und je schlechter die Chancen werden, die nächste Runde Russisch-Roulette noch zu überleben. Wie das Geschehene dargestellt wird, macht alles was danach geschieht komplett glaubwürdig und strahlt so stark in den Rest des Films aus, dass die vermeintliche Schwäche des Films, so sehr von dieser einen Sequenz abhängig zu sein, auch zu seiner Stärke wird. Ich glaube der Rest des Films ist stark vom eigenen Geschmack abhängig – mir hat es im Großen und Ganzen eher gefallen, wenn auch nicht umgehauen –, aber diese angesprochene Seuqenz alleine ist schon so sehenswert und beeindruckend, dass es sich selbst dann lohnt den Film zu sehen, wenn einem der Rest eher nicht so zusagt.

"I have to be honest - I found the first hour of The Deer Hunter torturous to sit through. Teeth-gratingly annoying characters, scenes that seemingly go on forever, acting as subtle as a brick through a windshield. I presume the intention was to get to know the characters before the sequences in Vietnam and then contrast that to what happens after the characters return, but I found the whole section tedious (and also really misognyst in parts). 
But then the next 45 minutes or so were absolutely stunning; palpable tension and dread, very fine performances, some exceptional cinematography and editing. It's in these minutes that I can really appreciate the critical acclaim heaped upon The Deer Hunter.
But then in the final hour, despite some fine writing and acting from DeNiro, and a genuinely brutal conclusion, there's a shift in pace that means the film really loses the momentum it has built, and scenes once again go on for too long - and I frequently found myself feeling ""shut in"" and wanted frankly to turn the DVD player off. 
All in all, I am glad I finally watched the film and there are many images that I won't forget any time soon, but I don't think I'll be returning to it again. My overall feeling is somewhere in this sprawling 3 hour ""epic"", there's a lean and altogether more powerful 90 minute film that wants out.",3.0

"Hatte mir mehr erwartet. Mit seinen drei so unterschiedlichen Akten ist ""The Deer Hunter"" nicht rund erzählt, auch wenn ich schon verstehen kann, welche Funktion der jeweilige Akt erfüllen soll.
Mein Hauptproblem ist jedoch die Nichtnachvollziehbarkeit der Charaktere - das gilt in Ansätzen bei de Niro, aber vor allem für Walkens Figur. Dessen Weg, seine Entwicklung und Entscheidungen sind nur behauptet, aber nicht wirklich hergeleitet oder gar begründet.
Nach der stärkeren Einführung hat sich ""Deer Hunter"" in den letzten beiden Dritteln zudem wie ein viel älterer Film angefühlt. New Hollywood war in den 70ern doch eigentlich schon weiter, zwiespältige Charaktere auch schlüssig auf ihren Weg zu führen statt die Ambivalenz dem Zuschauer nur als unerklärten Charakterzug vorzusetzen.",3.0
"Michael Cimino may have been difficult to work with, but you can't say he didn't make a good film. ""The Deer Hunter"" is at its core a very tragic story that will stay in the viewers mind for a while.
It showed less about the Vietnam war than I thought it would. But this film is about much more than just that. It's main focus is the story of a few friends and how they all change in different ways, even if they had to endure the same horrible things. It makes you think how some things they went through would affect you. It doesn't move quickly at all and takes its time.
I know a lot of War films are about similar subjects, but I think most of them explore it in different and unique ways.

It's a very long film, but it's really worth experiencing at least once when you have the time. It's a very affecting great story.",4.5

What stands out for me in this version of War and it's effects on ordinary working folk, is how you get drawn by the way you can place yourself in the lives of these guys. They are an ordinary group of mates, they drink, they muck about with each other, they take the piss, they do stupid things and fall out. But you get the feeling they value each other, and you understand them, they're real.
The cherry on top of these wonderful performances is the diversity of how War effects each of the 3 guys that go out and how that then then effects their relationship with each other.

"Ok. I love the view during the deer hunting scenes, the absolute intensity of the first roulette scene, and one piece from the soundtrack. Now with that out of the way, let me get onto the rant.
Cimino is really gambling with the audience's patience with that first hour. The whole movie felt like a masterpiece that went wrong in the editing room. Scenes that felt like it should be cut out are left in; scenes that would make the film easier to follow felt like they're missing. There are times I rubbed my temple in vexation because ""what is the point of this scene?!""
One example immediately springs to mind because it pissed the hell out of me when I had to sit through it: The idiotic bunch abandoning one of their pals on the road as a joke, backs up, only to trick him again, then comes back and finally lets him in. Keep in mind this was already an hour into the movie, and by this point I was so sick of their boyish behaviours so thoroughly depicted in the first hour that I was actually rooting for them to get slaughtered in Vietnam.
That was a 2 minute scene. Imagine how much time we could've saved if all this useless and painful repetition had been taken out. Perhaps an hour shaved off would've saved this film from failure in my eyes.
Then the film finally kicks into high gear when it contrast cuts to Vietnam and the brutality there. Great. I'm finally re-engaged. Wait what. How did they get there? Why aren't they being pulled into the helicopter? Did Steven die? What happened to those two after they got out of the water? How did Michael get into the roulette room? Why would Nick do that? How did Nick not see or hear Michael? What happened to Steven? Why is Michael already home? What about the other guys? Whose point of view is the movie told from? DAMN IT!
With that, I lost interest. I couldn't follow along to a plot so clunky and devoid of explanation. The last hour of the film I watched with great displeasure. I was amazed at how long they can still drag this out. Of course Nick shot himself, Oscar-dramatics right there. Of course they ended with a depressing rendition of an American hymn. How unexpected.

"Although it moves at the pace of a snail, The Deer Hunter is filled with fantastic performances, nicely composed shots, and a very strong narrative structure. A truly unique war film.",3.5
"A delicate and raw drama executed by a master. On paper, this began as a high stakes (literally) thriller about Russian Roulette in Las Vegas, and was then repackaged to be a war epic about Vietnam. Instead, Cimino turned it into a long, masterfully meandering look at American life. Hollywood wanted a war movie, Cimino gave them a film where the first hour is spent at a Russian Orthodox wedding, watching the intricacies of customs and character as a group of blue collar friends in a tight-knit steel town shoot the breeze. While the film has that high concept driving hook of a shell shocked vet falling into a ring of life-or-death odds, and Robert DeNiro there to rescue him, the film takes a more naturalistic trajectory than right through the flesh - it tackles nationalism, friendship, honor, love, worship and loss, and all the happenstance in between, as it focuses on character first over plotting. The sound design is paramount in this - like prime Altman we hear everything, there's a richness of detail in the wedding, war and bar scenes that help bring you right into that world. The sound can be messy at times as dialogue is tough to decipher, but that's the sloppy beauty of a movie that couldn't be made with that reckless abandon today (the irony being that Cimino probably brought about that change in philosophy by bankrupting United Artists a few years later). The sound won an Oscar, a rare example of Hollywood honoring the creative deployment of a category rather than just whatever film was the loudest or most technically proficient.
The Oscars also gave a statue to Christopher Walken though - given the career he's had since it's an award you can give with little regret, but in this film he does very little; he's a backboard for DeNiro, Streep and the rest of the cast to bounce their energy. Walken's award here is a textbook example of the Academy honoring an actor not for the performance, but because of the tragedy of the character's story (like Frank Sinatra in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY before and Sean Connery in THE UNTOUCHABLES after). Considering the stellar cast, including the unheralded candor of guys like George Dzundza and John Cazale (in his last role), Walken actually might be the weakest character in the film. Go figure.
The film's been called anti-war, anti-American and racist in its portrayal of the Vietnamese, but watching it again I really think the film treads with an ambivalence that's true to life. Saigon is depicted like a regular city the same as Clairton is back home, and there's as many whites behind the roulette gambling ring as there are Vietnamese. DeNiro's buddies show the same lack of honor (during the deer hunting pilgrimages) that the Viet Cong do, and he lashes out at both of them throughout the film. The somber, tone deaf ending rendition of ""God Bless America"" was seen as mocking in 1978, but that's probably more a reflection of how red the litmus test was regarding Vietnam at the time. Taken in the film, the song comes across as sincere and sad, like these characters sing it to salvage what bit of unifying tradition (like the wedding earlier) they have left. It's not judging, patronizing or ironic, just another example of realism from a film that on paper was supposed to be bombastic and surreal. That it goes out with that whimper, tender and true as it was, is the difference between a bombastic American Idol solo and a hushed, out-of-tune confessional by a singer songwriter. For a brief fleeting moment, Michael Cimino was Leonard Cohen, and ""God Bless America"" was his mic drop.",4.5
"The first really good thing is that for 3 hours movie, it didn't feel like one. I wasn't really bored for any minutes, except for a few stretches that could have been shortened. Other than that, a good movie with good performances. It's pretty much that. I didn't dislike it and I didn't love it. Just an interesting movie about the Vietnam War.",3.5
"""You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about.""
Before almost single handedly bringing an end to the auteur era of Hollywood filmmaking with 'Heaven's Gate', Michael Cimino made waves with his masterpiece 'The Deer Hunter', a portrayal of a working class community and the impending departure to Vietnam of three men enlisted in the army. Yet when you look at both films there is a lot of similarities, they are both admittedly bloated, pretentious and grandiose in nature yet for me 'The Deer Hunter' stays within the bounds of acceptability in those traits and to this very day still remains a heartbreaking, melodramatic and tense film full of great direction, cinematography and performances.
Set in the steel working town of Clairton, Pennsylvania, 'The Deer Hunter' looks at the impact of war on a close nit community and the three friends Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage) soon to be departed for Vietnam both before, during and after the event. The films long first act is a celebration and a send off of sorts as Steven is about to be married. The reception also marks the sending off party for the men and as they become more and more inebriated the tensions of that fateful moment become more and more apparent. The wedding and the following reception are stupendously shot pieces and highlight Cimino's preference for shooting well choreographed scenes with many extras and moving parts.
Whilst the film focusses on three friends who go to war together it is the relationship between Michael and Nick that becomes the integral centre of the film. De Niro and Walken are tremendous together and throughout the films first section you do get a clear sense of camaraderie amidst the underlying tensions which makes their relationship more emotionally engaging. Of all the performers it is Walken who makes the biggest impression though, winning an Academy Award for his heartbreaking performance as Nick. It should also be noted that John Cazale and Meryl Streep both excel in their roles although Streep is a little put upon in film brimming with machoism. Cazale even today is a cult figure in film, an actor who made only five films - all of which were nominated for best film at the Academy Awards. I grew up on the five films Cazale featured in and on every occasion he proved to be one of the best things about that film, a supreme character actor who really brought three dimensions to each of his roles, there was always a sadness and resentfulness in his eyes that I find magnetic. Cazale was terminally ill whilst filming 'The Deer Hunter' and was also romantically involved with Streep. It adds another dimension to his role here.
The film's middle section takes place during the war itself and contains one of the most nail biting scenes I have ever sat through in my life. Regardless of any historical accuracy the Russian Roulette scenes are terrifying, not just the game itself but the pit - a prison submerged in unsanitised water - and the agonising reactions to the unseen games above from John Savage's Steven. I can still remember the first time I watched 'The Deer Hunter' and my reaction to this scene, one of the few scenes in cinema history that has physically impacted on me, causing me to recoil in horror as these men were forced to put guns to their heads. The escape and aftermath from this barbaric torture from the Vietcong leads to the three men being separated, most pertinently it is Nick who is left with the most scars, being left in Saigon seemingly lost and alone, lacking any purpose.
In the final part of the film Michael returns to Clairton to be greeted as a hero which he turns away from in shame, no man or women could celebrate in such a way if they had seen or felt what he had gone through him, in turn the guilt of not coming back with Nick clearly weighs heavy. The weight on the whole town becomes more and more apparent as well, particularly between Michael and Streep's Lisa and Michael and Cazale's Stanley. Eventually there is nothing else to be done and Michael faces up to what happened out there by visiting a wheelchair bound Steven before heading out to a decaying Saigon to find Nick, now horrifyingly wrapped up in an underground Russian Roulette ring, drugged and confused and only just able to recognise Michael whose pleas for him to return home are tragically and heartbreakingly unrealised.
So even though 'The Deer Hunter' is by no means a concise film it is an at times overwhelmingly brilliant one. I am reminded of the foreboding moment where Steven's wife Angela spills a drop of wine on her wedding dress - as the couple toast it is said that no spillage brings about many years of good luck - or the almost prophetic way in which Michael describes the best way to kill a deer with ""one shot"". Another astonishingly good element to the film is the work of the late Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography. Has use of natural lighting can sometimes disappoint me but here it is quite stunning especially in the hunting scenes in the mountains which are nothing short of jaw dropping. He also manages to capture the grimy, grim setting a the working class steel working town, the film's colour scheme is very muted and grey but the lashings of fire from the huge machinery adds a eye opening contrast. It sets the tone for a bleak film, although not one devoid of life. The people of Clairton drink, dance, shoot pool and hunt together, there is a spirit and camaraderie between them. War breaks down all of that spirit and casts an even bleaker cloud.",0.0
"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is an emotionally intense, epically symbolic fictional tale that explores in an abstract way how the Vietnam War destroyed the lives of everyone who participted in it.
The film is grand, epic, and occassionally meandering and simplistic, as it lingers over the details in the small-town life of three friends: Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (a haunting Christopher Walken).
The film is neatly divided into three acts: the first section unfolds slowly. It is the day before the three friends ship out, and Steven is getting married. They hang with their friends, get drunk, carouse, and the film takes its time, showing in sociological detail the cultural aspects of this blue-collar celebration (in the VA hall, naturally). After introducing the culture they came from, the film abruptly shifts to the war, but there is an almost abstract feel to the war scenes. Before we get our bearings, the three soldiers have been taken prisoner by the Viet Cong, and in the film's histrionic emotional centerpiece, are cruelly forced to play Russian Roulette in front of the taunting guards. Michael kills the captors and rescues Steven & Nick, but Nick suffers a psychotic break and Steven breaks both of his legs.
The third act focuses on the painful, unspoken aftermath of the war. Steven loses both of his legs and is confined to a wheelchair; Michael returns, but cannot relate to anyone from the town, with the exception of Nick's old girlfriend, Linda ( a very young Meryl Streep). Nick has gone AWOL, lost in the chaos and morass of Saigon as it fell to communist forces at the end of the war. Michael returns to Vietnam, in order to keep his adolescent promise to Nick to not leave him behind. He finds Nick but it is too late; the war has claimed another victim.
The film was the first major attempt by an American filmmaker to come to terms with the war that had only ended three years previously. It gained much controversy for not being an accurate reflection of what it was like over there; but the Russian Roulette game is so obviously a metaphor for the brutality and randomness of war's violence, it seems difficult to understand why there was a scandal. The film never purports to be a documentary, and stays on the level of allegory.
There are multiple explorations of Masculine Pain--mostly psychological & emotional, and a quiet dignity is given to our protagonists, even as they suffer torments unspoken.
The film is not perfect--it becomes indulgent very frequently, and none of the female roles are developed beyond two dimensions. But the film is a riveting, intense experience, and a quintessential piece of 1970s cinema.",4.0
"One shot.
For far too long, I've been aware of The Deer Hunter's position as a critic favourite. I've also been aware of the other opinion that people have about that the movie: that's it's boring and overrated. I'm about to do the unthinkable: acknowledge the film's numerous flaws while also praising it as great cinema.
The Deer Hunter is one heck of a slow burner. By the time I got to the end of the first act, I wanted to take a break (although I didn't). To be fair, the first act needed to be long in order to familiarise us with the pre-Vietnam lives of the men, and the town . There are some flaws in the film's plot. The actual capture of our three protagonists is glossed over, and there are quite a few implausible moments throughout the movie. Overall, The Deer Hunter strikes me as a - and I'm trying not to sound flippant - self-indulgent film that, quiet frankly, might have still worked had it been trimmed down.
What's interesting is that even with all of its flaws, when the film came to end, I couldn't help but feel as though I'd just had one of the most profound film experiences of my cinematic journey thus far. It's as if the cast montage at the end had turned on a switch that enabled me to make sense of all those moments that had come before.
What was apparent when watching the film was that the film would have been a complete mess if it weren't for the moving performances of the whole cast, which included De Niro, Walken, Savage, Streep, Cazale, and so on. Vilmos Zsigmond's fantastic images, and Stanley Myers' light score are welcome touches to the film as well. This film was, much like Heaven's Gate, an ambitious undertaking, but one paid off immensely for Cimino. It might've helped that the subject matter may have appealed to the audience of 1978.",4.5
"The Deer Hunter is utterly captivating. A stunning film from start to finish.
Beautifully sensitive music, a powerful story combined with characters you are truly invested in, creates one hell of a film.",5.0
"The opening chapter of The Deer Hunter frustrated me deeply. The gratuitous antics of De Niro and friends, adorned with the typical 70's slang, cursing, and ball-breaking, was beginning to feel a bit too much. I understood that this was meant to be a powerful film, and while I wholly trusted that this Vietnam epic would get around to its point, I was losing patience for the journey needed to reach it.
Then it all came crashing down on me at once.
Stevie's wedding was a vital piece of this movie, and I must've been blind, dumb, or both not to see it in the first place. In fact, every moment of The Deer Hunter is vital: every laugh, taunt, prank, scream, tear, gunshot, and lick of flame. The characters are incredibly rich, be them in America or Vietnam, and their tight-knit circle of friendship is even richer. Though the film does heavy-handedly contrast their happy pre-deployment memories with the utterly heartbreaking final frames, it's still entirely accurate in its tragedy.
Like the best war films, this is more than explosions and anger- it is an exploration of one man's appreciation of all life's beauty, and his struggle to heal not only himself, but also his brothers in arms and the ones waiting for them back home.",4.0
"This is my third Cimino movie and my favorite so far, although I very much enjoyed both ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Year of the Dragon"". But this one is definitely the real masterpiece of the lot. It's roughly divided into three acts: the pre-war, the war, and the after-war. Each of those acts show different sides of the characters and how the war affects them. The cast is stellar. De Niro and Walken are especially brilliant. I loved the Russian roulette scenes that are all pivotal in the story. They will remain burned in my memory.",5.0

People need to know.",3.0
"The characterization is so richly defined in this film. Truly a study of not only wanting, having, and settling for, but also not wanting, not having, and not settling for. Deniro, Walken, and Streep form a seemingly palpable relationship. The falsehood of ""twist"" endings which seems to be a common trend as of late, especially in horror (one of my favorite genres) can only be found wanting, contrary to the depravity of mankind that is portrayed in this film. Upon destitution, stripped of humanity-after being so prevalent-life becomes obsolete.
Masterful filmmaking moves you, one way or another. I was left speechless upon my original viewing, after watching this so many years ago.",4.5
"Its distinctly divided into three acts: them as boys, the transformation, them as men. The acting is great, as both De Niro and Walken give great performances. The highlights of the movie were the roulette scenes and much of the war. However, I found the film to be extremely heavy-handed anti war film. It is a overly long and over dramatic. Also frustratingly uses PTSD as a way to make the characters do uncharacteristic things. Overall, it's a decent war movie and a heavy handed drama.",2.5
"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is often cited as one of the great anti-war films of all time, and one of the best films of the 1970s, after having won Best Picture and Best Director in 1978. Certainly it has earned its place in the pantheon of great films from the era right?
Eh...not so much.
Please don't get me wrong; there really is a lot to like about Cimino's anti-war magnum opus. The individual pieces of the film are universally great, from Robert DeNiro's haunting performance, to the great work turned in by Meryl Streep and John Cazale (who delivered his final performance in this film, a career tragically cut short by lung cancer), to the absolutely astounding performance by Christopher Walken. The ensemble of this film ranks among the best in American cinematic history, there's no doubt of that.
The problem is that the material they have to work with can only be elevated so far. At its core The Deer Hunter is a good anti-war film, but I don't think it's a great one. Films like Apocalypse Now & Platoon raised the bar much higher than The Deer Hunter can ultimately reach. It aspires to those heights certainly, and maybe for its time it was a great film, but it has been surpassed greatly.
Another problem is Cimino's direction itself. Much maligned for the self-indulgent and rambling pace of Heaven's Gate, many of those same problems exist here, merely papered over by the great performances and the powerful subject matter. The metaphor and symbolism is heavy in the film, but it's so bogged down by Cimino's emphasis on the details that it's harder to appreciate. I don't despise a film that requires a person to think, that's not the case at all, but sometimes conciseness is required in film and at just over three hours long, The Deer Hunter sometimes feels like its been stretched to an interminable length espousing the same things we've heard from other films, only done better.
Like I said, the Deer Hunter may have been at one point considered a canonically great film. And there are certainly things that still work, and this film is certainly worth a recommendation for anyone into war films or the cinema of the seventies. For me though, it falls just a bit short of greatness.",3.5
"One of the best film I've ever seen.
Griping, a perfect harmony between the scenario, the direction and the acting. Constructed of 3 parts (before, during and after the war), there's philosophical reflections, lyricism and also realism. A view on immigration, the working class and the war. It's passionate and painfully bitter.
And so much emotions, so much. Unforgettable, it stays with you. A must see!",5.0
"An emotionally draining piece of top-class cinema, beautifully cast (De Niro, Streep, Walken, Cazale), and even if you only remember the theme and the Russian roulette scene, that's OK. When you return to this superior war film, if you have the stomach for it, you will be in the mood for something special.",4.5
"A fantastic soundtrack that's obsessive to listen to, well acted by all having Christopher walken stealing the show from Robert de niro, well written to the point were it becomes completely perfect, story well told I mean seriously the deer hunter has quite along story and is overall just a perfect plotbthat is very well told in a very entertaining way, well executed to perfection and overall one of the best movies ever made thanks to Robert De Niro's and Christopher Walken's electrifying performances, so overall the deer hunter is absolutely fucking fantastic so I like to say its FF which stands for Fucking Fantastic five out of five stars for the deer hunter, its an unmissable masterpiece.",5.0
"Friendships forged in the steel mills of Shitwheel, Pennsylvania. Money earned for beer and broads, maybe also for firearms to perfect killing wild animals with a single pull of the trigger. Boom. One shot. Michael Cimino was instantly elevated to the status of Tinseltown deity in the mid-'70s due to the success of The Deer Hunter, his widescreen, minor-key symphony to the innocent, honest-to-goodness working class Midwestern dreamers who were packed off to 'Nam to become cannon fodder for Uncle Sam. If they didn't return (at best) with missing limbs or (at worst) in a metal CASKET, most likely the wires up-top were well-and-truly frazzled.

I first saw this in high school and being the dumb kid I was I grew bored of it. An hour dedicated to a wedding? Who cares. I hated this flick. Now as I rewatch it I like the wedding scene better than the Vietnam portions. I've grown an appreciation for the emotional buildup and the communal characterization while at the same time I've become more critical of the war sequences.
Christopher Walken is great here and really the entire cast is solid. If you look at this as a movie about what hardship can do to people as opposed to a war movie in any sense (either from a historical point or a action point) this is a pretty groovy flick. But man does this length and pace kill it. This revisiting as a chore.

"___Teil unserer Pile of Shame Lotterie___
Der heutige Griff in die Kiste mit ungesehenen DVDs brachte diesen prominent besetzten Klassiker über den Vietnamkrieg zum Vorschein. Der etwas reisserischere deutsche Titel ""Die durch die Hölle gehen"" war dabei ein wenig irreführend, denn obwohl es um den Vietnamkrieg geht und die bekannteste Szene sich um russisches Roulette dreht, handelt es sich um einen ruhigen Film, der sich viel Zeit lässt. Es geht nicht nur um die Schrecken auf dem Schlachtfeld, sondern vor allem darum, wie der Krieg die Soldaten und ihre daheim gebliebenen Freunde und Familien verändert. Die Auswirkungen von Vietnam auf Amerika also.
Der erste Akt hat es mir noch schwer gemacht, mich in den Film einzufinden. Zu unsympathisch waren mir die Charaktere, zu aggressiv, zu frauenfeindlich, zu rückständig. Mit Michael, der sich dann auch glücklicherweise als Hauptcharakter herausstellte, konnte ich noch am ehesten mitfühlen. Sicher, hierbei zeigt sich deutlich, dass der Film nun Mal zu einer anderen Zeit spielt - er wurde unmittelbar nach dem Vietnamkrieg gedreht. Allerdings empfand ich viele Szenen auch schlicht als zu lang. Ich weiß es zu schätzen, wenn man sich Zeit lässt, seine Figuren einzuführen, und gerade in diesem Fall ist es natürlich wichtig, um den Kontrast zu den Folgen des Kriegseinsatzes zu verdeutlichen. Aber die Hochzeitsszenen zogen sich für mich wie Gummi und insgesamt hätte es dem Film denke ich nicht geschadet, hier einiges zu straffen.
Dann der Schnitt weg vom unbekümmerten Spaß und der Idylle der Berge, in denen man gerade noch mit den Freunden auf die Jagd ging. Wir sehen nun, wie drei von ihnen in Vietnam in Gefangenschaft geraten. Die Szenen, die folgen, sind das krasse Gegenteil zur Einführung: Schnell, dreckig, die Kamera immer nahe dran, und es geht um Leben und Tod. Auch heute noch wirkt das sehr brutal. Der Krieg muss nicht mit viel mehr als dieser Szene abgehandelt werden, weil sie seine Sinnlosigkeit und die Beliebigkeit des Sterbens perfekt auf den Punkt bringt.
Auch der Rest des Films kann fesseln, weil die Leidensgeschichten der Drei so verschieden sind. Sie überleben zwar vorerst, bleiben aber von den Erlebnissen gezeichnet oder zerbrechen sogar komplett daran. Diejenigen, die daheim auf ihre Rückkehr gewartet haben, müssen ebenfalls mit der Situation klar kommen. Diese verschiedenen Sichtweisen sind sehr gut eingefangen worden. Eine Szene, die zwar nicht sonderlich überraschend war, mir aber trotzdem sehr gut gefallen hat, war das Zusammentreffen von Michael mit dem Hirsch. Es geht immer um die eine Kugel...
Etwas irritierend fand ich allerdings das Ende, weil nicht ganz klar wurde, ob es ironisch oder ernst gemeint ist. Im Endeffekt ist das aber nicht so sehr von Bedeutung, denn The Deer Hunter ist sowieso keiner dieser Filme, die den Sinn oder Unsinn des Vietnamkrieges ausdiskutieren wollen. Egal wo und wofür man kämpft, die Folgen für den Einzelnen sind immer ähnlich, und deshalb hat er auch heute nichts an Aktualität verloren.
Insgesamt ein sehr sehenswerter (Anti)kriegsfilm, dem ich nur deshalb keine bessere Wertung gebe, weil er für mich persönlich einige Längen hatte. Aber so geht es mir häufig bei älteren Filmen, das ist also wahrscheinlich reine Geschmackssache.",3.5
"""Do you think life would ever turn out like this?"" ""No.""
[Forgive me but most of this review is analysis]
Released in 1978, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a film about emotion, to which Cimino takes them to their most absolute visceral levels producing a drama that brings an emotional powerhouse upon its audience. The film starts in the small industrial town of Clairton Pennsylvania with gang of friends Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken), Stevie (Savage), and others. Now this is where we are introduced to the first chapter of The Deer Hunter; the emotion of happiness. We start on the wedding day of Stevie, the supposed happiest day of a man's life and certainly lives to the fullest with his pals. He goes off for a drink and a game with his friends at the local bar before his big moment. Then we go to their wedding, which has received some flack from audiences for dragging on too long, but for me it couldn't run smoother. Cimino is showing us the characters the happiest they could ever be, they're drunk, dancing, and seemingly couldn't have a care in the world about it all. He squeezes every last once of emotion he can get from the wedding so he can further be ready to use the great storytelling tool of contrast.
After our admittedly pretty obvious allusions to the future from the wedding, (the Green Beret's""Fuck it"" and the spilling of the wine) we go from Stevie's last hurrah to Michael's 1st we see in the film via the gang's annual deer hunt. Michael is already the most disillusioned of the bunch, streaking in the night repeating the Green Beret's call of Fuck It, and typically finding himself in the background of all the fun. But out in the mountains, he finds himself most at peace. Bagging the only deer of the day, Michael leaves Clairton successful, beginning his transformation into a hero. And with a somber Chopin piece we end our first chapter.
After meticulously detailing the gang's small town life, we're thrown in without warning to Vietnam with Cimino's 2nd chapter on fear, bravery, and heroism. Even in war Michael starts alone, and being alive, is successful again. Until by some luck his friends helicopter in and in the next scene we're thrown into the hut by the water for The Deer Hunter's most infamous scene. What follows still holds up to be one the most intense scenes in film, just perfect performances by Savage, De Niro, and Walken. In wading we start with Stevie, who's shinning moment has long past. Now he is a cowarding shell of man just begging to go home. Nick is oddly calm and ready and Michael already playing the hero for Stevie. After the piercing game of Russian Roulette, and a little river ride our gang splits up along the way to Saigon. There we primarily focus on Nick and his fall from a first time hero from the roulette game. With the promise of his to-be wife Linda (Streep) waiting back home for him, Nick makes the decision to actually stay in Saigon, disconnecting himself from his past love to his new love, the thrill of five or six empty cylinders and a single bullet loaded. In our last looks in Vietnam we see Michael depart as a hero in uniform, Stevie fearfully lost in the hustle and bustle, and Nick going into his own unknown path.
Chapter 3 is the return, rebuild, and reform. Initially Michael hasn't shown much change as he chooses to spend his first night home alone in a hotel rather than his own welcome home party. Though he does he finds company in Nick's girl Linda, though he knows it can't last. He knows he's still the hero. We soon find Stevie to be alive, though his wife Angel is barely there mindlessly searching for a voice, for a reason, as her supposed hero was demolished in the war. Linda is using Michael to grasp onto any semblance of a hero she can have. To get these responsibilities off of his head Michael goes back to his inner place, deer hunting, but now even this is tapping Michael on his shoulder reminding him of what he should do as the hero, as he finally misses, yelling ""Okay!"", accepting all his burdens.
With Steve the coward had going into hiding from the real world, he then goes back to Saigon to confront Nick, in the hero's final mission.
As it boils down to the last game of Roulette Michael finds that his heroism can't seem to fix anything, as Nick and Stevie seem to be lost causes as Stevie would rather live in a drab hospital all his life, and Nick mindlessly in love with Saigon. Michael is done playing hero because he knows he can't. Earlier in the film Nick says his favorite part of hunting was the trees and hills, he cherished the art and beauty of it all. And for Nick this whole game is as beautiful as the trees, as beautiful as Linda, maybe even more so, so why would he ever consider coming back?
With our fourth and final chapter we study grief and remembrance of what we knew. After Nick, the community stands together as one but as disjointed as ever. But Michael does manage to get the gang back together as they bond the only way they know how, a drink at the bar, as we close the film.
In all The Deer Hunter proves to a very powerful experience from all aspects. It looks fantastic, the cast is running on all cylinders, a beautifully subtle score, and as said before the plot moves from emotional peak to emotional peak without holding back. An experience you won't soon forget.",5.0

"Been on the watchlist for a long while now, glad to have finally seen it. I have no problem with long films, at all - in fact I often prefer them, but The Deer Hunter showed no justification for its length - it feels like they were so hellbent on doing an hour per act that they just filled the gaps in. I wouldn’t say it’s boring, but it’s ridiculously slow paced, especially the first act which dragged unnecessarily. The way each act had its own structure and almost its own story worked well in fairness, it gave a real sense of individuality but also cohesion in a strange way. 
All the cast were fantastic, particularly De Niro who killed it, was taken aback by how young Christopher Walken looked here but he was also fantastic, picking up his only ever Oscar win in the Supporting Actor category. Meryl Streep had a great supporting performance here too, only coming into play in the first and final act, but her presence for sure acted as a catalyst for character motivation in the Vietnam and act. 
On a whole it’s strong, but held back by the filmmakers’s desire to have a 3hr+ film, it’s clear he was to fixated on having three acts at an hour each than it felt forced and pacing was in shambles. Some really great moments, especially the first Russian Roulette scene.

"To preface, I did miss the first 15 minutes because my volleyball game started at 7 instead of 6, but holy moly was this movie intense. I saw it at the Landmark E Street Cinema for $5.
Some scattered thoughts:
-Orthodox Christian communities are rarely represented in Hollywood (compared to other flavors or Christianity at least), and its ritualistic use here is so well done
-That infamous wedding scene is spectacular (apparently it took 5 days to shoot). This scene among many others best encapsulates the camera’s voyeurism (kind of like a hunter watching its prey maybe?)
-holy mother mary is Meryl Streep amazing in this, well deserved first Oscar nomination. It’s really sweet to see her and John Cazale on the screen together.
-I think a lot of what this movie gets right is vibes-based. What I mean by that is while its depictions of Vietnam or PTSD may not be accurate, that’s not really the point. The dialogue wasn’t in-your-face amazing, and sometimes the brilliant score drowned out some of the conversations, but the best moments, I felt, were the silent ones: the beat before a character makes a major decision, the second before a gun goes off. Say what you will about the runtime but this movie was enthralling. 
-(Spoiler ahead) To finish off my last point, take the climax of the movie.


The Saigon Russian roulette cock fight was hardcore. It was confusing and brash and mesmerizing. Much of it was spectacle-the dialogue again doesn’t come across as in anyway brilliant and there is no obvious political commentary-but the movie reveals itself to be, at its heart, a drama. Its structure is traditional-three parts: set up (wedding), conflict (Vietnam), and outcome (picking up the pieces)-but the plot feels secondary to the immaculate portrayal of small town Pennsylvania in 1968. These people really do love each other and would go to hell and back for one another even if one has to commit a few war crimes along the way. I did get chills during God Bless America.",4.0

"Robert de Niro y Cristopher estás de 10, me sorprende mucho que cuando se habla de las mejores actuaciones de Robert está pase muy desapercibida por qué a mí parecer está a nivel que la de don Corleone, todo en la película es sumamente disfrutable, desde la boda hasta está horrible escena de Vietnam",4.5

"an disengaging three act movie that completely misses any point. it opens with an over-americanified wedding scene, in which we meet the three most unlikeable and boring protagonists, with no true seperate identities, and no enjoyable traits. we then spend 40 minutes in vietnam, two of those consist of actual fighting, where instead we get an endless and, above all, pointless russian roulette scene with no real outcome? after one small, and granted harrowing scene in the hospital (but more…",2.0

"Why did I take so long to watch this? This is probably one of the most emotionally draining films I’ve ever seen but I loved it! Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken both gave fantastic performances. The cinematography all around was great, the only negative I’d say I had was that the wedding scene really dragged on longer than it needed too.",4.5
"I’ve told many of my friends I’ve seen this movie and it probably annoys them but FUCK IT. I’ve watched this movie at least 7 more times after I bought it I still can’t get enough of it. This was John Cazales last film he did and he was GREAT.  if anyone hasn’t seen the John Cazale I knew it was you little doc on YouTube watch it. Everyone was brilliant, walken, deniro, Streep, Cazale, everybody.",5.0
"This marks the 100th film I’ve watched this year, and I need it to be special rather than any random film from my watchpile or on streaming. And what better film to watch than Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter. It’s definitely a project that could have only been made in the New Hollywood era, as it explores the impact and trauma of war and how it can ultimately change and damage a man.

Great film about war and its effects on people, loved the hunting scenes kudos to the beautiful Washington State. This is a powerful film.",4.0
"The wedding scenes are some of the most vital and ebullient cinema has to offer. If you were to cut the run time to an hour and end it before the war it’s basically perfect. 
Just like Full Metal Jacket, the war segment is so much more uninteresting than the setup. The great thing about this movie is that the last third is also really great and powerful. 
I thought this movie would be generic war movie Oscar-fare, but it’s a lot more human and subtle than I gave it credit for. 
Really good.",3.5

Don't get me wrong, at times it's a fantastic movie, but at other times (and a bit too often) it's rather dragging. I really don't think it needed to be an intimidating 3 hours long.

yeah yeah a 3 hour anti-war war epic wasn’t the right call for a short-fused day like today but they COULDNT cut down the 40 minute wedding dance scene?,2.5
Amazing to see these hall of fame actors figuring it out in the early stages of their career. Young Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken is just the tops. So many genuinely jaw dropping shots. Also an impressive amount of things that are communicated without dialogue. My high school gym teacher’s all time favorite movie… and for good reason.,4.5

"one of the worst films I've ever watched. The movie is 3 hours long and nothing really happens in the movie except a 5-min scene with a Russian rullete and a 10-min ending where DeNiro comes to rescue his friend walken. Apart from that is just 2 hours and 50 minutes of completely random talk and events that don't matter. The movie was supposed to be about Vietnam so I expected action, no action in the movie whatsoever. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend watching it, short say it's a waste of 3 hours' time.",0.5

"Meditative, close to perfect cinema. The first act gets better and better the further away I get from actually watching it. And the horrors of the second and third acts can’t be put into words.",4.5
"Not your typical knees in the mud being ambushed War film but certainly reflected on the horrors of the Vietnam War with use of some real footage from the era. The film had an unconventional plot rotating around Russian roulette and home-war relations.
I really enjoyed the wedding night scene with .Mike (Deniro) running down the streets naked. 
The film ends rather abruptly given the 3 hour length but an ending that would be the only one to make sense.…",3.5

"Okay I admit I stayed for robert de niro in an army uniform but my god.. what a movie.
I initially hesitated to see this because I didn't want to see yet another long ass war movie but I was wrong, what I got was an intimate story of family and friendship shot beautifully that made my heart warm.",4.5
to be honest this movie feels like a wedding of your second cousin that you don’t really want to be at. and at that same wedding your great uncle is recounting his vague memories of the vietnam war,3.0
"I almost stopped watching after the first 45 minutes. The characters/acting during the scenes that take place in the US were infuriatingly and annoyingly over emoted.
HOWEVER, the sheer brilliance of the scenes that take place in Vietnam alone make this film worth watching. It is some of the best filmmaking I’ve ever seen. It’s just a very strange juxtaposition between how much I disliked the first half of the movie and how awed I was by the second half.",3.5
"Flawed masterpieces are the best kind of masterpieces. 
Absolutely wild that anyone let them release this movie with the first act intact. I’ve been to actual weddings that were shorter than the wedding sequence in this. And honestly, I didn’t even find it that effective in character developing when taking into account how much was committed to it? I love the thematic idea of a 3+ hour “war movie” that only spends like 45 minutes on the war itself and has maybe 2 minutes of actual fighting. These guys lived a whole life before they got to Vietnam. And then they lived a life after. Their time there was just one brief moment between those two lives. It’s a powerful conceptual idea! But idk man, did we really need yet another cut to random Orthodox wedding dancing?? 
Is there any other movie that’s so fully built around one sequence? You can tell someone has an idea for that scene and then the entire plot got built out around it but goddamn if it’s not a powerful motif. 
Walken is a total unknown here and goes toe-to-toe with the biggest movie star in the world and comes out with an Oscar and a career. Iconic. Savage totally outclassed, how did they let him on the court with these two. Even the guys playing “racist Vietnamese caricature” are embarrassed by his performance. 
Speaking of, I think this movie got a lot of mileage out of “first movie to show the REAL Vietnam” but it’s actually still just as one-sided as the earlier, more jingoistic Vietnam films outside of showing what war does to its participants. There’s not a single Vietnamese character who isn’t a sadistic Communist, degenerate lowlife or a trashy prostitute. Such a penetrating, nuanced view into one aspect of Vietnam that is so completely blind to what is arguably the more important aspect of the picture. Big big problem throughout this. 
If it wasn’t for that, I’d say it might actually be the answer to Truffaut’s famous “there are no anti-war films” quote. You get maybe 2 minutes of actual battle in here and it features a grenade being thrown into a cellar full of children. If there’s ever been a war movie that more successfully avoided glamorization of violence, I haven’t seen it. 
I want to read a book or watch a movie about the making of this movie because everything about it is absolutely next-level insane. Maybe more interesting that the film itself. 
I feel like this review leans more toward the negative critiques so I’ll end by saying that several sequences here are among the most powerful and affecting I’ve ever seen set to film. Genuinely moving piece of artwork when it’s landing.",4.5

This is another one of those 70s movies that I just don’t get. It’s grimy, ugly, and glacially paced. The Russian Roulette sequences are nerve-racking, but fucking Paddington could be nerve-racking if the little bear whipped a pistol out of his raincoat and spun the cylinder.

"When the first time jump happened and all of a sudden we were deep into Vietnam I was a bit thrown off. We’re going to spend such a long time luxuriating in the wedding scene (don’t get me wrong, I could have watched that wedding forever) and then skip so much? It was jarring. But I came to really appreciate how this story was being told. Cimino isn’t afraid to really sink into certain parts of the story and skip through others.
The bigger, louder sequences are unbelievably gripping. I’ll remember the first Russian Roulette scene for the rest of my life. But the real greatness here is in the smaller, quieter, and often weirder parts. Every scene that happens in the bar for instance. It would be interesting to just show someone the scenes from the bar and ask them what they thought the story was. I bet they wouldn’t be far off.
I’m giving out some high ratings lately. Loving movies in 2021!",5.0
