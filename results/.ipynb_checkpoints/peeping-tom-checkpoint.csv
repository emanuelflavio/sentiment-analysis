"There is always an automatic aura of respect surrounding Powell's films. The attention to detail, the immaculate use of colours and the stunning set designs and mis en scene should garner nothing other than admiration and awe.
Peeping Tom is no exception. It is an amazing visual feast, oozing with luscious primary colours and lighting that makes just about every scene hold a treasure of some sort. Powell's ability to capture and hold your gaze with deftly constructed scenes ensures that, despite the film's somewhat straightforward plot, it is still a riveting film to watch.
Peeping Tom perhaps betrays its age somewhat in the pacing, but it is still an unusually macabre and dark film for that time. It has a disturbed and disturbing villain, who is simultaneously creepy and worthy of our pity. Moving along at a steady jog, the way it unfolds its narrative is mostly tackled perfectly, but sometimes it tends to drag out its ideas a bit too much for my liking. This is a minor quibble as it is still stunning even in its weaker moments.
I loved the unmissable passion for movie making present on a meta level here. The scenes on the movies sets are gems, little pockets of insight into filmmaking in those days and an interesting setting for a story like this. And as simple as that story is, there is still a deeper commentary hidden away if you are willing to scratch at the surface.
Literally turning the camera into a weapon, Peeping Tom almost feels like a satirical comment on modern media. We will watch anything and everything, are covered in an avalanche of reality soaps filled with people more than willing to share all the nooks and crannies of their life. And what do we do? We watch. The media has turned us into Peeping Toms and this film almost seems to ask the question who the real villain is. The maker or the watcher.
I'm leaning towards the latter.",4.5

"The gaze having colonized and replaced, rendering the whole of the body an optic nerve and the eyes no longer the eyes but where the new eye intersects with the transmission of data and of pleasure, the body an extension of the new eye, a system which can record, edit and play back events which use lived duration as another field to extend into and parasitically feed from, remaking it in the process, subsumed within and consumed there at leisure. The new eye is atop the pyramid, severed and floating above, everything which is only its base, what it needs to form a whole which it can then replicate and feed back onto, forming a totality from which to gaze out from, to forever mark that outwards as its domain of operation, a newly ravished corpse caught eternally in the act of so becoming.",5.0
"Shocking first to see the familiar Archers logo with just Powell and not Pressburger’s name in front of it. Then even more shocking to begin with a scene of a sex worker being murdered, told from the camera’s POV, with pockets of charcoal blacks added to the usual saturated color palette. Welcome to the ‘60s.
A prescient movie. This started to be discovered about 20 years after its disastrous initial release when Martin Scorsese became its de facto sponsor, and articulated the metaphor for directorial obsession that was laying there in plain sight. I’ll bet that even more people can identify with this movie now that we’re all amateur film directors with our iPhones - constantly photographing people and moments as a way to preserve them, control them, manipulate them, or just prove to ourselves and others that they existed.
I remembered, of course, that the camera is basically the guy’s dick, but I forgot that he actually has a murder weapon hidden in the tip of the front leg of the tripod stand, which he’s always raising slowly at a suggesting angle and caressing.",0.0

A tripod blade is a pretty sweet weapon for a serial killer.
I'm a big slasher fan but I've never watched Peeping Tom and I don't really know why. It's one of the first films to feature a serial killer and do the story from the killer's point of view. It's arguably the first slasher even though I would call it more a pre-cursor to slashers. In addition to all these things about Peeping Tom it also happens to be an interesting and really good film about a man's obsession with fear. It's creepy, it looks good, and the script is fantastic.
Everything about this film looks cool from the opening credits to the closing moments of the film. I love how you view so much from the perspective of the killer when it's time for violence to occur. Peeping Tom looks like it takes place in a slimy off broadway theater with poor lighting and I'm down for that look. The sets are sophisticated sleazy executed with great detail and beauty... it looks like it is supposed to look. The use of color is great in both the sets and costumes... which are to die for.
This movie is great scene after great scene. There is a super long part in the middle of this film that I can only describe as fear seduction porn where the killer is slowly trying to get the fear that he wants out of a woman. While it is more subtle than what would be done today it is creepier to me than anything that you find in modern horror. It's a very interesting demonstration of how you don't need to show a lot to make something anxiety-inducing and I appreciate that...don't get me wrong I love gore but to me this is also very fun.
The script is just so clever with so many interesting characters. Like each person, no matter how small in role, has something peculiar about them that makes them memorable immediately and that's a combination of dialogue and great performances. Karlheinz Böhm is standard setting in his role as Mark, your average neighborhood fear-loving serial killing photographer. You end up feeling strangely close to Mark, despite his tendencies, and that's a real difficult thing to do with a film like this. I like the slow tense build to the conclusion, which is satisfying and earned.

Michael Powell’s psychosexual thriller Peeping Tom operates very much like a British twin separated at birth from Hitchcock’s enduringly iconic Psycho. Both released in 1960, they each follow a seemingly amiable if not timorous young man psychologically plagued by a violent voyeuristic disorder. Where Psycho’s Norman Bates copes with his sexual desires by peeping through concealed holes in his motel walls, Mark Lewis, an aspiring filmmaker compendiously played by Karlheinz Böhm, wields his handheld camera as a proxy for the scoptophilic gaze. Both films are steeped in generalized Freudian psychology that may infuriate the modern viewer, but the paralleled themes of suggested child abuse yielding a highly conditioned individual who equates sexual desire with violence are reverse synthesized into two very different cinematic interpretations.
Mark uses fearmongering techniques to slowly terrorize women while filming their murders, then assembles the footage into a compilation of snuff material ostensibly for his sexual gratification, but Norman strikes abruptly and keeps no souvenir of his serial homicides. Where Norman assumes his mother’s identity to murder the subject of his sexual desires and cope with his repressed feelings of guilt and shame associated with sexuality, Mark’s childhood trauma of his father consistently filming him and his reactions to his father’s scholarly fear experiments informs his maladapted process of repeating that learned behavior with his own victims. 
In his sexual development, Mark uses the camera and phallic weapon of choice as his surrogates for the eye and the male organ. Only after meeting the sympathetic Helen (Anna Massey) does he start to actively display guilt/shame feelings and an unraveling of his tenuous composure; unlike Norman, who dissociates completely during his attacks, Mark is in a state of psychiatric morbidity—he is acutely aware of his mental illness despite his physical and psychological deterioration. Norman kills Marion Crane after connecting with her emotionally, which stokes his sexual attraction and triggers his response. Mark, however, protects Helen from his disordered paraphilic behaviors by promising to never film her—instead we see him prey mainly on sex workers and women who are easily missed. 
Norman’s capture results in an apparently permanent dissociation, likely due to a combination of shock and debilitating guilt and/or shame. But from the onset, we see Mark flirting with the promise of being discovered; he anticipates and even welcomes apprehension because he is unable to control the deadly symptoms of his crippling obsession and overpowering mental illness. However, when the police come to arrest him, Mark executes his final massacre as a desperate attempt to complete some sort of cycle—to not only finish his morbid documentary, but to reconnect him to his father via an interpretation of his father’s experiments. It is framed as an dramatic gesture of protection for Helen’s wellbeing, but studded with the themes Mark experienced in his childhood—the trigger of fear and looking, and how that manifests into his only source for human connection and the funnel for sexual attraction, frustration, and discovery. 
Both films navigate heavy and provocative themes of eroticism and violence, but Peeping Tom balances the depravity with droll British comedy and refreshing performances from the entire female supporting cast. Anna Massey as Helen and Maxine Audley as her keen, blind mother have particular chemistry (both with each other and Böhm), and Moira Shearer delights in a twinkle-toed cameo. Karlheinz Böhm impressed me with his adroit personification of the tormented sadist yearning for an escape, and despite some of the film’s broader moments, I felt Peeping Tom’s earnest attempt at weaving empathy into this memorable tragedy of an extremely traumatized mind.",4.0

"I had only seen this film about voyeurism and obsession once before so it definitely needed a revisit and it definitely holds up. While tame by today’s standards, it’s still a disturbing glimpse into the life of a seriously unbalanced individual. This is another one of those films in which I wish I could have seen the reaction of audiences firsthand because apparently people were quite appalled and disturbed by the subject matter. It doesn’t seem like such a big deal now because pretty much everyone’s lives are no longer private. We are online and on display more often than not and while I personally don’t understand the desire to document every aspect of one’s life, it’s kinda creepy how similar Mark’s behavior is to that of the average person today. It seemed outrageously intrusive then to film everyday mundane aspects of life and yet here we are in 2018 and it’s become fairly commonplace. Go figure.
The performances are all great. Karlheinz Bölm is shady yet charming and endlessly fascinating to watch. Speaking of watching, I would be quite content with a feature length movie of just Moira Shearer dancing around that film set.",4.5
"Always found it funny no matter what my ""arthouse"" friends say, you can argue that Michael Powell's greatest gift to cinema was inventing the slasher.
Now it has been years, since i last watched this and I only have just realised the murder at the start of this is an actual location in London, it is Newman Passage, between Newman Street and Rathbone Street. I've drunk in The Duke of York, Fitzrovia, which is the pub at the end of the road when they recover the body, multiple times over the years. The Pub next to the entrance was the Newman Arms.
Hell, a couple of streets away is Stephen St, the home of the office of British Film Institute, I believe the BFI were there in the 50s/60s, This may seem a strange fact but I have always wondered if this was based on some weird real life event/urban rumour in the film industry.

"“I don’t trust a man who walks quietly.” 
When I say I’m obsessed with Peeping Tom, I mean I am obsessed with Peeping Tom. 
Both a well orchestrated thriller and an extensive deep dive into the complexities of audiences’ own voyeurism within the realm of film. 
Peeping Tom is well layered, allowing one to take it at literal face value or to dig deeper into the complexities of the underlying messages imbedded within the subtext. I thought often of Funny Games while watching and how the two are two sides of the same coin, both pointing a finger back at the audience and challenging them to acknowledge their active participation in the horrors they’re watching. Albeit, Funny Games carries out that concept in a much more direct and aggressive manner, so Peeping Tom’s more soft handed approach with it is a wonderful counterweight. 
Wicked fun, magnificently constructed, and a challenging piece of media. I feel like it’s coming across like I’m being quite lenient so far this year with my ratings but really what keeps happening is I keep watching absolute bangers. And Peeping Tom is up there as one of the most banging of bangers.",5.0
"Much like the acts of violence in its lurid frames, “Peeping Tom” was an act of cinema brutality with a reverberating magnitude. 
The film not only ended Michael Powell’s career given its resoundingly poor reception, but its influences can be counted among the brightest gems and the sloppiest muck of late 20th century film. 
Among the gems; works by Scorsese and Coppola; who have listed “Tom” as among their favorite films. 
Among the muck; depending on who you ask, “Tom” was the satanic mother of slasher cinema. 
What distinguishes Powell’s work from its spawn though - is that he knew just where to direct his own gaze. 
Slasher cinema turns the viewer into the voyeur of the female body and violence done upon it. But there’s a reason so many psycho killers went masked; their directors didn’t let us gaze onto the killer. 
Not so with “Peeping Tom.” Powell lets the audience look into the eyes of the bearer of all “Tom’s” evils; a perfectionist director. 
And so, “Peeping Tom” is a masterpiece — because we are not only gazing at the women victims, but moreso in abject horror at the man gazing at them... a man not so far off from our idols of Scorsese, Coppola, or Powell in psychology... only in action.",4.5
"Hooptober 3.0 (2016) #17
At the very beginning of the film we are presented with the first hand vicarious experience of murdering a prostitute. We have the privileged position of seeing what the killer sees through the view finder of his camera as he stabs her to death with the sharpened point of his tripod leg. Given this first-person perspective we are rudely shoved into a position of identification with the killer and by extension made complicit in his crimes by the implicit acceptance of the atrocity that he (we) commit.
Having been immediately introduced to our killer we can dismiss the mystery of the whodunnit and we can focus on the greater mystery of trying to understand and learn more about our evil, murderous antagonist Mark Lewis. The thing is, Mark is almost kind of likable. He is mild-mannered, amiable and shy. This outward social behavior is incongruous and jarring when juxtaposed with the horrendous, pre-meditated executions that he commits.
One clue to his behaviour may be found in his early childhood. Mark's father subjected him to constant experiments as part of his research into the response to fear. Having applied a stimulus to induce fear, his father would film young Mark's tears, fright, disgust and grief. It is quite possible that such treatment could be seen as traumatic and when experienced at such a crucial time in a child's development it certainly could result in certain cognitive abnormalities.
His father was also at the head of his field in the study of voyeurism. In one key scene we see Mark sitting on a fence watching a couple kissing in the park. We see this all through the perspective of his father's camera lens as he focuses on the couple on the park bench and then on his son sitting on the fence.
This voyeurism and fear conditioning is a heady brew. It raises awkward questions about how culpable Mark is for his crimes. Is his compulsion to collect images of death and to collate them into his documentary of the fear response of the women he murders inevitable considering the modelling and conditioning that he has received? Is he rendered by his childhood trauma unable to control his transgressive behaviour? The answers to these questions have the potential to render a hideous fiend into a sympathetic victim, which is a difficult conclusion to accept given the tragedy experienced by his victims.
The fact that the film camera and its apparatus is the murder weapon itself is also a crucial element of this film. Everything is anchored by the fact that it is being filmed, projected and viewed. By focusing on this Peeping Tom becomes a rigorous interrogation of the culture of film production and it's consumption. Every scene is packed with ideas and questions about how we understand the human experience through the moving image and to what effect it has on us. This makes Peeping Tom an important film in the critical discourse on the social and psychological impact of violence and perversity on screen.
My apologies, I have focused more on the themes rather than the formal qualities of the film. Suffice it to say that the film looks great. Its lurid use of Eastman colour perfectly casts a sickly glow over Mark's film lab and projection space suggesting that something is rotten inside. The acting is highly stylised and when combined with some of the more naif moments in the dialogue it can be rather unintentionally amusing but this is part of it's charm. Irrespective, the characters work because the performances are earnest and engrossing.
I have been mulling over my relationship to screen violence and exploitation since the film went dark and silent and the only conclusion that I have come to is that there are no simple answers. But I love the fact that this film has me thoroughly engaged in thinking about it. Anyone seriously interested in the horror film and the cultural discourse surrounding it should see this film immediately.",5.0
"Peeping Tom is a metacinematographic essay with morbid intensity and macabre lyricism that represents one of the greatest benchmarks of modern thriller. The story's protagonist is a disturbed and psychopathic filmmaker who takes pleasure in filming the last moments of life of young women that he himself kills with the sharp tip of his camera tripod. Initially welcomed by negative criticisms so violent as to practically put an end to Michael Powell's career, the film was re-evaluated in the 1970s thanks to the interest of authors such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, and today it is rightly considered - together with Rear Window - as the most acute and disturbing reflection on the psychology of the voyeur and, by extension, on the meaning of cinema as the art of the gaze. The value of Peeping Tom lies in being a work that does not only concern cinema and filmakers, but also those who watch the screen and live on cinema. It is a movie in a certain sense shot ""against"" the audience, made with the specific purpose of analyzing it, interrogating it, provoking it, forcing it to confront its own perversions in a frightening process of identification with the protagonist.

"78/100
Second viewing, last seen 1996. Still seems remarkably dangerous six decades later, thanks to Boehm's unnerving performance (enhanced by the thick German accent nobody ever acknowledges), the lurid Eastmancolor palette, and a general air of casual seediness that one just doesn't readily associate with that era. Psychologically and thematically, the film's arguably a bit muddled, though one could argue that its main DSM-5 issue—conflating voyeurism and sadism—is fully justified by the camera-as-weapon reflexivity. (""It's only a camera!"" one detective shouts to another in the final scene, to which his colleague incredulously replies ""Only?"" This is before they have any idea how it's been modified, note.) But Rear Window handles that idea more adeptly/subtly, and I submit that Peeping Tom reached disturbing new heights in the age-old realm of Eros + Thanatos. Moira Shearer's scene is basically Singin' in the Rain's ""You Were Meant for Me"" duet restaged as a solo horror number, with music explicitly meant to arouse. When Helen's blind mother shows up in Mark's room, asking him to describe the literal snuff film he's watching, their dynamic as she leaves suggests not so much a potential murder averted but the mutual mortification of a mother- and son-in-law who very nearly fucked each other. Sex, violence, fear and cinema get indiscriminately tossed together in ways that sometimes make sense and sometimes don't, though the latter instances hardly seem to matter when e.g. Mark willingly hands the police his camera and then stealthily freaks out as one detective proceeds to fiddle with it for the entire interrogation. Bonus points for Powell creating magnificent tension during what's basically an exposition dump re: Mark's cruel childhood (Manhunter could have taken a cue from that scene, rather than throwing out Dolarhyde's entire history), and for a (very brief) climactic look directly into the lens that for once has a legitimate function. Obviously pretty great, really; having just revisited Back to the Future last week, I couldn't help but imagine Marty McFly sheepishly telling a 1960 audience, post-screening: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.""",4.0
"Criterion Collection Spine #58
A voyeuristic killer that just can't look away from the terror he imposes.
""Imagine... someone coming towards you... who wants to kill you... regardless of the consequences ... A madman? ... Yes. But he knows it - and you don't.""
The current Letterboxd poster for Peeping Tom definitely does not do a good job of selling how great of a psychological horror film this is. The movie is about a strange man with a german accent that is obsessed with filming the terror on his victim's faces before murdering them. And I would say this happens to be one of the great films that's able to be tense and frightening by using implied horror, rather than relying on graphic violence.
(Quick Hits) .... Spoilers:
- The deadpan gazes of this killer photographer that we follow provide a strong eerie presence, especially when people catch him staring at them through the window ... peeping tom style
- You can also feel his gaze when we get the point of view of his camera that he uses almost constantly, in the open and secretly
- He lives upstairs in this large house, and rents out the downstairs rooms. Then the plot thickens when a young woman named Helen living with her mom in the house becomes interested in him. And despite showing her his strange footage of voyeurism, including experiments in fear that his father would conduct on him, she continues to want to see him
- The prolonged impacts of the messed up testing/nurturing his father performed on him that are hinted at throughout, definitely lead to the creation of this murderous peeping tom
- Helen's mother is almost as eerie as he is, and she can tell that he is up to something. Her being blind makes her super observant about the sounds he makes, and the scene where they meet is very tense since we are able to hear his heartbeat like she can
""The blind always live in the rooms they live under.""
- It was fascinating to see the bright colors that Director Michael Powell was known for in his classic films, contrasted in this much darker story. The colors really popped in the scenes where he photographs lingerie models, also the colorful lightning he slowly turns on around a movie set where he carries out one of his murders, and even his dark photo development room has so much color in it
- Not only does he like to capture his victims dying, but he also likes to film the crime scene being investigated the following day
- The inclusion of men buying pornography was a clever detail in the story, to show how there is a range when it comes to the perversion of gazing at someone with desire
- Karlheinz Böhm does a great job in the lead role as Mark Lewis, with how his performance makes us feel the intrigue of his character's murderous voyeurism. Towards the climax we can even see that he wants these impulsive urges to stop, but he can't control them. And it actually seems like he longs to be caught towards the end
- There are so many great scenes where the tension builds and builds, which made the film go by so quickly. One of the creepiest moments for me was when the mother shows up in his projection room, and how the face of one of his terrified victims then becomes ghostly when projected on his back
- That was a great touch at the end to show how there was recording equipment in each of the rooms that his father used to spy on their tenants. And the screaming Mark begins to play from the recorders at the end builds to a fever pitch for the finale
- Then it is revealed that Mark's big secret for capturing his victim's being so scared, was to make them look at their own terrified reflection while being killed
If I had one complaint it would be that some of the acting was slightly melodramatic, but overall as a horror film from the early 60s Peeping Tom is a masterful thriller paired with a gripping physiological character study.

"I never heard of this film until today! I found it when I did a search for most controversial films! Apparently this film was so heavily dumped on by the critics (due to its disturbing theme) it ultimately ended his career!
So I hunkered down in my chair and prepared myself for a sleaze fest! Boy was I disappointed! It was a perfectly constructed film with a titillating theme that was so watered down for the masses I honestly couldn't understand why everyone got their panties in a bunch over this!
It wasn't dirty, sordid or graphic! It was a psychological thriller! The pacing was ungodly slow so I took a break from it to step outside and enjoy the sun! I forced myself to come back and finish the film!
It was obvious to me this film was not my cup of tea! However I felt compelled to learn more about it because it ruined a man's life! What I discovered instead was a new found respect for the film!
The film is now considered a masterpiece! I feel sad for Michael Powell that it took all of these years to finally get the credit due him! My only hope is that he was made aware of this before he died! And I'm angered over the fact a mob of critics destroyed his life in the time it takes to write a nasty review! I guess the old adage is true the pen is mightier than the sword!
Which would be impressive if they hadn't turned Michael Powell into a directorial Eunuch and by doing so denied the world of future masterpieces by Michael Powell!
I hope we can all learn something from this fiasco! Because I don't care for this film and give my opinion stating so does not mean the film has no merits! I am not a diety! My words are just that... my words! If you don't see a film simply because someone else said it was bad you may be cheating yourself of seeing a film that may very well be a masterpiece to you! You are the ONLY critic that ultimately matters!
For you future directors and cameramen out there this is an IMPORTANT film for you to see! I'm not going to regurgitate all of the reasons why... but it's all out there for you to see should you turn to the great and mighty oracle google! For those interested in psychology this one is a real doozey!
While I may not like the film, I can certainly admire and respect its contribution to the world of cinema! And I can certainly empathize with the man who was robbed of his career unjustly!",2.5
"""The result must be so perfect that the risks don't count.""
While he would go on to make five more films over the course of a dozen years, it's still fair to say that the critical reception of Peeping Tom in 1960 effectively ruined director Michael Powell's career in English filmmaking. Like Hitchcock's Psycho a couple of months later, the film was savaged by censors as well as the English press. Unlike Psycho however, audiences also stayed away. The fiasco turned Powell into an international journeyman.
By day an unremarkable focus puller for a London film crew, at night Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) takes surreptitious pictures of credulous women (e.g., prostitutes, aspirant models, colleagues) before luring them to vulnerable locales and dispassionately terminating them with a phallic tripod blade—all the while documenting their abject dread for later perusal in his home theater. Mark has inherited the home of his late father but lets most of the rooms to manage costs for upkeep, living anonymously in a small unit as though he too were a tenant. His extreme bashfulness piques the interest of Helen (Anna Massey), a well meaning boarder living downstairs with her blind mother Mrs. Stephens (Maxine Audley).
On a friendly visit to Mark's quarters, Helen learns of his troubling childhood history as a regular test subject for his biologist father's unethical experiments on the nature of fear. Though seemingly a full-time drinker, Mrs. Stephens is possessed of keen instincts and looks askance at the developing relationship between her ingenuous daughter and the mysterious landlord. With his violent psychosexual tendencies challenged for the first time by genuine affection, Mark briefly confides in a psychiatrist working for the police, who reveals that Mark's condition would take intensive therapy to alter (as well as privately alerting police that Mark warrants serious attention). After dispiritedly meeting and killing a model, Mark returns to find Helen privately screening of one of his snuff films, leading to a revelatory final encounter.
As an exercise in terror it must be said that Peeping Tom is pretty feeble, but nonetheless it's visually opulent, sometimes touching and very often hilarious. And while not as audacious as its outsize reputation might indicate, it's still worth noting that the film contains the first use of frontal nudity in the English cinema. Despite the nature of the material the film's first half is exceptionally fun, particularly the parodic segments highlighting the mundanity of technical work in the film industry. The second half gets caught up in a fair amount of pop-psychology theorizing that lets some air out of the balloon.
Though sometimes a bit stilted, Böhm's portrayal of Mark is nothing if not distinctive. He looks a lot like Nashville-era Dave Peel if he'd had his hair and makeup done by Thin White Duke-era David Bowie, and with Böhm's nearly toneless line readings I could be convinced that he employed Omar Sharif as a dialogue coach. The fact that these qualities make Böhm appear somewhat like an android would detract from the average performance, but for the thoroughly conditioned Mark it is an asset to his representation.
Additional points for Moira Shearer's arbitrary but engaging cameo.

"Director Michael Powell once described Peeping Tom as, "" ... a very tender film, a very nice one. Almost a romantic film.""; it's these almost-qualities which make it so tragic and heartbreaking. Because there's a different universe in which Peeping Tom becomes an even more transgressive Gun Crazy: one in which a man with broken pieces inside is found by a woman whose own sharp edges match his so perfectly that they jump off of a delirious cliff together, wonderingly embracing the flaws that make them unwelcome in society.
On the surface, Helen is nothing like Mark. Her slight social awkwardness in no way inhibits her ability to engage with others: she has a boyfriend, a community, and a raggedly charming confidence that suggests an otherwise hidden strength. She lives with her blind, alcoholic mother, and relates to her with a delicate combination of intimacy and superficiality which makes that life survivable, an instinctive adaptation that further confirms Helen's dexterity when it comes to making a path through the world.
But, in her last few moments with Mark, we see what she keeps hidden inside. We see it in her ecstatic expression as she stands, motionless, with a dagger at her throat, listening to Mark tell her the violence he's inflicted upon women. And we see it in the grotesque exaggeration of that expression in the funhouse mirror lashed to Mark's camera. This mirror that previously showed his victims their own deaths, driving them into terror so intense even the police were struck by it, reveals Helen's secret desires: her need for a relationship so transgressive it cannot be spoken of, let alone sought out. But here, in Mark, she's found someone who might have been able to give her what she needs, and with whose empty spaces she just might have been able to match.
Mark, however, has been so shattered by his upbringing, and the ways in which shame was infused into his very veins, that it has never occurred to him there was any other outlet for his desires; that there might be a way to meet his needs that doesn't end in death. It's too late, probably, when we see what is inside Helen, but it doesn't matter anyway: even seeing her face, Mark doesn't know such a thing exists. It's been so successfully hidden by polite society that, for Mark, the only acceptable kind of sex is polite, vanilla, and demure, and even the act of looking — or wanting to look — is forbidden, and thus cripplingly shameful. Something like the consensual, trusting, giving and taking of pain, fear, and control is beyond his comprehension.
(In that AU, though, Mark and Helen are deliriously happy, and there's lots of therapy, and Mark finally accepts that he, too, deserves nice things.)
(Also, I think we should talk more about how outrageously talented Karlheinz Böhm was, and the fascinating choices he made throughout his film career.)",4.5
"Perhaps its just the effect of time passing, and social social mores shifting, but given its potentially lurid subject matter, Michael Powell's close-quarters study of a voyeuristic serial killer seems quite tame now; almost quaint. I imagine it might have been shocking in 1960, but almost 60 years on, it's a remarkably bloodless affair whose main draw is the unusual psychology of a man driven to murder by his inner demons.
There's no mystery as to the killer's identity - we follow Mark Lewis from the outset - the mystery is why he does what he does. The resolution of that mystery isn't entirely satisfactory, explained away with some in-vogue Freudianism and a like-father-like-son, psychic trauma rationale. His primal urge to expose the face of true fear (the detective investigating the case remarks, ""I've been on the force thirty odd years...and I have never seen fear on anyone's face as on this girl's..."") leads to a strange and unexpected revelation at the end.
Tonally, it's bugged out. The Eastman Color film brings forth an exaggerated palette, with colours taking on an almost hyper-real saturation and suffusing the screen with a golden glow that's warm and comforting, at odds with the cold fish performance of its lead. The West London setting seems more post-war than swinging 60s, not so much edgy red light as saucy postcard porn and quaint innuendo. Undoubtedly the weirdest thing though, is Mark's accent. Not surprising in one way, as Karlheinz Böhm was cast in the role, but on a character level it's perplexing - we hear him speaking in a clipped English accent as a child on film, so are we expected to believe that sometime in adolescence, Mark acquired a German accent? Maybe, since no-one in the film mentions it, we're just supposed to pretend it doesn't exist.
Softly spoken Mark is a creepy, oily character, superficially amiable, studious and reclusive but truly in his element behind the camera, like in the scene that has him directing Vivian (a vivacious Moira Shearer), where he takes on a different persona altogether - confident and forthright. There's something very off about him, but no-one seems to notice, least of all Helen, who falls for his questionable charms (what a bizarre character Helen is; she's supposed to be 21 but has the air and manner of talking of someone more than twice her age). It takes a blind person, Helen's mother, to really see him for what he is. Maxine Audley excels in the role and steals every scene she's in, especially the darkroom showdown, where power shifts between them. Her natural matriarchal influence on Mark subdues him, but her physical limitations give him the upper hand again before he allows her to take back control. She gets most of the best lines too; ""I'm at home here... I visit this room every night..."", ""Visit?"", ""The blind always live in the rooms they live under..."". Uncannily perceptive in discerning Mark's true motives, she tells him, ""Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it Mark? A pity it can't be photographed.""
With so much of the plot focused on the act of capturing and viewing discomfort, the film invites a reading of it as a reflection of the intrinsic voyeurism of cinema, implicating both producer and consumer in the dehumanizing power of the gaze, but I'm not sure it's really aiming for anything so reflexive. At the same time, it's not simply a proto-slasher with cheap thrills on its mind; it's an oddity that falls somewhere between the cracks and enters the twilight zone of Hitchcockian thriller territory.",3.5
"Displaying the notion that nothing can damage you quite like a parent, Michael Powell’s expertly directed psychological horror-thriller elicits sympathy for a character that should reasonably be considered a monster. Karlheinz Böhm’s portrayal of the abused Mark is excellent and sincerely affecting. This now cult movie, which obtained an exceptionally harsh reception by critics when it was first released and had an unfavourable consequence on Powell's career as a director, is much more than an application in voyeurism; it’s an incredibly creative picture of psychological conflict.",4.5
The movie is a bit slow but it is still a good movie! It came out the same year as Psycho and is often compared to it. Some say it is better but I wouldn’t go that far. A very interesting movie. Rare to see a serial killer movie before the term was even coined.,3.0
"Peeping Tom is a brilliant horror film that explores the desensitized nature of voyeurism and contemporaneous relationship of film and death.
Film, like all art, is a lie to capture truth, as Picasso once said. So the next logical artistic step of capturing the truest thing we'll ever experience - death - both through the camera and with a mirror for the victims to watch their own demise, is a premise that is so seductively appealing that any dubiousness to those motives are immediately understood by our own curious nature to death.
Some call Peeping Tom the first true slasher movie. It's hugely influential to Martin Scorsese and specifically Taxi Driver.
Michael Powell was a very established director at the time. By making something so daringly ahead of his time, he was shunned and ignored after the film's premiere, the media went after him and his career was ruined in the UK forever.
But now, looking back, all of the critics and everyone who canceled Powell for making this movie, I feel we can confidently and resoundingly say fuck them. This movie is a masterpiece",4.5
"I find it very interesting that this film, released April 7th, 1960 in the UK-basically ended Michael Powell’s career. Meanwhile-months later on September 8th, 1960 another shocking film was released in the U.S. and it was Hitchcock’s most successful. The similarities between the main characters is striking. Both Norman and Mark are murderers that are compelled beyond their own control. Both were deeply damaged by a parent which has resulted in their homicidal tendencies. They come to different fates but both are voyeurs and we the audience are made to watch their most heinous acts. Fascinating that both films are now seen as classics.
New Criterion 4K looks very good.",3.5
"Exploring cinemas very obsession with Voyeurism and crafting a brilliant study of a traumatized and disturbed young man, Micheal Powell's Peeping Tom took years to earn the respect it deserves. Carl Boehm's performance as Mark Lewis is one that I consider to be one of the best I've ever seen and I don't feel like writing too much about this film but it's just something that needs to be experienced. It's brilliantly crafted on all counts being especially one of the most well directed films I've seen. It's influenced so many films and tackles it's themes very uniquely, engaging from start to finish and exceptionally clever.",5.0
"The British Peeping Tom was completed months before Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” but its’ perversity was an outrage and readily pulled from theaters in the United Kingdom after five days. This was a career killer for Michael Powell (“Black Narcissus,” “The Red Shoes”), while Hitchcock’s film was a phenomenon.
There’s quite a tense and deep-thinking face on lead actor Karl Boehm — he looks like a pouty miser Hitchcock ringer, just lankier. All of the jobs for his character Mark Lewis have to do with the camera. He is a focus puller for a British movie studio. On the side he takes cheesecake photos of scantily clad women in a boudoir set-up, while the photos are sold downstairs under the counter at a newsstand. This unassuming Mark character is the type of prim and studious kind that people give a glance and thinks he’s odd, but perhaps some sort of a genius. He is often left alone.
But it’s revealed in the first scene he’s a budding murderer, and we see everything through his foursquare viewfinder. He has picked up a prostitute and in the bedroom when she’s caught off-guard, he stabs her with a spike jerry-rigged on his tripod with the camera pointed at her. He obsesses with watching faces of women’s fear during playback from every new snuff film of his. He goes around as a documentarian on everything, couples kissing in the park, closeups on persons with deformities, and including now the police detectives on the trail of a moonlight killer.
Mark is not going to be deterred in putting a film of fear together. He’s also the kind, we suspect, is daring to be caught and see how far he can get before he can go with his anarchy. He has convinced one of the actresses (Moira Shearer, from “The Red Shoes”) to stick around after dark at the major studio he works for a dance short film. For a minute Mark is emulating a good director, but then he turns into a creep. Her fright before she is stabbed is perfect for him. But is he out of film roll?
The fact that the police are putting together new details in the investigation does not slow him. He has a film to complete, with an ending that will assign himself a role in front of the camera.
The only pullback Mark has is a new friend that treats him like an interesting human being. They get comfortable enough with each other that this girl wants to know about Mark’s childhood (he was experimented on by his own father, with documentary reels to prove it). It’s an interesting development, but when this downstairs neighbor Helen (Anna Massey) learns what Mark is capable of her reaction is too much pity and not enough revulsion.
Still, Powell is searching for the torrents of psychological horror and voyeuristic obsession, and his film is not mindless exploitation. Powell, like all his earlier tasteful classics, goes for rich Technicolor with an emphasis on reds, pinks and blues, and goes for harsh light in customary encounters, but in scenes when Mark switches the lights off you see diffuse light on faces and grain around the edges of the image.
There was actually a brief time years ago I preferred “Peeping Tom” over “Psycho,” but Hitchcock’s delirious way of playing his audience like a piano wins out long-term. Seeing them both in the same year is my suggestion. They were both watershed/bloodshed films.",4.0
"Damn, Alfred Hitchcock must have kicked himself for not doing this.
In all seriousness, Peeping Tom feels ahead of its time in that many modern films don't touch on voyeurism as well as this does. I can imagine it must have been a shock when it came out in the early '60s.
More so than the acts of the protagonist, what makes this film a terrific horror is the creation of dread and tension; to the point in which it feels like the build-up is what gets your pulse pounding, rather than the things that happen.
I enjoyed how the story ties into a psychological aspect. It's also exquisitely filmed.

still a total shock to the system and as much a proto-slasher as it is a proto-Joker (or even a proto-Fade to Black) and a prescient diatribe against film bro culture all the while pitting the notion of fear against loneliness and the anxiety that comes with impermanence; film might be forever but we certainly aren't",5.0
"The Road To Halloween - Eliminating The Horror 'Classics'
Michael Powell was crazy to even attempt this film.
Not because of the stupid controversy that it stirred up at the time of his release, leading to his career being irreversibly damaged as a result. He probably didn't bank on such an extreme reaction. No, he was crazy because of the complexity of a film that should have been beyond even someone as extraordinarily talented as he.
Peeping Tom is almost like a film within a film within a film. I felt like I was watching at times, within our outer walls of this film, the theatrical framing of the filming that Karlheinz Böhm was undertaking. How on earth does one even conceive of such an idea let alone even make it work as masterfully as it does here? It's not the first time I've been left unable to understand what seems to be the impossible by Powell, although the last time I thought that was when he and Emeric Pressburger were going through their A Matter Of Life And Death / Black Narcissus / The Red Shoes run.
I think he perhaps manages it to a certain extent because he is recalling The Red Shoes in some ways. Not just in the casting of Moira Shearer, but in the way that everything is cloaked in that extra layer of theatricalism that helped make The Red Shoes so mesmeric. Once again, Powell is not afraid for the audience to know that this is a piece of drama and he isn't afraid to chip away any pretensions of realism the film might have had. It all helps him to create those extra theatrical layers to make his point about film and voyeurism.
Listen to the music as well. It's like a dirge. It sounds like a watered down incidental insert from a silent movie and it's notably melodramatic in how it's conducted. It felt almost as if he wanted to separate it away from the more obviously pacy and excitable music that Böhm uses on his movies. Powell wants us to know that this is a spectacle but he also wants us to understand and even take up the uncomfortable position of sympathising with Böhm.
Much like the way Anna Massey does. I don't believe she assumes that position simply because of the abuse that she sees Böhm suffer at the hands of his father, or because she's in love with him. She does it because she's equally as curious as he is - just in a much less murderous way! She comments to him outside her party that she had seen Böhm many times without ever getting the chance to talk to him. She breaks away from her party just so she can watch some home movies with him, despite having only just really met him properly.
She's a voyeur too. It's why she understands. Look at the way she can't look away from the screen when she discovers one of his grislier movies. For me, she is the most fascinating character in this film. It's through Massey that we ourselves understand what Powell wants us to be and what he believes many of us are. It's a really fascinating, challenging and delightfully uncomfortable set of circumstances that he creates here.
To be honest, the only reason I'm not giving this the full 5 stars is because maybe the theatricality of it all was slightly too much at times, especially when it comes to the fainting actress and the various surrounding that. In all other ways, Peeping Tom is cinema of the very highest calibre and a piece of film directing that is beyond the understanding of a peon like me.",4.5

Mark Lewis is the introverted type who stays to himself. A photographer by trade who has a sinister secret project. His dream is to be a director and carry on the work of his deceased father. He is making a documentary about fear and the reaction from women as he kills them.
Peeping Tom. WOW! Karlheinz Böhm does a tremendous job portraying the role of our damaged creepy auteur Mark Lewis. A flawed but complicated character that nails both sides of the spectrum from villain to a young man entrenched in puppy-dog love. He's a creeping Peeping Tom but he is our weirdo in a world that he sees as his stage. In a film like this you'd expect a performance like that to take the cake, and it does, but there's a rival performance that is every bit as great. Maxine Audley as the blind alcoholic mother of Helen. There are a few lines that jumped out to me and she spoke them all. Lines like ""The back of my neck told me."" when asked how she knew that our Peeping Tom was outside the window. Her scenes with Mark toward the end were amazing. That's the kind of gal I want to have a Scotch in the rocks with.
I love that classic use of light. Hues that permeate the backgrounds to an almost comic effect. The same methods would later be used by legends like Dario Argento and George Romero to perfection. I love they way this film looks overall. Colors pop in that old technicolor look, almost like a theater set with some backgrounds looking incredibly fake but in excellent fashion. I know how that must sound, but it's tough to explain. I love it. It took a while for this film to hold my interest but by the second act I was hooked. A killer that uses a camera and a mirror to both film and make the victim watch their terror. That's some twisted stuff.
Peeping Tom is plagued with ""over-acting"" but that was par for the course at the time. A time when film was treated like theater. I am all about it.

She’s cute as a button in Michael Powell’s nervously pervy Peeping Tom, and its paranoid kitsch poster is second from the left based on its Letterboxd popularity.

Full disclosure: I’ve never even seen The Machinist, mostly because I don’t feel like running into Bale’s rib cage in a dark alley.

Well, hi there.
After ruling over Austria for a few years as the Emperor, Karlheinz is ready for a career change and moves to Great Britain in hopes to become a director.
Only issue is that his father basically - for the lack of a better word - groomed him into becoming a Peeping Tom.
What an iconic film. One of the first Slasher movies, beating Psycho by a few months. It was horribly received initially and pulled from British cinemas after 5 days only.
It is a stunning film, gorgeously shot with some really nice set designs and the use of color is quite interesting. On top of that we also get a strong performance by Karlheinz Böhm who is *horrible* at pretending that he's not a killer and aroused by fear. What a great classic.

Peeping Tom (1960)
A few months before Alfred Hitchcock unleashed Psycho on the world, a thematically similar thriller was made across the pond with Peeping Tom. A film considered so odious by critics that it practically destroyed the career of its director Michael Powell.
Mark Lewis works as an assistant at a London-based film studio, but off the set he's into ""seedier"" activities, which involves what he is doing for his latest film project. You see, he's making a documentary on fear, and in order to achieve that, he films the terrified reactions of female ""test subjects"" before killing them. Meanwhile, he befriends his friendly downstairs neighbour Helen, who takes an interest in Mark's passion for film but is otherwise unaware of his latest project.
This is a movie that dives deep into the voyeuristic psyche of its main character Mark, effectively played by the Austrian-born Karl Böhm. He is portrayed as a shy, almost sympathetic loner who is heavily implied to have experienced abuse at the hands of his father (who himself used his own son as a guinea pig). I found the relationship he has with Helen to be quite interestingly developed, who is portrayed as too naive to see what Mark is really up to, as opposed to her mother who despite her blindness, is ironically one of the few to suspect something wrong.
Powell's directional style is effective, from his use of colourful lighting to the innovative use of shots from the killer's point-of-view (or camera, so to speak), that would become a staple of later slasher movies. While there isn't really much in the way of graphic violence, the implications of what happens to Mark's victims are perfectly obvious. There's a very-meta like approach he takes to the material. Having the sharp end of camera tripod as a murder weapon was an inspired choice, and I appreciated the use of filmmaking (set shoots, Mark's projection room e.g) to progress the narrative.
Quite a complex film to me to digest, but a very interesting one nonetheless. I can't say it truly clicked with me, but I can definitely say it deserves the accolades it has, especially considering how much it was overshadowed by controversy on its release (even though it's very tame by today's standards).

"Powell proves once again that he was one of the greatest and most ambitious directors, being able to perfect the art of lightening and use of colors. In the case of Peeping Tom the color he focalizes on is red, the supreme color, already used in The Red Shoes, but took on another level here. If in The Red Shoes he and Pressburger were able to explore colors in a more fantastical, dreamlike way, given the story that allowed that kind of approach, in Peeping Tom, Powell has to keep things more realistic, exploring passions and violence with the use of a dark, sanguineous, red that explodes in the movie, that reveals the truth and matches the troubled, corrupted soul of the main character.
Powell had quite an interesting career, often working alongside with director Pressuburger, his fimography explores macabre and disturbing themes such as ill attachment to art, dichotomy between art and artist or artist and the human beyond the artist, forbidden erotic attractions and desire to create and achieve perfection, even when it means going beyond the line of humanity. Few movies are able to explores the depths and corruptions of the human being such as Powell’s movies, which in the end proved to be both what made him great and what made him disappear.",4.0
"""Peeping Tom"" is a 1960 psychological thriller directed by Michael Powell. Infamously part of the Powell and (Emeric) Pressburger duo of directors, known as ""The Archers"". Within the mid 1950's the duo somewhat split creatively but still remained friends, which leads to the reasoning that ""Peeping Tom"" was a creative solo effort on the part of Powell. Now ""Peeping Tom"" is not without its turbulent landing upon popular culture. Grossly misunderstood by the ""then"" audiences of the time (especially those within the critical press), ""Peeping Tom"" would be commonly denounced for its graphic shock, terror, and lewdness about it. Within the wide sprawl of things, this wildfire would eventually serve to be the downfall for Powell in terms of continuing work. Powell still went on to direct and produce some films, but the damage was done to the point where he would never be able to return to the level of success he had once before.
Just like an assortment of other critically and societal panned films, there is a reassessment with newer viewership that garners fandom of cult status. ""Peeping Tom"" easily enjoy this capacity, especially with the acceptance of its spiritual companion of the same year, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960). ""Peeping Tom"" had an April theatrical release in comparison to ""Psycho"" which debuted within July of the same year. From his point of advantage, Hitchcock was able to see the critical frenzy that went after ""Peeping Tom"" and adjust accordingly. Hitchcock's plan of action was to simply not give a press screening beforehand. Ironically (but as Hitchcock somewhat planned for), ""Psycho"" became a massive success even though the two films are vastly comparable. In retrospect, much of the generation that that saw the two films in tandem with each other within the marination of time saw that there was no reasoning for one film to be demonized as such while the other one flourished. Naturally, in today's light ""Peeping Tom"" is revered as being quite brilliant for helping incept the ""Slasher"" horror genre with its spiritual sibling ""Psycho"".
""Peeping Tom"" is easily a well-crafted feature, upholding excellent merit in its own technical sense. We can deem this with a societal eyeroll towards the frenzy of the past, but pragmatically I couldn't do it for myself until I actually sat down and watched the film myself. Ironically, even with myself absolutely loving much of the Powell and Pressburger film, I somehow never crossed paths with ""Peeping Tom"" till now. The immaculate coloring of things easily carried over from the other films, ironically the first thing that my eye looks for in the crafting of an ""Archers"" feature. Past the technical margins, I was absolutely drawn in by how advanced the story was, especially with the central character of Mark Lewis and his dynamic creation. This is absolutely a cornerstone block within the genre in which many of films were formulated from, especially with the tortured soul self-aware of conflictions and wanting to self-destruct as an exit point. There is the strange pseudo-scientific balance of feeling a bit of the plight for the character but as he also is harnessing absolute acts of evil, it's also a challenging position of knowing that he should atone for measures of accountability. This entry point of connecting of his character places the viewer themselves in the shoes of the voyeur as well, completely warping our mentalities as by watching the film we are somewhat of a conduit of him as well. The other character that I was vastly intrigued by was Mrs. Stevens, the mother of Mark's romantic interest Helen. Helen was interesting as well as a sweet and understanding element to Mark, but Mrs. Stevens challenging Mark within his surroundings was some of the best moments within the film.
At the end of the day, I will own my dynamic of having my viewership somehow living under a rock surrounding this film. It was probably a viewing that should have happened a great deal earlier but nonetheless I'm glad I finally got to it. I easily agree with the common point of discussion that this film is of equal measure with ""Psycho"" as being incredibly influential to not only horror, but that of film in general. This will easily go in my mental assortment of films that grossly need repetitive viewing, as I know more and more concepts will unearth each time.",5.0

The first(?) slasher film, Peeping Tom is a fascinating depiction of fear, perversity, and voyeurism. The story concerns a serial killer obsessed with filming almost everything he sees and those that he kills. His camera violates the space of his female victims and in many ways Peeping Tom makes voyeurs of its audience. It perversely makes us want to see more whilst condemning that we do. 
Plenty of times in Peeping Tom the shots linger on people seeing things but rarely does the film shown us what is being seen. This harsh censorship obscures the gruesome details but it works to the film's benefit - the audience is denied the masochistic pleasures of voyeurism as sadistic actions play out in the narrative. It seems like an almost subconscious statement on horror filmmaking. There's also a lot of sexual repression in Peeping Tom, with a subplot involving erotic photography further blurring the lines between the lead character's obsessive behaviour and sexual aggression. 
Peeping Tom essentially ended the career of Michael Powell, one of Britain's greatest filmmakers, but it still displays his calm and collected filmmaking, matched with his usually striking colour compositions. 1960 was a watershed year for horror and Peeping Tom was released just a few months before Hitchcock's Psycho. Whilst Peeping Tom is a bit weaker than Psycho (it lacks Psycho's beautiful elegance), it works as a much more cerebral think-piece. Peeping Tom is a morbid gem, with some intellectual ideas and a fascinating foresight into horror cinema. Worth checking out.

"A violent penetration of voyeurism
Some of its style may have aged but it’s perspective and themes are deeply complex. It’s relationship between man and machine that realises sexual urge makes it an ancestor to David Cronenberg’s Crash.
The serial killing of prostitutes is nothing new but to show it in 1960 and in the manner of phallic harpooning via the artifice of a covetous lens was too much for audiences at the time of its release. Psycho came out the same year with many reviewer seeing it as an unsubtle transgression by Hitchcock. 5 years earlier the eloquent Night Of The Hunter was too distasteful for the time ending Laughton’s directorial career as soon as it started. The reviews for Powell’s Peeping Tom eventually led to the same conclusion. It was punk music at a Sunday Service. 
Boehme and Audley, as the killer and his girls blind mother, stand out and contrast brilliantly. It may get a little topsy in the end but it’s assured direction and unique colourist style influenced from Vertigo set it apart like a strange Argento Giallo made way ahead of it’s time.",4.5
"An intriguing character study that was ahead of its time, both in its voyeuristic use of the killer point of view, as well as its articulate and confrontational examination of the male gaze.
Peeping Tom tells the story of Mark, a photographer who loves to record the deaths of women to study their fear responses. The causes of his behaviors are slowly revealed throughout the film as he establishes a meaningful relationship with a tenant in his apartment building. 
It flawlessly puts the audience in the drivers seat, as we find ourselves empathizing with a perverse murderer who is impeccably embodied by Karlheinz Böhm. As viewers, we enjoy this intrusive look into his experiences as much as he enjoys peeping into the personal lives and emotions of others. By doing this, it playfully blurs the line between reality and film. 
Peeping Tom is more heartbreaking than horrifying, but it definitely earned it’s place as a horror classic.",4.0

"What to say about a film almost universally loved by an audience spanning over half a decade that was smacked down hard by the critics of the time? This film is amazing, and perhaps the most Hitchcock of all non-Hitchcock films... from Michael Powell, a director best known for wartime romance epics no less.
So with that in mind, let's talk about something completely different: Peeping Tom. Who exactly was Tom, and who was he peeping at to become so universally ridiculed anyway? Is Tom a name or a euphemism? Was he a male cat? All this and more in this episode of ""Two hands in my pockets"".
OK, so there are tales and legends, sometimes muddled together over the years and disputed by historians, but let's go with the most romantic version...
T(h)om(as) was a country tailor who secretly 'peeped' at Lady Godiva as she rode naked through Coventry. Why the heck was an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman doing such a shockingly lewd thing way back in the 11th century you may well ask. Or not.
So, her ladyship's husband, Leofric Earl of Mercia was imposing mega taxes on the poor people of the area, and she was none too pleased about it. You see, she was a leader who loved her people. Like Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains. Ah bugger, I got lost for a minute there. Well, maybe not that. Anyway... after one too many naggings, Leofric told her he'd reduce the burden on the people only if Godiva got her kit off and went riding Cedric the pony through the town.
As a totally modern girl, she didn't hesitate to whip 'em off and set away on her nudey-ride with only her long hair covering her b(l)ushes. The folks of the town had been told to stay indoors to reduce instances of heart-attack and fainting, but one guy, our Tom, yeah that guy... Voyeur No. 1, decided to hide in the undergrowth and cop an eyeful... and the rest as they say, is history.
In some versions of this tale, the 'Peeping Tom' was struck blind or dead for being a dirty old perv. I choose to believe that is far too right wing an outcome for such a beautifully socialist story.
Anyway, Godiva's a top Sheila I reckon.
Tom, well the jury is clearly still out on him.

Note: some of this is just my imagination running wild and bears no resemblance to actual historical fact. You decide which bits.

Helen: Mother, What’s worrying you?
Mother: The price of whiskey
Helen: What else?
Mother: What else matters?
Gorgeously produced film, saturated in color and loaded with interesting and beautiful shot compositions. It’s fitting that such care was taken with the focus and framing of the camera since since this film is about voyeurism. I really loved just about everything about the way this film is out together. It’s a really excellent psychological drama. It is lacking in blood and actual slashing that I like in my slashers. I think it’s more like an ancestor to the slasher film as it pre-dates Psycho by a few months and depicts a serial killer more than a decade before the term serial killer is even coined. The final reveal is gloriously twisted and makes up for some of the slower acts that lead up to it. Helen’s blind and alcoholic mother is definitely the MVP.

"“i do feel alone in front of it. i suppose stars never do?”
“they feel alone without it. and the great ones feel alone all the time.”
during so many points in this movie i had to pause just so i could whisper “holy shit” quietly to myself. the scene when mark first takes helen’s mother’s hand is incredible—the juxtaposition of a voyeur and a blind woman coming face-to-face, the way they butt heads, but also how they both want what the other has: she wishes she could see, and he wishes he couldn’t. her blindness is a burden, but, in a way, so is his sight. 
another great moment is when helen and mark share a kiss, and how directly afterwards mark pulls his camera towards himself and kisses it with even more tenderness than he gives helen. he’s insistent that she never be photographed by him because he’d much rather have her be the camera, to see the world through her eyes instead of his own.

The British Psycho is how Peeping Tom is often described, and it isn't an inaccurate way to do so (even if it actually very slightly predates its more famous counterpart). For its similarities though, it's also quite different. First, most obviously, would be the lush, primary color palette. It's gorgeous and makes every scene pop, and draws a great contrast to the black and white film sequences contained throughout. Secondly, a bit more subtly, is the focus on, and characterization of, the killer.
While the tragedy of parental overbearance and abuse is a present element in Psycho, that story doesn't place the killer in the role of the true lead. Our interaction with him and understanding of his point of view is more obscured and controlled, while we follow the narrative of the victim (particularly due to the twist being an important aspect of the story). In Peeping Tom, after the POV opening sequence (an early take on the idea, though not the first), we're then thrust directly into the world of Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm). We're fed information about his life, his job, his proclivities, his fears, his childhood. The monster his humanized, and thus becomes someone we can empathize with. He is aware of his insanity, its triggers, and even actively wishes to be cured or even caught. Böhm gives an outstanding performance, boyishly charming in quieter moments, giving way to intense stoicism and manipulation in the moments he has control, and sheer panic and grief at the times when he doesn't.
Everything is praiseworthy about Peeping Tom, be it the performances, the cinematography, the sets, the score. But while it's far from an unknown picture, it is criminally underappreciated (having about 1/20th of the ratings on IMDB for example). While Psycho was a box office success and multiple awarding winning feature, Peeping Tom spent barely 5 days in theaters before public outcry saw it removed and banned, stunting its appreciation and substantially damaging Michael Powell's directing career. It's interesting to imagine what could have been.

One of the all-time classic slashers and holy shit, it lives up!!
For starters, I gotta talk about the weapon of choice and all I’m saying is, unique af. This movie isn’t graphic at all but still makes those moments effective and that’s mainly due to Karl Böhms performance/character. As we dive into the mind behind the crime, it held my engagement throughout and the writing was definitely a key factor. Same could be said for the style/overall look too…",4.5
"What would frighten me to death?
Voyeurism! A cool film. An electric atmosphere with amazing colors and a bombastic soundtrack. Both Mark and his victims throughout the feature are often entertaining to witness for varying reasons. This is a movie about the eyes, whether or not that's the human eye or the eye of the movie camera. Karlheinz Böhm, on top of being pretty attractive to me at least, has a piercing gaze whenever he deeply looks at someone. A serial killer murdering women through his camera, literally weaponizing the male gaze, is about the most on-the-nose thing you could do in a movie about a serial killer, but to me, it absolutely works. I think the film makes that work through hitting this exact tone between mostly realistic interactions and dialogue, while also being notably heightened and ""cinematic"" when it gets to its more dramatic elements. I wasn't as into it as I was maybe thinking I would be, but it has numerous moments and images that are likely to stick in my head for some notable measure of time. I am perhaps drawn to serial killers, them being a substantial reason for my interest in psychology, because one has to wonder from case to case, whether in fiction or in reality, why someone would do such despicable things to others. So many ways to go about it, and like Robert Graysmith showed in Zodiac, this is a fascination that will stay within the human mind now and forever. (You can also sadly chalk this up as another feature that portrays psychology as some dark art. Sigh.)

"Known for destroying Michael Powell's career, Peeping Tom is nowhere near atrocious, but it's easy to find grounds for the negative reviews. Despite decent visuals, the limitations of the script ultimately screw things over.
As a character study on a serial killer, there are some uncanny similarities between this and Psycho, which was released earlier in the same year, and this might have partly explained why one was revered while the other trashed to death.
What's also crucial is the lack of a consistently effective story. Since the first half is way more captivating than the second, the result is a highly uneven experience that lags when it matters the most.",3.0
"This really is a fantastic horror film. This always gets grouped with Psycho as the original precursors to the slasher film but I think you can see it much more here than in Hitchcock's film (I actually don't see Psycho as much of a horror, more of a thriller), with the POV tracking shots and the killings of young women. This film is also incredibly well shot and beautifully lit, I wonder if this had any influence on Mario Bava's work at all... especially makes me think of Blood and Black Lace.",4.5
I can definitely see what Peeping Tom did for the horror/slasher/voyeurism genre in its time but ultimately this was quite slow and kind of boring.

"Released two months before Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Peeping Tom delves deep into the mind of a killer in a way that deeply disturbed viewers and critics, who called the movie sick and disgusting.

Psychological and tense, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is a landmark of its time. Hailed as one of the major influences of the slasher, along with Psycho which came out months later, and unfortunately only properly appreciated many years after its release when its hugely negative reception had effectively ruined Powell's career. Scopophilia and Freud are pivotal throughout, with the camera acting as both weapon and phallus. Moreover, the film turns its camera towards the audience, reflecting the voyeurism of Mark – performed by a forcefully magnetic Carl Böhm – unto us as viewers. We, innately, are the biggest peeping toms of all.",4.0

"A photographer that films his murder victims just to relive their fear is quite unsettling. Karlheinz Böhm’s unnerving stare only intensifies the tension throughout this. There’s a fantastic sequence where he’s preparing to make a kill, and vibrant Moira Shearer (from The Red Shoes) is dancing around him, completely oblivious. It’s a great sequence, as the tone flits from fun & upbeat to terribly tense depending on who the camera is looking at. This is so wildly different from anything else I’ve seen from Michael Powell, but it’s a fascinating film with a very nasty feel to it.

… It's not that Mark is asexual in the sense of having a stable sexual identity, if anything he's anti-sexual, he's too deeply repressed to have any sort of successful relationship, which seems to be part of what makes the nude models he photographs so comfortable around him in spite of their apparent vulnerability. This non-sexual nature is unharmful in itself, but it belies a repressed violence that emerges in his murders. It's not just that his violent methodology recalls his father, it also manifests a kind of phallus for him, sexualizing the extension of his gaze: he kills people with his camera, but he does so by extending forward a tripod leg with a blade on the end. If his father made him feel like he could never become a man, then this is how he becomes a surrogate pseudo-man: with a deadly prosthetic. …

Controversy and background aside, this movie is really frickin’ good. The direction is so clean and swift. It’s pacing is so reserved and well done because it’s more of a character study.
The character of Mark is complex. He commits terrible crimes but we actually sympathise with him. That is truly an achievement and a lot of it is owed to Karlheinz Böhm. What a performance. He perfectly captures anxiety, nervousness and trauma and he makes it look easy.

The moment the blade goes in isn't horrible just because it's a murder.

"An interesting journey into the mind of a serial killer that also touches on themes of voyeurism, loneliness, childhood trauma, sexual repression & the art of filmmaking, Peeping Tom was torn to shreds by critics when it premiered but just like any other film that was ahead of its time, it garnered a cult following over the years and is now regarded as a genre classic.
Set in London, the story of Peeping Tom follows a lonely young man who is obsessed with the effects of fear and is making a documentary on it, the content of which involves him recording the final expressions of victims as he murders them. Things are set in motion when the woman living below his apartment befriends him and inadvertently comes across his works one day.
Directed by Michael Powell, the film packs a number of shooting tips & tricks up its sleeve and opens with a scene that introduces the protagonist doing what he does best, all captured from his camera’s viewpoint. Powell paints a tragic portrait of the killer here, keeping his human aspects in tact throughout and shows him to be a psychotic product of child abuse.
Also notable is the self-reflexive use of camera as this cinematic device narrates a story of its own through its POV shots, smooth manoeuvring, sharp images, bright lighting & vivid use of colour palette. Humour is cleverly incorporated in spite of the dark tone. Editing keeps the tension palpable, even leaving few murder moments to viewers’ imagination, but the pacing is a bit on the slow side.
Coming to the performances, Carl Boehm plays the serial killer and does a fantastic job at capturing his human side and articulating it to the audience in a relatable manner. It’s a thoughtful, balanced & impressive act by all means. Anna Massey is in as the girl next door but her work is mediocre at best while her mother, played by Maxine Audley, manages to leave a strong impression despite her limited screen time.
On an overall scale, Peeping Tom is a fascinating example of psychological horror that’s skilfully directed by Michael Powell and is brilliantly steered by Carl Boehm’s terrific rendition of his simultaneously creepy & pitiful character but there are slow patches in the middle that make the ride tedious plus the interaction between our protagonist & his girl friend isn’t that engaging either. Nevertheless, despite being controversial at its time of release, Peeping Tom has rightfully earned its place today amongst the most influential works of its genre.",3.0

Capítulo #30: El asesino del celuloide 🎞️
----
Viviendo bajo la sombra de Hitchcock y de su más revolucionaria joya: Psicosis (1960) Peeping Toom fue empujada inmerecidamente a la oscuridad y al olvido, tan solo por haber sido lanzada en el mismo año.
Pero la propuesta de Michael Powell tiene mucho que decirnos sobre el cine y el ser humano, de como el primero sirve como vehículo de escape para materializar las fantasías y deseos reprimidos del segundo, mostrando al cine como la manifestación artística más eficiente y realista a la hora de presentar las emociones humanas.
A su vez Powell nos recuerda que el terror puede venir de muchas formas y la tristeza es uno de ellos. El género nos acostumbro a abordar dicho concepto desde la tensión, el temor y demás sentimientos que son esporádicos y efímeros. Se van con el momento.
En cambio el terror que nos propone el fotógrafo detrás de la cámara es uno más persistente y duradero. Es la miseria de condición humana. Yo realmente venía con la intención de asustarme y me he ido con sentimientos de tristeza y casi que una lágrima.
La forma en que el autor aborda al asesino desde un foco empático es bastante singular, en lugar de ser expuesto como el típico villano la audiencia lo percibe como una víctima de los terribles hechos que ha pasado en su vida.
Cabe mencionar que las secuencias voyeurguistas son espectaculares, de igual forma que las líneas de diálogo, los códigos cromáticos y la edición de sonido y montaje.
Estoy seguro que es la clase de obra que solo gana más y más con cada visionado.
Nota: B+",4.0
"“Peeping Tom” is an early serial killer/slasher movie that is told from the perspective of the killer, the disturbed “aspiring filmmaker” Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm). The focus of the film lies on exploring the psychology of Lewis and how a mix of childhood trauma, sexual repression, paraphilia, and obsession with fear and photography made him the compulsive murderer he is.
I´m actually impressed that a film from 1960 features a portrayal of a psychopath, which is so nuanced, complex, and empathetic. Without excusing or downplaying his crimes, of course. Böhm´s lead performance is captivating, layered, and emotive and depending on the situation, his character is either creepy, scary, or pitiful. His psychological depth, charisma, backstory, and iconic murder weapon make Mark Lewis one of the most fascinating villains of the horror genre.
Similar to Hitchcock´s “Rear Window”, “Peeping Tom” demonstrates the relationship between cinema and voyeurism, but in a much more disturbing way. Lewis sees his whole world through a camera and basically acts like a film director. We can´t mindlessly enjoy this film like a normal slasher movie, because it makes us reflect on our own role in Lewis´ crimes, witnessing them with the excitement of a voyeur. The movie makes us accomplices and exposes us. We are appalled by Lewis´ fascination with fear and death, but the simple fact that we are watching a horror movie shows that we share this fascination at least on some level. “Peeping Tom” also shares similarities with another Hitchcock film, “Psycho”, which was released in the same year. Both movies feature mild-mannered serial killers with either daddy or mommy issues. 1960 was a good year for psychological horror.
As expected of Michael Powell, “Peeping Tom” is not only a creepy but also an aesthetically pleasing experience. Colors, lighting, production design, and shot composition are all stylish and beautiful to look at.
The smart script, interesting themes, masterful craftmanship, outstanding lead performance, and several unforgettable scenes (including the fantastic ending) make “Peeping Tom” a milestone of its genre. It´s a shame that it was so misunderstood at its time, but fortunately, nowadays, it receives the admiration it deserves.",4.0

"Scandalous British sleaze fest which could be easily mistaken for a lost, mislabelled Hitchcock classic, the original giallo or the true birth of the slasher film. In reality, it's just the Technicolored tale of an awkward pervert, and that's enough for me. Michael Powell bombed his whole career to give us one of the greatest horror films of all time, what a hero.",5.0
"It only takes a matter of minutes for the clammy atmosphere of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom to clasp its sweaty palm upon you. Watching it through the view finder of a portable camera we are unwilling accomplices to the films first few moments, forced to become voyeurs, fascinated and unnerved by what we witness.
That is a feeling that stays with you throughout as this daring character study toys with your moral judgement. There is no time wasted attempting to create a mystery as to who the killer from the opening scene may be, more a question over his psychological make-up and the root of his motivation. By removing the question of whodunit there is nothing to distract us from an uncomfortable attachment to the mild mannered cameraman.
There are no black and white terms of liking Mark, this nervous young man who on the surface is completely unassuming. The more we learn of his tormented childhood as his relationship with Helen develops we find ourselves searching for reasons to forgive the beast that he cannot manage to contain within himself. We end up attempting to rationalise the emotions of a monster who preys on women's weaknesses.
Mark continues his fathers study on fear that we first see on the reel he plays to Helen when he invites her into his studio. The film itself is a wider look at the power of fear, the freezing control forced onto the women returning their own gaze that only leads to one thing. Mark is a seriously disturbed man, surrounded by his library of terror, watching and taking pleasure from it. Powell continues to push forward his softer side, encouraging us to like him. And it is hard to resist.
As you would expect from Powell the colour palette is wonderfully rich, bathing his world in swathes of red and blue technicolor moments that enhance the tension around already fraught situations. His voyeuristic use of the camera offers us no hiding place from the perverse nature of Marks character, always inviting enough to ask to see more.
You can understand why this film was so damaging to Powell's reputation, a bold portrayal that has only received acclaim as moral attitudes and understanding has changed. He didn't go on to direct anything of note after the savaging this film took which is cinemas loss. Thankfully we have this and the classic Pressburger collaborations to look back on and remember him by.",0.0
"doors are windows and windows are eyes and eyes are mirrors and mirrors are projectors and projectors are doors.... that act as means of splitting perspectives and influencing perception, ""photographing you photographing me"", contradicting emotions and hidden personalities revealed exclusively to the viewer, pure voyeurism, a perfect movie to get lost inside.",5.0
"There is something so exciting about the filmmaking behind Peeping Tom. This was super controversial for its time, but even though the content is quite tame by today's standards, it still feels extremely fresh. Just the way the camera moves and the perfect pacing of this film makes this such an immersive watch.
It's genuinely unsettling at times, but extremely captivating from start to finish. From the very first scene, I knew I was going to love this. The single-take of him murdering his first victim really set the tone of the film. You see Mark as this socially-awkward guy for the most part, but because of the first scene, I just found it deeply uncomfortable to watch him interact with people.
This is a top-tier thriller. Really meta in the way it forces us to contemplate how we view violence in films. It just feels like a less obnoxious version of Funny Games. Something about those shots in the darkroom with the neon red just really satisfied me aesthetically.",5.0
"The film that killed Michael Powell's career is ironically his last masterpiece. So vilified it was at the time that he went on to do little else of note, only recently has it received the recognition it deserves. This is such a tragedy, the ambition and brevity demonstrated in Peeping Tom would have been unprecedented in 1960 and we are just left to wonder what he might have gone on to do had audiences and critics been as ahead of his time as he was.
The use of colour is exquisite, the vibrants primary hues that he had been making use of since his Pressburger collaborations are put in to full effect, accentuated to the highest degree of vibrancy as to attract our eyes to the ravishing production design. The attention to detail is equally genius and the use of match cuts to link scenes through similar actions is just textbook seamless filmmaking.
A precursor to the slasher genre, we know who the killer is within the first few minutes, which allows the film to become a fascinating character study rather than a generic murder mystery. Forced to look down the voyeuristic viewfinder of the central characters' camera, we see what he sees and the cinematic artform itself becomes a vessel for scopophilia.
The character of Mark is given a great deal of depth, a compelling backstory and is written with a palpable compassion. A strong performance by Karl Boehm draws a great deal of empathy from the audience to portray this tragic and deeply scarred individual. Though very much a horror movie with a captivating gothic atmosphere, it plays out much better as a psychological thriller, an insight into fear and the allure of making movies.",4.5

Perhaps the most surprising revelation in Peeping Tom was that the truth was right under our noses all along...Mark should've been cast as the star of the general shopping mall commercial.
& The least surprising was the whole reversing the peep polarity as a means to a cure.
But hey, the most & least surprising elements do compliment each other quite finely. Plus, this movie is pretty fkn sharp, a/v-wise, & is clearly the inspiration for Wright's Last Night in Soho.
Maxine Audley as Helen's mom is perfection - & not just because she's the epitome of the parent you pray to God your gf doesn't have, but that's definitely a factor.
Great flick pick, Kev!

"The camera being utilized as a weapon, being made to capture people at their most vulnerable - a statement about the inherent sadism present in art's search for ""authenticity."" As Michael Powell would show it to be in here, it's a film all about how ""realism"" is not within one's means, especially in an artist's drive to create something they see to be ""perfect."" For someone like Mark, it's not always about the art itself, but it's a fetish - and it also becomes an indictment about the sensibilities that people develop towards the art that they consume, which only makes Karlheinz Böhm's performance every bit as unsettling as it is tragic.
Peeping Tom was banned in many countries upon its release, and director Michael Powell had ruined his reputation for creating something that was seen as obscene at the time when it first was released. Visually it might seem tame today, but the text underneath is what only makes this film among the scariest horror films ever made - and at that, one of the best films ever made about filmmaking.",5.0

"Audiences were so horrified by Peeping Tom that it was actually pulled from UK theaters. The Brits felt violated and betrayed because one of the most revered and hopeful of their directors, Michael Powell (The Red Shoes), had made something perverse and psychotic. He made viewers confront the level of thrill-seeking they hope to get from a moving image by following a smutty photographer/amateur filmmaker (Karl Boehm) who photographs nudie pics for side money, but gets his real thrills from filming women while he stabs them to death with a blade that's hidden on his tripod.
When the photographer begins to form a friendship with his downstair’s neighbor, he attempts to reform, but his psychosis goes much deeper than thrills and reveals a nefarious experimentation in fear, with his father as the controller and he as the subject. Powell, who always possessed one of the most impressive visual eyes, uses the grainy mouth-open screams of women to communicate to the audience that the act of filmmaking is providing something to voyeurs. There are different levels, sure, like the fellow that Boehm observes shopping for nude photos in says store but says no to purchasing a nudie film. With a picture you retain control of your fantasy. With a motion picture, someone else has control of the imagination and you just watch.

Every fan of ""Scream"" has heard of ""Peeping Tom"" and knows that this movie is a milestone in the genre history because it was the first to show the murders from the killer's point of view. All thanks to trivia questions asked by Ghostface to Casey at the beginning of the film.
But ""Peeping Tom"" is more than that. It can also be seen as an exercise in metalanguage that presents a slight criticism of Hollywood society and its obsession with sex. It makes a comparison between cinema and voyeurism, or scoptophilia, as the psychologist explains, which would be basically, in his words: ""the morbid urge to gaze"".
Karlheinz Böhm delivers an excellent performance for the main character, Mark, who is, at the same time, protagonist and villain.
Mark is a cinephile psychopath who watches the world through his camera and whose desire to kill awakens when he sees the expression of horror on his victims' faces. He needs to capture what he calls the ""face of death,"" that is, the expression his victims make when they realize they're really going to die.
Mark quickly alternates between childish attitudes and frightening cold stares. His inconstant reactions make his interactions with others uncomfortable to watch, just as it should be for the characters. This is a great way to immerse the audience into the scene.
Also, the knife at the base of the tripod is a nice touch.
The production is good, but the death scenes are boring, without any drop of blood, which weakens the visual power of any serial killer.
In addition, the correlation that the detectives make between murders through the expression of horror on the victims' faces makes sense by taking into account Mark's psyche, but it takes away some credibility from the story, as well as the superhuman sensory and instinctive capacity of the blind woman.
""Peeping Tom"" is a groundbreaking horror tale that takes place behind the scenes of a classic Hollywood that blends the passion for cinema with the hidden pleasure of voyeurism. A must watch for horror fans due to its pioneering point of view that has influenced many other classics ever since.

“I hope to be a director very soon.”
I’m becoming unhealthily obsessed with The Archers’ films. There’s something about these movies that are so unbelievably down my alley and I can’t really explain why. 
This movie rocks and rolls. A phenomenal character study that feels so damn ahead of its time. It’s mind boggling that this movie came out in 1960. Even though it was the same year as “Psycho”, it still somehow seems a lot more ahead of its time in comparison. 
  The script goes so hard. Mark is such an incredibly written character. Characters like Mark with the reasoning he has for being a weirdo and killer that makes you sympathetic for him are probably my favourite types of characters of all time. He’s another one to add to the list of some of the best in that category. He’s compelling as shit. Karlheinz Böhm also just plays the shit out of him. 
  The story itself is also just really good. The type of thrilling aspect this movie has is part of what makes it feel so ahead of its time. I felt like there really wasn’t a dull moment here ever. 
With this being the first I’ve seen from Powell standalone, of course it carries the phenomenal filmmaking from the others I’ve seen from his duo work. The colors, use of music, directing itself, the use of POV from Mark’s camera in this. I just love the guy. It sucks that this movie kinda ended his career.

"I was hoping I’d like this more, Just like my previous review of All About Eve, I hope my appreciation goes up on the rewatch. 
The acting is pretty good. There is no one who particularly shined, nor did anyone’s performance fall flat. The writing was quite nice, especially the way that Mark’s past is revealed throughout. The pacing was quite nice too. I really wish we got to see the crime’s in more detail as I feel that could’ve elevated the film, however the more reserved approach isn’t a bad thing. Firstly, it makes the viewer use their imagination and possibly come up with something more devastating than the “reality”. Secondly, and more importantly, it allowed for the film to get past the censorship. The cinematography was wonderful. Powell’s use of highly saturated colour is so beautiful. The creativity of shots in this brilliant. One in particular is when Mark is filming from the rafters of the studio set. The way the detectives are somewhat contained by the box of the grid is really nice. 
Overall, this was a very good film with some nice acting and writing, and even better cinematography.",3.5

I have never seen any of Michael Powell’s other films and to be honest while I was aware of this one, it had never made it to my watch list until I was compiling my list for this year’s Hooptober.
Exquisitely shot and composed.  Masterful use of color, framing and set design.  I was blown away.  As if a 50’s era golden age of Hollywood dance film was mixed with Hitchcock.  Yes, there is only one scene of dancing featuring the amazing Moira Shearer (must watch Red Shoes now), it still had that feeling.  
A compelling story, lurid and dangerous for its time but quite tame by today’s standards this is still well deserving of consideration as a classic of the genre.  The lead actor Carl Bohm was decidedly creepy and of a piece with Norman Bates if somehow less unhinged sporting daddy issues rather than mommy issues.
But, wow, the color and cinematography were masterclass.  This was compulsively watchable and entertaining from start to finish.  Thank you Hooptober.  I would never have watched this were it not for this challenge.",4.5

Mark Lewis is never without his camera. During the day he works on a film set. In the evenings he's got a side job taking risqué photographs. And in the darkness of night, he films the horrified faces of his victims.

"A deeply disturbing, character study that has an eerie way of blurring the lines between the silver screen and our reality. We follow Mark, a psychologically scarred, aspiring film director, who, due to his father, has developed Voyeurism. And it is because of his mental illness, he becomes obsessed with fear and documenting it on camera. So to satisfy his urges, he murders many women on camera, trying to create his magnum opus of a documentary. It is through this concept, the film asks the uncomfortable questions of how ones obsession with work can make them go mad, as well as the sort of “self awareness” that we have when watching film. As we, just like Mark, become somewhat of voyeurs ourselves as we watch these stories on the big screen and get entrapped in their worlds, begging for more. It’s not something I particularly would’ve thought about, but it’s an interesting revelation from the director. It’s also not really scary per se, as you don’t see any graphic violence by any means. All of the murders are more or less implied, much like in Black Christmas (A film I adore and never will stop mentioning). But it still manages to make you feel uneasy and frightened, as this situation all feels very real. It definitely feels like something from the twisted mind of Hitchcock, but oddly enough it’s not and this came out the same year as Psycho. A shame I learned this film killed Michael Powell’s career basically, because it’s very revolutionary to the horror genre. Maybe in an alternate reality, Psycho never existed and this was the film that took all of the glory. Sorry for rambling too much.",4.0
"Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom,"" a thriller couched in the destructive leer of a camera, is an ice-cold yet blazingly rendered piece of work. With potent colors and thick ideas, Powell tells the story of a murderer obsessed with the image captured through a camera lens. Themes of fear, power, and violence pour forth from a restrained yet striking piece of work. In the end, the thriller may be too measured to make a remarkable impact; but it is a compelling and chilling film.",3.5

Wow, this was a nice surprise. This one has been on my watchlist for a long time.
This one is masterfully directed and edited. The way Michael Powell captures the close up shots and the way he sets the scene is great. The cinematography was stunning, right from the first frame everything looked gorgeous. A technically strong movie.
The cast was amazing.Carl Boehm was great as Mark. One of the most convincing slasher lead performance ever. His character is so mysterious but still you can understand what might go on his mind. Anna Massey as Helen was phenomenal. A lovable character and the only character Mark normally interacts. Her charming presence was perfect for the tension value. Maxine Audley was terrific as Mrs.Stephens. A commanding role and the only person who somewhat understands Mark’s mentality.
The writing is really strong. I was completely engaged throughout the runtime. The way the characters speak their dialogues were a bit slow. But the conversations between the characters were amazing. The themes and the ideas this movie handles were written and executed in a masterful way.
As far as issues I didn’t like the third act that much and it had a few pacing issues in the second act. But this was a solid psychological slasher that can be enjoyed by every slasher fans.
Great pick Kev.

""Whatever I photograph, I always lose.""
I've never felt so close to a murderer, but this film puts us in the perspective of its protagonist, like if we were the peeping Tom. In fact, we are all peeping Toms because of our own fascination with films, which is kind of voyeuristic if you think of it. What's more interesting about this film is that it takes its time to explore its central character, making us understand more his odd behaviour, instead of focusing on the morbid aspects of the story. Mark is one of the most complex characters I've seen in horror cinema, and is so compelling to watch because of his multiple facets. He's odd, reclusive and introverted, but at the same time, he is curious, and has this obsession with the idea of capturing women's expressions of fear right before murdering them, which in a way seems like he is following his father's footsteps regarding his psychological experiments on fear, but he also gets pleasure from watching his footage in his darkroom. This film not only offers an insight into the mind of this peculiar character, but we also get to see how he interacts with other people. His growing relationship with Helen, for whom he begins to develop strong feelings, and gets to struggle with his dangerous impulse trying not to hurt her, which is definitely one of the more interesting aspects of the story, how he gets to actually care for someone. Peeping Tom is a fascinating study on fear and trauma. Audacious, compelling, smart and insightful. I can't believe this film ended Michael Powell's career. What the fuck was wrong with people in the 1960s?

"Boy were English censors s o f t back in the day! Peeping Tom killed Michael Powell’s
career and for the life of me I can’t figure
out why. I mean sure, the central theme is voyeuristic murder and it was 1960 but Psycho came out that same year and that film only served to propel Alfred Hitchcock’s career even further. I went into this expecting all-out sleaze, gore, strong sensuality and maybe even nudity. Instead what we have here is a very well shot, written and lit slow-burn psychological thriller that, if I’m being honest, is sort of overrated to me. Don’t get me wrong, I liked this film quite a bit and maybe my expectations got the best of me but I kept waiting for it to kick into full exploitation movie overdrive and that never happened. Powell never made another film after this which is a crying shame because he and Pressburger were an awesome filmmaking tandem and I feel like we were robbed of further greatness from them.
The lighting and costumes really caught my eye and Otto Heller’s cinematography is creative, precise and even playful at times. Carl Boehm’s central performance as the psychotic voyeur Mark Lewis was solid, although he kind of annoyed me with his constant cowering and creepy awkwardness but I guess that’s exactly the point. Some tense and suspenseful moments that work very well are sprinkled in throughout but I think it suffers a little bit from the deliberately slow pacing and plot structure. I mean, is this thing culturally significant? Sure. Worthy of the total shit storm of controversy it was met with? Absolutely not. Thankfully we’ve come a long way since 1960 and the stark commentary on filmmaking that this film offers is timeless and terrifying. However—and feel free to tear me apart on this—I was a little underwhelmed and at certain points bored while watching this. Perhaps a second viewing is in order? It’s a very good film but not quite great (except the ending, THAT was great) in my humble opinion.",3.0

Strange how this feels both ahead of its time and imprudently dated at once. In reference to the former, it's a mini-miracle something this prickly and dauntless was not only made and produced in 1960, but given a comparatively wide release : regarding the latter, the painstaking histrionics strike the biggest nerve of soured age, tethered strongly against some basic, procedural goofiness (e.g. let's not bother, you know, running away from the man steadily approaching me with a blade, or: drama-drenched lines like, ""I could never photograph you!"" meant to be taken semi-seriously). But even beneath this chicanery are bouts of masterful formalism elegantly springing to life : Powell's use of over-saturated colors to accent purity of the reds, blues, and greens (Exhibit A and Exhibit B) ; the constant return to First Person and Third Person point-of-view shots ; wondrously composite framing and sly, superimposition techniques (like e.g. this shot that projects a woman's face on Mark's back, transforming it into a skull). People shunned its bold and uncomfortable demeanor -- but it's supposed to be uncomfortable ; “Peeing Tom” not only describes lead character Mark, but film directors and, subsequently, audiences as well. It unflinchingly prods at our primitive desire to obsess with not necessarily acts of perversion, but the reactions to those acts of perversion : notice Mark's insistence on capturing the aftermath of his evil deeds. (Who knew that half a century later we'd be living in a world where you can find hundreds of videos of people's faces as they ""react"" to 2Girls1Cup for the first time ever.) The obvious comparison is PSYCHO -- both made in 1960, detailing the sick, psychopathic tendencies of two insatiable men who, in some strange way, almost want to be caught -- but I think the more accurate Hitchcock-parallel is REAR WINDOW : a bilious ode to the blurred, triangular boundary between cinema, voyeurism, and real life—the biggest contrast being whether the killer is the antagonist or, in PEEPING TOM's case, the protagonist. There's an intrinsic hankering within all of us to see things we know we shouldn't be seeing : it's how far we're willing to go to satisfy those desires that defines our individual decency. Perhaps it’s how intolerably relatable most critics and viewers found Mark and his moral depravity that made them wince and writhe with discomfort.",4.0
"the use of colours and the lighting 😩
michael powell directs the shit out of this and karlheinz böhm is simply incredible in the lead role. could see why it's often compared to hitchcock because it definitely feels like it with the incredible tension building while also being similar thematically. Peeping Tom puts us in the killer's POV with the amazing opening sequence itself and it only gets better from there!
the film is a very interesting look at male gaze exploring the connection between cinema and voyeurism in a very interesting way making us contemplate how we view violence in films and Peeping Tom does so in a deeply disturbing way. there isn't any explicit violence in the film, it's always suggested and yet it's surprisingly effective. what's frightening however is the fact that mark does not just take pleasure in observing people but also in capturing their fear on camera. brilliant film.",0.0

**********
Oddly, this is my first Michael Powell film. Gotta watch more by this guy. This movie was EXTREMELY well done.
What makes it so great is the empathy that Powell creates with the killer. Mark (the killer) is just plain nuts. But he's struggling with it. The dude KNOWS he's sick and that there is no way to escape it. So he realizes that he has to embrace his illness and just give over to it. And at the same time, he struggles with it, especially when it gets in the way of something he truly cares about.
So good.
The suspense and build-up of slow horror is also very well crafted. And even though this was filmed WAY back in the day, it doesn't seem all that dated. Heck, I would love to see a remake of sorts with our current selfie, Snapchat, Instagram culture. (Has there been one? Not sure). Regardless, the material is very topical in many ways.
Such a good horror flick. Now I can see why it is on so many BEST OF lists. Nice.",4.5
"Cameroticism, a picture about pictures. Peeping Tom is a tightly wound film whose excellent formalism sets the stage for the lurid thrillers of the following decades, most notably Brian De Palma's. In spite of this, I found myself by far more captivated by the lead character's psychology, which is nuanced and delicate. The titular voyeur's budding doomed romance stands out as the most unique element, as well as the strongest, so much so I feel I would've preferred less sadism and even greater emphasis on the portrait of a man consumed by his own fixation on fear. Overall, it's a delightful effort and a delightfully surprising one in many ways.

"This is a great piece of British cinema and a great look into the Male gaze in the form of a psychopath. Kind of feels like Psycho in another world in its psychological horror and it’s really effective in that sense. Obsession and the mind of those who obsess, acts as a great stimulating theme with heaps of intrigue and anticipation. I liked the fact there wasn’t really a mystery element to who was the killer, the fact we knew from the get go made for unique approach to the film which completely changed the effect on the audience. It really allowed you to delve into the mind and eye of madman which isn’t what you expected it to be like in the kind of meditative tone this film possesses for a lot of the time, the subdued violence was also very effective as the anticipation level was maximised. Another cult classic that I adore.",4.5
"If Alfred Hitchcock was obsessed with blondes, then Michael Powell was obsessed with red heads!

I found it to be surprisingly mediocre, considering it's directed by Powell, who is one of my favorite British directors, and has made along with his fellow directing collaborator Emeric Pressburger some of my favorite Films of all time!
Still, the acting felt over the top and a bit annoying, even considering the protagonist's mental state, and the narrative felt a bit dull with the pacing feeling weirdly misplaced a bit. One thing though that is obvious, as in literally every Film directed by Michael Powell, is the incredible eye-candy Technicolor cinematography, this time instead of Powell and Pressburger's go-to cinematographer Jack Cardiff, it was done by the Czech Otto Heller!

There is no doubt though that this Film has influenced and has helped create the slasher genre in some ways, and has been helping rooting some of Cinema's most notorious thrillers. I mean it was released just one year before Psycho!",3.0

I had heard about the film Peeping Tom for years, but every time it was described to me it just sounded like a sleazy curiosity and not much else. While I wouldn't have passed up the chance to see it, I wasn't obliged to put much effort into seeking it out. It was the film that ""destroyed Michael Powell's UK directing career"" after all, so it had to be just a bunch of smut.
After thinking that Peeping Tom was one kind of film for a decade or two, I was proven completely wrong in every respect. Sure you could still say the film is about smut, but that would be such a crude and ignorant description of the film. Saying it's a masterpiece in psychological terror would probably be a better description of the film.
Even putting the horror or thriller aspect aside for a moment, this is a GREAT film made by a master of the medium. While I've seen my fair share of great films by some of the world's greatest directors, I have to admit right now that when it comes to Michael Powell's career and filmography I'm a bit ignorant so this first time watch caught me completely off guard. I was expecting an exploitation flick, and I got one greatest genre films I've ever seen instead.
I'm not even articulate enough to properly describe what I think about the film. The direction is superb, the attention to detail is mind-boggling and the performances are truly great. The premise of the film seems simple enough, but it's psychological complexities is what makes the story truly great I think. The character of Mark Lewis could have been written as simply psychotic, but it goes so much deeper then that with his father, his connection with his victims and that at one point it seems he knows how his psychosis works by manipulating himself in a key scene or two.
Karlheinz Böhm is outstanding in the role. I can't overemphasize that. It's a fantastic performance in every scene he's in. His calmness, his panic, his infatuation, it's all there in a perfect performance. I'm struggling to describe what I think about this entire film right now. Wish I could switch brains with a half decent writer for a few minutes to properly get my thoughts across. Suffice it to say I was blown away.

"Tem uma tensão crescente e atmosfera de suspense bastante fortalecida, pena que essa produção caiu nas mãos da crítica, e ficou esquecido durante anos. Hoje em dia, ele tem a fama de ser cult, bem diferente do seu primo ""Psicose"", que é mais lembrado e venerado. Eu mesmo, soube deste filme recentemente, e só agora tive a oportunidade de assistir. Na época, esse filme causou escândalo na sociedade britânica, pois foi taxado como um filme pervertido pra época, e essa recepção ruim, arruinou a carreira bem traçada do diretor Michael Powell, que tem bons filmes no currículo, como o clássico ""Sapatinhos Vermelhos"".
O desenvolvimento do filme é fantástico, e brilhante para a época em que foi feita. Um serial killer, solitário, quieto e tímido, mas com um passado traumatizante, que no presente tem uma obsessão de assassinar mulheres, mas antes ele grava o ""medo"" e o ""apavoro"" das mesmas com uma câmera, e depois fica assistindo em casa. E nós, como espectador, somos cumplice desses assassinatos, pois com as técnicas cinematográficas, somos transportados para ao lado do psicopata, e também vemos as reações das mulheres antes de serem assassinadas. A metalinguagem está presente e bastante forte na produção, e também tem todo debate sobre voyeurismo, psicopatia e fetichismo.
A produção foi influência pra Brian De Palma, Argento, Scorsese e por ai vai. Um dos pioneiros de um trilher de psicopata. E o que foi nostálgico para mim foi observar a tecnologia de câmeras da época, os rolos de filmagens, e como se fazia para se revelar as fitas.",4.0
"In 1960, Michael Powell released Peeping Tom and nearly tanked his reputation as a filmmaker. But even with the film’s reception having been so hyperbolically negative at the time, one cannot deny that Peeping Tom has indeed achieved its goals, inciting a sort of shock that might have felt alien to the sensibilities of audiences of the time. But Michael Powell also saw that these impulses when making perfect art are not that alien, given the reputation that he had managed to establish along with Emeric Pressburger for so many years, are not that alien – and could very well have been deadly at that. For all we know, this aspect to Peeping Tom might have indeed resulted in a far more prescient film than what was seen first and foremost in here.
When Peeping Tom starts, the camera lingers on a call girl, who prepares to take the unseen cameraman up to her room. But of course, the camera acts as a voyeur – something we’ve already accustomed ourselves to via Hitchcock. But our camera can only follow this woman so far before we see a look of fear on her face, as if near death. And then the film makes a hard cut to a camera projecting everything we had just seen on celluloid. This poor woman is dead, but the camera lingers on her final moments, replicating our voyeuristic interest in her.

"I was recently asked to provide a listing of my favorite horror films and I forgot to include PEEPING TOM.  Shame on me.  It’s brilliant.
  
It is fascinating to think that PSYCHO would be released shortly after this one.  PEEPING TOM has always felt like the character of Norman Bates starring in M.  It is unnerving throughout, constantly giving the sense that the Viewer should be able to do something to intervene, but instead the Viewer watches ... and anticipates.  Using the erratic piano solos of Gordon Watson as a reflection of the obsessive drive of Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) awakening is so creepy (and reminiscent of the killer’s whistling in M when he has located a new child victim).  And the movie’s last audible line of dialogue actually made me gasp, it was so heart-rending.
  
In many ways, PEEPING TOM is a Master Class in the Art of making motion pictures.  This is due not only to the skillful use of cinematography, lighting and sound, the intense screenplay from Leo Marks, or Director Michael Powell’s sharp control of what the Viewer will be required to see ... and what will be left to the imagination.  (Note how the title character wants to be a Director, the person in control.)  The casting is so inspired with terrific performances from Boehm, Anna Massey, Maxine Audley, and Moira Shearer.  Even “bit” moments with Pamela Green as mouthy model Milly are right on target.  And who doesn’t appreciate the chance to see Miles Malleson again?
   
One of the truly nasty things about PEEPING TOM is that remembering scenes from it afterwards may just highlight thoughts of our own compulsions and the lengths we go to keep the knowledge of them hidden from others.  I assume that the vast majority of us aren’t murderers, yet we may be troubled by the impulses we do have that aren’t exactly fit discussions in polite society.
   
PEEPING TOM is a prime example of brilliant filmmaking.  It would make an amazing triple feature with PSYCHO and M.",5.0

33 Films x 6 Decades: 1960s
Reviled and rejected upon release in 1960, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is very apparently a member of the ""so Hitchcock it is shocking it was not directed by Hitchcock"" club. Compared to films such as Vertigo, Psycho, and Frenzy, Peeping Tom would be a natural fit with voyeurism, scopophilia, and the ritualistic killing of women whose sexuality is deemed to be dangerous by a psycho (Vertigo, obviously, does not fit this). Yet, it instead was directed by Michael Powell. One half of the Archers, Powell is a legend of British filmmmaking, yet none of this helped to prevent Peeping Tom's negative response with viewers shocked by the content and moral implications of even watching such a film. How could a psycho who commits such horrific murders against women be the focus of a story? Lurid, progressive, and highly influential, Peeping Tom is a film that provides scares and ideas in equal measure.
As a film about voyeurism, Peeping Tom is rather apparent in borrowing from Hitchcock and innovating on where Hitchcock left off. In one particular shot, murderer Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) looks outside a window from the second floor of a building to keep an eye on a detective that is following him around. It is a sly nod to Vertigo as, if memory serves, the reverse shot occurs in Hitchcock with James Stewart being the detective who looks up at the second floor window to keep an eye on a woman. The film further introduces voyeurism in shots of Mark high above the studio. First, as Vivian (Moira Shearer) walks into the studio to meet with him - which is also a gorgeously colored moment with the purples, reds, blues, and greens, all blending gorgeously in the scene - and then later as Mark films the cops at the crime scene. Even small moments are loaded with voyeurism, such as Mark just peering through Helen's (Anna Massey) window when he comes home from work. This is a film filled to the brim with voyeurism, but that is apparent to anybody who watches the film.
Where Powell truly innovates with voyeurism is in how he often captures it, not just relying on overhead shots of Mark looking down on somebody doing anything. Detaching the camera from the film itself and instead turning it into a voyeuristic device for Mark to use for his own pleasure. With frequent iris shots in which the lens of the camera is the only thing we see, the film puts us right in the mind of Mark. As a by-product, it delves us right into his mind. As this is not a pretty place, it is not hard to imagine why many critics were repulsed by the film in 1960. Serving to separate the audience from the actions taking place - no matter how horrific they tend to be - this technique is one that instead favors a focus on Mark and his morbid reaction to watching a woman die or to see people find her body.
It is certainly sordid and perverse, yet incredibly effective in scaring the audience. By putting the viewer in the mind of Mark and with us being powerless to prevent what is set to occur next, the film simulates the way in which Mark, too, feels powerless to stop his voyeuristic and murderous urges when using a camera. While he finds pleasure in this action, the audience is horrified by the sadistic hold the camera has on Mark's mind. Compelling him to kill in an attempt to capture the fear on a person's face when they see themselves being killed, Mark is certainly driven by the childhood trauma of his father doing the same to him (though not killing him), with Mark quickly learning that being frightened is not enough. Rather, the greatest fear is fear itself, but not in the way Franklin D. Roosevelt meant. Instead, Mark puts his own twist on it by arguing that seeing yourself afraid is scarier than simply being afraid. For Mark, he watches old videos of himself being afraid to feel this fear, while also making the women he kills see themselves be afraid as he kills them. Weaponizing this fear, Mark and the film as a whole often feel like a critique of horror films, directors, and audiences.
Incredibly indebted to the work of Hitchcock, Peeping Tom is also indebted to Dziga Vertov and Man with a Movie Camera. In that Soviet documentary, Vertov endeavored to demonstrate the power of a camera in telling a story. With scenes of the stop-motion animation camera twisting, bending, and being used to capture any old image, Vertov demonstrated the inherent power a camera held to capture and manipulate a moment. In Peeping Tom, Powell shows the danger that very same camera can have. With Mark using a camera that looks very similar to the one in Vertov's film, he similarly bends, twists, and elongates the camera, using it as a literal weapon against the woman he films. In this depiction of a man using a camera to impulsively kill women, finding pleasure in seeing their fear, and making Mark a man with dreams of being a director, Michael Powell makes Peeping Tom a thinly veiled critique of cinema and the industry as a whole. Showing the perverse nature of voyeurism and the pleasure audiences get from watching horror films where people are scared or watching films where women are marginalized and abused, Peeping Tom plays like a warning about the damaging power a camera can have. Though Powell makes a living using a camera to tell stories, he nonetheless knows the power that it wields in manipulating one's senses and the harm it can cause if used by somebody with nefarious intentions. Self-reflexive in this way, as it deconstructs the way in which a film works and shows the voyeuristic and disconnected way in which a horror director - or director in general - works, Peeping Tom may not necessarily hate itself or its audience. However, it is greatly concerned. It wants to probe why this voyeuristic tendency and the love of watching people act frightened (or any other emotion) is so prevalent and popular. It is the perfect example of a filmmaker understanding a genre and feeling so well - in this case, Powell understanding horror and how to create an atmosphere of fear - that he is able to deconstruct it and question why it is so enjoyable to watch.
In this, Peeping Tom offers a variety of response. Whether it be the academic, the sadistic, for enjoyment, or more, Peeping Tom probes into the feeling conjured up by horror films and the way in which directors elicit emotion - whether it is Mark or the real director who is making a film that Mark works on as a technician - from an audience. Forcing the audience to decipher why they watch horror films and whether this detached voyeurism is truly dangerous or just for entertainment, Peeping Tom is a film that loves film and filmmaking, but openly wonders why the voyeurism of film is more openly accepted than it is in reality. In essence, why is James Stewart watching his neighbors in Rear Window acceptable when the same action would be indefensible if done by somebody in real life? It is a fair question and why that Peeping Tom endeavors to show the dangers of throughout with Mark standing as a classic cinematic peeping tom, but one who is also dangerous and kills women with the power the camera gives him over them and their emotion. Controlling, scary, and deranged, Mark stands a critique of the potential damage film and camera's can have on the minds of those already damaged. It allows them to remove themselves from a moment and experience it through a camera, coercing behaviors and actions that may have been out of their character if not given the power of holding a camera. It is for this that the film's dependency on the camera's eye is so important, especially in the final scene. Prepared to kill himself with the camera in the same way he killed multiple women, Powell moves the camera. Unlike the death of the women, we do not see it from behind a camera. Instead, Powell takes us out of the camera and uses a medium shot of Mark lunging himself towards the sharp edge of the camera leg. Forcing us to face the horror the camera can creates instead of being able to hide behind one to watch it, Peeping Tom ends with a powerful image of what horror voyeurism can create in the human mind.
A horrifiying work from Michael Powell, Peeping Tom delivers scares in a very subtle, reserved fashion with the film deriving horror from simply following Mark Lewis. As he closes in on a kill, the film sends chills down the spine of the audience, forcing us to watch every gruesome detail. With typically excellent colors and excellent camera work, Peeping Tom is a film that may not have been as revered as Powell's prior works upon release, but has finally received its just due as one of his strongest works. Though, on-the-surface, a major departure from, say, The Red Shoes (hell there is even a Hans Christian Andersen mention here and Moira Shearer dancing around a studio set like she did in that film), Peeping Tom is a film that explores that film and many others. How does the distance the camera puts between us and the action impact how it resonates with us on a human level? The people we watch are like us, but seem like distant beings who are products of our imagination. This gives many directors the power to do anything they wish to them, as we are so disconnected that it gives us just a fleeting sense of shock or concern. Openly questioning the psychology behind this and wondering why it is alright, Peeping Tom is simultaneously a great film and a great exploration of whether or not films and the power a camera gives are dangerous to one's psyche.",4.0
"Peeping Tom is an intimately terrifying experience that doesn’t let up. While this film may have killed the career of its director, it also at the same time established a legacy for him and his film. With tight directing and an unsettling story, Peeping Tom has all the makings of a film ahead of its time. It is a movie about looking, in a similar vein to Rear Window but with much more sinister intentions.
Director Michael Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks created a deeply unsettling portrayal of an obsessed man who regularly films real, candid reactions and emotions. More specifically, that of his victim’s fear. Murder and voyeurism is sex to this man and we know it within the first few minutes. It’s an interesting conceit as if means we spend the rest of the film knowing what he had done and what he’s capable of, meaning any empathy we have for him is hard fought for and it’s a credit to both Boehm’s layered performance.
Even if some of its plot devices and symbolism will seem obvious to today’s savvy audiences, Peeping Tom is still one of the most influential films ever made. It’s a stylish movie and explores many issues such as cultural repression in Britain, psychoanalysis, sexuality and voyeurism. It’s a daring, unconventional horror film that gets us close to the killer’s mind, we are part of the film, without the audience there is no Peeping Tom, this makes it even more petrifying.

"First movie to ever put the audience in the killer's point of view.

A movie that cost Michael Powell’s career due to controversy and its a tragedy that Peeping Tom ended his career in Britain. but fortunately, thanks to Martin Scorsese who championed the film and brought it to the 1979 New York Film Festival to great acclaim, paved the way for its reemergence and reevaluation. So, Powell lived to see Peeping Tom vindicated and declared as a true classic. After all, this is one of the greatest influencers of horror in the film industry.
A generation of filmmakers went on to create its greatest successors like Halloween (1978) and Dressed to Kill (1980). And we can name more films influenced by its technical points, like the vibrant colorful set design and imaginative lighting of Suspiria (1977), the grimy, neon-lit beauty of Maniac (1980), Driller Killer (1979) and Taxi Driver (1976). Also, the thematic points of similarity in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986) and Scream 4 (2014) in which both killers film and watch back their crimes. Also, in the sadism for perfection in art in Color Me Blood Red (1965). We can still see its influence to this day.",4.5
"An uncomfortable, disturbing and surprisingly empathetic portrait of a voyeuristic serial killer who uses his camera as a deadly weapon, a horror film that apparently was too bold and ahead of its time for its contemporary audience. The themes of voyeurism, cinema and its audience is really clever and interesting, its filmed with such lurid and vibrant colors and has a brilliant, disturbing use of POV camerawork, and Karlheinz Böhm delivers a fantastic performance of a character that's somewhat empathetic in one minute and genuinely fucking creepy the next. The opening is incredible and sets the mood and the incredibly unsettling vibe that'll continue throughout and end up culminating in a glorious finale. Quality filmmaking, thank you Scorsese for giving this new life!",4.5

"“I don’t trust men who walk quietly.” Same.
I have never watched “Peeping Tom” on the big screen (though I have seen it several times on my television) and the way Powell elevates what in another’s hands would be an overwrought tale of Gothic dread into an enrapturing, gnarly piece of art isn’t the result of him adding a prestige sheen to the genre. It’s him fully loving its true mechanics and real nature. The elements Powell intensifies are inherent to the genre: the rich sense of color to mirror the psychological, the use of elaborate staging that recalls the cluttered mind, the fear of being watched and the confused madness of the watcher are pitched to uncompromising ends here for an often mesmerizingly complicit arrangement.

"One of the key moments in “Peeping Tom” occurs when Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is being questioned by two detectives regarding a murder of a woman that took place after hours at the film studio where he works. As one detective asks questions, the other is handling Mark's ever-present camera. We can see how desperate Mark is to have his camera back in his hands as his eyes follow its movements and his hands continue to reach out hopefully. That camera has become the expression of his twisted psyche, and the film clearly shows just how he has come to see making a film as intricately connected to pain and fear, and also to sex and death. By putting both himself and us right alongside Mark, as voyeurs who see the world through a camera's eye, Powell effectively sabotaged his career as a director. In England, “Peeping Tom” was met with uncontrolled, and uncalled for animosity and reprobation, so why did “Psycho,” released later that year, manage to become not only a hit, but the template for hundreds of films in its wake? Hitchcock's film was more violent, more graphic, and also pulled the rug out from under audiences when the top billed actress was done away with before the end of the first hour. “Peeping Tom” has practically no blood, and the violence is essentially all off screen. Granted, “Psycho” was in B&W, while Powell's film was in the lurid and saturated Eastmancolor, but what was it that made critics react with bared fangs to a beloved filmmaker like Michael Powell? Looking in a mirror and seeing something you don't want to see or admit to yourself is disconcerting, and recognizing that Powell was holding up that mirror and saying “this is what you really want, isn't it?” was just too much. In the cinema, we are all voyeurs, all gazing at our fantasies, and complicit in fantasies, often violent or sexually coercive ones, that we never admit to in broad daylight. Powell didn't exonerate himself either; there he is in a cameo playing the unconscionably cruel father that created the monster that is Mark sheerly out of scientific curiosity ala Stanley Milgram. But the viewer? Us? Have we, like Mark, if only for a couple of hours, decided to take leave of our moral values and become killers, criminals, with our victims conveniently set up for us on the big screen? Both films are about the moral ramifications of gazing at that which we shouldn't see, of voyeurism, but Powell is more explicit in turning that gaze right back at us, and he was crucified for it. The film had a exaggerated reputation as something gruesome and bloody, which it wasn't, but seeing it the first time, after Criterion released a great print (with great extras!) it did not disappoint in the slightest. It wasn't bloody or gruesome at all, but it was a missing link, and a cinema experience, like all the Archers films, that is one of a kind.",5.0

"Excellent use of sound and suggestion to create a strange and terrifying mood. The real reason why this setup is so unsettling is because our ""villain"" is so pitiable - he's been abused and mistreated, brought up in a way that would make just about anyone into a psychopath. He's handsome and well-dressed, and his internal struggle between murder and kindness is torturing him. The first-person sequences put us in his shoes. How can we fault him for being a peeping tom when our compulsion to watch movies grows from the same voyeuristic seed? If you really want to fuck with people, make them question their own motives - all the buckets of blood in the world can't help you if you don't have an intelligent story.

The artist's dilemma: artists are always creating; the actual completion of the art is an afterthought.
Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) is a camera operator in a film studio during the day; in the evening, he takes provocative pictures of young beauties; and on an occasional night, he captures on film the fear of his victims in their last dying moments.
 
Mark is such a nice, quiet boy; unfortunately for our protagonist, he was raised by a biologist-social-scientist who used his young son in ""fear"" experiments.
The search for new art continues,  looking for new photos at the NewsStand or with the effortless enthusiasm of young artists like Vivian, who is practicing modern dance moves, or Mark, who is trying to film a documentary on fear.
This film is by the great director Michael Powell, and it is a grand film to look at. The sound atmospherics are unnerving at times, and the tension rises at a constant pace.

"Wholly Hitchcock-adjacent and obviously akin to Psycho's seminal slasher status garnered the very same year, Powell and writer Leo Marks' work opting for a series of victims instead of one as the afflicted titular ""filmmaker"" frantically compiles footage for his documentary debut. The voyeurism's initially presented as something either hereditary or instilled, the footage Mark shows to Helen insisting that his father's research on the psychology of fear and its effects was either traumatic or telling of Mark's inevitable continuation of his father's work albeit murderous. Technically elevated and fear as fuel/impetus as Mark compulsively leers at and looks out for his latest victim is a nice touch and compliment the acts themselves nicely. An absolute pleasure to ogle what inspired some the best visual and thematic aspects of De Palma's oeuvre as well.",4.0

The opening scene is brilliant, and every scene outdoes the preceding one in its brilliance. Michael Powell directs the thrilling crime drama that was completely ahead of its time. It is simply marvelous. Also, after seeing The Red Shoes, Life and Death of Col. Blimp, Black Narcissus, and this, I'm almost convinced that Powell had a thing for red-heads.

Hello Letterboxd! I'm doing my own slight twist on Naughty's two most recent 30 day film challenges, switching a couple of the categories between the two lists. So for the most part it will follow Naughty's first scavenger hunt list, but I also put in a couple categories from the second list as well. So, without further adieu, I bring you the first day of my custom-made film challenge. Hope you enjoy it!
Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.
Who would've predicted two excellent slasher films coming out in the exact same year from two British directors? Sadly, it would appear that one has outdone the other in popularity, and I dare say that Michael Powell's Peeping Tom has all but died in popularity. It saddens me that the Criterion Collection DVD went out of print, and since then, there hasn't been any sign of any home video release in America by any other film company. It had a terrible initial theatrical release- none of the critics appreciated it, and it actually ended up being banned in Finland for years because of the ""repulsive"" subject matter concerning the psychosis of the main character.
However, as much as I love Psycho, I have to admit that Michael Powell's take on slashers has a lot of things to love in it. There's the creepy opening scene, featuring a first-person murder. We know that there is a guy with a camera, and that he kills people in some mysterious form while filming them, in first person. We never see the killer's face in this opening scene, but not long after this, it is clear who the killer is- if you've seen enough films like this, you know right away who it is. It's usually a repressed individual who appears to have mental issues. The real twist isn't who did it- in the case of Peeping Tom, it's the why. We know right away that the main character has some sort of repressive history that has yet to be revealed, but we aren't really given too many clues until the whole can of beans spills out in its conclusion. And what a creepy, spine-chilling conclusion it was.
Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) works in a seedy British porn shop, taking skimpy photos and videos in the upstairs bedroom of a local convenience store. The store holds a secret of its own- they sell pornographic magazines to adult customers by specific request, though these magazines are never shown to us in detail. Mark has taken a liking to photographing and videoing beautiful women, and appears to take his camera fetish outside of the porn shop as well. He has a strange addiction of filming crime scenes and other things that most people would find strange to film, such as a couple making out or a random stranger's house. Things change for Mark when he meets Helen, a tenant of his apartment complex who has just moved downstairs. She seems to have taken a liking to him, and the two start a somewhat awkward relationship. However, Mark cannot seem to escape his past, and he hides a deep, dark secret that could threaten Helen's life- and everyone closest to her.
The acting in this film, I believe, makes the film far, far creepier than Psycho ever was. That's not to say that it is superior, however, but I have been somewhat desensitized to the horror elements of Psycho, although that certainly doesn't keep it from being one of my favorite films of all time. The German accent that Mark has in Peeping Tom adds an eerie feeling to his overall character, and the various plot twists revealed throughout the film make its overall suspense flow quite differently than in Psycho. Whereas, in Psycho's case, all of the twists were explained in the final scene, each segment of Peeping Tom reveals a little bit more of the overall puzzle, up until the shocking final reveal.
Peeping Tom is a stellar suspense film, and one of the most terrifying and creepy murder films I've ever seen. Its main character makes my skin crawl whenever I see and hear him, and his damaged past makes the story that much more intriguing. Although not quite as good as the undeniably classic Psycho, Peeping Tom is still a sorely underappreciated gem of horror, and one of my favorite British mysteries of all time.",5.0
"Director Project
Director: Michael Powell (Final Film)
Peeping Tom from the onset could be mistaken as a lowly-Hitchcock. A jaded replica with varying technical flourishes to differentiate from just a simple reproduction. However: aside from the foundations of the film, this is entirely different as it ventures deeper down into darker depths than most Hitchcock, and is thematically richer than most of those said (unsaid) films - and this isn't to talk-down those films and to suggest that they are not any good - because they mostly are from what I've seen, and anyway, they're completely different - but rather to amplify my thoughts on Peeping Tom.
This is the film that (from what I've heard numerous times) completely obliterated Michael Powell's career and obviously that's a shame, but I'm also glad that this didn't get completely lost - and maybe had it not been directed by Powell, it may have been, but anyway, I liked the film very much.
The film explores fear and obsession a lot, and really gets into its shocking moments with a few of Mark's home-made videos. These videos go a long way into explaining the conditioning of Mark, and also provide some rather uncomfortable moments. There is also a peculiar feeling throughout that all the idiosyncrasies mean something vitally important, and not only that, but everything means something. It's strange to me, but the most obvious is when Mark is copying other characters action for action.
Anyway, as for the actual film; attempting to make this at that time must have been like tugging on a tiger's tale. And for that, it was a massive gamble. It both worked, and horribly backfired. But I'm happy this exists nonetheless.",4.5

"My Horrific October | 2022
I had always assumed that the popular phrase ""peeping tom"" came from this old classic film. It wasn't until I dug deeper - that is, googling where the term originated from and finding out within 15 seconds - when I found that it actually comes from a legend that originates all the way back to the 11th century about the city of Coventry. Apparently, a gentlewoman named Lady Godiva rode a horse naked through the city to protest taxes, and legendary Tom was the one person who peeked at her during this event - hence, Peeping Tom.
I can't speak for how verifiable that story actually is because, frankly, how could Tom be the only one who looked? It is a legend after all. I can speak, however, for how interesting this film really is, especially for the time. This movie is innovative in many ways, mainly in the subject matter and the contents of the film alluding to literal pornography and what have you. This isn't something you will see often in films from this long ago.
The story also surprisingly incorporates child abuse as a motive for why the main character is such a disturbed individual. I thought this was also a bit of a progressive, sensible way to present the psychology of this particular murderer, and something that was simultaneously unexpected. The use of video in the film as a form of cinematography and composing shots is also extremely inventive.
Overall, it's easy to see why this is a classic, and it's a horror movie that is well-regarded for an abundance of good merits. Obviously a must-watch!",3.5
"It took several decades for Darwin’s theory to be come absorbed enough into the collective consciousness and to then manifest itself in new expressions of fear of those who would abuse the theory. e.g. The Island of Dr Moreau, etc. Peeping Tom is a manifestation of the fears created by an understanding of Freud’s theories, and the fear of the damage to the psyche that can be done in childhood by those who would abuse their understanding of Freud.
Mark works as a focus-puller, which is kind of like a psychiatrist. “What’s your job here?” “I’m a focus-puller.” “So am I, in a way.”
Mark (and I suspect Michael Powell) sees psychoanalysis as hopeless: “What’s the cure for scopophilia, doctor?” “Oh, a couple of years of analysis, three times a week.”
Why the F was this movie so controversial in 1960 that it ruined Michael Powell’s career? Yet, Hitchcock’s much racier film, Psycho on the same subject in the same year was his biggest hit??
“You don’t trust yourself, Mark, do you. Instinct is a wonderful thing, Mark. It’s a pity it can’t be photographed. If I’d listened to it years ago, I’d have kept my sight. I wouldn’t have let a man operate me whom I had no faith in. So I’m listening to my instinct now.”",4.5

PEEPING TOM hat in der Filmgeschichte seine Spuren hinterlassen und lebt quasi auch von seinem Mythos.
Kaum im Kino, fühlten sich nach der Vorführung die Kritiker empört dazu berufen dieses ""schundige"" und ""ekelhafte Stück Dreck"" völlig manisch zu zerfetzen und ihren Hass in Gänze zu entladen was dazu führte das die Karriere von Michael Powell just in diesem Moment in England zu Ende war und der Film fast - zum Glück nur fast - genauso geschreddert wurde.

PEEPING TOM kam aus dem Nichts, spielte mit gängigen Konventionen des Horror - und Thrillerkinos. Was zunächst bequem und einfach in Schwarz und Weiß und in Gut und Böse getrennt und kategorisiert wurde wird hier gegen den Strich gefegt.
Es ist unglaublich wieviele Schichten Michael Powell hier hineinwebt und der Gesellschaft und somit jedem einzelnen nicht nur den Spiegel des Voyeurismus vorhält, sondern diese gelinde gesagt konfrontiert und bloss stellt. Exemplarisch sei zum Beispiel die Szene in dem Zeitschriftenladen zu nennen, wenn sich geniert nach freizügigen Lustobjektenmaterial erkundet wird.
Eine einzigartige Aneinanderreihung wunderbar aufgebauten und arrangierten Szenen gibt es hier zu bestaunen. So akribisch toll provokant und ja auch mit scharzem Humor unterfüttert.
Klar, das die Schmierfinken von der Presse so hart abgingen und ihren Hass, Frust und Abscheu in die Schreibmaschienentasten kotzten.
Inhaltlich will ich hier gar nicht viel schreiben, wer den Film noch nicht kennt sollte am besten so unvorbereitet wie nur möglich die Fahrt antreten.
Ich mag hier sehr die Inszenierung, die Farbgebungen, die Schatten, die Abstufungen, den schwitzigen Drive und natürlich die Perpektiven in Klein - und in Großaufnahme.
Besonders überraschend war für mich wie visionär Michael Powell hier eigentlich am werkeln war - besonders in dem Aspekt des heutigen Social-Media-Irrsinns in dem die Voyeure in der Überzahl hinter jedem verfügbaren Bildschirm lauern und den Blödsinn der nach unentwegt Aufmerksamkeit gierenden Selbstdarsteller folgen und beiwohnen.
Immer im Fokus der Linse. Der Sucher findet immer jemanden und immer schaut jemand zu.

"Criterion Spine #58
At last. The OG slasher. Peeping Tom has been on my radar for at least a year now, I believe after reading up on it during some Halloween research. I picked up a poster of it on sale recently that is as large as my apartment's front door, so naturally I had to see the film before even considering putting the poster up.
""Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.""
The fact that Peeping Tom ruined Michael Powell's career but then put him on the map as a genius thirty years later is a narrative we hear so often around groundbreaking talent. Van Gogh being the artist to most popularly follow the same pattern. The Red Shoes is a huge favorite of mine, and while it is a very different story, I can see the same director making both movies. Each have something in common color palette wise. And in terror. Also, so cool that Moira Sheerer is in both.
""A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed and good comes of it?""
I am sure someone else has already made this joke, but it looks like Mark Lewis' Dad tried to make Boyhood before Linklater did. But in an extremely unwholesome way. Poor Mark. It's so fascinating that Karlheinz Boehm approached the Mark character with sympathy, because he could relate to growing up in his father's shadow.
""I don't trust a man who walks quietly.""
Peeping Tom has its moments of dullness, but considering it was made in 1960 and movies were not pumped full of the melodrama we are conditioned to look for these days, this is a very minor complaint. What the film has to say about voyeurism and filmmaking is genius. Martin Scorsese has some intriguing thoughts on why 8 1/2 and Peeping Tom are the two most important movies to watch about how to make movies. I'm going to need to let the film soak in some more to digest it all, but Scorsese is probably right.

The movie is a nerdy experience, but if you can appreciate Psycho, also from 1960, you will get something out of Peeping Tom. It is highly quotable, full of cool shots, full of a character making cool shots, and full of a mise en scène and color palette that inspired Last Night in Soho. Oh, and it started the slasher genre.

It's strange to see the Archers logo at the very beginning of Peeping Tom without the name ""The Archers"" or even Emeric Pressburger's appearing on screen. It's about as strange as not seeing frequent Archers player Roger Livesey in either The Red Shoes or this film.

This is a weird one for me to review. I think Peeping Tom is a solid film that's certainly effective, but I'm left not as disturbed as I was prepared to be. Now, the story itself is disturbing. It's also ultimately a sad study of a man who was traumatized during his youth and would inherit his late father's fascination in just finding the fear in people and recording that fear on camera. It's highly commendable how this little film that was premiered in 1960 decided to hold a mirror in front of its audience as it faced the all-too-human subject of voyeurism. Carl Boehm is exceptional as the mentally scarred and lonely Mark Lewis even when one can tell the actor is an Austrian playing a Brit or, like me, one sees him with his complexion and blonde hair as sort of resembling David Bowie in the early 1980s. Then, there's director Michael Powell with his elegantly confident presentation and signature care in the mise-en-scène. The use of colors his pictures are known for is so strong that I sometimes want Powell's canvas to just melt into paint and wash over me like a wave.
🎞🎞🎞🎞
However, I wonder in the case of Peeping Tom if the pretty color cinematography and the underlying piano score are what keep the film from getting so deep under the skin of a modern viewer such as myself. It might also be the intentional choice to not actually show the murders on-screen with the exception of the very last one. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is almost always brought up in the same discussion as this thriller from the same year. For this post, I want to bring that film up to highlight how that one still really creeps me out while Peeping Tom does so to a lesser extent. There's the stark, shadow-y, black and white look that works, Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable orchestration of the high notes as the bows pierce the audience like knives, and the murder (one shown in its entirety and another that has already started before the screen fades down) are kept on-screen. I know it was 1960 and those two movies were a lot for audiences to stomach at the time. I'm simply trying to articulate how it's easier for me to feel the wicked power of Psycho even after sixty-three years. With Peeping Tom, the presentation is maybe a tad too proper but definitely and undeniably tame by today's standards.
🎛📽
Like I said earlier though, Peeping Tom is still effective. The story grabs us from the beginning and never lets us off the hook even after its conclusion. While this early example of a ""slasher movie"" is not as frightening as it was to its first viewers, there is still suspense and disturbance conjured within an intelligent story with clear craftsmanship. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is still necessary for all movie lovers to watch before they die.

Bet De Palma masturbated to this countless times.
This is so good that it ruined Micheal Powell's career. A top class and truly brave voyeuristic work. A brilliantly chilling portrait of a disturbed mind. It was way ahead of its time with the taboo content and its edginess still holds up so well. It's salacious, it's perverse but it's also extremely tragic. Visually it's stunning with beautiful use of colours and excellent attention to details. Karlheinz Böhm is brilliant. The first 45 minutes are absolutely flawless. Overall it's a phenomenal film and also much better than Psycho.",4.5
"“I distrust a man who walks quietly.”
Wildly different in subject matter from everything else I’ve seen from Powell (no pressburger 😔) and honestly crazy how dark this is for a 1960s British film from an acclaimed director. Almost feels like a thesis film on voyeurism and violence in film and the linking of the two... phallic objects and lenses and windows and everything in between. Kind of begging to be analyzed in that sense and I think that’s why I couldn’t fully get into this - maybe it’s better the second time around.

"Dear Tom,
I got your video in the mail. Sorry it took me 63 years to get back to you, my mailman was only recently outed as known dyscalculia afflicted alcoholic. I’m halfway through and I just wanted to reach out to you.
Tom, your movie is preaching to the (traumatized) choir here! My dad was a professional photographer, so I know the abject terror of having a camera trained on you at any given moment, day or night. And I’m all too familiar with the pressure and confusion that comes with being an indentured, involuntary model with no clue what’s being demanded of you. - I just wanted you to know, you are not alone.
I don’t know how familiar you are with South Korean cinema, but I think The Wailing might be a good recommendation for you. Depending on how you read the film, the devil turns out to be a hobby photographer in that movie, so I think it might resonate with you the way it did with me.
I noticed your analogue OnlyFans content creation is having an uptick. Maybe you should focus on that instead of making home movies? Filing those brown envelopes rather than rewatching your dad’s documented trauma collection? Or maybe try yoga or take pictures of sourdough? None of those things relieved my stress either but I just wanted to say things do get better if you find an outlet for your pent up frustrations. It’s important to know that, before things get out of hand.
Maybe you should see about getting that one wonky tripod leg fixed?
It reminded me of a story I heard about a German camera guy working in the UK, who bore an uncanny resemblance to a Thunderbirds doll, and just because he had a German accent in the 60s, the BLIL (British Lactose Intolerant Lobby) vilified him as a dairy dealer because he served his guest milk.
The poor chap got really prickly while trying to explain how to properly hold a tripod to his downstairs neighbor. And accidentally died demonstrating how to take a deep dive selfie, slipping on a puddle of milk, poured on the floor by a British lady who was too embarrassed to refuse milk but equally mortified about farting in public so she just spilled the contents of the glass in his dark room, hoping it would go unnoticed.
What I’m saying, chillax and go for oat or soy milk. -Just my two cents.
I’m going to continue watching the video you sent me now. Write back soon!

The ultimate unfulfilment of media as a substitute for sex - surely more relevant now than it ever was. These days all we need to do is Google our sexual fantasies. Back then you'd have to go to the tobacconist and ask for their ""under-counter"" material. I for one object to all this sex on the internet - sometimes I just sit in front of the computer and shake my fist at it.
Mark needs a rectangular prism between his eyes and the objects of his sexual desire. But he craves the acknowledgement of his presence. An insoluble paradox, as the camera by definition removes the photographer from the frame. And so, in the throes of his deep psychosis, he drives for the most primal acknowledgement possible between two entities - fear. The instrument puncturing the membrane between the ""image"" and reality? A phallus, of course. It's hard to imagine a more phallic symbol than the raising of the tripod leg to point directly at the women Mark yearns to penetrate.
Peeping Tom is a film designed and performed with such ponderous deliberation - every frame intricately blocked, every colour carefully chosen, every line of dialogue delivered with precisely timed pauses between them - one suspects Michael Powell was aiming for Brechtian remove. Even the casting of Karl Boehm seems emblematic - he's clearly a foreigner, his German accent not disguised in the slightest, despite no diagetic explanation for this (Mark Lewis is an Englishman raised in England by his English father - played by Powell himself).
All the better to clue the audience in that Peeping Tom contains coded narratives beneath the surface storyline. Script writer Leo Marks was no stranger to this sort of dialectical doubling - he was a code specialist during World War 2 - making and breaking codes, both concealing and revealing hidden meanings of deep contextual import.
All the British public read into it at the time, of course, was obscenity. I wonder how much of it was the extreme darkness of Mark's destructive mental disintegration and how much was simply the frank depiction of quotidian British sleaze. Everyone knew it was there but exhibiting it in a film was simply not cricket, old chap.
Isn't interesting too how this triptych of groundbreaking films that hit the world in the same year from Britain, America and France - arguably changing the acceptable landscape of film discourse forever after - was grounded in the same dynamic? Peeping Tom, Psycho and Eyes Without a Face ALL trace the causal factor for the violation and destruction of young women back to a dysfunctional parent-child relationship. The root of all evil is not money - it's Mum and Dad.

"A Voyeur’s Photograph 📹

A psychoanalytic thriller where a madman’s sadomasochism is filmed by his ultimate weapon, a camera. Peeping Tom (1960) captures its titular character’s depraved pleasures and, at the same time, the audience’s expressions of terror, all the while stunning with Powell’s directorial finesse. His career-destroying effort proved effective.",3.5
"A great movie about making a movie about a movie (sort of). Movies about movies are usually so pretentious but this one did it without any of that, perhaps because it wasn’t the central plot point. Either way it was integrated so seamlessly and provided a great source of comedy in an otherwise super dark story.",4.5
"This is a complex movie, and I don't think on one watch I could put together a remotely coherent theory of everything Powell is trying to convey.  But I will comment on one scene I found particularly interesting.
There's a moment in this where we watch a man watch a woman watch a home movie of himself as a boy, recorded by his father.  The father is not a passive observer, though.  He is tormenting the boy (for a certain purpose that I won't reveal).  As this plays out we feel the man's relief in being able to unburden something traumatic, we feel the woman's apprehension and confusion, we feel revulsion toward the father for his actions, and we feel sympathy toward the child version of the man.  We. Feel.  This is tricky stuff, even more so because by this point we know the man to be a serial murderer, and have already watched him kill, directly and from his own point of view.
So while I agree with those who say the movie is a commentary on the audience as ultimate voyeur, I think it also has a lot to say about the function of the director in the process -- in manipulating our emotions to evoke an intended response, and the power and control inherent in that role (it's no coincidence that in his professional life the killer aspires to be a film director).
Thanks to Charli M for reminding me to check this out.  The copy streaming on the Criterion Channel looks fantastic -- whoever lit those sets was a gifted artist.  The colors are so vibrant in some scenes they just pop off the screen.",4.0
"1960 seems like a great year for movies particularly horror, we had Psycho and this in the same year and later they became an influence over the genre.
I would be lying if I said I was totally frightened by this classic.

But still Peeping Tom is a very dark movie and has it own great moments. It is a very entertaining movie full with interesting things. The film dives deep into the mind of serial killer and explored some interesting topic like voyeurism, fear and trauma.
While they don't fully scared me, some scenes are creepy and totally grasped my attention (particular beacuse of an excellent performance from the lead actor). The last 5 minutes is so damn good! Technical aspect of the movie is top notch with sharp editings, very well built set design and cinematography that gives us some disturbing and stunning images.",3.5

A man scared by experiments his scientist father did to him as a child, films women with a camera, then kills them with a blade hidden at the end of his tripods leg, capturing their moment of death on film. Right off the bat the film goes into Mondo Cinema territory by having him pick up a hooker then killer her all while the camera is rolling. There are a lot of parallels with Psycho, I still say that Psycho has the edge because it actually gets you to root for Norman at one point. This film really makes the camera out to be a machine of terror. This film is Mondo Cinema approved, cheers.",4.0

peeping tom é um exercício de como funciona a mente de um serial killer, básicamente introduz o espectador para dentro dela.
no caso aqui temos mark lewis, um serial killer obcecado pelo voyeurismo, que filma suas vítimas quando elas estão prestes a morrer, para depois assistir inúmeras vezes em casa.
o diretor michael powell faz um trabalho primoroso ao trazer a tona e explorar às origens da compulsão de mark, que se originou durante a sua infância, em uma época que o mesmo era cobaia e sofria experimentos do pai, que era cientista
impossível ignorar o fato de que, talvez, o mark assuma esses dois papéis dentro da sociedade, como uma vítima e também aquele que oprime, visto que, sofreu nas mãos do seu pai e o que se tornou após isso é somente o resultado dessas atrocidades das quais sofreu pelas mãos dele. – é muito contraditório, não? porque você meio que torce para ele não ser descoberto mas também torce para ele não cometer mais nenhum assassinato.
bacana também como podemos ver mais dos medos do mark, sua personalidade e a sua dificuldade em se relacionar com os outros, principalmente sua vizinha, na qual ele se intimida quando está por perto.
os planos sequência são ótimos alternando quando mark está para fazer sua próxima vítima e então para quando ele está cometendo o crime, e assim, logo em seguida, mais tarde, assistindo ao que registrou em sua câmera.
câmera essa que é praticamente onipresente em sua vida, já que o mesmo prática escopofilia, ele não consegue sair sem seus equipamentos, é como se algo estivesse faltando.
num geral, é uma obra recheada de detalhes e conta com um visual sofisticado, o uso das cores contrastando com os detalhes que contém na montagem e as transições, tudo muito bem planejado. inegavelmente é também uma obra que desperta um incômodo mas também instiga muito o espectador a continuar assistindo.",4.0

"Peeping Tom is a groundbreaking mix between drama and serial killer thriller.
Karlheinz Böhm, former Kaiser Franz from the german Sissi films, is very good as serial killer Mark.
His performance is really nuanced, he balances between very shy and psychotic.
Anna Massey as his neighbour is very cute and charming, she has a direct approach but is so sweet while doing it.
What amazed me was the storytelling.
The film gives us little bits of information to figure out why Mark is so twisted.
He's not only evil and sadistic, he suffers from the invisible scars from his childhood.
I found myself rooting for him, I wanted him to stop with the killing and to try a relationship with Helen.
My favourite scene was the second murder, it's so well directed and very exciting.
How his victim dances and fools around while Mark prepares to kill her.
It's very tense and also very dynamic.
Peeping Tom surprised me and was way ahead of it's time.
It's a shame that it destroyed the careeres of Karlheinz Böhm and director Michael Powell, they both showed here how much talent they had.",4.0
"Incredibly influential to a generation of filmmakers so it’s a shame it perhaps doesn’t have the mainstream recognition it so deserves.
Carl Boehm does a great job conveying such a damaged, really sympathetic killer despite all the awful things we see him do. There’s a lot going on with this character and multiple viewings are rewarded. Anna Massey also stands out in a key supporting role.
The film loses me slightly when it deviates away from Boehm and Massey for too long and I don’t feel the clanging piano keys in the score have the same impact as, say, the Herrmann strings in Psycho. 
But for fans of thrillers and serial killer films I’d say this is a must see and highly recommended.",4.0
"En 1960 mismo año que Psycho, en Inglaterra, así como en Estados Unidos, se reflexionaba sobre el acto de mirar. No solo para entender qué se mirá, sino también por qué y para qué. Porque no hay nada más peligroso para el cine que el mirar sin entender, que el ver sin reflexionar, que el hacer sin saber por qué. De ahí, de la peligrosa cinefilia que deviene en enfermedad de Mark, es de donde debemos escapar si no queremos sufrir su mismo destino.

In a film class in college, the professor spoiled the big secret of this movie in a section on camera POV. To the extent that this is the big reveal of the movie, I can only shrug. Maybe ignorance would have been better but I don't see how it hardly matters.
Peeping Tom is not a movie about a peeping tom. It's about a guy who kills women while filming them with an old video camera (or, maybe, just a video camera since it's 1960). The killer is the film's protagonist so we follow him around as he meets women and tries for a bit not to kill them.
For a cult film, I wasn't impressed. I didn't like or particularly loath the main character... and given the ending, I guess I was supposed to have sympathy for him. Some of his backstory is kind of interesting and, for a time, I was kind of wrapped up in the story.
But the film takes long detours as he toys with his victims... and I guess if you found this suspenseful, it'd be a white knuckle film. But I didn't... maybe the film's age and pacing just didn't jibe with me.
As far as POV shots and the ultimate reveal of how he's killing the women... yeah... maybe if I didn't know in advance. But it's a big maybe.
Peeping Tom didn't work for me after all these years of wondering. I couldn't connect with the killer nor did I find his kills interesting... or the mystery of what terrified the women as he, y'know, stalked and murdered them. The icing on the cake seems like a minor detail under the circumstances.

"Peeping Tom is part of what I like to call the “holy trinity of 60’s proto-slashers.” The other two being Psycho and Blood Feast. All 3 shocked audiences upon their release with their dark subject matter, voyeurism or advances of on-screen violence. And I feel confident in saying that there is a little bit of at least one of those three in every slasher to come out since then. But maybe more importantly, Peeping Tom installed one of the cardinal rules of low-budget, exploitation filmmaking:

"Watched on Amazon Video
""Peeping Tom"" meant considerable damage to the careers of both director Michael Powell and lead actor Karlheinz Böhm. Some of the raunchy scenes were too revealing and, above all, it was downright unreasonable at the time of the film's release that the audience should identify with a mentally disturbed serial killer in the leading role. Yet this radical as well as courageous work, which alongside Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" was to signify a key work for the slasher genre and is now revered as a classic of the horror film, is conspicuously restrained as far as explicit details are concerned and, despite some thoroughly oppressive moments, allows the most drastic to emerge in the viewer's mind.
In addition to the precise exploration of the inner life of main character Mark, who is indeed a maniacal killer but is never unilaterally condemned as a cold monster due to his tragic backstory as well as his sensitive affection for Helen, the daughter of the family living in the apartment under him, ""Peeping Tom"" is also a reflection on the compulsion of passionate observation and explores the individual's fascination with fictional scenarios of violence decades before film history actually produced ever more lurid and violent works, which certainly enjoyed an unmanageable audience for a reason. With images that are beautifully composed from the camera angles and settings through the stylish lighting, Powell created a special work together with the haunting acting of his lead actor.
Even if the passage of time has meant that it has always been formally outdone, ""Peeping Tom"" will certainly never lose its status as a co-founder of a sub-genre and stylistic blueprint as well as clear inspiration for quite a few successors.",4.0
"""We both have the key of the door. Mine needs oiling. Yours needs exercise.""
Saw this on the big screen 20 years ago, but rewatching it today Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom' feels so much more like my kind of thing today than back then. This is a true eye candy, Eastmancolor masterpiece, and would probably been just as much the paradigm shift film wise as 'Psycho' was if it hadn't been banned for many years by British censors. 'Peeping Tom''s fascination with the psychological phenomena knows as scoptophilia serves as a carte blanche to go down paths that were probably on the edges of taboo for 1960, but never revelling in it in any overtly exploitative ways. It all seems tame for today's standards, but the craft on display is impeccable and the plot ends up much nearer a modern slasher film than you would probably think. The film is obviously still great, but I would go so far as hailing it as one of the true, unmissable classics of cinema.

Peeping Tom might just be the best British Horror film from the 60's that I have seen, and it is a cinematic crime that the controversy surrounding this film at the time of its release ruined the career of director Michael Powell, who, as others have pointed out, may just have invented the Slasher film.
Its influence on other directors is very apparent: the opening of the film is very similar to the opening of Nicholas Meyer's Time After Time, and I think it's safe to say Brian De Palma loves this movie (just googled to see---yep, he does).
Karlheinz Böhm as Mark, the killer of the title, is the perfect balance of creepy, charming, and repressively intense, in a performance strongly reminiscent of the work of Peter Lorre. Staple of English television Anna Massey takes what could have been a boring young love interest role and makes her Helen a realistic character full of thoughtfulness and compassion.
Peeping Tom was strange for its time, and it's still strange now, while also remaining considerably more emotionally complicated than most any Slasher film since.

"With a cold, curious gaze, we follow the day-to-day happenings of a psychotic killer obsessed with capturing death mask images, in Peeping Tom. Unlike the slashers to come inspired by Psycho, Peeping Tom is far more pathological and far less thrilling, as we play voyeur to a young vicious voyeur.
Thrills nothwithstanding, The Archers took a big risk here, letting the proverbial blood out of a would-be thriller and more passively investigating how trauma can construct a traumatizer; I'm not surprised this film wasn't much of a hit upon its release.
Despite its lack of appeal and slow, passive narrative, I appreciate its bold suggestion. Why do we follow a nervous, insecure killer around? This film is well before exploitive seat fillers; clearly we are meant to appreciate, and possibly sympathize with, the fragile mind of a serial killer.
What serves as the great revelation at the end of Psycho, the glimpse into a killer's twisted psyche, is gently woven into organic exposition midway into the second act of Peeping Tom. Hitchcock made a whole genre with the former, and films like Sinister and The Driller Killer were few and far between, finding inspiration in the latter.

"“The first slasher” is far from the best the genre has to offer, and isn’t even the best slasher of 1960

—————
Often spoken about alongside Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho due to the similar year of release and proto slasher themes, Peeping Tom is far away from Psycho in almost every way. Where Psycho, thrills, shocks, and horrifies, Peeping Tom is mostly just creepy. 
The film follows Mark Lewis, a cute videographer and a misanthrope. He stalks and kills while keeping an innocent and calm demeanor to those around him. The movie slowly follows him as detectives begin to find out what he is up to and as he begins to court Helen Stephens his neighbor. It all plays out a little slow, and it’s hard to understand why. The film feels boring and safe, as very little makes it stand out against contemporaries. 
One of the things it does offer is interesting camera angles and crosshair like camera shots that give the film an uneasy and voyeuristic feel to it. That being said this still pales in comparison to Psycho’s close up shots of blood running down the drain or bodies being wrapped in plastic.
The movie comes to a very predictable conclusion and ends doing much of anything interesting that makes it worth watching nearly 64 years later. Almost everything has since been done better and updated upon, whether that is the opening murder sequence, or the use of film in the making of the movie. It’s all traditional and tame for fans of the genre; and although it’s worth watching for horror die hards who appreciate the growth of the genre, everyone else can skip it.
Overall it’s an old serial killer movie that feels slow and melodramatic in comparison to the best the genre has to offer. Especially as you compare it to Psycho, it pales in comparison as the characters are less interesting and complex, and instead there are a larger variety of characters and less memorable moments. While it may have been shocking and cool upon release, it doesn’t hold up the way other films from the 60s have.",3.0
"Swaps out the stock oedipal conflict of Psycho for something far more horrifying, but far less explicit.
Boehm's performance the fulcrum of it all, his Lewisian dual-act as wounded child and frightening lunk the source of near every moment of dramatic tension.
So tightly wound, so endlessly profound, they don't make 'em like this anymore folks.

"Much better than it sounded based on the summary. The peeping tom is creepy and fascinating and horrifying - while somehow having moments where he's almost appealing. Now that's tough to pull off. There's a fun 'jazzy yet dangerously insane' score, fabulously dressed sets, weird intrigues and a really wild backstory/inciting incident prompting all these voyeur murders.
Did I mention the killer uses a tripod arm with a hidden sharp spike on the end as a murder weapon? I've known some dudes who were REALLY obsessed with photography, and now I'm feeling a little bit suspicious..",3.5

"Karlheinz Böhm said in a interview that there is only two specific performances of his own that he is particularly proud of. One is his portrayal as Helmut Salomon in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film ""Martha"" from 1974. The other is as Mark Lewis in this film. The funny thing is while both performances come across as rather evil maniacal roles they are drastically different and when compared together really can be used as evidence to Böhm's acting abilities. In Martha, I might go as far as to say he is even more evil and terrifying as a abusive controlling husband because there is absolutely no shred of goodness in his character.
As Mark Lewis however, there is a much more complex conflict warring within himself. Böhm is very soft spoken as opposed to his ""Martha"" role, he is quiet, nervous and insecure. He shows compassion to people he respects while others receive his darker side, kind of like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde complex (as in the psychological definition). So needless to say he was nothing short of brilliant.
Micheal Powell's shocker of a film is not as shocking as its history. It's kind of appalling to think of the harsh treatment this film faced when Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (a film one could argue is even more shocking and graphic in its content for that era) premiered the same year to praise.
Peeping Tom is a classic thriller that to be perfectly honest has more depth than Psycho. I'll admit I have Psycho rated a bit higher but that has more to do with how Hitch's story is crafted and visually filmed. Peeping Tom contains more symbolism and metaphors with psychology and film. I mean a horror film about cinema is the perfect combination for any film lover and I frankly love how Powell was able to incorporate that with a serial killer prototype. It creates such a interesting mixture of ideas and genres and ultimately a terrific film.",4.0

"2021’s 174th movie • 77/100
It’s hard to believe this came out in 1960 considering what the plot deals with. I love the fact that Michael Powell liked to challenge himself and be extremely controversial, innovative and memorable when he wanted to. Peeping Tom is a great early example of the many crazy serial killer/mentally ill-people movies that we watch nowadays.
What I like about this movie is how absurdly provocative it is in so many ways. It’s not great because it is simply a great movie, it’s great because of how provocative it is. After so many years since its release, its audaciousness, satirical wit and dazzling color sense still crackle with life.",3.5

I absolutely adored the colour scheme, at a time when most films were still being shot in black and white, this must have felt like a visual overload.
It stays clear of showing any violence or brutality, a product of it's time no doubt but as it was still heavy subject matter it pretty much ended the Director's career.

"Tight, solid conceptually, well-acted and beautifully directed.
Peeping Tom is a fairly rewarding hidden gem of a film, focusing on the psychology of a killer, while having a commentary that is timeless enough to echo todays desire to document and film everything.
The meta commentary was quite solid.
However, It wasn't creepy enough for my liking.
It didn't go deep enough or far enough.
Found this to have a certain same air of cheese that most old bad Hitchcock films have and a tone that almost holds itself back from being serious enough to make the ideas work.
Voyeurism was the new sex in the 1960's but by today's standards, this take on the psychology and POV of a killer is just a little dated.
Mind blown that something so simple and basic ended up ruining Powell's career lol.

"It may come to a surprise to most of you, but I didn't really like Peeping Tom. I did, however, love all the technical aspects. It's all masterfully and meticulously constructed, especially the lighting. Whether it's a wide shot, a medium shot, or a close-up, it was planned that way to make everything look perfect. The same can obviously said for the camera movements. Amazing. What I loved about the film the most, which will come as no surprise, were the costumes (lighting a close second). Colorful and beautiful. Unfortunately, I was bored as a viewer the entire time, and it's not like I was spoiled in any way beforehand.
My short analysis of the film: Everyone in modern times is like the main character. They have to go everywhere with their smartphones, sometimes even filming everything with them, such as concerts! A lot of people are also peeping toms, using the internet to peek into others' lives, although this type of voyeurism is acceptable.

"It is scary to think that this film enraged a continent enough to end the career of a man, and not just any man but one of the most highly respected directors of all time. When I first watched this film, I understood what banned it, but I had no context knowledge to know who Michael Powell was. I thought it was some twenty-five year old chap starting out in the business. When it finally clicked who this man actually was, I knew I had to rewatch this film. And boy, is it better on a second watch.
Pyscho is a horror film for all times and Hitchcock knew what to cut and what to keep to enthrall an audience, but Powell not only lingered on a fully blossoming murder from seed to flower (albeit cutting away before we even see a death) but he placed (some of) it in and near the seedy pornographic store that would later reappear in great numbers, in New York set slashers in 20 years (think Maniac, The New York Ripper, even something non-slasher like The Howling). Essentially, Peeping Tom was too revolutionary for its own good. Sex had to be subdued and murder had to be a mystery. Yet here, not only is our protagonist the killer, but he gets an origin story and a romantic sub-story for tragic purposes. Audiences were just not ready to fill up such big shoes.
Then there is the symbolism, the metaphor for something I'd personally say is Powell's own perfectionism, since our killer wants to make a perfect documentary, going extraordinary lengths to make his footage. This possibly ties in with Powell's own need to go the extra mile (obviously not murder though) to make his films. And of course he sacrifices himself for his own film, if that isn't symbolism then the sky isn't blue.
What a masterpiece. Not only is it important cinema history for building some of the pathways to modern horror, it is psychologically intelligent, emotional and very darkly funny when it satirizes the film industry.",5.0
"“do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? it’s fear.”
Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom pulls back the curtain that an audience so comfortably resides behind, anonymous and hidden in shadows, and embroils us in the voyeurism of his main character, shining the spotlight back at us as we are locked in place and exposed. this film implores one to really pay attention to mannerisms and details while they build the horror-fueled tension not just from the heinous murders being committed, but the harsh reality of Mark Lewis’ so-called profession. he is the camera and he yearns for it - mimicking gestures made by the people who he is watching as if he is recording the movement to himself, kissing the camera lens directly after receiving one himself. Powell summons sympathy for him while properly framing disgust and disdain, meshing tenderness and atrocity in a way that makes the viewer feel foul and overindulgent. it is a film about looking, depicted through the obvious POV live-recording camera angles, but also through in-film cinema reels, reflections, and a general lurking notion from peering-in. and it makes looking an eye-candy galore with vibrant primary colors and wonderful lighting, allowing the viewer to ignore the grime that is covering us as we watch. the camera can be a weapon in interesting and literal ways, and Peeping Tom’s straightforward, yet enthralling presentation of this begs to leave an unforgettable impression. also, the final scene is perfect, and is one of the finest payoffs/relievers of stress in horror/thriller.",4.5
"One of the best horror movies ever made. Gets under your skin using genuine tension instead of cheap jump scares.
Though seen from today's lens ""Mark Lewis"" is too overtly creepy that we would instinctively shy away or if we saw him on the street we'd assume he has a woman tied up in a freezer somewhere.

"I was a bit disappointed by Peeping Tom. While the subject matter feels ahead of its time, and must have pushed boundaries in its day, its style now feels very dated. It’s the story of Mark, a damaged man, abused as a child, trying rather bizarrely to work through his daddy issues by creating a snuff movie. It plays as pulpy nonsense but it’s created with craft. I didn’t find it shocking or interesting enough to really hold my attention, but I did enjoy parts of it including its very black, very British, humour (“well he won’t be doing the crossword tonight!”). I never really bought the tension between Mark’s affection for his neighbour and his callous disregard for other women’s lives. There’s an interesting story in there somewhere about voyeurism, but it trips over the more outlandish elements of the plot. Maybe it’s a film that is best appreciated for its provocative place in film history, or maybe I just wasn’t in the mood. It certainly has craft, and I liked its sound design very much, with its jazzy score making light of the subject matter, and the way the use of sound directs our attention and establishes tension in quite subtle and effective ways. Karlheinz Böhm makes for a striking villain, by turns timid, gentle, cold and ruthless. But he can’t rise above the pulpy nature of the story. It’s by no means bad, but it’s definitely not the subversive masterpiece I was hoping for.

Michael Powell Ranked",3.0
"If ever the subject of Peeping Tom came up, I was always able to engage in the conversation, despite not actually having seen it. I knew that it was directed by Michael Powell and starred Karl Boehm and Anna Massey. I knew that Boehm’s character was a photographer who filmed his female victims at the point of death. I knew that the movie came out in the same year as Hitchcock’s Psycho, with which it is frequently compared. And I knew that it was reviled by critics upon its release, something that all but ended Powell’s inestimable career.
I’m not sure, then, why it took me so long to see a film that I felt pretty familiar with but, hey, I finally succumbed – and it was worth the wait, not least because, on Blu-ray, it probably looks as good as it’s ever done.
And it’s a great film –a genuine work of moviemaking art. And although Powell is long gone, I can’t help feel bad for him, for the flack that he received following Peeping Tom’s release. At least he was later acknowledged and embraced by the likes of Scorsese and Coppola, who championed the film, thus allowing it to be reappraised.
I’ll admit, the way the film starts, I can see where reviewers were coming from. A very uncomfortable point-of-view scene has a Soho prostitute (played by Brenda Bruce) being secretly filmed by an unseen individual. She takes him to her dingy flat, begins to disrobe and then looks in terror as – cut.
We’re spared the gory details, thankfully, but the implication of what happens next and the seedy preamble (the assailant’s approach, the transaction and the would-be assignation) do not make easy viewing material. And then the murderer goes home to watch the event in his private projection room – via a piece of film that will form a part of his wider ‘documentary’. Hell’s teeth, this is very dark stuff indeed.
To be honest, I just don’t think that critics and (possibly) audiences were ready for this kind of thing in 1960. Simply put: Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks were way ahead of their time. Peeping Tom paved the way for the excesses of the Italian giallo and the American Slasher. And yet, it’s an altogether more sophisticated suspenser that has, at its heart, an unusual love story featuring two sympathetic characters: Wendy (Massey) and Mark (Boehm).
Cineaste Mark works as a camera operator at a film studio and as a photographer for smut magazines. In his spare time, he adds ladies of the night to his evolving personal film project. He is a sexual deviant and a murderer but because of the way he’s written and played, it’s hard not to feel pity for him, which I’m guessing is a big reason why critics felt so antsy. Mark’s psychopathy has been cultivated by his father (played by Powell himself). The young boy was an ongoing experiment, so much so that he could only relate to the real world by looking at it through a viewfinder. It’s only when he meets the empathetic Wendy that he realises there’s more to women than sex and death.
And Massey is so likeable as Wendy that it’s easy to see why Mark’s childhood programming becomes so discombobulated. Yes, he is a murderer but one can’t help feel that his appalling upbringing doomed him to a life of terrible transgressions.
Powell and Marks aren’t interested in telling a pat story. Life is full of uncomfortable truths and society is riddled with hypocrisy – and I’m pretty certain that the (mostly) gentleman of the press who attended previews of the film recognised certain of their own peccadilloes in Mark and one or two other characters, such as Miles Malleson’s respectable dirty old man.
It’s not an easy film to watch by any means but Peeping Tom has so much going for it. There are scenes that surprise, such as Moira Shearer’s character’s impromptu dance, which wouldn’t have been out of place in a glossy MGM musical. There’s quite a bit of humour, too, emanating from, for example, the filming of a production-line comedy that Mark is working on. Then there’s Wendy’s mother (played by Maxine Audley) – a blind woman who is able to ‘see’ into Mark’s soul. And the film is beautifully lit and photographed by Otto Heller.
I could go on but if you haven’t seen Peeping Tom and have the slightest interest in the macabre and important British movies, don’t be a dummy (like me) and leave it too long to make your acquaintance with it.",4.5
"Seems to establish the psychosexual motifs that became such a mainstay in slasher films. The camera as a tool of voyeurism, that allows spectators to 'look' instead of just 'see', the camera as a weapon and even phallic substitute. The film embraces all of these ideas and places the viewer in a strange situation, in viewing and looking at these crimes through Marks camera, we develop an unnerving affinity with Mark. The film is beautiful and entertains yet the crimes are ugly, but then do the crimes themselves become a thing of beauty?
Holds up very well still. Great example of a character that is both creepy and pitiful.",4.0

Horroctober presenta:
El asesino detrás de la cámara.
Examinar la mente de un psicópata siempre será tarea difícil, los pensamientos corrosivos y fracturados de estos individuos me causan una fascinación indescriptible. Siempre detonados por traumas y perturbaciones psicológicas.
Peeping Tom comienza presentándonos a nuestro desequilibrado asesino y convirtiéndolo en el protagonista, quitando toda intriga y búsqueda de quién será el temible sanguinario. Ante esta destrucción del misterio, Michael Powell hace una maniobra aún más jugosa: conocer el pasado, sus asesinatos y los pensamientos de Mark Lewis. Acá es donde entra la medida y ansiosa interpretación de Böhm.
Poco acertado sería decir que es un slasher. Va a horizontes más psicológicos, potenciada por una expresión de los escenarios con los que Powell constantemente crea un entorno de sombras y colores. Siempre con nuestro psicópata pegado a su cámara, siendo su principal instrumento para capturar el temor de sus víctimas. Sus filias insanas de las que compartimos su visión subjetiva, viendo a través de esa lente de 16mm.
Siendo una metáfora sobre como utilizamos el cine para desahogar y capturar nuestras inquietudes personales o simplemente una historia de un enfermo mental, lo que queda claro es que Peeping Tom le ha destronado el puesto como mi cinta favorita de este horroctober a la pesadilla de Craven en la calle Elm.

"Hooptober #7! Films from different decades, being the 60s.
A spectacularly crafted British thriller, that has all the beats of similar films about serial killers, except it comes decades earlier than the ones people remember. It is a proto-slasher movie, and very much a horror film to be honest, but it tows the line closest too thriller. It's hard to really say because it wasn't made to be a particular genre as films are later on, but it is definitely a genre film. It resembles a slasher movie in the sense that it did the POV killer shot 14 years before black christmas, and 18 years before Halloween. There's also a gimmick the killer uses which is a slasher franchise keystone, and the body discovery scenes etc are here, it's interesting too watch to be honest. Hard to say if this influenced movies in the 70s that formed slashers, but it should've been watched, all the beats are there except the gore and the kills themselves. It's super tame, no nudity at all funnily enough and there's no blood until the last few minutes really.
It's well filmed, it constantly looks slick and vibrant, the uses of colours can be stunning and effective, the same with the lighting! The direction is sound, the acting is superb! especially Mark and Helen! Mark is portrayed well as a disturbed and childish like man, who has a dark streak that cuts through the bubbly joyful persona, he is clearly ill and afraid of the things he's doing, but he cannot stop. He is the camera you see the whole film through, it only stops if somebody turns it off, and nobody can do that for him since his father has died. The young Helen is smart and inquisitive, she's caring and just wants to get to know Mark, and for him to help write her book. She's the biggest presence in the film other than Mark, her mother looms over the second half of the movie, boy is she something as well.
A great watch! and a big recommend!",4.5
"Halloween 2018 (can't wait!!)
Il y a des petits spoilers dans le commentaire, mais presque rien et c'est même pas vraiment des spoilers; en fait, à mon sens, l'intérêt du film réside ailleurs.
Ok, mais je m'attendais vraiment pas à ça; je sais même pas à quoi je m'attendais, en fait –sûrement plus à un truc dans le genre de Body Double ou de Opera, je pense. Mais pas à ça. Et je sais même pas c'est quoi, ça, parce que tout le long du film, j'ai surtout eu l'impression que Michael Powell devait être très désillusionné par rapport au cinéma à la fin de sa carrière. Il y avait quelque chose de très triste dans le fait de voir ce cinéaste, tout seul, sans son partenaire de longue date, qui faisait un film à la fois sur l'obsession de faire du cinéma et sur l'obsession des spectateurs.trices à voir des personnes [des femmes] mourir à l'écran. Ça rappelait Hitchcock dans un certain sens (et je crois que ce dernier l'a perçu et s'est trouvé malin plus tard, car son Frenzy a quand même beaucoup de similarités avec Peeping Tom, en partant du grain de l'image et en passant par le fait de montrer la personne mourir à l'écran, jusqu'au fait d'avoir repris la même actrice, Anna Massey, qui joue aussi dans Bunny Lake Is Missing, par ailleurs).
Mais je sais pas, il y avait une telle amertume dans le film, ne serait-ce qu'avec cette opposition entre Mark et Helen, et cette ""magic camera"" entre eux, remplie de beautés et de possibilités pour elle et qui constitue cette caméra qui fait émerger à l'écran l'enfant qui est en chaque adulte (quelle belle idée, tout de même), paradoxalement à cette chose pleine de souffrances, de peurs et d'obsessions qu'elle représente pour Mark. Et pourtant, c'est lui qui a du mal à se départir de sa caméra lorsqu'il sort, car d'un coup qu'il croiserait des gens qu'il souhaiterait filmer à leur insu? Et c'est un film qui parle aussi de l'obsession de la justesse à l'écran, de cette recherche de l'authenticité qui amène à vouloir capter des scènes du quotidien dans le dos des gens, mais aussi, dans le pire des cas, qui mène à une forme de cruauté derrière l'écran (par exemple, dans le réalisateur qui fait refaire plus de 100 fois la même prise à son actrice pour une maudite pub, ou dans Mark qui tue des femmes avec sa caméra car il n'est jamais satisfait de leur regard qui s'éteint). Mais alors, que reste-t-il lorsque même les choses qu'on filme et qu'on voit qui sont authentiques n'apparaissent même plus comme telles lors de la captation du moment d'authenticité qu'on attendait tant? C'est très triste d'en arriver là, quand on y pense, et je crois que c'est un peu une de mes hantises en tant que cinéphile, c'est-à-dire que ce qu'il y a à l'écran n'arrive plus à se donner à moi comme une expérience d'authenticité, malgré que je sache depuis toujours que c'est ""arrangé avec le gars des vues"" (parce qu'au final, l'authenticité au cinéma réside ailleurs que dans la réalité de ce qu'on voit, je crois).
Et puis, j'ai aussi trouvé qu'il y avait dans Peeping Tom beaucoup d'intransigeance envers le cinéma d'horreur qui se vautre souvent dans la représentation de la violence et de la torture à l'écran. Les meurtres des femmes, aussi sordides qu'ils soient dans Peeping Tom (pis eille, c'est quand même some fucked up shit qu'il y a dans c'te film-là), ne me sont jamais apparus complaisants ou esthétisés: au contraire, c'était cru, difficile et vraiment malaisant. Et c'était satisfaisant, quand même, ce regard critique que le film portait sur lui-même, surtout dans ce temps d'Halloween où c'est facile, parfois, avec les films d'horreur ou les slashers d'oublier qu'il y a des humains derrière l'écran qui meurent symboliquement pour notre plaisir.
Mais là, je sais plus très bien où j'en étais, je suis déconcentrée, mon cou me fait mal et j'ai du mal à rendre compte de mes impressions de manière tout à fait cohérente, mais ce qui compte vraiment de dire, c'est que c'était quand même tragique comme visionnement, parce qu'on voit ce presqu'adieu de Michael Powell au cinéma se faire dans l'amertume et la sécheresse, et je l'ai vraiment ressenti comme si je voyais le témoignage de quelqu'un qui avait ""fallen out of love"" du cinéma, un peu (et ça, ça fait beaucoup de peine à voir). Mais aussi, en voyant ce film-là, on ne peut pas s'empêcher de se dire que malgré toute la beauté et la richesse qu'on peut trouver dans le cinéma et dans le partage des expériences cinématographiques et cinéphiliques (et y'en a beaucoup, pareil), il reste qu'il y a quand même ce côté sombre, sordide et noir qui peut émerger aussi quand le cinéma fait ressortir, comme chez Mark, ce qu'il y a de pire en nous. C'est pas ben ben beau, tout ça, quand on y pense, mais c'était quand même un film mauditement riche, même si ça m'a fait pas mal peur.",4.5

"Peeping Tom is a perfect example of a movie that was both revered and reviled on release. But it has garnered a more successful reputation as time has gone by, which I am happy about that because it is a very interesting film. It was very ahead of its time, introducing new ideas and some scenes that are quite shocking, which seemingly was what angered those who reviled it at the time.
Peeping Tom is bold, intelligent and above all memorable. It does have some slow, talky stretches and while shocking and suspenseful the opening sequence did give too much away too soon. But.. for a movie that apparently destroyed Powell's career, it is a brilliantly made movie with innovative camera work especially and an appropriately jazzy and haunting score.
Peeping Tom also has fine direction from Powell, a bold intriguing story that benefits particularly from a genuinely unnerving atmosphere and intelligent dialogue. The acting is believable and sympathetic, some underplay but I feel that was the intention. Karlheinz Bohm especially is very effective in the titular role.
Overall, ahead of its time and very good.",4.0

"A man who inherited the house from his father, who was a famous psychologist noted for expertise in studies of fear, works at a film studio as a camera operator and moonlights by selling stills of mostly undressed women to a local magazine/newspaper store. Why he kills women is the question at the center of the film. He's fixated on the trauma he endured because of the experiments his psychologist dad put him through. It may be because of his own interest in studying fear and the cultural assumption that women scream out while men just take it stoically. But the director Michael Powell disabuses that assumption in the conclusion. It looks like it's heading for a happy ending only to reveal what's been going on in this guy's head all along. The focus on photography is evident throughout this film. The guy constantly carries around vintage Bell & Howell movie cameras, and watches his work in his upstairs apartment on a variety of vintage projectors, the kind of which are now long gone, sadly.

Obviously worth it for its Hitchcockian trappings, but also fascinating in the way it channels the tools of filmmaking--the act of filming and looking and capturing human beings on celluloid--into something predatory, lurid, violent. Carl Boehm's lead performance is so compelling; he lives somewhere between a young Jon Voight and Peter Lorre, a broken man succumbing to his trauma-fueled compulsions. A man convinced he can only relate to people through fear, and who can only channel that fear through the camera lens.",4.0

"""I don't trust a man who walks quietly""
One of the few examples in film that the audience at the time of release was just not quite prepared for. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom may have gotten him blacklisted from making films, but he is entirely vindicated by this beautiful visually-surrealistic masterpiece of psychological horror.
An unsettling dive into the voyeuristic lifestyle of a disturbed man with an obsession capturing fear through the lens of a camera. Karlheinz Bohm gives an incredible performance as the complex and scopophillic young man who has a habit of murdering the women he convinces to model for him with a contraption rigged up to a movie-camera so he can rewatch the raw panic displayed before the blade pierces its' victim. Grisly stuff for 1960, and the film is just as suspenseful as your average Hitchcock thriller!
If you are familiar with Powell's (& his long time directing partner, Pressburger) have a proclivity towards using a lot of bright colors that end up causing their films to have a very dreamlike and unique feel to them. This is no different, and I am very excited about the Criterion 4K release that was just announced earlier today, so I can really see this in it's most complete look.
One of the film's strongest aspects is in the way relationships are drawn out throughout the story. Every character is given complexities so that it is difficult to really look at things in a ""good vs. evil"" angle.
Peeping Tom is an incredible film that, along with Psycho (which came out this same year... maybe Powell should've made films in the United States), revolutionized horror film-making to focus more on the psychological aspects of their ""monsters"". Along with some A+ level cinematography, stunning colors, fine acting, and a suspenseful score, Peeping Tom might've been the most unjustly over-looked films ever made at the time of its release.",4.5
"Objectively funny that the Brits were too sensitive at the time to handle that one of their most lush, vibrant, and brilliant dramatic filmmakers was a little bit perverted. But when you know film as well as we (very luckily) do now, you'll know that to be a good filmmaker you must be downright deranged. Freaky. A little sexually fucked up, if you will. A piece of knowledge so commonplace that a movie about Steven Spielberg's oedipal thoughts about his mother was in major Oscar contention-- we now take our freaks for granted.
Truly, a supremely gorgeous entry into the voyeurism canon. And don't take that as the only good point to this -- the narrative itself is rich, riddled with ideas about movies, fame, scopophilia, and sex-- and yes, it's delightfully pulpy and nasty too. Cameras and guns aren't super different -- both shoot, both have crosshairs. Really glad I watched this one.",4.5
"Take me to your cinema.
Maybe the most interesting, and dare I say accurate portrayal of what drives a filmmaker at their core? All filmmakers are voyeurs, and Peeping Tom is one of the best examples of that, almost feels like Powell is calling out other filmmakers for the secret thoughts they all share. The merging of reality and fiction, how far to push it, and what it all means has been on the minds of filmmakers since literally the beginning with Melies and the Lumiere brothers, to Vertov, to the French New Wave, and on. Peeping Tom has those same thoughts about how far is to far, or is there even a limit to the things you should be allowed to film when talking about documenting ""reality"" even when that reality is inherently skewed. Really phenomenal horror film. Should never have ended Michael Powell's career.",4.5

"The morbid urge to gaze. Haunted by memories of the past. Voyeurism and the viewer’s relationship with violence. Every single frame is so vibrant, rich and deeply textured. The type of film you fall in love with the very opening shot and are totally captivated until the final image. Masterpiece.",5.0
"From its opening use of first-person perspective, Peeping Tom collapses our perspective as a viewer into that of its titular voyeur. We are made complicit in his actions as he claims his first victim, watching through his own camera’s lens. You know that you shouldn’t be seeing this, but you can’t look away.
The genius of Michael Powell’s proto slasher is that it gets viewers to turn their own lens inwards. But it does this not just through the sense of complicity that it creates, but moreover in how it balances the audience’s sense of revulsion with a desire to go deeper into the psychology of its protagonist. We are not just complicit by default but are indeed compelled to know more. And this complex complicity poses multiple challenging questions to the viewer on the nature of how we relate to violence on film, but that all ultimately relate back to one key question: does partaking in filmic violence make us, on some level, violent ourselves?
For what it’s worth, I think that juxtaposing the very real violence Mark Lewis creates by night with the artifice of the film set he works on by day answers this clearly enough. What separates Mark from you or me is that to him, the answer to this question is extremely literal. The illusion of cinema isn’t enough. He doesn’t value the boundary between performance and reality; he can only accept the real deal. Surely, he is the first character in one of these voyeuristic thrillers where the camera is a literal penetrative weapon, and he even positions the damn thing like it’s his penis.
Yet Powell doesn’t limit this character to being an incomprehensible creep, but instead one of psychological depth that can even arouse our pity. Peeping Tom understands that men like Mark are a result of their environment, rather than innate evil. There’s a real fatalism to his actions, seemingly following a predetermined path engineered for him by his father. Much of the staying power of the film and character comes this decision to make such a dangerous man someone recognisably human, rather than a one-note caricature. It reminds us that there are damaged people around us, and a tool like a camera can be used to evil ends.
Carl Boehm’s appropriately off-kilter performance also provides another dimension to this character, with the slight German twang to his accent highlighting his slightly alien aura. He combines a sort of David Bowie quality with the energy of an authentic oddball you could meet every day, creating an indelible impression that feels paradoxical in its fusion of the alien and authentic. It serves as another example of how Peeping Tom fuses filmic and psychological language.
This modern psychology of Peeping Tom is mirrored in the ahead-of-their-time stylistic and formal choices. Powell’s film often takes place in the shadows and low light, which is vividly brought to life with unsettling reds, yellows, and greens that evoke seedy desire. The use of Technicolor gives a vibrancy to the imagery here that contrasts heavily with most of the slashers that have followed it yet feels appropriate to the overpowering desire experienced by Mark. Meanwhile, the aforementioned first-person interludes are used sparingly at key moments to create complicity, balanced by a focus on reactions of characters to Mark’s footage. Thus, we contrast our own response to Mark’s work with those that he shoots.
This reflects the ultimate power of Peeping Tom, in how it forces us to examine the how of film, as well as the what. The boundary between the real violence Mark inflicts and the fake violence of traditional filmmaking may be clear in output, but is more murky in method. The fantasies we enjoy are brought into existence by the magic of a camera, and the reality behind this magic trick is all about leveraging control and manipulation to simulate something real. Examined through this lens, a troubling question emerges: is the filmmaking process so fundamentally rooted in domination that Mark is only taking it to its logical extreme?",5.0

"Despite being more than 50 years old, ""Peeping Tom"" still packs a hell of a wallop. It still feels edgy, dangerous. It's a sleazy, chilling portrait of a madman that was so controversial that it torpedoed director Michael Powell's esteemed, distinguished career.
Initially, it's hard to fathom the director of ""The Red Shoes"" and ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" helming a disturbing psychological thriller, but watching ""Peeping Tom"" I found that the movie fits right in with those other works. It's darker (well, marginally darker than ""Red Shoes"", which has some very dark moments) and more violent, but the cinematography is no less stunning. Powell made better use of Technicolor than virtually anyone, and ""Peeping Tom"" is no exception. His colors are grittier than in the other films I've seen of his, as befits the subject matter, but they still pop off the screen. It's almost a shame that this movie is pretty bloodless. I would have loved to see how beautifully red Powell's blood would have been. But, alas, it was a different era, with a different moral code and more restrictions.
Even so, this is a brash, daringly dark film. It feels decades ahead of its time in virtually every way. It came out the same year as ""Psycho"" and, obviously, was overshadowed by Hitchcock's more popular effort. It seems I cannot read about ""Peeping Tom"" without hearing about ""Psycho"" (and I'm guilty of the same thing, sorry about that). But while Hitchcock's brilliant thriller relies on misdirection, twists and a subversion of the very art of cinema, Powell's film is more straightforward and, somehow, more disturbing for it. We know who our villain is from the very beginning. And the movie makes the bold choice of following him, of making him the central figure of the narrative. We don't follow one of his victims. We don't follow him for a while without knowing exactly what he's doing. We know he's killing women and filming it, we know he's a brutal fiend, and yet Powell makes him a sympathetic figure despite being a very chilling one. We learn, early on, the depth of his psychosis, the reasons for his mania. We learn the things that shaped him and realize that this poor bastard never stood a chance. He was doomed from the beginning, used as a lab rat by a brilliant scientist father studying the effects of Fear on the nervous system. Mark Lewis (the central figure of the narrative, brought to life by a riveting performance from Carl Boehm) is, if anything, merely continuing his father's work, expanding upon it in depraved, eerie ways. We see him set up the kills, watch with morbid fascination at the meticulous amount of work he puts into it. Yet we also see that he barely tries to hide what he's doing. He puts virtually no effort into avoiding capture. Mark sees such a thing as inevitable. Not only does he document his kills with the movie camera that seems to grow from him like another appendage, he also documents the police investigation surrounding his murders, at least as much as he is able without arousing too much suspicion. He's a scary figure, but perhaps the scariest thing about him is how fascinating he is, how easily we can understand and even, at times, relate to him despite his atrocities.
Powell makes us an accessory to those atrocities, by using the first person POV vantage point of Mark's camera (amazing, considering that this movie predates ""Halloween"" and all of the slashers that later used this tactic by 18 years or so) and by actually getting us to care for Mark and sympathize with him, despite the ghastly horrors he commits. This is not to say that ""Peeping Tom"" is without surprises. Anything but. Powell wisely hides one of Mark's major tortures from us until the very end, tantalizing us and forcing us to imagine just why these women are so terrified (it's not just the sharp implement coming toward them). By putting us alongside Mark, even in his shoes at some points, Powell seems to be indicting us in this madness. After all, we are watching it. We are eager voyeurs for this gruesome story. We knew what we were getting into, unlike the women Mark preys upon. But even they are not entirely innocent. Mark uses their lust, their greed, their curiosity, even their desire for Fame against them, luring them into situations any rational person should avoid at all costs. But we watch from Mark's perspective. We are here because we have the same desire for Sex and Violence as Mark. It's a major reason we love the cinema in the first place. Powell seems to be rubbing our noses in the filth and depravity that we hunger for, but playfully because, obviously, Powell shares our base desires and, in ""Peeping Tom"" he fulfills them in shocking, chilling ways.
There's genuine emotional suspense here as well. Despite everything, we can't help but hope that Mark is able to redeem himself, that he can perhaps turn away from his sick desires at the last moment. After all, if Mark Lewis can redeem himself, then there's hope for any of us. That alone might be enough to push this movie above ""Psycho"" for me. Norman Bates is a great character, but I never cared as deeply for him as I did for Mark Lewis. I never cared about any of his victims as much as I did for poor, doomed Moira Shearer or Anna Massey. Powell is a less chilly filmmaker than Hitchcock, which is why his humanitarian, distinctly British dramas (particularly the practically perfect ""Col. Blimp"") hit me as hard as they do. He's not quite like any other filmmaker I've encountered, which is why I need to devour all of his work. But that humanitarian streak, that ability to engross us so deeply, and easily, in the lives of his characters makes this foray into dark thriller territory all the more effective. His bold use of color (this fits right in, for me, with the work of Mario Bava, it's practically a giallo) and manipulation of light and shadow (as in virtually every scene set in Mark's screening room, but particularly the scene with the blind woman) also amplifies the story. He also integrates humor in unexpected ways and finds a deep core of humanity even in characters that other filmmakers would make inhuman. ""Peeping Tom"" is incredible, revolutionary work that still feels ahead of its time.",5.0
"do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.
fear. such a desired emotion.
because it's the moment.
maybe moment before death, 'cause there's nothing after the real fear.
but the process itself, the very structure of fear, is such an interesting topic to study, so it seems to our character.
cinema is nothing but voyeurism.
capturing moments, very different, but us always attracts something perverted.
a well-known phenomenon for a long time, but Peeping Tom is the film that started it all.
the camera's a real weapon. it stalks the characters and kills them, capturing their emotions, like a photographer presses a button while taking a picture.
the camera is like an extension of the body, since cameraman acts as a kind of guide between worlds: our reality, where viewers like perverted voyeurs sit in their cozy warm rooms, looking through the guide at the cinematic world, where absolutely anything can happen. any manifestations of fear, violence and horror, and it's satisfying to see all this, knowing full well that in your real stable reality you're safe.
stunning work. in the midst of this frightening atmosphere and suspense, there's a kind of tender, childish revelation here.
is it possible to call the scoptophilia inherent in the main character and such a strong desire to bring the process to fear as a result; a desire to realize his trauma in someone else?
double feature with Psycho in every meaning.
the same story of a psychopath, easily amenable to Freudian psychoanalysis, only in different manifestations.
there's so many things I want to say, but my thoughts are getting tangled, that i don't think i'll ever be able to formulate them

"Makes a great double feature with Psycho, also released in 1960, but very much the superior film — Hitchcock is just in full command of his medium. Thematically, however, voyeurism centers in one of Hitchcock’s other thrillers, the Technicolor marvel Rear Window. Peeping Tom is obviously more indebted to that earlier work than damn near anything.
Peeping Tom stands on its own sharpened tripod legs, however, in its psychoanalysis of the titular scopophiliac himself, Mark Lewis. Though less memorable than his contemporary, Norman Bates, Lewis benefits from being portrayed by a prevaricative Karlheinz Böhm who dominates the screen time in contrast to the murder motel manager. One gets the sense that there’s more going on under the placid lagoons he has for eyes, some childhood trauma or ulterior motive constantly bubbling under the surface. He is a deceptively shallow mensch. Played by a German actor, a Teutonic accent naturally rises to the surface and this post-war, pre-Swinging Sixties London is rife with morbid, scuzzy energies.
Mark Lewis is a stranger in a strange land, though he never left the house he grew up in. His long-dead brilliant father, who tortured and scarred his son in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, was surely some sort of proto-Mengele, rather than Moses. The sort of misery and destruction he’s wrought upon London in the form of calculating, public death is an affront to decency; Lewis claims his victims are mortified to see their own fear before death but I think they’re terrified of others witnessing it post-mortem.
Solid flick, though, plum-full of contemporary anxieties and in-vogue Freudian suggestions. As a progenitor of slasher flicks, it’s a shame most couldn’t live up to this pedigree, but you’ve got everything from Halloween to Scream here.",4.0

So, dass Wochenende war dieses Mal ziemlich vollgepackt und für Michael Powell's revolutionären Horror-Reißer wollte ich mir dann doch etwas mehr Zeit nehmen, da er mich selbst nach einem Rewatch immer noch mit einer gewissen Faszination zurückgelassen hat.
""Peeping Tom"" gilt als einer der größten Horror-Flops der Film-Geschichtsbücher, was vor allem an seinem damals neuen und einzigartigen Konzept lag... den wirklichen ""Horror"" in den Alltag zu transferieren.
Der katcholische Filmdienst zeriss dieses mutige Experiment damals regelrecht mit Worten wie ""Krankhaft, abwegig und peinlich geschmacklos"", was besonders Powell's und Böhm's Karriere damals einen schweren Schlag versetzte... Geldgeber gab's keine mehr und keiner wollte Böhm, einen Helden der deutschen ""Sissi""-Klassiker mehr casten, da ihm der Ruf eines ekelhaften Spanners auch im echten Leben ewig nachhing... verrückte Welt.
Aber dreimal dürft ihr raten, welcher andere wegweisende Horror-Film 3 Monate später mit einem ähnlichen Thema in die Kinos kam und überraschenderweise einen immensen Erfolg feierte... genau, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".
Hitchcock selbst sah ""Peeping Tom"" sogar als Inspiration für sein Meisterwerk und da sich die Zeiten (Buffy sei Dank) manchmal auch zum guten wenden, erhielt Powell im Nachhinein dann doch noch großartige Kritiken zu seinem wegweißenden Risiko-Projekt, die ihn teilweise folgendermaßen beschrieben:
""Peeping Tom"" hat ein unangenehmes Thema, aber doch auch eines, dass sehr spannungsgeladen ist. Michael Powell, dieser äußerst erfahrene Filmemacher, hat ihn mit einem Maximum an technischer Exzellenz und der ganzen Qualität ausgestattet, wozu er fähig ist. Es gibt nicht zu viele Horror-Momente, weil es das Thema selbst ist, das für die emotionale Wucht sorgt.
Aber jetzt mal genug von der traurigen Vergangenheit dieses damals verkannten Klassikers und dessen fatale Einwirkung auf die Karrieren der Beteiligten... worum geht es eigentlich in ""Augen der Angst"" und kann er über 60 Jahre später immer noch überzeugen und schockieren?
Meine Antwort dazu wäre ein ganz klares ""Ja Klar!"", da Alltags-Horror meiner Meinung nach mit etwas Engagement beim schauen IMMER zieht, egal wie alt der Schinken ist!
Mark Lewis ist ein zurückgezogener und kalter Mann, den nichts mehr Fasziniert als das Thema ""Angst"", was aus den unorthodoxen Misshandlungen seines Vaters in Kindeszeiten zurückzuführen ist.
Täglich wurde der kleine Junge mit angst-erfüllenden Situationen konfrontiert, damit sein eigener Vater darüber Bücher schreiben konnte, um anderen Menschen zu helfen... Mark allerdings hat durch diese perversen Prozeduren bleibende Schäden davongetragen.
Sein Haus hat er noch nie ohne seine Hand-Kamera verlassen, mit der er des Nachts eben jene Opfer filmt, die er mit unerwartetem Schrecken und dem anschließenden Tod konfrontiert, die er anschließend in seinem privaten Vorführraum sammelt.
Tagsüber arbeitet er unauffällig in einem Filmstudio als Kamera-Gehilfe und fristet sein routiniertes Dasein so vor sich hin... bis ihm die nette Untermieterin Vivian mit ihrem fröhlichen Wesen bezirzt, wodurch sein Herz scheinbar wieder zu schlagen beginnt und der gebeutelte Junge augenscheinlich endlich wieder so etwas wie ""Gefühle"" entwickelt.
Klingt nach hartem Tobak und das bleibt er auch über die Jahre!
Hier wurde nämlich micht nur mit der ungewöhnlichen Thematik experementiert, auch die Probier-Lust was Kamerawinkel, Ego-Perspektive und gleichzeitiges filmen mit einer Hand-Kamera gilt es hier besonders zu loben und einfach gesagt sieht der Streifen über die Jahre immer noch verflucht gut aus und kann den Zuschauer auch nach all den Jahren noch durch seine dichte Atmosphäre problemlos über seine Laufzeit fesseln.
Böhm's Darstellung dieses gepeinigten Jungen, der gleichzeizig noch einen eiskalten Killer in seinem Körper beherbergt, setzt dem ganzen aber noch die Krone auf!
Seine Taten mögen von grausamster Natur stammen, trotzdem fand ich Mark über weite Strecken ziemlich symphatisch und konnte mich sehr gut in seine Rolle hineinversetzen.
Besonders gefiel mir die Stelle, in der Vivian ihn dazu überredet, seine heiß-geliebte Kamera ausnahmsweise für ihr gemeinsames Date zu Hause zu lassen, woraufhin er zu er zu einem ganz neuen Menschen mutierte und endlich mal ""Freude"" zulassen konnte!
Daran merkt man exzellent, wie sehr seine Dämonen mit dem Elternhaus und eben besagter Kamera verknüpft sind und es ab und zu nur etwas Zuneigung und Spontanität braucht, um aus seinem inneren Gefängnis auszubrechen... hätte ich auch mal wieder nötig.
Das Finale zählt zu meinen absoluten Lieblings-Momenten, wenn es um episch-inszenierte, dramatische Schlusspointen geht, in der sich Mark im Grunde seiner eigenen, größten Angst stellen muss!
Gänsehaut ist hier vorprogrammiert und ich glaube, dass eben jenes Ende auch in der heutigen Zeit den ein oder anderen nicht unbedingt kalt lassen wird.
Powell meinte selber:
""Peeping Tom"" ist ein ganz besonderer, persöhnlicher Film für mich. Der Schmerz, den ich als Folge der Misshandlung des Films erlitten habe, gehört der Vergangenheit an.
Dank Leuten wie Martin Scorsese, der ""Peeping Tom"" zu einen seiner Lieblingsfilme zählt, bekommt Powell nachträglich endlich die Anerkennung, die ihm damals so schmerzlich verwehrt blieb.
Jetzt schreiben Hobby-Kritiker wie ich gewaltige Reviews über seinen Film nieder und überlegen während dem tippen gleichzeitig, die Disc erneut in den Player zu pfeffern um sich nochmal begeistern zu lassen, der Oktober ist ja noch lang!
Ein absolutes Mustsee für jeden Interessenten an Horror-Geschichte, Skandal-Filmen und alten Psycho-Thrillern... an ""Peeping Tom"" kann sich der Zahn der Zeit gerne ausreichend Karies einfangen!

"🇬🇧🎥🔴English review below🔴🎥🇬🇧
Wo der schmale Grat von Kunst und Besessenheit haust, spürt man hier mit dem Fuße den bodenlosen Raum der Gefahr, die aus der Besessenheit stammt.
Angst ist etwas, was wir alle mindestens ein Mal so gefühlt haben, dass nur wir es verstehen würden. Und was dieser Film schafft, sozusagen als ein Großvater des Slashergenres, eine schwierige Geschichte zu erzählen, für die die Gesellschaft 1960 noch nicht bereit war.
Begriffe wie ""Skopophilie"" und ""Sadismus"" oder etwas, was man Dekaden später als ""Snuff-Filme"" bezeichnet, drängten sich aus der Büchse voller Denkanstöße für viele Filme, die diesem Geist nacheiferten: Die meisten sind schlecht und geschmacklos, manche aber sind ausgereifter und großartiger als man es Filmen mit diesen Thematiken zu glauben vermag.
""Peeping Tom"" ist nach dem zweiten Mal der Grund, warum ich Kino liebe, selbst wenn die Aura im Rahmen der eigenen vier Wände etwas verzerrt ist. Das Medium ""Film"" ist nicht nur da um des Filmes wegen, sondern verbaut mit der Kunst des Filmens, zeigt aber auch eine Seite, die einen die Angst einverleibt, je länger man darüber nachdenkt. Die Kamera als Werkzeug für Kunst, als Waffe oder auch als Libido. Es ist vielseitig, was später auch in Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"" in einem anderen Setting erneut aufgegriffen wurde.
Karlheinz Böhm spielt liefert hiermit wohl die beste Performance seiner leider durch diese Rolle in die Brüche gegangenen Karriere und Michael Powell bot als Regisseur wohl eine Antithese zum Image des sinnbefreiten und Kill-geilen Slasherfilmes. Hier haben wir einen äußerst komplexen Charakter als Protagonisten, welcher die beängstigendste, aber zugleich ängstlichste Person ist - und das schon über sein Leben lang.
Und zum Anlass, dass eine 4K-Restaurierung des Films von Leuten wie Martin Scorsese und seiner Stammeditorin, Thelma Schoolmaker, neuerdings herauskam, kann ich sagen, dass diese Restauration wunderbar gelungen ist. Die Farbe Rot ist dezent und stark, aber nicht übersättigt oder erschlagend. Und allgemein: Für einen Film aus dem Jahre 1960, welcher an den Kinokassen durch die Zensur furchtbar gefloppt ist, kann man schon sagen, dass der Film alles hatte, was auch ein gleichaltriger ""Psycho"" auf Lager hatte. Der eine war ein Skandal, aber ein immenser Hit von Anfang an, der andere erlangte den Kultstatus erst in den 1970ern.
Fazit: ""Peeping Tom"" steht Hitchcocks im gleichen Jahr erschienen ""Psycho"" in Nichts nach, was die gesamte Regiearbeit, den Schnitt, die Erzählung und das Schauspiel betrifft.
Es ist nicht der einsteigerfreundlichste Film aufgrund seines gemächlichen Tempos und vielleicht wird es nicht beim ersten Mal gleich so immersiv wirken, aber ich sage eines: Kaum ein Film aus dieser Zeit, wenn er nicht zuvor der Pressevorführung gezeigt und dann zensiert worden wäre, wäre so bahnbrechend gewesen wie ""Peeping Tom"" und das ist er auch heute noch.
—————————————————————————
Where there is a fine line between art and obsession, here you can feel the bottomless space of danger that comes from obsession.
Fear is something we have all felt at least once in a way that only we could understand. And what this movie manages to do, as a grandfather of the slasher genre so to speak, is tell a difficult story that society wasn't ready for in 1960.
Terms like ""scopophilia"" and ""sadism"", or what decades later would be called ""snuff films"", came out of the box full of food for thought for many films that emulated this spirit: most are bad and tasteless, but some are more mature and great than films with these themes would have us believe.
After the second viewing, ""Peeping Tom"" is the reason why I love cinema, even if the aura is somewhat distorted within the confines of my own four walls. The medium of ""film"" is not only there for the sake of the movie, but is also built up with the art of filming, but also shows a side that incorporates fear the longer you think about it. The camera as a tool for art, as a weapon or even as a libido. It is multifaceted, which was later taken up again in Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"" in a different setting.
Karlheinz Böhm delivers what is probably the best performance of his career, which unfortunately fell apart as a result of this role, and Michael Powell as a director probably offered an antithesis to the image of the senseless and kill-happy slasher film. Here we have an extremely complex character as the protagonist, who is the most frightening but at the same time the most fearful person - and has been for his entire life.
And on the occasion that a 4K restoration of the film by the likes of Martin Scorsese and his regular editor, Thelma Schoolmaker, has recently been released, I can say that this restoration has been wonderfully successful. The color red is subtle and strong, but not oversaturated or overwhelming. And in general: for a movie from 1960, which flopped terribly at the box office due to censorship, it's fair to say that the film had everything a ""Psycho"" of the same age had in store. The former was a scandal, but an immense hit from the outset, while the latter only achieved cult status in the 1970s.
Verdict: ""Peeping Tom"" is in no way inferior to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", released in the same year, in terms of overall direction, editing, storytelling and acting.
It's not the most beginner-friendly movie due to its leisurely pace and maybe it won't be as immersive the first time you see it, but I will say this: hardly any movie from that era, if it hadn't been shown to the press screening beforehand and then censored, would have been as groundbreaking as ""Peeping Tom"" and it still is today.",5.0
"As a charismatic horror, Peeping Tom is a textbook example for uni's psychoanalytic film/ theory modules. It also resembles Hitchcock's Rear Window (peeping tom) and Antonioni's Blow-up in terms of mystery, horror, and voyeurism. But Peeping Tom's psychoanalytic, particularly Freudian, themes of childhood trauma, death drive, and fixation are more prominent than the other two films. This is also one of the earliest slasher films without the gruesomeness of its descendants. Carl Boehm delivers a wonderful performance as a compulsive, fragile, and camp young serial killer, Mark, who was traumatised by his scientist father's childhood abuse, i.e. documenting his fear for research success. The experiment of Mark's father very much reminds me of legendary scientists, e.g. Darwin, who are also known to experiment on their sons. Mark has deep conviction in the power of camera to see and document; yet his enduring mission to capture fear with it, perhaps to settle his own triggered by his father, remains an impossible, visual, and self-inflicting task.
Another wonderful performance was given by Anna Massey, who plays a sensitive, intelligent, blind mother of Mark's love interest, Helen. Mrs Stephens can't see, yet her rapt and developed hearing and sensitivity were masterly acted out, esp. when she was afraid. The screenplay by Leo Marks, who is not only a screenwriter but also a cryptographer, is full of twists and surprises. This film's sexual and violent contents were too ahead of its time but perhaps perfectly foreshadowed the societies and disturbed youth's repression in the Roaring 60s well.
The last summation, when Mark has carefully prepared for his own demise by walking under the limelight of his cameras in his dark room before confronting his own death, is a dramatic achievement. Morbid, charming, and sympathetic to those suffering from child abuse and psychoanalytical complicated, Peeping Tom is a cinematic achievement rightly lauded by masters like Scorsese for decades to come.",5.0

The proto-slasher that counted Michael Powell‘s career among its victims. 
The story of Peeping Tom and Psycho coming out the same year with very different consequences for its directors has been talked about for decades because it's still fascinating to this day. 
It’s more of a combination of circumstances than any one thing, but I always come back to thinking about how Peeping Tom doesn’t have any violence in it that come close to being as explicit as in Psycho and yet it was considered a “sickening film” regardless. 
That was done mostly through tone. The POV for almost the entirety of the film is with Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm), the killer and part time softcore-porn photographer. Could that really, be it? The POV in Psycho is only on Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) for brief periods of time, but that’s a different film trying to accomplish different things. The switching POVs in Hitch’s film are part of some of the most brilliant aspects of it while the constant POV in Peeping Tom is part of its own brilliance. Critics being too disturbed by the point of view of Peeping Tom without realizing what that is saying is almost poetic. 
That might not be the only reason either. I also read opinions that Alfred Hitchcock had an unprecedented deal with Psycho where he controlled not only the marketing but distribution of the film. His marketing for it is of course famous, but he also pushed to have the film as widely released as quickly as possible negating what critics had to say about it. In other words, bad reviews couldn’t hurt the box office because everyone was already seeing the film and word of mouth caught on. The film did get its share of bad reviews, but not as much as Peeping Tom. There’s an argument to be made that some critics didn’t want to give a film that was already a hit a bad review as that would have shown them to be out of touch. 
Powell had no such rights with Peeping Tom. Some point out that the film was less of a career killer and more of a “final nail” in it. Either way, critics were not nice on a film that they either did not understand or one that made them feel too uneasy to understand. 
Of course, the headline that Peeping Tom killed Powell’s career with no context is more dramatic.

"""I have always felt that Peeping Tom and 8½ say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two, 8½ captures the glamour and enjoyment of film-making, while Peeping Tom shows the aggression of it, how the camera violates. From studying them you can discover everything about people who make films, or at least people who express themselves through films.""

Peeping Tom released in the same year as Psycho. The parallels between the 2 are undeniable, between the influence of the slasher subgenre to the meta subtext on voyeurism. However, while the latter enjoyed success and is considered an iconic staple in pop culture, Peeping Tom got shammed and ended the career of its director. That's exactly what sets these films apart.
Psycho is a film that suffers from being unable to fully commit to its subversion, often resorting to appeal to the audience. On the other hand, Peeping Tom is completely confrontational on its stance of the audience. It's an unsettling exploration of our voyeuristic tendencies and aligns ourselves with the troubled protagonist.
Michael Powell (and his usual collaborater Emeric Pressburger who was absent here) is someone that I have been meaning to explore. From this film alone, I can see how much of a craftsman and revolutionary director he was. To be able to well execute a smart risk like this requires some talent but also a lot of courage. It's insane how this film and its multitude of ideas have become more and more relevant overtime.

"داستان یک قاتل سریالی روان‌پریش که هنگام کشتن زنان از آن‌ها فیلم‌برداری می‌کند، با این انگیزه که حالت چهره و ترس‌‌شان را هنگام مواجهه با مرگ ضبط کند...
مارک، دستیار فیلمبردار وعکاس پورنوگرافیکی است که دارای انحراف روانی چشم چرانی است، او از تجربه جنسی طبیعی وامانده و تنها از راه دید زدن ارضا می شود. در طول فیلم ما وابستگی غیرمعمول و فتیش‌گونه‌ی کاراکتر به دوربین را شاهدیم. گویی این شیء جزئی جدایی ناپذیر از بدن او شده و به ابزار چشم چرانی و جایگزینی برای فقدان آلت تناسلی‌اش بدل گردیده است. در جایی از فیلم که همسایه طبقه پایین او، هلن، به‌طور غیرمنتظره‌ای او را می‌بوسد، او (با تاخیر) به لنز بوسه می‌زند تا به واسطه‌ی شی یی به نام دوربین بتواند لذت جنسی را تجربه کند.
دوربین در فیلم پاول متجاوز است، وسیله‌ی قتل و ارضای یک بیمار جنسی است‌ که گاها در صحنه‌ی جنایت ابزار فیلمبرداری به طور عامدانه شکل آلت مردانه را که آماده برای تجاوز است تداعی می‌کند. فیلم پر از نماهای ذهنی هدفمند است و مخاطب غالب اتفاقات فیلم را از نقطه‌ی دید مارک دنبال می‌کند. در صحنه‌های قتل‌، زمانیکه مارک به قربانیان خود نزدیک می‌شود و از لنز دوربین آن‌ها را تماشا می‌کند، دید بیننده نیز به منظره‌یابِ دوربین منتقل می‌شود تا او نیز در لذتِ چشم چرانی و شکارِ سوژه با مارک همراه شود. گویی لنز دوربین، دوربینِ هدف گیریِ نصب شده روی یک اسلحه است که به دنبال قربانی می‌گردد. بدین شکل یک همسانی بین لنز دوربین، نقطه نظر قاتل و نگاه تماشاگر برقرار می‌شود. در واقع پاول هم بازیگر جلوی دوربین‌ش، هم فیلمبردار پشت دوربین ش و هم تماشاگر را وادار می‌کند در شمایل یک بیمار روانی چشم‌چرانی کنند و قتل و جنایت مرتکب شوند.
در لایه ی اولیه، داستان فیلم درباره‌ی مرد قاتلی است که از سوء استفاده‌ی دوران کودکی به دست پدرش جان سالم به در برده (با ورود شخصیت هلن، بخشی از کودکی مارک آشکار می شود که در آن پدرش در مقام یک روانپزشک سلطه‌گر از طریق آزمایشاتش باعث آزار مارک، و زمینه ساز رفتارهای او در زمان حال شده است)، اما در حقیقت استعاره ای است از رابطه تماشاگر با سینما. این موضوع در صحنه ای آشکار می شود که مارک با روانپزشکی که پدرش را می شناخته صحبت می‌کند. روانپزشک در مورد فتیشِ اسکوپوفیلیک صحبت می کند، لذتی که نه فقط مارک، بلکه همه‌ی ما از چشم چرانی به دست می‌آوریم. و به همین دلیل است که هرگز از تماشای فیلم پشیمان نیستیم.
پایان فیلم یعنی نزدیک شدن به پایان مستندی که مارک در حال ساختش است. تماشاگر متوجه می‌شود آنچه به تماشای آن نشسته است، مستندی دهشتناک و خونین بوده در مورد قاتلی بیمار که در حال سلاخی زنان است، قاتلی که تلاش می‌کند تا چهره‌‌ی مرگ‌ را به قربانیان خود نشان دهد. در صحنه ی پایانی، مارک که وحشت زده است و می‌داند راه فراری نخواهد داشت، تصمیم می‌گیرد همانند قربانیانش با ترس خود رو در رو شود، او دست به خود ویرانگری می‌زند و خود را قربانی آلتِ قتاله‌ی خویش می‌سازد. پاول در جایی گفته بود: «فیلم درباره‌ی یک قاتل شیطان صفت نیست، درباره‌ی یک فیلمبردار است.» حتی در یکی از پوسترهای تبلیغاتی فیلم هم نوشته شده بود: «چه چیزی این( دوربین) را به شیطانی‌ترین سلاحِ قتلِ استفاده شده تبدیل کرده است؟»
آیا قهرمان فیلم پاول انسان خجول و گوشه گیری است که دوربین به مثابه‌ی رسانه به او قدرت هیولا شدن می‌دهد؟ و آیا در نهایت این رسانه (دوربین) است که مارک را قربانی خویش می‌نماید؟",4.5

"a deeply disturbing and sophisticated critique of the male gaze and a thematic continuation of rear window and vertigo. some may say that a camera objectively documents the truth, but i think that we can all agree that it can very easily be influenced by the man behind it. and if the man is a perverted individual then the camera transforms into a weapon, women become objects and violence becomes perverted and cheap entertainment. the eye of the filmmaker becomes the camera and as a result the audience sees the world in the exact same, sadomasochistic way the filmmaker does. powell had already explored the danger of art in his masterpiece the red shoes, and here he(in the same year hitchcock did with psycho)gives birth to the slasher genre, by literally exposing the dangers of the genre and deconstructing it. the vibrant use of colour weirdly makes the whole thing feel even more dark and disturbing. i don't know if this is the first movie to ever use the killer's pov shot(made famous in halloween), but this is definitely the movie that added a whole new layer into the shot, the sacrifice of privacy in the name of sick pleasure. it still kind of feels relevant, which makes the whole thing even more scary.

Robert Powell's Peeping Tom is a movie you've heard of when you're a fan of horror or classic movies. The movie that was too much for it's time, and ended his director's career. I said it before, I'm a big fan of older horror movies. And Peeping Tom is a lot more innovative than I thought it would be. The movie could be easily from the 80's.
The lighting and the colours are absolutely amazing. The score is great and really sucks you in.

What a great film this is...
Mark on the surface we seen him as a shy man. He talks sweet, he is in his own world. But he has a secret, an obsession which he can't make go away. A trauma that he himself is haunted by.
Peeping Tom is something groundbreaking in cinema itself. The subject itself at that time of matter. Even though Mark is the protagonist, we can also say his camera is in supporting.
We are seeing lives through that. the tracking, the fear. Seeing death in the mirror is something more than frightening. Michael Powell, intelligently handles every scenario and detail of this movie with a beauty.
The scenes with Mark and Helen showing Mark trying to resist his temptations and opening upto someone about his nature. Showing his fathers experiments on him, how Mark was like a test subject. You can even see how Mark is become who he is. When he is showing his fathers old video recordings he is telling a story about each shot, how his father was feeling his grief over his mothers death or even when his father brings a new woman in his life.
Mark's persona can also be trying to achieve something for his father. Something he left unfinished and trying to finish it for him. The POV shots of this movie are brilliantly taken.
I can see why Scorsese considers this movie as one his favorites, It is a masterpiece, an expression to human persona, a film capturing itself.",5.0
"Frankly, I love watching perverts in action.
Let me clarify what I mean by love. While I am watching a film like Peeping Tom, an excellent work from 1960 by director Michael Powell, I'm not in my living room cheering on the troubled subject in the film, nor am I finding some sort of unsettling sexual satisfaction due to their actions. No, when I say love in this regard I simply mean that I am completely fascinated by character studies of this manner and the tone of such films typically works wonders for me.
Despite my preconception to embrace such a film, absolutely nothing is guaranteed once the first frame appears on screen. Plenty of films have dabbled in the world of perversion and deviant sexual behavior, so it isn't some new subject matter that will automatically keep me invested. When it all comes together though, when cinema is willing to dive head first into the darkness and swim around with depraved, disturbed characters, those are the types of films that I mark on the calendar and count down the days until I have the opportunity to lay eyes on such a work.
Peeping Tom is a wonderful example of how good it feels to explore the depths of evil.
Right off the bat I knew I was going to admire the film when it kicks off from the perspective of looking through someones personal camera as it approaches an unsuspecting woman on the street. It is amazing how effective this technique is compared to simply filming a man approaching a woman in an ominous way, because the first thing I thought of was how delightfully wrong it all felt. Only a few minutes into a film and this voyeuristic approach had me feeling uncomfortable thanks to the enhanced realism, as if a work of fiction had been transformed into a documentary I shouldn't be watching.
An even bigger credit to this aspect of the film is that it isn't any less jarring as the narrative progresses and the technique is used repeatedly. In fact, it becomes even more unsettling once we witness the initial murder first hand because after that moment, even if we seem to be watching something fun and innocent, through this lens it is dripping with danger.
The casting of Karlheinz Bohm as the lead was an inspired choice. In fact it is downright perfect because his look alone fits the bill of exactly what scares me the most about the concept of a peeping tom. Bohm as Mark Lewis is just normal enough for him to blend in and even earn the trust of his peers, yet he also emits the absolute right amount of creepy to make you wonder about him in the back of your mind, even if for just a split second. We learn as the film progresses that while we technically can never be 100 percent sure of whether he was born with a level of evil lurking inside his soul, it is clear that the very unhealthy and downright off-putting relationship with his father is what brought his perversions to the surface. Through various psychological experiments conducted to study fear and the nervous system, along with the observation that his old man embraced his desire to film moments worthy of privacy, Mark Lewis became the man he is today, a man that I hope to never encounter, a character realistic enough for me to realize I unfortunately just might.
Peeping Tom was released 54 years ago, and it seems to be a work that was ahead of its time. Released during an era where such topics were controversial, the film was initially trashed by critics and the career of director Michael Powell went off the rails as a result. Seeing it now in 2014, I admire the fact that what was crafted so long ago isn't even remotely dated, playing even more relevant today as we are still attempting to understand the intricacies and terrifying realities of mental illness and sexually charged crimes.
A great film that deserves the credit it finally earned over time.",4.5

"God, it's just been one great film after another for me lately. This is what I get for using Letterboxd's top 250 horror list as a watchlist and not something to just ignore.
Peeping Tom is strangely not about a perverted man named Tom (which is naturally what one'd expect) but from a far more timid, albeit nonetheless murderous, Mark. Stuck behind his camera, peering though the world via lens, Mark has (unsurprisingly) become somewhat stunted in the social department — stuttering through conversations and quickly dismissing himself to go watch his films in the dark of his room. Hey! I understand — which film nerd can't relate. 
But the films Mark watches aren't innocent, No. Rather, he relives the terror of those whom he's killed — especially savouring their frightened facial expressions. It's this fear that unlocks his impulses, that drives him to these acts. Perhaps there's an intimacy in such raw expressions that he desires; perhaps such screams seem comfortable compared to the abusive past he suffered at the hands of his experimental father. What ever the reason, he's trapped inside his habits and we, the audience, are trapped there with him.
Peeping Tom makes fantastic use of the POV shot — one of the first instances of the audience consistently placed in the eyes of the villain. We too, see Mark's world through a lens — and oh what a gorgeous lens it is. Technicolour horror movies are an absolute blessing because its glow comes through everywhere — from Mark simply sitting in a dark room to a rather large Hollywood set. We're able to feel the appeal of the screen in the film's very presentation. The attraction of horror too, as bodies are neatly obscured away from the camera lens. 
The film's central story revolves Mark's budding romance with his kind hearted neighbour Helen, whose blissfully unaware of Mark's destructive ways. However, maybe in connection — in putting that camera away and venturing out into the world — our peeping (or in this case. more peering) Tom can be balanced by some true experiences. It sure is better to be documented than to document. 
As lavish as the colour palette is, Peeping Tom still holds strong in its horror fair; however, perhaps in a balance between  its serial killer story and a more psychological struggle. Even now, Mark's story remains relevant. How often to we leave our rooms and homes without our technology (especially our phones, our lenses to the world). How drawn are we to horror? And I don't mean the genre, I mean the horror in the world — the 'content' that makes us feel bad. How often do we sit and consume and connect ourselves with this horror so much that we're one step from becoming complicit in it ourselves?
Like Mark, I think we all need a Helen — a grounded, caring friend to haul us out of the darkness, encourage us to throw off our lenses (if just for a minute), and watch the world and live above all else.",4.0

I thought I had seen this before, but this was an entirely new experience, and it was excellent. You can clearly see how much thrillers would take from this film, for me it was interesting to see what this film took from M. The killer especially reminded me of Peter Lorre in that film. In general though this was a fascinating film, in both its psychological and visual elements.
Visually it’s really interesting and I quite enjoyed the look. It has an impressive use of lighting, the camera movement is impressive. From framing to spacing, the cinematography was quite good. The music was fitting to the film. I particularly found the home films music to be perfect. It gave them a silent film sound, which made sense for how he watched them.
The acting was pretty good overall, but it’s Karlheinz Böhm as Mark that really elevates the film. He is both sensitive, charming, creepy, and disturbing. The film really portrays him in a very sympathetic light, especially as you learn more about him, still a psychopath but you can understand why he is that way. Maxine Audley as the mother was also quite good, even in her small role.
It’s truly a fascinating film, it evolves into something more than just a thriller with a killer. The psychological aspects though are what really set this film apart. From the psychology of the killer, to his father, and what it says about voyeurism and us in the audience. It truly is an excellent film, and obviously for 1960 truly groundbreaking in so many ways.
Anyways I highly recommend the film, it’s a recognizable classic for many reasons. Definitely a must watch, interesting in so many ways, that final kill and the reveal are brilliant. I too would be terrified if I had to see myself at the end. Böhm really is fantastic in this film though and one of the most memorable killers in film, that is just a human.",4.0
"Horror changed in 1960. More so than any other year. Sure, Hitch's little nasty gem about a nerd with oedipal issues may have been more influential on the mainstream, but watching Michael Powell's nasty little number now (for the first time I might add), its difficult to argue that it hasn't been the more influential on horror that actually wants to be about something.....
The joy of it isn't really in the surface - Karl Bohm as the shy, quiet man with a camera going about capturing what fear looks like in his trusty camera as he skewers all manner of women across swinging London - but more in what's underneath: the twisted relationship between man and camera, the watcher and the being watched, the antagonist and the audience, suddenly at one, its a beautiful and incredibly insightful look into the increasing pervasiveness of 'watching', something in today's society that has even more terrifying resonance.
Bohm's job in cinema even lets this breathe on multiple levels - the notion of cinema as little more than titillating voyeurism, yet how it can seep into the minds of those consumed by it, the addiction of those who elect to spend more time looking through a viewfinder or a lens than at the actual world around them......
Sure, the kills are teased and brutal but nothing on the level of Hitch's masterpiece so one can only surmise that the poisonous reaction to the release of this was due to how uncomfortable it made people feel because of what it suggested. Pausing to make an audience look back at itself, at its own complicity in what its watching, in its ongoing thirst for more and more spectacle and at what cost.
Every bit the classic its now recognised as, Peeping Tom is where that godawful term 'elevated horror' was born. Horror being about something and the notion of 'meta' on a level other than cheap throw away gags began in those seedy backstreets of 1960s London.......

"“Are you crazy?”
“Yes, do you think they’ll notice?”
Arriving the same year as Psycho, but having more in common with Rear Window, Peeping Tom is tale of voyeurism, trauma, and murder. Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is a quiet loner who films everything in his life. During the day he works as part of a film crew, in the evening he films softcore pinup shots, and in his spare time he films women before impaling them on his tripod, hoping to capture the moment of true fear when they know they are going to die.
One night he meets Helen Stevens (Anna Massey), his inquisitive and friendly downstairs neighbor. As they get to know each other, it begins to seem possible that Mark could have a normal life. He shows her films from his childhood, one full of fear and torture at the hands of his father, a doctor researching the nature of fear. It is the familiar tale of the sins of the father echoing in his child’s life; trauma begetting trauma. Mark is well acted by Boehm, who plays him as soft spoken, detached, and just a bit off. But not so far gone that he can’t be redeemed; I found myself really rooting for Helen to help him make peace with his past.
I was reminded of other serial killers making art movies like A Bucket of Blood or The House That Jack Built. There are a lot of clever visual indications that Mark is only capable of seeing the world through the lens of his cameras. There are a number of first person perspective shots and a very striking image of Mark’s eyes through the spinning reel of his projector. It all comes together nicely for an excellent, very stylish proto-slasher.

"Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.

Poweel's film is one of those that best use the cinematographic code to speak of itself. He puts us in the voyeuristic position that the seventh art itself is, along with its main character: The spectator sits in a chair inside a cinema, inside a dark room, watching other people's lives. This is the proposal of the audivisual and of a cinematographic construction in essence.
The protagonist's journey of horrors, within his troubled life and his devastated childhood, has as its main function and his job to do what cinema directors want when making their works: Observe the reaction of the audience. He is the man behind the camera, who shoots the scenes of the films, observes everything that is happening. When he begins to perform his nefarious acts, his toil is mixed with his personal life, with his disturbed mind and with the camera in his hand. His life is a film in constant motion, and he wants his victims to be part of his set design. His fetishism for filming is so big that, in a scene where he receives a kiss, he responds by kissing the lens of a camera. His body craves the camera and is governed by it.
A striking feature of the director is that his films have a wealth of colors in each scene, as if they were alive and shining within the scene, contrasting with the film genre in which he proposed, which has murders and macabre sequences, in addition to have a flood of details in each shot and a formalism that complements and pays homage to Hitchcock.  
The protagonist looks so much like the mythical Norman Bates that one complements the other. The difference is that, in Psycho, the macabre appears more abruptly, while in Powell's film, there is greater elegance and stylization within the horror.",4.0
"This review may contain spoilers!
What a fantastic film! Peeping Tom is infamously known as the film which killed the career of it's director, Michael Powell. This is very ironic, especially considering that Peeping Tom is one of Powell's final masterpieces. Peeping Tom is an interesting depiction of fear, voyeurism and the shockingly perverse.
The film tells the story of Mark Lewis, an aspiring film-maker who works as a member of a film crew by day. However, by night, Lewis is a serial killer with an obsession with filming almost everything he sees and those that he kills. Peeping Tom has a fantastic script with a fascinating story. It is more disturbing that scary but still packs an incredible punch. It uses some fantastic story telling techniques, including the changing of perspectives. Peeping Tom makes voyeurs of it's audience. Mark's camera violates the space of his victims, usually young women. The perspective changes so that we see things from the killer's point of view through his camera. It is almost like the audience is the killer taking away an innocent life. However, we don't see everything. The fact that Peeping Tom makes voyeurs of it's audience makes us want to see more despite the fact that condemn ourselves for doing so. Peeping Tom also explores sexual repression through it's subplot of Mark's side job producing soft-core porn. It blurs the lines between Mark's obsessive behaviour and his sexual aggression. The dialogue in Peeping Tom is brilliant as well as really smart.
The film has a brilliant cast which is led by a sublime lead performance. Karlheinz Bohm is terrific as Mark. He balances both sides of the character incredibly well. He plays the character as two sides of the same coin: The shy young man and the calculated killer. Anna Massey is wonderful as the film's heroine. Her performance is perfectly judged, especially in the final 20 or so minutes of the film. She realises the curiousness of the character really well. Moira Shearer also makes an appearance as a fun character who meets a grisly end. The rest of the cast all give very strong performances. All are given some great scenes and moments to shine.
Michael Powell's direction, as to be expected, is terrific. It perfectly displays his calm and collected approach to filmmaking. His composition of each scene is wonderful and his use of colour is incredibly striking. I love how he allows the shot to linger on people seeing things but doesn't show us what is being seen. It editing is brilliantly done and, at times, harsh. The music is sparsely used by when it is, it adds a creepy and unnerving atmosphere.
Overall, Peeping Tom is a brilliant film and an essential watch. It is one of the very best examinations of the inner workings of a psychopath's mind. The story telling is fantastic. The cast all deliver terrific performances and Powell's direction is masterful. Its far to say that Peeping Tom pretty much ended Michael Powell's career and was vilified by critics. I'm pleased that Peeping Tom has at last been recognised as the great film that it is. 1960 was an important year for horror with Peeping Tom and Hitchcock's Psycho being released within months of each other. Whilst I think that Peeping Tom is a bit weaker than Psycho, I still think that it is an absolute gem of a film and an exceptional piece of filmmaking. Highly recommended!",4.5

"Mark Lewis: Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.
It's really a wonder to me that such a disturbing film like Peeping Tom could air in 1960, a time where horror and violence was still avoided and minimized for the public.
From the very first scene, we get a terrifying introduction of our psycho character Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm), your typical shy, good-looking yet disturbed guy who'd rather offer you milk that water. His technique in killing his victims, and the fact he uses a camera, is frightening. But I think that the most sinister aspect is when he explains the reason he uses that specific way to kill. Trully a chilling sequence.
And it's not just Mark Lewis that makes Peeping Tom such a unsettling film. We learn that his father was already an unstable man, filming little Mark as he experiments on his child with questionable ways to make him scared or crying. Those footages made me think a lot about Sinister, so you can imagine how creepy those scenes can be if you've ever seen that film.
Peeping Tom is also a very, very horny film. The fact that it starts with the murder of a prostitute is already a solid proof, and also that Mark's victims are all females. But later on, there were so many subtle sexual dialogues, I couldn't help myself again but wonder how could that film air.
Such a frightening experience! I can only admire Michael Powell's success in delivering such a disturbing story. Probably the film that launched or heavely inspired the creepy pictures we see nowadays.

"I really enjoyed this—I love how the camera interacts not just with the characters but with their very thoughts, fears, and emotions. A great statement to the obtrusive nature of film and the psychological damage done by constant scrutiny. This is a film about trauma—living with it, creating it, and relishing in it. What happens when one gives in completely to their impulses and removes themselves from the realm of reality? Perhaps the acting could be improved, but the film itself makes a fantastic statement.

Watching this for the first time had me on the edge of my seat and quite disturbed by the end.

"Michael Powell’s classic thriller in which a young man murders women using a movie camera to film their dying expressions of terror. Starring Karlheinz Böhm, Moira Shearer and Anna Massey.
At the time of its release, Peeping Tom received very, very bad reviews and effectively ended the career of acclaimed director Michael Powell, whose best work was done was in the nineteen-forties, with his frequent collaborator Emeric Pressburger.
Now, Peeping Tom is regarded to be the director’s sole masterpiece.
The first time I watched this, I was absolutely against this film, but now having had another look, I can understand why its reputation has considerably grown over the years.
The story concerns recluse Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) works at a movie studio in the day and, at night, takes lewd photographs of women. Also, he's producing a documentary on terror, which involves recording the responses of targets as he kills them.
He helps Helen (Anna Massey), the daughter of the family living in the room below his, and he tells her imprecisely about the film he is creating. She quietly goes into Mark’s room to view it and is terrified by what she witnesses – particularly when Mark spots her.
Karlheinz Böhm gives a very good performance in his role as Mark Lewis, the young man who gets the frightening responses to women as he kills them while working on his project at the same time.
Elsewhere, Anna Massey and Moira Shearer are both decent in their respective roles as Helen and Vivian. Helen is the woman who is terrified to find out what Mark is up to, while Vivian is the stand-in at the film studio.
The direction from Powell is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a tense atmosphere happening as well and the script is written to a decent standard by Leo Marks as he makes the movie good to follow.
The camera stands out best in terms of the technical aspects, because it makes good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status.
I am so glad that I gave this movie another go – I really am.
Overall, Peeping Tom is a very decent British thriller, due to the good performances, direction, script, tense atmosphere and dramatic moments. A very underrated gem.",4.0

There's a lot going on here but I think two things are the most interesting, mainly the fact that Mark's sadism was passed down from his fathers toxic masculinity, but ALSO the way the movie critiques the lengths male directors will go for their ""art"" at the expense of women really marks the movie as ahead of its time. The fact that Moira Shearer, shown in the movie to be a legitimately great talent, is snuffed out in order to serve Mark's Artistic Process™ echoes the trials and tribulations endured by Hitchcock's women, Kubrick's torture of Shelly Duvall, Bertolucci's violation of Maria Schneider, etcetera etcetera. 
But fuck, it's hard not to feel for Mark a bit, especially at the end. He's a Frankenstein's Monster of Toxic Masculinity in the Arts.",4.0

"Is it bad that I see myself as having a lot in common with this character? Watching this at either most or least opportune time, I realized that I’m essentially the same kind of lonely weirdo, watching movies all day, little to no outside contact, and always working on “my documentary.” Of course, I don’t kill people, but that’s just one small difference...
But this seems to be Powell’s goal with this film. It has all the perversion of Hitchcock or Giallo, yet none of the tension. Instead it’s replaced by a formal deconstruction of how we watch movies and people. The killer is a “peeping Tom” with a presumptive diagnosis of “scoptophilia” where he has obsession with looking at people in intimate situations. Powell puts us in the killer’s perspective through the act of filmmaking as we see our “Tom” murdering victims through his the camera and by extension his POV. In this sense, we are the same as the killer. We are culpable. Because Mark isn’t the only person in need to peer in on other people’s lives. The cops follow suspects in their investigations and Mark’s neighbor practically inserts herself into his life. We are all lonely curious creepers and Powell expertly uses the medium itself to demonstrate.
Other aspects of the film, like the plotting and pacing, aren’t on the level of genre masters like Hitchcock. Even with it’s beautifully colorful visuals and demented melodrama that makes this enjoyably off-putting, you can tell Powell’s strong suit isn’t pulp. But he uses the genre to turn the camera on the audience so they are forced to inspect their own creepy tendencies. I should probably go take walk.

Such an unsettling and fascinating film that was ahead of its time.,0.0
"The year is 1960. Janet Leigh takes a shower at the Bates Motel when a knife-wielding silhouette appears on the other side of the shower curtain. You already know what happens next, of course, because it's one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. Hailed by many as the greatest horror film of all-time and often cited as the genesis of the slasher sub-genre, Psycho was an enormous success, popular fifty years ago, still popular today. Yet months before Norman Bates put on a wig and a dress, a very similar film named Peeping Tom was lambasted by critics. Unlike Hitchcock, who received a boon to his career, Michael Powell, the director of Peeping Tom, suffered career suicide. One critic, Derek Hill, said the film should be ""thrown into a sewer."" Another critic, Len Mosley, said the film ""is more depressing and nauseating than the leper colonies of East Pakistan, the back streets of Bombay and the gutters of Calcutta."" Over the years, Peeping Tom has been rediscovered, re-evaluated and reappraised. As a result, its critical reputation has soared, yet it still stands in the shadow of Hitchcock's beloved classic. That's unfortunate, since Peeping Tom is just as revolutionary, just as magnificent, and, in some ways, even superior to Psycho.
At first glance it might be easy to confuse Mark Lewis, the ""psycho"" of Peeping Tom, with household name Norman Bates. They're both shy, soft spoken, uncomfortable in social situations and awkward around the opposite sex. They're victims of bad parenting. They share voyeuristic urges and a penchant for murder. But through Mark's budding relationship with Helen, the meek, redheaded young woman who rents the apartment beneath his own, we see a tender, boyish, loving side to his character that paints him in a more sympathetic light than Norman Bates. Mark is damaged, but he's human: part murderer, part victim. Unlike Norman, Mark is aware of his mental illness and expresses a desire to cure himself. Despite his horrible crimes, I found myself rooting for Mark's well-being. When he tries to secretly film the murder investigation of one of his victims and accidentally alerts authorities to his presence, I held my breath not just because of the tension of the scene, but because I wanted him to evade capture long enough to conquer his demons. My heart broke for him during his tender moments with Helen. I felt his sorrow, his pain, his desperation. It's a testament to Carl Boehm's phenomenal performance that Mark maintains such vulnerability despite his sinister deeds.
Norman Bates's psychological issues were a result of his unhealthy relationship with his mother. For Mark Lewis, daddy is to blame. ""I've never known a moment's privacy,"" he tells Helen, since his father, a biologist obsessed with fear and the nervous system, filmed and documented every moment of Mark's life. Unlike Psycho, which relied on clumsy dialogue to diagnose and deliver Bates's back story, Peeping Tom uses a much more effective method: Mark, at Helen's insistence, rolls footage from his youth that shows his dad waking him in the middle of the night, purposely frightening him, throwing lizards on him, even filming Mark's last moments with his mother on her deathbed. Seeing firsthand that Mark was treated as a guinea pig rather than a son -- his entire childhood nothing but an experiment to his father -- injects an enormous amount of sympathy into his character. Suddenly everything makes sense: Helen's attraction and protectiveness toward Mark, since she pities his past and thinks she understands the cause of his anti-social behavior; the camera's manipulative power over Mark, since the footage from his youth reveals that the camera was a gift from his late father; and Mark's obsession with capturing fear in its ultimate form, since he is continuing his father's research. When you take into consideration that Michael Powell himself played the role of Mark's father, and that Powell's own son played the role of young Mark, effectively blending reality and cinema, it adds another eerie layer to the proceedings.
My favorite sequence of Peeping Tom occurs on a movie set. Mark is an aspiring filmmaker and works for a movie crew. After a day of filming, he arranges to meet Vivian, the lead actresses's stand-in, after-hours to make a film of their own. Since Mark had an opportunity to kill Helen the night before in his personal cinema but resisted the urge, it's easy to question if Vivian, with her bright red hair, isn't still playing the role of stand-in --- this time for Mark's neighbor and soon-to-be love interest. Leading up to the scene, Michael Powell establishes an ominous, foreboding tone using items typical of a movie set as weapons of dread. Then Mark appears, camera in tow, descending from the rafters like the director of the picture, ready to capture Vivian's final performance. It's fascinating and frightening to watch the change in his demeanor. Instead of resembling the shy, awkward, insecure Mark of previous scenes, he is transformed into a smooth, calm, confident predator, his eyes exhibiting hunger and lust as he directs his prey in what he hopes will be the climax for his documentary on fear.
In the aforementioned scene, as I watched Moria Shearer's character dance happily around the movie set to a musical number (invoking memories of an earlier Powell-Shearer collaboration, 1948's The Red Shoes, a five-star film in its own right), I thought of classic-era Hollywood and its happy endings and its virtuous ideals, and I watched Mark --- or Michael Powell, rather --- impale those virtues through the neck. No wonder critics found Peeping Tom vile and disgusting, since the film revels in perversity, focusing on sordid topics like pornography and prostitution and repressed sexuality. There's a seediness to nearly every scene, as if every line of dialogue is a naughty secret, every performance naked and exposed. Peeping Tom exists behind closed doors; it operates at night, when the well-to-do citizens are asleep and the sinners slink. The lurid tone adds to the feeling of unease. Peeping Tom also introduces many ingredients that would become staples of the slasher sub-genre. For example, we watch Mark stalk a prostitute in the streets, the first of several sexually-promiscuous victims, whereas Helen --- the ""virgin,"" so to speak --- is the final girl.
Peeping Tom is tame compared to the slashers that have followed in the decades since its debut. With the exception of the climactic final scene, no deaths are shown on screen. The blood spills only in our imagination, yet the power of suggestion is so strong that you'll cringe and shield your eyes even when the violence isn't visible. In a typical slasher, as a masked killer systematically offs teenagers one by one, viewers are expected to be entertained by the grisly deaths on screen. In Peeping Tom, Mark's weapon of choice isn't a knife or a machete, but a camera, and therein lies the brilliance of the film. He kills his victims with the tripod of his camera as they stare back at a reflection of their frightened selves. Later, when Mark watches the footage from the darkness of his private cinema, we partake in the ritual with him as we watch the same footage from over his shoulder. The title of the film doesn't just refer to Mark, but to viewers. We are the peeping toms. We are the voyeurs. The true killer is the camera, and we are implicated in its crimes. Not only does Peeping Tom lay the groundwork for future slashers, it deconstructs the entire genre while simultaneously giving birth to it. Mark is essentially a mirror of ourselves, watching death for gratification, so who is more disturbed: us or him?
Psycho is a borderline top-ten favorite, so when I say that Peeping Tom is just as good, well, that's mighty high praise. Personally, I find Norman Bates more frightening, more disturbing and more chilling, but my feelings toward Mark are more complicated since I felt a great level of sympathy for his character and even rooted for him while simultaneously rooting against his actions. If anything, Mark Lewis is the better character while Norman Bates is the better villain. Of the two films, Psycho is scarier and more suspenseful, but Peeping Tom digs a little deeper, hits a little harder, and I feel like it's the richer, more multi-layered of the two films. No doubt about it, however, both Psycho and Peeping Tom are phenomenal films, and in a genre that's often disrespected and littered with waste, they stand side-by-side on the mountaintop as proof that horror movies-- yes, even slashers -- can reach the same level of technical brilliance and artistic genius as any other film.",5.0
"Scavenger Hunt #108 March 2024:
Watch a movie featured on Elvira’s Movie Macabre.
Watched: 25/31
Peeping Tom has an excellent and mysterious thrilling nature that unfortunately is short lived by the end of its runtime. It’s got some great cinematography, particularly for its time, including the use of POV from a killer’s perspective. However, the mystery is quickly revealed to us without having to solve anything and the film’s journey takes the same repetitive approach that could have had the length of this movie cut by at least half. Tom is an interesting character study, but he’s not explored as deeply as he ought to be and every decision made for this film feels incomplete. There’s a great movie hidden inside this feature somewhere, but it only scratches the surface and leaves the audience impatient, especially those people familiar with films from the same sub genre.

"PEEPING TOM is definitely a misunderstood masterpiece like Martin Scorsese said when he got this film re-released back in 1980…it’s criminal what happened to Michael Powell’s film career as a director after the release of this film…imagine the films that might have followed over the next 20 years…it is a timeless classic that is intense…disturbing and psychologically compelling..about the struggles of childhood trauma where the abused becomes the abuser…it’s so masterfully done by Powell…and still very relevant today.
Mark Lewis played by Carl Boehm plays the troubled glamour model photographer who works in an upstairs studio above a newsagent store…but in his spare time he has a gruesome obsession catching something sinister on his camcorder…and keeping all the recordings stored away in his secret video room…the performance from Boehm is terrifying…because of his gentle and calm nature…it’s one of those stories that puts the sociopath in a sympathetic light.
Mark Lewis is in my opinion one of the most complex characters in Horror history…it’s an Integral film to the slasher genre too…and it’s also an integral film to the world of cinema full stop…which is why it’s easily one of my top Horror picks from the 1960’s….i absolutely recommend this classic….i can’t wait for the criterion Blu-Ray release in May…all I can say is…if you haven’t seen this…please go check it out as soon as you can.",5.0
"This is the first slasher ever, according to Scream 4. Who am I to argue. In Scream 4, Ghostface (who I think is Rory Culkin at the time) asks what the first slasher is. The wrong answer was given as Psycho, which is interesting because I think it's a good answer. Slashers have come a long way since the shower scene, of course, but what is that scene but a classic slasher kill? As Ghostface says, the reasoning for Peeping Tom being the first one is that it was the first film to put the audience in the POV of the killer. That being so, this movie had to hit like God damn gang busters in 1960 (also the year of Psycho). Plus, it's a film from The Archers, directed by one half of the duo who gave us unassailable masterpieces like A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, and The Red Shoes, so it's British as fuck. It's got quite proper trappings but underneath it is nasty, delightfully grim and sordid. 
The Britishness of it all seems a little stuffy at first, however there is nothing but freshness here. Our main character is a real piece of work, a troubled bloke who set the mold for hundreds of horror movie protagonists/villains. The camera tripod with the secret blade is a particularly savage signature murder weapon, and it ties back into the nature of making movies. It almost seems to ask the question of what exactly is violence on camera? Is pretend violence still violence? We are watching these things happening, knowing it's just a movie, but the movie within the movie is very real and horrifying to the characters. Above all it's a very fucking cool film with lots of thoughts to chew on. And very colorful! I heartily recommend Pee Ping Tom",4.0

"Well ahead of its time upon its release just months before Hitchcock's Psycho, is Michael Powell's highly controversial multi-layered study of the psychology of a serial killer. Masterfully portrayed by Austrian Karlheinz Böhm, Mark is a tragic monster, indeed; a pitiful mash up of Peter Lorre, Udo Kier, and Klaus Kinski, emotionally scarred from years of torturous experiments conducted upon him by his father, a renowned psychologist, Under the daytime guise of a focus puller for a movie studio lies a disturbed voyeur whose obsessive lens turns homicidal at the slightest detection of fear in its beautiful young subjects, which include Moira Shearer and Pamela Green ('cor blimey!),. Anna Massey (Frenzy, Vault of Horror) is equally exceptional as Mark's smitten downstairs neighbor, Helen, while Jack Watson (Tower of Evil, From Beyond the Grave) and Nigel Davenport (A Man for All Seasons, Phase IV) round out the supporting cast rather nicely. Director Powell, who effectively ended his own career here for decades, cameos as Mark's father while recruiting his own real life son to portray young Mark. Without giving too much away, the script is incredible, with more than one rattling exchange throughout, to its credit.
Initially panned by critics and later developing a huge cult following that famously includes Martin Scorsese, who has championed the film all along, Tom is a true classic of British cinema that stays with the viewer long after the film has ended. Indeed, some prefer it to Psycho. My highest recommendation.",5.0

"The British horror classic that shattered genre tropes and introduced the world to the terrifying visage of observing the killer's point-of-view, during murderous acts. Simply nasty and upsetting - especially for 1960.
Single, white, male loner Mark Lewis (played brilliantly by the disturbed & reserved Carl Boehm) works at a film studio during the day and, at night, takes sexy photographs of women looking to break into adult photographic modelling. Director Michael Powell knows how to move the camera in a stalking and reptilian way, that truly unnerves the audience.
Our fracturing titular antagonist is also making a documentary on fear, which involves recording the reactions of victims as he murders them using a long bayonet attachment, protruding from the front of his video camera stand. He befriends Helen, the daughter of the family living in the apartment below his, and he tells her vaguely about the movie he is making and the unsettling inspiration he received from his psychologically abusive father.
""Peeping Tom"" is a satisfying cinematic feast, bursting with brilliant primary colours & sharp lighting - making just about every scene a marvel to gaze upon despite the creepy main character and disturbing subject matter.
A truly frightening movie no doubt for its time, and the camera following a very disturbing antagonist help cement ""Peeping Tom"" as a genre gamechanger; as well as, a cinematic feat to be studied.",5.0
"What a deliciously nasty film. The great Karlheinz Böhm (in that brief period when he angled for international recognition, after shooting to Sissi fame in Germany, but before collaborating with Fassbinder, and long before becoming a humanitarian) stars as Mark Lewis, a London photographer whose camera doubles as a murder weapon. His day job is respectable movie work, his night job is taking naughty pictures of women for voyeurs (we witness somebody buying these pictures early in the film, in a truly delightful scene), and the passion that he is driven to is killing women while filming them, in what he calls making a documentary on fear.
Yes, our protagonist is a voyeur, and a man obsessed with his camera, and by showing us the first murder he commits in this film through his lens, director Michael Powell makes us as the audience feel like we are complicit with his crimes - and even more so when he watches the murder that he taped back, seeing what we saw as it happened. I can only assume this complicity made audiences and critics very uncomfortable when the film came out, which was part of the reason it bombed so infamously on its initial release.
Karlheinz Böhm is fantastic as Mark Lewis, whose name suggests he is British, but whose accent is very obviously German, and never explained in-universe. He looks like he couldn't harm a fly, and his soft-spokenness only makes him creepier. Resisting any urge to play the role in a more dominant way was certainly the right decision for the part.
The film is exciting to watch throughout, but one of the greatest strokes of genius is casting Moira Shearer as one of Mark Lewis' victims. She plays an extra on the film he is working on, she is beaming on the screen and looks like a star, we see her dance (reminding us of her most famous performance in The Red Shoes), and even although we know the nature of this film, and the nature of its main character, we keep hoping that she might survive her after-hours encounter with Mark after all - I mean, Michael Powell is not going to kill off Moira Shearer, is he? Well let's just say: It turns out to be a terrifically suspenseful scene, even although we know what is inevitably going to happen all along.
Terrific throughout.

"In the last six decades not a single other film has come close to exposing the psychological connection between cinema and voyeurism that Michael Powell demonstrates with Peeping Tom. From its stunning examination of the male gaze, to its found footage and slasher stylings, it is simply incalculable the sheer number of films that would not exist today if not for this film.",5.0
"Peeping Tom succeeds in being both a tense, deeply disturbing psychological thriller and a visually stunning character study. Any review will tell you that the film was destroyed by British critics on its release, revived by Martin Scorsese in the late '70s restoring Powell's reputation, and is now considered an important classic, if moderate by today's standards. But, moderate or not, it is still profoundly compelling.
It is immediately recognisable as the work of Powell - the colour cinematography is so lavish you forget it was released at a time when Carry On was the face of British cinema. But Powell, working within the confines of the British film industry as he was, was always one to push the envelope - thematically as well as technically, as exemplified here.
The story focuses on an introverted young psychopath who is a focus puller for a film studio but who moonlights as a smut photographer. His downtime consists chiefly of murdering women and cinematographically capturing their expressions of fear (which he says is the most frightening thing in the world). The first half of the film ends with him doing away with a studio stand-in, at which point Powell juggles the genres of psychological horror and police procedural effectively to say the least.
Aurally as well as visually striking, but never garish, cheesy or in otherwise bad taste, Peeping Tom has, in a spectacular stroke of irony, stood the test of time to fully merit its status as one of the most intelligent, unsettling horror films ever made. Enthralling from the first frame to the last.",4.5

"Much has been made of the parallels between Peeping Tom and Psycho (1960) — two thrillers about psychotic killers made by British directors with decades-long pedigrees. Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's career, while Psycho took Alfred Hitchcock to new heights.
There are whole books to be written about this subject, but I'll say simply that Psycho is a suspenseful horror thriller with a great twist, while Peeping Tom is a depressing drama that never really leaves its twisted main character's POV.
Also, with its rich use of color, Peeping Tom looks like Powell & Pressburger's acclaimed films, and is unmistakably British, but in all the wrong ways, showing the seediest side of London. Psycho is a black & white thriller done on the cheap with Hitchcock's TV crew. It's a thrill ride. The protagonist of Peeping Tom suffered horrible abuse as a child, and he's reenacting it over and over, filming women's fear and then murdering them. (Norman Bates's childhood trauma is played more as a gimmick than anything the audience can relate to.)
Personally, I can watch Psycho over and over, and it's still scary and thrilling. I think this was only the second time I've seen Peeping Tom. It's a brilliantly made film, but it's sad, grotty, sexually queasy, and deeply upsetting.",5.0

"“Well, he won’t be doing the crossword tonight.”
Carl Boehm’s central performance as Mark Lewis is kind of mesmerising. It’s a not-at-all relevant comparison to make with Christopher Reeves as Superman/ Clark Kent. But to me there was a wide gulf between two very different sides to his personality. Predominately, he’s a socially awkward hideaway who keeps his head down & even long-standing tenants of his home don’t know he’s the Landlord. Then there’s the dynamic, confident persona behind the camera; especially when making the murder segments of his documentary.
I put the Spoiler Warning up top so will go ahead & make a second not-at-all-relevant comparison to say that the finale reveal of the mirror was as impactful on me as the harmonica explanation at the end of Once Upon a Time in the West. We’ve watched intently, sleuthing & reacting to what Mark is doing with his documentary. At the end of the murder sequences – we see a shiny reflection upon the victim faces. We’ve been encouraged to envision some horrific weapon of some sort. How incredibly layered then the reveal. We are watching him as he watches them watch themselves be murdered. Yet before we know the end of that chain, we were made to mentally fill the void & picture what was happening. Take a long, hard look at yourself dear viewer. Just how deeply does this film’s explorative portrait of voyeurism know you?
Mike’s entire life has developed (heh) into being about capturing moments on film. Whether on Studio Set or snapping soft porn stills above a dingy corner newsagent, he’s at his most focused when shooting. Then at his most relaxed sat watching back what he has shot. I liked the solo piano accompaniment to these sequences, making it feel like Mike was a Silent Era aficionado. There are 2 turns of phrase that ultimately take on far greater significance than they seemed to in the moment. He makes repeat reference to maybe not being around tomorrow. At the end we realise he never knew when his documentary might need to come to an end. He also says: “You’re safe so long as I don’t see you’re frightened.” Where Helen is concerned, how very significant that becomes.
One of the aspects I have to single out is the consistently grimy London world around them. Damp, crumbling bricks, globby window frame paint, rust, peeling wallpaper, drab colour schemes – it’s a world away from the Sixties soon to Swing. Except for my favourite scene of the movie, which shows Mike at his most focused & gives us an unexpected splash of colour. Staying behind on Set after work, an Extra meets with Mike, agreeing to be filmed. There are red & blue storage cases & a general sense of things being cleaner in the open space. It’s almost like the film’s big Musical Number, as she improv’s a dance to some bongo-happy tropicana. This is Moira Shearer as Vivian, who ought to feel comfortable enough, having been Victoria for Powell 13 years earlier in The Red Shoes. With all sorts of camera set-ups & angles, this Scene is quite dizzying.
I also can’t help but wonder what a movie-going audience felt in having this & Psycho in theatres only a few months apart. There’s no suggestion either was somehow influenced by the other. Yet there’s more than a mere whiff of the Hitchcockian obsessions in Peeping Tom. How many folks saw these & started to wonder what the world of watching might end up becoming?

"—🧩🗝 Spooky Season 2023 #63 🗝🧩—
“Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it, Mark? A pity it can't be photographed.”
When it comes to spooky season, there's nothing better than a good surprise, especially one that you realize you're falling for as you watch it. Peeping Tom is a wonderful cinematic treasure that takes its edgy subject matter as far as it could go at the time of its release. It's a fascinating serial killer character study, a thrilling forward-thinking meditation on our now wildly obsessive culture, and a stylish genre exercise in captivating storytelling. Loved it, loved it, loved it.
Notes:
- Yet again, this is a film that I've been putting off for literal years and of course it ends up being one of the best things I've watched all year. I just refuse to learn my lesson 🤦🏻‍♂️. I blame the bland posters. But there's no excuse with a film this fantastic.

"My giddy Aunt, if you want to understand the concept of ""lurid colour"" look no further than Mickey Powell's 1960 murder-in-the-movies ""Peeping Tom"". Whole frames here are spilling over with directional lights that splash out in reds, orange, green, purples, yellows. It's both a chaos of the gaudy, showbiz Soho-set world of the film and also the chaotic, hyper-aroused interior mind of main character Mark (Karl Boehm).
""Tom"" is a long-buried masterwork of one of the greatest of all British film-makers. Released just 2 months before ""Psycho"" came out, the story about Mark, a camera assistant who stalks women at night and kills them with his spikey tripod so he might ""capture"" the terror on their faces as they die, was mocked and scoffed by critics and audiences alike who probably were expecting a far more violent and gothic genre picture than what this actually is.
Unlike ""Psycho"" with it's overt violence, butchering of big-name actors and B&W creepiness, ""Tom"" has a very stylised theatrical, almost camp energy. Lead killer Mark is not like the weird, shifting Norman Bates but is a shy, withdrawn, rather skittish guy who finds his well-ordered, pre-planned world of shooting a documentary about fear and death rudely interrupted by a curious, friendly lodger in his large London house. Helen (Anna Massey - who at the time had just married one of the great Sherlock Holmes actors Jeremy Brett...Why did she never seek his detective skills on this one?) is fascinated by the peculiar behaviour of Mark and wants to befriend him. Her blind, alcoholic mother (a superbly bitter, darkly comic Maxine Audley) is wary of the strange young man who makes ""peculiar noises as he walks about in the room upstairs"" but would rather knock back a 6th whiskey for the day then ban her daughter from poking her nose in.
The film is effectively moving between this blossoming friendship between Mark and Helen and Mark's daily job working at a rather cheap and shabby movie studio in Soho. It's a job that allows him full access to cameras, film stock, processing equipment and even a director's chair (with his own name on it). It also allows him the space to invite a wannabe starlet, Vivian, to join him afterhours and pose for him as he practices lighting her. In one of the film's many theatrical setpieces, Viv puts on a tape of suitably Dankworth-like jazzy bongo grooves before leaping and dancing all over the set while Mark grows increasingly impatient at her inability to stand still and simply ""do as she is directed"". One of the great attractions to this classic is how we are never really watching a conventional killer flick (as you might argue Psycho is) but rather a very specific metaphor for film-making and film directors in particular being brutalists, somewhat sadistic in how they must ""capture"" and ""own"" the image. The image here is mainly that of young women, but not all just saucy, curvy starlets - Mark is also drawn into the image of the lost, downtrodden, the persecuted. At one point he wishes to shoot a closeup of a model with a facial deformity...he's using the camera, the probe, as a way of showing the sort of empathy and connection to a person that he himself cannot fathom. The film is very clear that Mark's issue is not simply sexual psychopathy, but a specific paraphilic disorder. He is compelled to watch, compelled to stare and not engage. There is a lot of setup for this issue - His father is seen in flashbacks manipulating and bullying the child Mark into specific extreme emotions to satisfy his own cruel and ""perverted"" paraphilic urges.
Like ""psycho"" has an ""expert"" appear in the 3rd act to explain Norman's psychotic condition, here Powell also uses the trick of a heavily accented German ""expert"" to explain Mark's affliction too.
But ultimately this is a movie that wants to make it very clear that the camera here is a sexual device, a replacement for the phallus. Often Mark is seen stroking, handling either his lens, his camera body, he's using touch to approximate real soulful connection. When he hands Helen a glass of milk to drink, he strokes the rim and caresses the glass as if that is a close as he can ever get to her as a person. This is very much a commentary on how the cinematic act of making a film is an act of penetrating the unwilling participant, but also that the act of then viewing the result, is a willing participation in the witnessing of how soulless the figures on screen really are. The first step, as it were, to brutalising a human soul, is to treat the body as a piece of meat.
It's certainly the openness of this perspective that Powell is presenting which would've messed up the minds of the censors and critics of this film way back when. He is not mocking or 'monsterising' Mark. He is drawing empathy toward his killer. That's pretty unforgiveable for an audience in 1960, to humanise the villain. There are some pretty outlandish attempts to create a black almost buffoonish humour at times. A sequence of a director trying to get an actress to faint convincingly is played almost entirely for laughs and one of the opening scenes where Mark is revealed to work part time at a ""newsagents"", where his boss sells dodgy porn under the counter and uses an upstairs room to make his own softcore nude shots, plays out one of the broadest moments in the movie as a Gentleman Customer has to gurn and buffoon his way through the purchase of a ""saucy mag"" before grabbing the wares and scuttling out the shop. Mark's boss dryly observes ""Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight"".
In the end this is a genuinely engaging tale, a thriller, about a murderer using his camera to recreate the traumas that broke his own childhood apart. The camera is an extension of him (as it would be for any film director obsessed with film-making). There's a great moment where Helen wants to take Mark (so shy, so awkward) out on a date but resents the constant presence of the ever-present camera around his neck. He hands it to her and she puts it aside before they leave the house. Suddenly Mark is buoyant, bouncing, free from troubles. It seems he might have a chance of having the weight lifted off him. Then suddenly, they pass a hedge where a couple are necking and Mark is stopped in his tracks. He has to look. He has to watch. Despite Helen's protestations, he knows he can't resist the perversion that lives so close to the surface of his soul.
Being a film-maker, a hunter of the image according to Powell, is akin to the state of mind of the obsessive, the stalker, the killer. ""Peeping Tom"" is not the same sort of visceral thrill-ride as ""Psycho""...it has almost no on-screen violence...and if that film was about every boy who loves his mother, then this is very much about every boy who loves his camera, but it's rich gaudy tableaux and surprisingly emotional openness (for it's era) is still pretty darn disturbing and it is a genuine classic that should be watched if given an opportunity.",5.0
"the most thorough document on the inherently exploitative nature of image making; cinema as a destructive act; the movies as they relate to fear and desire and sex and violence, implicating both creator and consumer in their capacity to do tangible and enormous harm. has quite a bit of overlap with something like de palma’s body double, but where that film argues cinema is all artificial and illusory, this loudly declares that, no, the violence is real and dangerous and horrifying, and for me its statement is far more provocative (both are next level great tbc). you’re plunged directly into mark’s aberrant psychology from the very first scene on and it becomes clear almost immediately how closely his impulses mirror our own as film viewers. it’s easy to condemn audiences and critics for rejecting this so thoroughly on its release, but at the same time...of course they did! its metaphors are so clear and convincing it’s impossible not to be disturbed by them. and the years have done nothing to dull its transgressive power. that it features the most sumptuous photography in all of horror and is made up almost exclusively of indelible images is also very appealing. total masterpiece. took all of 60 seconds to convince me i was watching one of my favorite movies for the first time, no better feeling",5.0

"Filmed in beautiful lush colors and accompanied by a stellar peformance of Karl Böhm, the film visibly exploits the voyeuristic nature of filmmaking, it depicts the psychology of helming a camera, fashioning scenario, and filming it, something Hitchcock was also a master in. A truly remarkable film that was ahead of it's time, sadly you can feel the power of censorship. I wish Powell could go crazy in his film with some bloody scenes. Peeping Tom still remains, despite some pacing issues, an unsettling, disturbing, and unforgettable psychological and visual exploration into the sadistic and voyeuristic obsession with fear experienced by a psychopathic killer. It is also the first slasher, next to Psycho. 🇬🇧",4.0
"Mark might be the creepiest character ive seen in a movie, partly because people like Mark actually exist.

the 20th century nightmare — I bet Alan Moore has it memorized,0.0
"The movie that pretty much ended the career of its director, Michael Powell, still has the power to shock. The subject matter is lurid—introverted Brit Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) murders women with a tricked-out movie camera that allows him to film them as they die—but Powell’s artistry is at its empathetic peak. This highly saturated Technicolor production seems to be oozing life, as if it too were an organism that, like each of the killer’s victims, is made suddenly aware of its own mortality. Every aspect of moviemaking (and obsession with same) is interrogated, especially in the way different genres like the comedy and the musical collide with the gory murder plot. It’s understandable why audiences of the time rebelled. Yet Powell is finely attuned to the tactile properties of this objet du cinema, so much so that he plays Mark’s father in black-and-white home movie inserts—the creator cannot absolve himself of his creation.—Keith Uhlich

"""Augen der Angst"" wurde gleichzeitig mit dem thematisch ähnlichen ""Psycho"" (Hitchcock 1960) im Spätherbst 1959 gedreht und beeinflusste wie dieser sowohl das italienische Giallo-Genre mit seiner ausgeklügelten Farbdramaturgie, der Küchenpsychologischen Hintergrundgeschichte um Traumata, Kindesmissbrauch und Voyeurismus und der für seine Zeit expliziten Gewalt (damals gekürzt ab 18 in den Kinos, heute ungekürzt ab 12 und damit dank Harry Potter ab 6, wenn Erziehungsberechtigte dabei sind), als auch den Slasherfilm mit seiner Handlung um einen Serienmörder, der Frauen, die ihm Angst zeigen, mit einer versteckten Stichwaffe in seinem Kamerastativ umbringt. Regisseur Powell komponiert seine Setpieces meisterhaft und lenkt den Blick des Zuschauers so, dass er in die rein auf das Sehen, den Voyeurismus konzentrierte Welt des Serienmörders eintaucht, aber gleichzeitig über seinen eigenen Blick reflektiert. Intelligenter und spannender als vieles, das folgte.",4.5
"PEEPING TOM (1960)
""A young man murders women, using a movie camera to film their dying expressions of terror.""
Released the same year as Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant Psycho (1960), Peeping Tom offers psychological, pseudo-sexual thrills and can also be seen as a progenitor of the contemporary slasher film. Ironically, director Michael Powell's film has more in common with Hitchcock works such as Vertigo (1958) and Rear Window (1954) due to the nature of voyeurism that's expressed. It's a remarkable British picture that has the filmmaking craft downpat, while drawing viewers in with plenty of taboo subjects to ponder over: child abuse, sadomasochism, and scopophilic fetishism to name a few.
I think the best aspect of Peeping Tom is that it makes a statement about us viewers being voyeurs ourselves and getting a delight or rise from what we're seeing unfold on-screen. Mark Lewis (portrayed by Karlheinz ""Carl"" Boehm) is an incredible character to try deciphering; his mannerisms and his bloody kinks make for an interesting study. His murder weapon of choice to this day remains one of the most original and baffling (in a good way) items to ever appear in any slasher we might associate more with from a later film. The dying expressions of his victims he captures on film for mental/erotic sustenance is disturbingly interesting.
Throw in some gorgeous cinematography, great acting, an enticing musical score, and an ending that shakes you up, Peeping Tom solidifies itself as an amazing cinematic achievement. It is a bit of a slow burn to wade through but overall enjoyable.

Task 1: Watch a film from Time Out Magazine’s Best British Film list.
Oh boy was this movie creepy and way ahead of its time. This movie was filled with controversy when it originally came out, and I can kind of understand why, but this is a fantastic movie with a subtle, but terrifying lead performance from Carl Boehm. The camera work, the sound, the plot, it all reeks of creepiness. Even the fantastic music filled me with dread.

"Proof that dudes with cameras are creeps?! Obviously, I'm joking but this is movie is the ""creepy director"" trope avant la lettre.
Was expecting this to be somewhat outdated (a lot of controversial, sensationalist films are) but this was surprisingly challenging to watch at times. It's a perfect example of a movie that's actually great but got dismissed in its time for just being trashy or nasty. I'm actually kind of relieved I didn't have to leave my house after watching this.
The opening scene alone gave me a slightly uneasy feeling. What makes it work well even now, is that it definitely manages to act on your conscience. It's just a movie, but still, you somehow feel almost sleazy watching it.
There's also just something inherently creepy and disturbing and the idea of being watched and not knowing it, and this film has that in spades. Suffice it to say he doesn't just 👀 though.",4.5
"Sumptuous - for a film exploring the dark side of creativity, this is a work of stunning visual beauty. I watched Optimum's blu-ray release, and it's a top-class transfer - highly recommended. I can see how this would have made a stir in 1960 England - what an incredible piece of work. It's difficult to imagine how the concept would have shocked people, now that we have become so inured to slasher and serial-killer themed stories. A terrific example of horror inspiring great art. And it is still genuinely creepy. Final scene is a corker, too.",4.5

"In 1896, Thomas Edison released a film entitled The Kiss. Its story was far from complicated, as all the film depicted was a kiss between two actors. Still, this was more than enough to generate controversy - the final film was widely denounced by moral authorities like the Roman Catholic Church and declared by critics to be ""absolutely disgusting"". All of this just goes to show that sex and cinema have always been inextricably linked. Even the most innocent of films have a voyeuristic element to them - to watch a film is to see through another's eyes, to plunge oneself wholeheartedly into another's perspective.

This recognition of cinema's voyeuristic tendencies courses through every second of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, a film where even the title demands a certain level of awareness from the viewer. It constantly challenges us to look further, criticizing its own artifice and male-gazey perspective while drawing our attention to how and why we're watching. It scares us not with what we cannot recognize in its characters, but what we can recognize in ourselves. At the same time, it gleefully criticizes those who would remove these aspects from cinema, suggesting that they might be more necessary than we expect.

Equally as important is that Peeping Tom is also a goddamn fantastic thriller. This has gained a reputation over the years as ""the British version of Psycho"", and while I think I prefer Hitchcock's film more for sheer shock, this is certainly good enough to merit the comparison. What especially charms me is the potpourii of cinematic influences that makes up this film's aesthetic - the Sirkian visuals, the silent-movie soundtrack, and the wide array of film references just equal nirvana for a geek like me. This is the kind of old movie that's just as good as everyone says it is, and it's entirely awesome in a spine-chilling way. Check this one out if you can.",5.0
"A young camera nerd, damaged beyond repair by his father, keeps records of the dying faces of the women he kills.
You can see why it met the critical fate it did, I'm not an expert on the genre at all so I don't know what had come before (I'd guess not much and that the idea of this being a genre movie would have been unthinkable at the time, but that is a guess) but I think it's safe to say that no British director of Powell's standing had ever released anything on these lines at all in 1960. The film is undoubtedly a masterpiece but even after over 50 years with everything that has come since Powell's masterful direction immediately creates a sense of complicity that is genuinely disturbing, and crucially I think, asks questions of the viewer with regard to film in general that must have struck some nerves, as must the characterisation of the killer as someone familiar with Sight and Sound and the Everyman, this is a movie set in the heart of cineaste London that shows it to overlap with pornography and obsessions. Powell's casting of himself and his son for a crucial scene must surely have helped make the attacks so personal and damaging.
It still feels sordid, but it reminded me of recently watching Frenzy, Anna Massey being the obvious link as well as their relative placings in the career of Britains two greatest directors, but while I enjoyed Frenzy it was hard to escape the feeling that Hitchcock was only half succeeding and half coming across as some embarrassing out of date uncle, how the freedom to deliver his old obsessions without any layers of censorship reduced his effectiveness. Here Powell delivers a movie about obsession and voyeurism and about the movies at the absolute top of his game, complementing his other work at the same time as breaking all sorts of ground for horror. It's not anywhere near as explicit as Frenzy but it is more real and it makes you mourn the fact it stopped his career in its tracks because it is clearly the work of someone with so much still to do and say.
The use of colour, of sets, of camera angles, of music is the equal of anything else in his career which is to say the equal of anyone else out there or possibly in the case of colour and music beyond equals. The sequence of the actress dancing for the camera followed by her murder is one of the most intense scenes of extremes I can think of. It is perversely an amazing movie about movie making as well as everything else, it's a movie in love with the power of the camera on people. In horrible, sick ways yes, but for rare moments in other ways too.
It's not a genre I have a lot of time for, I'm glad the Letterboxd season took me to it because it is a masterful movie.

"Released in the UK just a month before Psycho, director Michael Powell's film was at first panned by critics and largely ignored by audiences. That's a shame but totally understandable as Peeping Tom is a blitz of dark, DARK disturbing creepiness and is one of the honored great granddads of the slasher genre. Karlheinz Bohm is brilliant as the deeply disturbed killer behind the camera and the whole movie glows with a constant off putting sinister dread vibe.

"Is this good? Yes. Did this bore me? Yes. This is a very well made movie and looks amazing, gagged this was made in 1960. There’s really good cinematography, sets, costuming, score. I was just really bored for a lot of it. I don’t really care for Helen and a lot of the movie focuses on her. I also felt like the scene with Vivian dragggged out for like 20 minutes which felt useless. I do like the concept of this movie a lot. It’s cool how Mark is taking photos of women on the verge of their deaths to capture photos of true fear. I also like Mrs Stephen’s a lot she was a good character. I wish there were more scenes through the lens of Mark’s camera and definitely more stalking scene/photo ops.

Peeping Tom is an early slasher filmed in the UK in 1960. I watched a bunch of Austin Powers last weekend so it was great to be transported back in time again for a 60s Brit sexy party! Psycho came out the same year, but Peeping Tom is in beautiful color. 
The Peeper dresses in a suit and tie and has a clean part in his blond hair. He looks more like Ted Bundy then a typical slasher. I really loved the start. I started to lose interest towards the end, but it made up for the lull with a pretty shocking finale.",3.5
"I always have love and appreciation for early horror films that can be so sick and sadistic. For a film to be this affective and hardly show any of the blood or murder is very rare. I was also huge on the killers weapon of choice. It’s so unique and his motive is also very intriguing to say the least. I got a Hitchcock feel from this and I mean that with the upmost respect to him and the director Michael Powell. There’s never a dull moment, and it’s shot so beautifully. Tension and thrill from start to finish. I’d say this is an essential for any film buff. This is definitely an older horror flick that I can see myself revisiting and probably gaining more respect and appreciation off more additional viewings.",4.0
"“Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.“
Michael Powell’s terrific direction encompasses everything ambiguous and wrong with the voyeurism of cinema through the eyes of tormented psycho Mark Lewis and his camera. the viewfinder looking like a rifle scope is just too perfect for the kind of penetrative violation exacted upon the actresses in this.
boldly examines how hollywood narratives treat the female body while also making the more general observation of our being attracted to excessive emotion, be it arousal or fear. Karlheinz Böhm is uncannily great in the role of the traumatized Lewis who goes around stabbing ladies with his *cough* phallic stick. i’m almost disgusted at my own pity for this character because rather than rejoice over the ending i felt tragically moved. 
the theme of seeing and blindness is so skillfully turned inside and out here and it is made awfully clear that our gaze - as opposed to reality - is very much a one way action. it is us who stare willingly (and eagerly) into the abyss and nothing stares back but the dark mirror figments of ourselves.",3.5

Karlheinz Böhm é muito bom aqui, transmitindo um olhar quieto, melancólico e doentio.

Apesar de ter gostado dessa premissa inteira do filme, tratando sobre esse lado doentio causado pelos experimentos do pai e como isso afetava sua vida. Não sei, não gosto muito do rumo que o filme leva. Porém o final é muito bom.

Acho muito interessante o lance da metalinguagem e me lembra bastante alguns found footages em certas cenas, sendo uma grande influência pra diretores e filmes vários anos depois.

"“It’s only a camera.”
“Only?!”
I’ve heard and read Scorsese singing this thing’s praises for decades now. Saw that it was on Tubi last night and gave it a shot. The years, and the countless imitators that it spawned, have blunted its effectiveness a little, but it’s still powerfully queasy and disturbing. I was surprised by how bitingly funny it was, though. There are several laugh-out-loud moments here. Plenty of “yikes” and “uh-oh” moments, too. Plus, those colors…

"This be the verse. The director as voyeur as killer. Maybe cameras don't really steal your soul, but the men behind them can take a lot. Peeping Tom is a lot darker than Powell's films with Eric Pressburger, reflecting the angst that was already beginning to boil over as the 1960s began. The realization that the serene, pleasant image of the preceding decade was nothing but set dressing.
The film feels inspired by Hitchcock's films of the era, particularly Rear Window and Vertigo, both featuring a nice young man who watches young women from afar. Hitchcock, of course, returned to the theme in his own 1960 release, Psycho, both this film and that one featuring nice, clean-cut young men who turn out to be not so nice and not so clean. With mental illness and overbearing parents who haunt them and shape their paths. Though Peeping Tom doesn't take place in a remote hotel and the killer isn't alone in his watching. Mark shares his films with Helen and he also shares them with us. Mark may be a stand-in for Powell and other directors, but we're implicated too. We just keep on watching.",4.0
"It took me a while but I've finally seen Peeping Tom, and I'm very glad I did. I would consider this the true precursor to modern horror, yes even more than Psycho. Psycho is great but it feels very distinctly Hitchcockian noir, very of its time the 60's. Which yes Peeping Tom does too but in a different way if that makes any sense, I also think Spider Baby is a good example of precursor to modern horror. I love horror movies about making movies, I eat that shit up. I'm always worried that iconic films that are critically lauded might be disappointed, but it was defintely not in this case. Theres better horror films and there is better 60s horror but Peeping Tom is still special and it deserves your viewing and respect damn it.",5.0

"Zu seiner Zeit ein extrem kontroverser Film, der auf breite Ablehnung stieß, machte er doch den Mörder zum Protagonisten und ließ den Zuschauer die Geschichte aus seiner Perspektive erleben.
Wie der Titel verrät, ist Voyeurismus ein bestimmendes Thema des Films.
Inszeniert von Michael Powell und mit Karlheinz Böhm in der Hauptrolle, wird den beiden bei der Premiere der Handschlag verweigert und die Kritiken sind verheerend:
""Die einzige befriedigende Art und Weise, PEEPING TOM zu beseitigen, wäre, ihn zusammenzukehren und so schnell wie möglich in der nächsten Toilette herunterzuspülen. Selbst dann würde der Gestank zurückbleiben""
Für einen ernsthaften Skandal, war der Film dann jedoch nicht lange genug im Kino und geriet zum finanziellen Debakel.
Bekannt aus seichten Komödien und natürlich aus seiner Rolle als Kaiser Franz Josef in den Sissi Filmen, erlitt Böhms Karriere ernsten Schaden, von der sie sich erst 1 1/2 Dekaden später unter Fassbinder erholte.
Auch für Powells Karriere war der Film ein Desaster und ließ ihn länger ohne Geldgeber für neue Projekte dastehen.
Es ist Leuten wie Martin Scorsese zu verdanken, dass dieser Film heute ein anerkanntes Meisterwerk mit einer großen Fangemeinde ist und ab Ende der 70er seine Rennaissance in Programmkinos feierte.
Peeping Tom ist ein erstaunlich moderner Film, der der Rolle des Serienmörders viele neue Facetten geben konnte und brillant von ""Carl Boehm"" verkörpert wurde.
Auch hat er viele Filme dieses Genres bis heute beinflusst, wie zb Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Maniac usw.

"The bar got raised to a new level at movie night by Michael Powell's Peeping Tom last night, right in time for it to be my pick again next week.
In trying to find a way in to this remarkable film, the easiest place to start is with the screenplay. Leo Marks, who gets credits for original story and screenplay, was the son of Benjamin Marks, the joint owner of Marks & Co, the famous antiquarian bookseller at 84 Charing Cross Road in London. In one of the extras on the Criterion Collection DVD, he says that he knew he wanted to be a writer from hanging out in the bookshop with his father as a child and from reading, at his father's suggestion, Edgar Allan Poe's story, ""The Gold-Bug"". This not only got him turned on to Poe, but gave him the cryptography bug when he was a pre-teen.
During the war, he was recognised as a polymath and amateur cryptographer, but was passed over for a position at Bletchley Park because the intake team thought he was a misfit who would have trouble working as part of a team. Instead he was assigned to the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Baker Street and spent the rest of the war working with resistance groups in Europe and with agents who were operating behind enemy lines. The father-son link and the layers of meaning in cryptography and spy-craft would both feature in his screenplay for the film.
On its surface, the plot is relatively straightforward. In contemporary London, Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm), a focus puller working on a large studio (Pinewood Studios?) production, is also a voyeuristic serial killer. Using a handheld film camera his father had given him as a child, he stalks and murders a succession of young women, from sex workers to actresses, getting his sexual kicks from capturing the fear in their eyes with his movie camera as he skewers them with one leg of his tripod which he has sharpened to a deadly point. Marks’s screenplay sources Mark's sexual violence back to his childhood when his famous psychiatrist father used him a research subject for his work on how children responded to fear and his voyeurism back to the gift of the movie camera which Mark sees as a reward for the terrors his father subjected him to.
While the sexual and fetishistic content gave the envelope a gentle nudge, the plot was not particularly out there for the horror/thriller genre and, superficially at least, much less in your face than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which had its New York premiere two months after Peeping Tom premiered in London.
While both films drew on psychiatric theories to explain the psychopathology of their central characters, it is fairly straightforward to make the case now that Peeping Tom is the more subversive film by a very long way. Certainly the universally apoplectic reaction of the UK critics showed that Powell had hit a major nerve.
While the plot may be straightforward, the way Powell films it is anything but. The audience cannot be a passive consumer of this film which very quickly becomes, thanks to the screenplay, a series of Chinese boxes.
The film opens with a wide shot of a street in Soho, filmed not on location but on a soundstage with lurid lighting that looks, at first, as though it could be a Cinemascope movie poster touched up to brighten the colours. The camera advances towards a blond sex worker seen from the PoV of the unseen punter to whom she quotes her price then walks away, confident he will follow. We get a flash of a handheld movie camera being quickly covered by a coat, then, as the sex worker climbs the stairs to her room, the follow shot becomes the view through the viewfinder of the camera.
As will happen repeatedly throughout the film, the view we see changes between wide shots where we are in the position of traditional cinema goers; PoV shots through the camera viewfinder - often when violence is being done - where we are watching the scene through Mark's eyes; reverse shots where the PoV becomes the view of Mark, or more often the lens of his camera, seen by his victims as he closes in for the kill; or, and this is where I wanted to stand up and cheer; footage filmed by Mark and projected onto a screen in his flat. The layers of seeing and watching and seeing and watching here (with intervening lenses) are head-spinning and I cannot think of another film that makes such use of gaze and focus, and all of this in a character who is a focus puller!
There are several wide shots where Mark is caressing his camera while talking with his victims or with Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), his neighbour who is fascinated by him and insists on trying to get closer to him, despite the antipathy her blind mother (Maxine Audley) feels towards him. There are also a couple of scenes where Mark is rubbing the lens of the camera up against his cheek and it seemed entirely possible for a moment that he might actually slip it between his lips and mock-fellate it. To add yet another level, Helen is a writer of children's stories and the book she is writing, that she wants to discuss with Mark, concerns a magic camera and what it photographs.
However, the Chinese boxes are external to the plot as well as internal to it. Powell plays Mark's father, the psychiatrist, in the flashback scenes and Powell's son, Columba plays young Mark, who is reduced to tears of terror in several scenes. Powell's then wife, Frankie Reidy, plays Mark's mother, in the scene his father films of Mark standing beside her deathbed. To add an additional layer, Powell shot the flashback scenes in B&W, in the Powell family home.
The final crossover point, revealed in one of the Criterion DVD extras, is that the cameras in Mark Lewis’s room include Powell’s own first film camera, a hand operated Eyemo, made by Bell and Howell, which he won in a competition.
In a way that coincidence often works for me, I was reading the 1996 Film Comment interview with Godard about, amongst other things, his Histoire(s) du cinéma (1989) which I had just finished watching. In that interview, he talks about the difference between seeing a film in the cinema and on TV - to be able to see a film in the cinema requires the act of projection, of a light behind the film. However, for TV, he argues, ""there is no projection . . . there is just transmission of something. It’s peculiar to cinema to project, yes.""
Last night, what we saw on DVD was a transmission rather than a projection, which just added another layer to think about, and talk about, in this wonderful film.
I have seen stories that said the critical pile-on after the premiere of Peeping Tom effectively ended Powell's career. That is bullshit, of course. He came to Australia and made They're a Weird Mob (1966) and Age of Consent (1969), as David Stratton has described it, re-kickstarting the Australian film industry.
The extras on the Criterion DVD are an audio essay by film theorist Laura Mulvey, a stills gallery of on-set photos, and a documentary, A Very British Psycho, which Chris Rodley made for Channel 4 about Leo Marks and the film's critical reception.",4.5
"Have you ever wondered what would happen if Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy was released in 1960 instead of 1972? Exactly, neither have I. But if you ever decide to ask yourself a hypothetical question as obscure as this one or you have a penchant for torturing your house guests at dinner parties, then look no further than to the curious case of Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom.
Released in April 1960, just a few short months before Hitchock’s Psycho saw the light of day, Peeping Tom is now universally regarded as a classic and an early protoplast of giallo that eventually evolved into what we refer to as slasher movies. However, despite its current appraisal the movie nearly ended Michael Powell’s long and illustrious filmmaking career. It turns out that the audiences (at least in Britain) weren’t ready yet for that kind of storytelling. This is truly intriguing because at the same time French New Wave was taking over the continent and in a few years’ time The New Hollywood would swiftly move the goalposts of moral acceptability well beyond what the audiences in 1960 could even imagine. And it has to be said that Peeping Tom was properly slammed down by viewers and critics with such words as ‘vile’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘offensive’ being hurled at Powell from all directions even though the film isn’t graphic at all. It only makes me wonder what they would have to say about the aforementioned Frenzy, Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs, Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange or – God forbid – Wes Craven’s The Last House On The left…
But that’s all in the past. Today Peeping Tom is revered by critics and genre aficionados for its pioneering attempt at ditching the traditional approach to depicting a villain and not only have the camera follow his murderous exploits, but actually devoting the entire story to the process of trying to get into the killer’s mind and understand what makes him do the things he does; what makes him tick. As far as I am concerned, this was completely unprecedented in mainstream cinema of the time and even Hitchcock’s Psycho explored this space rather superficially and from a completely different perspective. Moreover, Powell often assumed the point of view of the killer thus fully committing to the exploration of voyeurism in the most visceral manner possible. This surely must have served as direct inspiration for the likes of Dario Argento, Mario Bava, John Carpenter and Brian De Palma who also adopted this technique in order to discomfort and upset their respective audiences.
However, despite its thematic prescience, technical originality and the moral bravado, Peeping Tom comes across a bit strange, as though Powell was either holding back or wasn’t quite sure how to commit fully to the audacious ride he had envisioned. This can also be a by-product of the time, but I often found myself disengaged by the unnatural dialogue and a wholly manufactured and rushed conclusion that brought the film to an altogether too abrupt an end. Perhaps the matter wasn’t helped by Karlheinz Böhm’s attempt at disguising his German accent and the nearly complete lack of chemistry in his interactions with Anna Massey’s character. It is also possible that the film’s occasional dips into perceived infantilism are simply derived from the historical gap between the film and my own vantage point.
In any case, it goes without saying that Powell’s Peeping Tom – destructive as it was to his career – is an extremely important data point in the landscape of development of genre filmmaking and perhaps cinemas as a whole. After all, many excellent filmmakers have cited this movie as inspirational to their development and without its somewhat culturally premature appearance on the scene, giallo would have never come into existence. Thus, it is perhaps unreasonable to hold a genuine trailblazer over the coals too much because Powell’s perspective was completely different to ours; all he could see was uncharted darkness ahead of him because literally nobody before him had the audacity to do that. I would like to think he had a faint idea he was accomplishing something important and was quietly holding his nerve hoping that one day the audiences would grow to understand the importance of this movie, which is a real feat regardless of how strange it may seem to someone watching it six decades later.",4.0

Second time in about a month that I've seen this film. Still hypnotized by its deep dive into the mind of this man fighting against his own insanity. It's such a disturbing and dark ride.
Karlheinz Bohm channels his inner Peter Lorre as he sweats his way through the film. He is a delightfully twisted character that we gain sympathy for when he shows his love interest old films from his childhood and we get a glimpse as to how his father slowly drove him insane. It's frightening in that manner and the movie slowly watches him unravel as he battles against his own murderous nature, his fascination (almost lust for) fear and his overwhelming need to kill.
Beautifully filmed, this is a seminal horror film that I'm sure I will be watching again in the future.",4.5
"I have always felt that Peeping Tom and 8½ say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two. 8½ captures the glamour and enjoyment of film-making, while Peeping Tom shows the aggression of it, how the camera violates... From studying them you can discover everything about people who make films, or at least people who express themselves through films.
Martin Scorsese
It's unbelievable how controversial this film was at the time of release, critics said it should be ""dumped into sewer,"" it was pulled down from the theaters in less than a week and it's said that it effectively ended the great Michael Powell's career, and it's all the more difficult to believe, when you realize that it was released at the exact same year as the more graphic and violent, but very similar film, Psycho, that unlike Peeping Tom became a massive hit. So what caused everyone to hate this film so much? Roger Ebert has the answer in his review of the film:
I think because it didn't allow the audience to lurk anonymously in the dark, but implicated us in the voyeurism of the title character.
Laura Mulvey, who is the first theorist that you'll think of while watching the film, gives her reasons in more detail:
Why was the film such a critical disaster? The story reaches both back into the history of British film culture and forward to new developments in film criticism which have attempted to account for its shock effect. Peeping Tom, as its title implies, is overtly about voyeuristic sadism. Its central character is a young cameraman and thus the story of voyeuristic perversion is, equally overtly, set within the film industry and the cinema itself, foregrounding its mechanisms of looking, and the gender divide that separates the secret observer (male) from the object of his gaze (female). The cinema spectator’s own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist. It is this relentless exposure of cinematic conventions and assumptions that has attracted the interest of feminist film critics, and the recent application of psychoanalytic theory to film theory clearly reveals the film’s psychoanalytic frame of reference.

"Every night you switch on that film machine. What are these films you can’t wait to look at?
Voyeurism, lack of privacy, and childhood trauma take the spotlight in this disturbingly creepy psychological horror-thriller directed by Michael Powell.
From its meticulous focus on a lurking perspective, often positioning the viewer in the killer’s point of view, to its artful aesthetic, Peeping Tom had a lot going for it which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was instantly captivated by the deep reds, rich blues, and vibrant yellows saturating my screen in every direction. I was also unexpectedly absorbed by Karlheinz Böhm‘s unsettlingly awkward and childlike mannerisms, which yielded a peculiarly memorable brand of serial killer.
Above all, however, I really appreciated the way it made me think about the film’s thematic implications and relevance in today’s social media obsessed society. With a surplus of daily digital content exchanged between friends and strangers alike, it is easy to be taken aback by the advent of a new, technologically derived type of voyeurism we’re all complicit in—a covert scoptophilia thriving in a virtual realm.",4.0
"Hoop-Tober 2.0: Film #5/31
The Horror in Question
Oh man. Damn. This one really fucked me up. The film is almost 15 minutes over and I'm still sitting on my couch, stunned as fuck. Well, it isn't that bad, but you catch my drift. It's not often, that I get so shook up by films. Jesus.
First off, it was a real surprise to seee Karlheinz Böhm in this. You see, I only knew this Austrian actor for his role as Emperor Franz in those boring Sissi movies and for being on crappy German TV shows. So it really was sight to behold to watch this actor whose face I had only associated with boredom and, well, switching the channel, playing a psychotic killer.
Of course, this is not the main reason I'm so dazzled by this film. By showing us how the always filming Mark, a shy and awkward man who is a ""Peeping Tom"" in the truest sense of the expression, kills women while filming their last moment, director Micheal Powell makes us complicit in Mark's crimes.
Peeping Tom is the rare Horror film that really suceeds in putting us in the shoes of a killer, something which I find truly frightening. In that regard it reminded me much of Angst (which incidentally is Austrian, just like Böhm), which is more explicit ( Peeping Tom features no gore at all), but just as terrifying.
Shit, something tells me I won't be sleeping well tonight.
Best Scare
Oh, where to begin? When Mark shows a film of him as a child to Helen, the one woman he won't ""photograph"" (meaning kill), because he isn't as weirdly sexually attracted to her as his other victims, is a real doozy in terms of scares. Also, the scene with Helen's mother or the frightfully manic, yet terrifyingly calm ending. Truth be told, I've found pretty much everything unsettling in this, to say the least.
Horror Champ
Of course, Karlheinz Böhm. He is soft spoken and looks nice enough at first glance, but has a manic glimpse in his eyes, that is hard to ignore. Also, I'm always wary of people that film everything. What's their deal? Anyway, I've never look at Böhm's ads for charity in Africa the same ever again.

"I borrowed the Studio Canal DVD of this film when I saw it on the library returns trolley, motivated mostly by wanting to check out its extras, but I took the opportunity to rewatch one of the creepiest films I have ever seen.
Michael Powell’s film tells the story of serial killer Mark Lucas (KarlHeinz Böhm) who works part-time as part of a film crew and part time photographing soft-porn pinup photos that he develops in the darkroom in the house he has inherited from his father.  
I don’t have a lot to add to my 2020 review (I watched the Criterion DVD, which has different extras).  After watching Powell’s widow, Scorsese’s go-to editor for the last 40+ years Thelma Schoonmaker, lavishing praise on Noreen Ackland’s editing, I paid particular attention to it this time.  Apart from all of its other claims to fame, Powell’s use of the camera to give us the killer’s point of view, that is very dependent on Otto Heller’s cinematography and Acland’s editing, should be on every film school watch list.  There were a couple of places where the primary shot was the terrified victim being advanced on by Lucas and the reverse shot was not the classic shot back at Lucas but either the view of his camera lens or an image of Lucas reflected in an extreme closeup of the victim’s eyeballs.
The extras on the Studio Canal DVD are Olivier Serrano’s documentary short film The Eye of the Beholder (2005), a photo gallery, Powell’s filmography, and the film’s original trailer. This is well worth trying to track down if you have not seen it.  I would love to see it in a cinema, although I note that we will be getting a six film Powell and Pressburger season from Melbourne Cinémathèque in May (click on the season title to reveal individual films).",4.5
"Peeping Tom is an oddly beautiful film in its mundanity. It is perhaps the crowning jewel of the collection of my favourite kind of horror film: those that make you squirm at the realisation you’re perpetuating that delicate chain of voyeurism you condemn. The horror is soaked into the outdated wallpaper. Brilliant.
Other thoughts include the atmosphere; the fact it’s a haunted house film with more tangible yet invisible ghosts than any other; the fact that ironically you only ever see just enough and your perverted mind can fill in the rest; the influence on Manhunter; and the fact that the light is more terrifying than the dark. This will be on my mind for quite a while.",5.0

I loved the Moira Shearer dance sequence, which made me want to revisit The Red Shoes. The commitment to making Maxine Audley's character so unlikeable was audacious and definitely pays off.
Karlheinz Böhm's performance is also masterfully unsettling. His unexplained German accent adds menace to his character in the context of post-war London. This is compounded by his character's disturbing backstory and the way it is revealed in the film.",4.5

Rewatching this after having seen more of Michael Powell’s filmography, this actually felt less out of place than I was expecting it too.

It’s a groundbreaking masterclass in terror and tension, that would go on to influence so many great films and understandably so.

"Though Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho gets most of the freak love as far as films released in the year 1960 go (and rightfully so -- it's my favorite movie!), Peeping Tom, directed by the now-single Michael Powell, is just as fucked up, if not more so, than the Hitchcock classic. Here, Freudian concepts drift into their Lacanian conception of psychoanalysis by focusing on the gaze and, more importantly, the mirror. The film follows an obviously mentally disturbed young man, played by Carl Boehm (in real life the son of a notable classical music conductor), who is serially killing women and filming the murders. His camera is modified in a strange way that is revealed near the end of the film, so I'll spare you a description. (This is also a critique of the power of film, a critique I'll leave to others.) The film is exceptionally seedy for the early 1960s, as our murderer has a side-hustle selling pornography. As shocking as the killings are throughout the movie, the reveal at the end about the motivation behind them is straight-up bone-chilling. The only thing keeping this one from being an all-time favorite for me is Boehm's acting, which is a little too on the nose, to the point of being bad, to deliver its scares sufficiently. Still, this is a once-deplored film that, thanks to the efforts of Martin Scorsese, has had its reputation rightfully recovered and is now viewed for the twisted classic it is!",4.0
"Peeping Tom is a dark and riveting thriller about a psychotic filmmaker who murders women and records the act on his camera. It's directed by Michael Powell who was famous for his collaborations with Emeric Pressburger on features such as Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes although this solo effort is far more disturbing and less accessible than the Powell and Pressburger productions. Despite the subject matter this film isn't particularly gruesome or provocative but it's genuinely disturbing and creepy at times, not least because there are aspects of the lead character that make him slightly sympathetic despite his horrendous actions. The more violent sequences are really effective and there's one long scene involving Moira Shearer who starred in The Red Shoes that is incredibly memorable in the way it builds up tension while creating some really powerful imagery. However, the entire film is engaging without a single dull moment in the story and it builds to an ending that is shocking but superbly satisfying at the same time. To begin with I thought the lead performance wasn't that great but then I realised that firstly the actor wasn't English and secondly he's playing someone who has had almost no human contact for most of his life so it gradually became apparent that this is actually an incredibly effective performance that manages to shape one of the most distinctive and twisted characters that I have seen. His vocal delivery and physical performance are both so unique and it creates a protagonist that will live long in the memory. The thing that really stands out apart from the generally disturbing and powerful nature of the story is the cinematography and the way that the camera within the film is also used to capture some fantastic POV shots and unique angles. There are so many memorable images here due to the positioning of the camera more than anything and this combined with the colouring on the sets makes this movie extremely visually stylish and exciting to watch. The sound design and editing are fantastic as well and from a directorial standpoint this feels like someone working at the peak of their powers so it's a shame that the film pretty much ended Michael Powell's career because it was a bit too disturbing for people in 1960. The only issue I might have is that the character of Helen is written in a way where she comes across as quite stupid and also somewhat annoying although I guess it would be difficult to create the same amount of tension if she didn't fall in love with Carl. In truth it doesn't make much sense that nobody finds him suspicious until the end considering that everytime he opens his mouth it's quite clear that he's insane. However, this isn't really a problem because Peeping Tom works through the strength of its story, cinematography and pacing that together with a memorable lead performance create a disturbing and atmospheric film which is impossible to take your eyes off.

"Schocktober 2022 - Film Nr. 22
Die Ambition hinter Peeping Tom finde ich bemerkenswert. Denn beim Protagonisten handelt es sich um einen Serienmörder mit einer Kamera - und das 1960. Er filmt seine Opfer im Moment ihres Todes.
Allerdings liegt im Entstehungsjahr auch der Hund begraben, denn wirklich gezeigt wird hier nichts. Man vertraut beinahe gänzlich auf die Vorstellungskraft der Zuschauer. Das nimmt dem Film den Schrecken genauso, wie das theaterhafte Schauspiel und der ebensolche szenische Handlungsfortschritt.

"Peeping Tom kam 1960 heraus, im gleichen Jahr wie Psycho und hatte ein recht ähnliches Sujet. Doch wo Psycho bei allem Verschieben der Geschmacksgrenzen und Sehgewohnheiten als Meisterwerk gefeiert wurde und Hitchcock noch mal einen riesigen Hit bescherte, war für Peeping Tom ein ganz anderes Schicksal vorherbestimmt: die Rezeption als „schlecht“ zu bezeichnen wäre wohl die Untertreibung des Jahrhunderts. Als Schund wurde der Film beinahe flächendeckend gebrandmarkt. Und dies zerstörte die Karriere des Regisseurs Michael Powell und war für die…",4.0
"Currently the UK is experiencing a heatwave our national weather service is describing as “oppressive” so comfortably sitting down and watching some high quality cinema is far more difficult than it usually would be. This was the case with Peeping Tom, a film that was so controversial when it was released it ended the career of its director Michael Powell. Is this a career ender or a maligned masterpiece that deserves a reappraisal. 
It’s very much the latter. Peeping Tom…",4.5

"Great movie, had heard that this is considered one of the first slasher movies for a while so finally got to check it out. A little different from how i expected, it was 1960 after all, but I read that some of the cut footage was never recovered which is too bad. Interesting that this movie dives so deep into the mind of the killer which you don't see in many later slasher films. It's much more disturbing to see…",4.5
"Peeping Tom offers a fascinating look into the psychology of a killer, and does it in a very mature and authentic way… especially for being in 1960!!
I had only seen this film once before, and I recently bought it on bluray! My god, it’s such a fantastic film. I think this might be my favorite Michael Powell film, and it’s for sure one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.",4.5
"So. Freaking. Good. I'm kind of speechless after that ending... This movie may have ruined Powell's career, but it also cemented his legacy. Supremely underrated, and worth every minute of it's run time. A must watch for horror fans and I will have to revisit it at a later date to give it a proper review.",4.5

"Might be a 10 later but a wowwwwzeee wowzers
What a film! No wonder people compare this to Hitchcock. Not only does deal with similar topics Hitchcock is known for, but the presentation is so perfect and captivating it might as well be a Hitchcock film. But Micheal Powell does something truly special here, tapping into some seriously dangerous ideas and exploring them in such a horrific way yet it never feels like it’s condescending to those mentally concerned.

"It is a great shame that this ended the career of Michael Powell, this is such a enthralling movie, so much to take in and think about.

There was a scene in it that actually made me feel like I was a peeping tom and morbidly gazing , it made me shiver.",4.0
"Psycho may get most of the plaudits when it comes to 1960 slashers, but Peeping Tom serves as the more penetrative progenitor of modern horror as we know it, even if the craft isn’t equally matched to that of Hitchcock’s classic. It’s a mighty close affair, however, and Peeping Tom holds up extremely well due to how ahead of its time it was. Its provocative nature even seems controversial by today’s standards — it examines the relationships between sex and violence, art and authors, creators and consumers, all explored in a manner we’d likely see from the likes of Lars Von Trier at his most cavalier. It’s a shame that it essentially destroyed the career of director Michael Powell upon release, but Martin Scorsese became a huge fan, and subsequently introduced Powell to his soon-to-be wife, Thelma Schoonmaker, so it’s not all bad news.",4.0
"A slick, lurid psycho-thriller decades ahead of its time in both style and content. Carl Boehm as Mark Lewis gives a haunting performance equally as powerful in its iconicism as Anthony Perkins in Psycho or Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver - with his expressionless face and large, moist eyes his character is imbued with a vulnerability that makes his bizarre pathology all the more frightening and unpredictable to watch. Mark’s murders are not spontaneous or malicious, instead they are portrayed as almost mechanically inevitable - the logical outcome of traumas that occurred years before the film takes place. Right from the start we are trapped in the mindset of someone at the mercy of very dark instincts and the obscurity of those instincts and how they manifest at any given moment is what makes Peeping Tom so unsettling.
That’s not to say that the character of Mark resists analysis - his fascination with death and capturing his victim’s likeness in a state of utter terror could be seen as his way of processing, or “owning” the abuse he faced as a child, and in fact this process is eerily similar to what drives a lot of artists interested in telling darker stories. Cinema is inherently voyeuristic after all, and in Peeping Tom this is taken to its logical conclusion (the fact that Mark’s go-to murder weapon is a camera tripod is a not-so-subtle indication of this). By drawing a direct parallel between Mark’s psychology and the psychology of your average audience member seeking catharsis in the gaudy shocks of a horror movie director Michael Powell directly implicates the viewer, forcing us to acknowledge our obsession with aesthetic representations of sex and violence through the unhealthy fixations of a genuine sociopath.
Speaking of aesthetics, this is one of the most stylistically sumptuous films of the 1960s, on par with Hitchcock’s Vertigo in terms of movies that make you go “wait, they were doing that all the way back then?” It’s a movie that comes across as very contemporary, bursting with lurid primary colours, rich production design, immaculate framing and a camera that glides sinisterly around the artifice like a lion closing in on a gazelle - despite the lack of on-screen blood or nudity Peeping Tom feels incredibly titillating for its time and I’m not surprised reception to it was originally so hostile (just look at all the nonsense surrounding Joker last year). It’s a sign of great filmmaking when so much can be expressed through just colour and editing, and ultimately Peeping Tom’s reliance on implication over exploitation, whether due to the restrictions of the time or not, is part of what makes it such an enduring film. A true classic, and well worth watching if you like Alfred Hitchcock, Brian DePalma, Nicholas Winding Refn, David Fincher or pretty much any of the hundreds of filmmakers who were almost certainly inspired by this thing.",4.0
"Peeping Tom came out the same year as Psycho, both are today recognised as great, boundry pushing, psychological thrillers, yet while Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation, Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's. While Hitch used his films disturbing subject matter to enhance his reputation for the frightening, gory and strange. Michael Powell was the man who (along with Emeric Pressburger) had made such ""safe"" and prestigious technicolor fare as The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus and A Matter Of Life And Death. In fact Powell's films were never anywhere near as safe as their reputation suggests, but then again Hitch's were never quite as horrific or macabre as his, deliberately fostered, reputation suggested either. If Hitch had made Peeping Tom himself, I don't think the fury would have been as intense, but I also doubt it would have found the ready market that Psycho did.
The fury that Peeping Tom provoked on it's initial truncated release, being banned with a few days of release, all but destroyed Powell's later career and he made few more films other than a couple of minor productions in Australia. Still Peeping Tom has lived, it eventually found a market in the underground film scene and has been championed by such later filmmakers as Scorsese.
Watching Peeping Tom today as far as graphic sex and violence goes it's pretty tame stuff, but that doesn't stop it being profoundly disturbing. The sleazy atmosphere, gaudy colours and repressed attitudes all coupled with Powell's superb cinematography is a heady combination. As is the sight of Moira Shearer dancing once again in a Michael Powell production, but one a million miles from The Red Shoes, not that her ultimate fate is any better there than here. The sight of such a beloved dancer and actress in such a nasty, taudry film didn't help it with the snobby self righteous critics either.
For my money although Hitchcock may be the greatest filmmaker Britain ever produced, it took Hollywood to finally realise his genius, but Michael Powell was probably Britain's greatest filmmaker, a true unpindownable artist in an industry that didn't appreciate the extent of his worth.",4.5
"Viewed on DVD Criterion Collection #58
Peeping Tom (1960) has been dubbed The British Psycho (1960). Released the same year as Psycho (1960), there is no doubt the two films share a similar theme including a killer with parental issues, but I feel the comparisons stop there.
Peeping Tom (1960) is more about filmmaking than anything else.
Mark is obsessed with capturing fear on celluloid no matter what the cost.
Peeping Tom (1960) is a wonderful psychological thriller but was panned upon its release. So much so, it ruined the career of director Michael Powell.
Hopefully, time has righted this wrong.",4.0
"The daddy of serial killer films, Peeping Tom is a brilliant unsettling and disturbing film that stupidly received heavy vitriol upon release, vitriol which sadly tarnished Michael Powell, his reputation and career. Odd considering Hitchcock's Psycho - released just three months later- cemented his reputation and bathed him in glory.
Much is said of Powell and scriptwriter Leo Marks' empathic approach to the killer, Mark Lewis (played with soft spoken precision by Karlheinz Böhm) but to be honest I never really have any sympathy for him (who could feel sympathy for someone who kills a Moira Shearer character?!) For me, Mark is neither hero nor anti-hero. What the film actually does is present it from his POV (integral given the film is about his being a voyeur and capturing the final moments of his victims on film) making no concessions or apologies but instead simply allowing the audience to see that things are not black and white, that criminals are not 'monsters' devoid of humanity but merely ordinary people who are capable of performing horrible evil acts for whatever reason. As such Mark is shown not only to kill, but to have compassion and feelings for others. Much is also shown of there being some way of understanding Mark's heinous acts through exploration of his background and upbringing and how that has formed his psyche.
I cannot imagine what a revelation that must have been for the audience at the time - an audience who may have been more accustomed to more simplistic cinema, of seeing good guys in white hats and bad guys in black - but it certainly must have been hard to swallow or tolerate given the hard time the film was unfairly given.
As Powell's career in films in the UK lay in tatters, some twelve years after Peeping Tom, Hitchcock returned to his native country to make Frenzy, a film with a link to Peeping Tom in that it also starred Anna Massey. Legend has it that Hitch had Massey's character's cruelly dispatched in his movie as a direct result of her surviving in this. Hitchcock could get away with such things, alas for Powell it was only in the mid to late 70s that a new hype formed around Peeping Tom (with Scorsese citing it as a major influence) and a major reappraisal began to occur to allow the film to finally take the respect it had always been due.",4.5
"Is Peeping Tom the greatest film about film there is? It may well be. I have a fond affinity for this level of self-reflexivity; I guess as a cinephile, spending my days watching film after film, it's fascinating to see the darker side of my passion brought to life. It helps immeasurably to have it so brought by a director as brilliant as Michael Powell. The performance he gets from Karlheinz Böhm is among the most distressingly sympathetic portrayals I've ever seen, the way he frames his story with great visuals adding vastly to the core concepts of film's perverse invasiveness. It's always interesting to compare Peeping Tom to the contemporaneous Psycho: people tend to wonder why the latter renovated Hitchcock's name where the former destroyed Powell's. It's no great mystery, when you consider it: Powell has the daring to not only show us the murderer for who he is from the very start, but also to show us that we and he are one. His sadism is ours, his sick obsessions with the captured image no sicker than that we too display. It's tough to be shown the perversity of your passion, but maybe a crucial part of being passionate is embracing the follies therewith associated. No cinephile should be without the experience of Peeping Tom; it's as crucial a depiction of our minds as it is a dark and troubling one.",5.0
"Thoroughly disturbing classic film about a serial killer (eerily serene Karlheinz Bohm) who films himself murdering women. It's a fascinating and hugely influential film, especially in its deconstructive exploration of how the camera eye can function as a distancing effect and can desensitize one to violence.
PEEPING TOM came out the same year as PSYCHO, and it's pretty interesting to see how they complement each other in many ways. Both are about reclusive loners with severe parental issues and sexual hang-ups (here, it's pretty strongly implied that he masturbates while watching the footage of his murders and his camera is frequently used as a phallic symbol) who are helpless against their murderous urges. What is different about this film, however, (besides all the British accents) is that instead of Hitchcock's smooth B&W photography, it is shot in true Michael (THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, BLACK NARCISSUS) Powell style, meaning lots of luscious colors and elaborate sets, which makes for an interesting counterpoint to the tawdry subject matter.
I had never seen PEEPING TOM before, but it was pretty suspenseful and unsettling to me even now, so I can hardly imagine how it must have rocked peoples' boats back in 1960.",4.5

As vezes eu me impressiono bastante com o quão complexas algumas obras do passado podem ser. Não por duvidar da capacidade dos nossos antigos de sentirem e entenderem o mundo a sua volta, mas sim, porque raramente essas obras eram bem vistas na época que foram feitas - sempre lembro da história que Psicose (1960) escandalizou, não só pela violência e referências a sexualidade, mas por filmar a descarga de uma privada: faz com que o público mais antigo pareça bem antiquado. Saber que essa obra, Peeping Tom, causou uma grande queda na carreira do seu diretor, só me faz acreditar mais nisso.
Difícil negar que os assuntos trabalhados aqui são temas que até hoje temos dificuldade de debater, especialmente da forma apresentada aqui. Vemos o mundo pela perspectiva de nosso protagonista, o assassino da obra - evento raro na época -, um jovem cheio de complexidades mentais e comportamentais. As comparações com Norman Bates são bem fundamentadas - duas figuras maldosas, porém vítimas de tragédias da sua psiquê -, apesar de Mark ser bem mais consciente de suas ações e consequências.
E o maior pulo do gato é um entendimento que me fascina desde que vi De Palma explicando: a relação da natureza do cinema com o voyeurismo; o entendimento que ser telespectador é ser voyeur. O filme se constrói a partir disso e é realmente um sacada genial.
Um comentário aqui do Letterboxd me fez refletir: temos que, também, dar a esse filme o crédito de ter sido um percussor do slasher? Na minha opinião, claro que sim! Já está na hora de coroar Powell como um dos diretores mais influentes do terror.",5.0

Shy movie studio hand Carl Boehm moonlights as a photographer of scantily clad women, while obsessively working on his own perverse movie with the world’s most lethal tripod. An uncharacteristic thriller-slash-horror movie by the co-director of THE RED SHOES (whose prima ballerina, Moira Shearer, is featured here) that was critically savaged on first release, effectively ending Powell’s career.

Peeping Tom is like another lost Hitchcock film that wasn't directed by Hitchcock. Mark (Carl Boehm) films a prostitute named Dora (Brenda Bruce) and murders her. Mark wants to become a famous director just like his peers. It comes apparent that something is happening psychologically to Mark and the people around him. Obviously, I cant spoil it but Peeping Tom is sorta a thrill ride. Vibrant and gorgeous colors, clash with the brutality of Mark's human nature.
All of it seems in tuned to the murder mystery camp of the early 60's/late 50's. I can see why people think that, this is on-par with Hitchcock's other great works. I guess voyeurism was a thing back then with all these murder mysteries.",3.5
"This felt ahead of its time with the found footage aspect and partially sympathizing with the killer. Also back when it was made, you didn’t have the internet which it’s easy to look up videos of people dying by just pulling up your phone and typing it in (I don’t recommend it either).
I loved the overall look of the movie, the lighting and colors made everything on screen pop. It’s a shame that this essentially ended Michael Powell’s career, but in all honesty it’s better to have a film bomb and be acclaimed 60 years later than it is to be big at first then forgotten about.",4.0
"Often referred to as “the first slasher” and apparently, it cost the director his career because of how reviled it was upon release. Peeping Tom is a fantastic slow burn of a horror film that is finally getting the recognition it deserves. Its focus on the characters above all else makes this a really interesting entry to the slasher genre. It may not be very bloody or gory, but it is effective and creepy. It’s also engaging even if it’s slower than you’d expect for a “slasher”.
The movie it most reminded me of was the recent Joker film. They both portray the villain as the protagonist in a way that makes you almost uncomfortably empathetic to them. It felt very 60’s and very modern at the same time.",4.5
"For the first film of my 100 horror movies in 92 days challenge, I decided to watch what many consider to be the first slasher. 

Peeping Tom was released in the United Kingdom in 1960 but didn’t have an American release until 1962, two years after Psycho shocked the American movie going audience. Peeping Tom was not popular with critics because of it’s controversial subject matter. The main character, Mark Lewis, makes snuff films. The film would go on to be named one of the greatest British films ever. 
Karlheinz Böhm, billed as Carl Boehm, stars as Mark, a withdrawn young man who aspires to become a filmmaker, but he hides a shocking secret. He becomes close to neighbor Helen Stephens (Anna Massey) and she is inspired by his love of filmmaking to create a children’s story based around a magic camera. Helen, along with the audience, discovers that Mark’s father had an interest in fear and would often film his young son’s reaction to things. This traumatic experience led to Mark’s own horrific filming tendencies.
This is a very well made film that definitely deserves the praise it’s received over the years. It was the perfect film to kick off the film challenge I am attempting. I can’t guarantee I’ll stick with the challenge, but I’ll try.
Film 1/100",4.5
"""What paper are you from?""
""The Observer""
Michael Powell’s psychological horror film Peeping Tom is full of little in-jokes and self-reflexive touches like the one above. The scene takes place early in the film as cameraman and serial killer Mark is questioned on the street about his status when filming the scene of a murder he committed the night before. He is, of course, not really a newspaper journalist, but an observer of a different kind: one who enjoys filming women at the moment of their death.
It is not the only such reference in this explicitly metatextual film. At one point a friend produces a pornographic picture from his pocket and quips: “You don’t get that in Sight & Sound”. It is these allusions that set it apart from Rear Window (1954), probably the canonical “voyeur” movie. I’m not certain that the word “voyeur” even features in the Hitchcock film (incidentally, the expression “peeping Tom” does), but I am absolutely certain it does not make reference to scoptophilia. Michael Powell’s movie does both, long before the synonym term scopophilia became associated with the “male gaze” in art and cinema (notably in the work of John Berger and Laura Mulvey, respectively).
Hitchcock – with whom Powell worked at the beginning of his career – is very much the elephant in the room here, not only due to the echoes of Rear Window but also Psycho, released the same year as Peeping Tom. Powell’s film somewhat reverses the Rear Window’s premise by making the man behind the camera both voyeur and killer. It is impossible not to think of Psycho, meanwhile, not only because of plot similarities but also diverging reactions to the two movies and their respective filmmakers. While Psycho cemented Hitch’s legacy as the master of suspense, Peeping Tom saw its director completely ostracized, his career destroyed.
Psycho, it should be remembered, also revolves around a murderous voyeur, one who watches a woman – hitherto assumed to be the main character – undress before stabbing her to death in the shower. Peeping Tom is certainly no more visceral, but legend has it that audience members refused to shake Powell’s hand after its premiere, portending the broader disgust that would meet the film. Perhaps due to the illusion-breaking, filmmaking milieu in which much of the action takes place, the public found itself unable to distinguish between the film world and its creator. What is understood today as self-reflexive deconstruction of the medium did not apparently provide the kind of ironic distance that protected Hitch.
With the play of perspectives – notably witnessing the murders through Mark’s viewfinder – Powell was asking the viewer to confront the voyeurism of spectatorship itself. Mark’s camera-cum-murder weapon is also fitted with a mirror so that its victims can see themselves as he films them die. Indeed, the film is doing something similar to viewers in reflecting their ugly desires back at them. Moreover, it is possible that what bothered audiences more than the violence (most of it implied rather than actually represented) were the references to prostitution and pornography, the open secrets of society that were not yet deemed suitable themes for cinema. All this makes Peeping Tom perhaps the first great British moral panic on the eve of the so-called Permissive Society, anticipating future fearmongering over video nasties and snuff movies which was stoked up by the gutter press but often backed by politicians and conservative campaign groups.
If I have made it sound that Peeping Tom is one long metatextual clin d’œil then that is to overlook other queasily troubling aspects of the movie. Despite the exploitation elements that predict the slasher movies of the 70s and beyond, Mark’s behaviour is given context. We learn that he was subject to abuse from his father, also a cameraman who enjoyed filming people when they were terrified. The fact that Powell himself played the voice of the father behind the camera, in Mark’s screenings of these “experiments”, no doubt added to the absurd perception that the director was in some way implicated in what is shown on screen.
In tone, the Hitchcock movie Peeping Tom most reminded me of was Marnie, in which the titular character’s behaviour is finally revealed as a consequence of childhood trauma. It also shares with Marnie an extraordinarily vivid colour palette that looks forward to Italian gialli horror and, most markedly, the early movies of Brian De Palma (especially Blow Out, with which it shares some thematic preoccupations). If I have any complaints it would be that German-Austrian actor Karlheinz Böhm does not have quite the range of Anthony Perkins or, notably, Dirk Bogarde, who was first approached for the role (and would have been perfect). With his slightly Germanic accent and intonation, he seems somewhat miscast in much the same way that Oskar Werner is in Fahrenheit 451 (1966). Where Perkins was able to convey vulnerability and latent violence simultaneously, I found it hard to believe mild-mannered Böhm capable of the acts he is shown doing. Otherwise, essential cinema.",4.0
"Directed by Michael Powell, one half of the legendary directing duo The Archers, Peeping Tom is considered to be the first ever slasher.

"Can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
Striking a come-hither pose for the camera while drolly recounting the banal details of her love life, Milly asks Mark the above question; simultaneous to performing as a female object for the male gaze of the camera, Millie establishes the subjecthood that gaze erases. The male fantasy those photographs market cannot acknowledge Millie's abused reality.
Later in Peeping Tom, a film director exhausts an actress until she feints on camera and later forces her to relive a traumatic experience to get a usable take. An avatar for countless filmmakers before and after him, this director's mentality echoes Hitchcock torturing Tippi Hedren in The Birds, Kubrick berating Shelley Duvall in The Shining, and Bertolucci orchestrating the rape of Maria Schneider. The pain does not matter as long as it serves the final product, largely because the final product will paper over that pain, leaving it just outside the frame.
Of course, Mark's mission in the film - to capture a moment of honest terror - comes from a similar inclination, seeking to preserve authentic trauma while keeping the perpetrator (himself) outside the image. Psychologically, this compulsion stems from Mark's own need to recognize the fear he experienced as a child in the faces of others (the women are for him akin to the mirror he attaches to his camera). Whatever Mark, the director, or any filmmaker intends, however, as the cinematic image ""fixes it so the bruises don't show"" it likewise indexes the reality that went into that image's creation. We just have to peep below the surface to see it.",5.0
"We all tend to agree that Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" changed movie thrillers forever, but people often forget that Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM beat him to the punch by only a few weeks. A similar psychological case study of a serial killer, Powell (sans Pressburger) really digs deep into the killer's mind by making him the protagonist. Sure, Hitch gave us a few choice scenes of Norman Bates talking about himself, but we would learn that he was not to be trusted and wasn't even entirely aware of who he was himself. Karlheinz Böhm's killer knows exactly who he is and desperately wants to tell us. He strips himself bare and keeps giving others the clues to solve who he is and why, perhaps hopeful that he'll be discovered and stopped since he's not capable of stopping himself. While less iconic than ""Psycho,"" I think I prefer the subtleties of this film more, with Powell just as deserving as ""master filmmaker"" status as we routinely bestow upon Hitchcock.

But what a departure! Together Powell & Pressburger made such a wide range of light comedies, epic dramas, fantasy fables, and horrors of war. But nothing in his previous work really suggested that Powell had this film in him. Not to mention that this didn't come on the heels of anything really similar that it could imitate. This was a bold experiment, practically inventing its own genre. If the film is less terrifying than a typical Hitchcock film, it's perhaps because the film is too beautiful to ever be mistaken for a real life threat. The staging of each scene is masterful, with my favorite images being the depth of field when Böhm is stalking his next victim, completely unaware that he's being followed himself by the police. The layers of actors on multiple planes is something to behold. We also get a dance reprise from Moira Shearer with just as grisly an end to her performance as she got in ""The Red Shoes."" There's so much in this film to embrace, and as the one real genre outlier in Powell's canon, it's worth dissecting his whole career just to see the innocent seeds that sprouted into something so unexpected.",4.5

Both Michael Powell and Alfred Hitchcock made movies about young serial killers in 1960. So why was only one man’s career effectively ended?

Karlheinz Böhm als Teufel mit Engelsgesicht ist einfach faszinierend. Und die Filmlänge fühlt sich sehr kurzweilig an.
Ich habe viel zu loben, aber dennoch hatte ich am Ende einfach nicht das Gefühl, einen wirklich außergewöhnlichen Film gesehen zu haben - vor allem nicht, was die Handlung betrifft, denn da gibt es heutzutage deutlich spannendere Filme.",3.5
"Perhaps the best Hitchcockian movie that Alfred Hitchcock didn't direct (that's not meant to take credit away from Powell who was a major director in his own right, I just haven't seen many of his movies). The psychological exploration of voyeurism, child abuse, and sexual repression keep this movie ticking along. Nothing is all that shocking (at least by today's standards), but I loved the way our killer needed to set the scene first before he could go through with his murders. Reading some of the reviews from critics at the time is pretty funny, one person compared Powell to the Marquis de Sade... which I think is a tad hyperbolic even taking into account some of the content in this movie. I'm not sure if this is the first movie to place the audience into the perspective of the serial killer, but it is certainly an effect choice.",3.5
"A remarkable experiment in sustained tension, Peeping Tom is a timeless portrayal of voyeurism. Powell manages to capture two versions of Böhm’s Mark Lewis: the horrific predator and the sympathetic product of an unaffectionate and abusive father. I love that this film about photography uses such unique methods like point-of-view, and made even better with a narrative reason.",4.0
"Peeping Tom is labelled as one of the proto-slasher films, usually alongside Psycho, which came out the same year. The film explores some subjects that were considered to be taboo at the time so for that reason the film is a huge influence on horror and a film that is ahead of its time.
The film's lead is actually the serial killer, which obviously wasn't common in the 1960s. Besides that there is some effort made to feel empathetic towards the murderer by revealing some abuse from his childhood. Carl Boehm is excellent in the lead role, showing just enough personality while remaining mostly cold and creepy.
The film looks quite good still, but I do think it shows its age a bit. Maybe after watching dozens of films that were influenced by this one it results in this film seeming a bit flat. I'm not that familiar with British films of the era so I may have struggled to connect with it a bit for that reason. Its a movie I respect more than I like, and its obviously beloved by many, so my good not great opinion shouldn't mean a great deal to anyone interested in checking this one out.",3.5
"Rewatching Peeping Tom on the day of its 60th anniversary, I find it surprisingly a more profoundly disturbing film than Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) in terms of its subversive sordidness, consistent empathetic POV from the perpetrator, meta allegory of filmmaking itself. Shoot in exuberant colors that could match Douglas Sirk’s melodrama and the ingenious use of light and projection, particularly in the darkroom and the studio set where the killer films the panic-stricken face of his victim, Michael Powell explicitly links…",5.0

This was probably a real sock knocker in 1960, and it's still effective today despite a few meandering scenes. Great performances too.",3.5
"Apparently, so shocking in 1960 that it ended Michael Powell's career. Obviously not shocking at all today, but it's easy to see how ground breaking it was and how influential it's been. It's a great film and Powell is a master film maker, as he demonstrated on many occasions.
I actually thought that bits from 'Frenzy' were from this, so thought I'd better see what all the fuss was about. I was a little underwhelmed by today's standards, but it is a must for all horror fans, as it's influence can be seen on so many films since.",3.5

"The film cinematography in this is gorgeous. Every inch of set design, costume design, makeup design, hair, location and lighting is all perfect in creating the aesthetic here. It feels real enough, it never breaks reality in the way something like Argento’s Suspiria does, but it feels stylish and wonderful to look at. Being a mainstream film from 1960, of course it doesn’t go too deep into the perverted voyeurism, keeping itself restrained and focused more on the psychology of the main character and his symbiotic relationship to his camera rather than to the actual shock of the murders themselves. We’re only shown one on screen death throughout the entire runtime. I don’t even think we’re shown any of the victims’ corpses, leaving so much of it up to the imagination. But that just adds to the style of the film. That so much of it is left up to the imagination of the audience, we almost become perverted voyeurs in imagining what these gruesome killings could look like, what could’ve happened to Mark as a child, where we only see glimpses of what was filmed by his father’s camera. We don’t see the expressions on the victims’ faces, that of pure fear, either. The limitations of the time used to further the subtext, to immerse us and let us as the audience fall into the psychology of this film.",4.5

Mark Lewis is an assistant cameraman. To earn some extra cash, he takes raunchy pictures of girls that the owner of the local newsagent can sell in his shop. But Mark is also a socially awkward psychopath. He likes to film women...before he kills them...
'Peeping Tom' is a British psychological horror/thriller and true classic from 1960.
It's been regarded as (one of) the first slasher movie(s). It covers themes like child abuse, sadomasochism and fear.
It reminded me a bit of 'Psycho', because that too revolves around a killer who's obsessed by his parents. But 'Peeping Tom' hasn't been influenced by 'Psycho', because it was released earlier. Maybe the director read the book by Robert Bloch ('Psycho' 1959) and got some ideas from that?
Some parts from 'Peeping Tom' feel a bit dated nowadays and the raunchy bits must have been shocking in 1960, but are nothing compared to an average modern music video.
It's always cool to watch movies like these that have been groundbreaking and have been an inspiration to countless directors and creators after it.

"🇩🇪Deutsche Review ist Unten⬇️⬇️⬇️
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇺🇸During the day, the unassuming Mark Lewis works as a camera assistant in a film studio. His colleagues appreciate him, and no one suspects that as a child he was abused by his father for psychological experiments as part of his scientific research. The renowned psychology professor and author regularly woke his son up at night and terrified him. He meticulously recorded the reactions with a camera and tape recorder: a horror that remains etched in his memory.
I think it's so nice to read about the movie after it comes out, because when it came out in 1960 it was a scandal, nobody liked it and the press and critics talked it down, but today it's one of the landmark movies of the genre with its story and theme, and there could have been many reasons why people didn't like it back then.I found the themes in the story very exciting because I remember when I was scared in Jumanji (1995) when the giant mosquito breaks through the window pane, I know that my mom said to me back then that it's just a movie, and that's exactly what I think peeping Tom did so well, because everything the audience sees in his movie is real, so you could also call it a snuff movie.
Why Mark Lewis, played by Karlheinz Böhm, does this is normal nowadays for the characterization of killers.disturbed environment or trauma from youth.the murder weapon is then again a highlight because I have not seen anything like it.but I found it fits Mark's personality.I didn't find the terror that the film captures bad at all and the rest of the cast is great.a great slasher movie in my opinion.the colors and the set are also well chosen and enhance the film again.

🇩🇪Tagsüber arbeitet der unscheinbare Mark Lewis als Kameraassistent in einem Filmstudio. Seine Kollegen schätzen ihn, und niemand ahnt, dass er als Kind von seinem Vater für psychologische Experimente im Rahmen seiner wissenschaftlichen Forschungsarbeit missbraucht wurde. Regelmäßig weckte der renommierte Psychologieprofessor und Autor seinen Sohn nachts auf und versetzte ihn in Angst und Schrecken. Mit Kamera und Tonband hielt er minutiös die Reaktionen fest: ein Horror, der sich einprägte.
Ich finde es bei dem Film so schön nachdem Film noch etwas drüber zu lesen.Den 1960 als der Film rauskam war der Film ein Skandal niemand mochte und die Presse und Kritiker haben ihn schlecht geredet.Heute zählt er mit seiner Geschichte und mit seinem Thema zu einem der Wegweiser Film des Genre.Warum die Leute ihn damals ihn nicht mochten kann viele Gründe gehabt haben.Ich fand die Themen in der Story sehr spannend den ich weiß noch damals als ich Angst gehabt hatte.Bei Jumanji(1995) wenn der Riesen Moskito die Fenster Scheibe durchbricht.Ich weiß das meine Mam damals zu mir sagte es ist nur ein Film.Genau diesen Aspekt finde ich peeping Tom so super aufgefasst.Den alles was die Zuschauer in seinen Film sehen ist echt.Daher könnte man auch von einem Snuff Film reden.
Der Film hat mich sonst sehr unterhalten.Warum Mark Lewis gespielt von Karlheinz Böhm das macht ist heutzutage für Charakterisierung der Killer normal.Gestörtes Umfeld oder auch Trauma aus der Jugend.Die Mordwaffe ist dann aber nochmal ein Highlight den sowas habe ich auch noch nicht gesehen.Fand ich aber passt zur Persönlichkeit von Mark.Ich fand den Terror den der Film einfängt gar nicht schlecht und auch der restliche Cast ist super.Ein Klasse slasher Film wie ich finde.Die Farben und das Set sind auch gut gewählt und Werten den Film nochmal auf.",4.0

"Escrito por Leo Marks e dirigido por Michael Powell, A Tortura do Medo é um thriller psicológico e terror (precursor do subgênero slasher) que explora o potencial da agressividade por trás das câmeras, unindo o sadismo ao voyeurismo, o que motivou o título em inglês: Peeping Tom.
Seguimos o fotógrafo Mark Lewis (Karlheinz ""Carl"" Boehm), que, com alta inclinação ao sadomasoquismo e ao fetichismo escopofílico, é obcecado por gravar e assistir belas mulheres morrendo, ao ponto de ter uma sala especial em seu apartamento para revelar seus filmes sem ser pego.
Mark é um jovem tímido e recluso que, fora de seu trabalho de meio período, dedica-se a enganar e assassinar mulheres para capturar o horror de suas faces diante da morte. Contudo, em um desses casos, torna-se amigo de uma de suas potenciais vítimas, Helen Stephens (Anna Massey).
Acompanhada de uma trilha sonora moderna em piano composta por Brian Easdale e executada por Gordon Watson, com melodias contrastantes e tensões dissonantes, a cinematografia alterna entre uma câmera autorreflexiva em primeira pessoa e planos fechados em interiores isolados.
Apesar de seu suspense mediano conduzido a um desfecho um tanto artificioso, o filme combina, de modo ousado e brilhante, um argumento psicanalítico com o uso da câmera em seu potencial de violar um ator, despindo-o de seu papel e congelando-o em seus últimos momentos de vida.",4.5

"This and Psycho were released the same year, and both serve as the very foundation of the whole slasher genre. It is cool watching the film and noticing the roots of tropes and common elements. The main character himself being a prototype for numerous future killers. As a character I found him interesting, although pretty unsatisfying. The use of color was incredible. Really loved how this film looked visually. Pacing is a little slow and certain stretches feel sort of pointless, but overall quite good.",4.0
"Gran manera de ver y pensar el cine. Esta película abre una discusión casi implícita de qué es más importante al momento de hacer una película. Por un lado está Arthur Baden, el director de estudio, con todos los recursos técnicos a disposición y un equipo gigante de gente, pero que aún así no logra plasmar en una toma la actuación cercana a la realidad que pretende; mientras que Mark hace de esa realidad casi su único recurso. La presencia del dispositivo es precisamente la que quita la cuota de realidad en las actuaciones, que se ven interpeladas directamente por toda esa parafernalia que grita ""ESTO ES FICCIÓN"". Mark no tiene ese ambiente de estudio, ni en la disposición técnica ni en el conocimiento de sus víctimas, quienes no saben que están a punto de ser protagonistas de una historia brutal producto de los traumas de la infancia de un pobre tipo. Sin embargo, así como Arthur no logra su toma ideal después de 53 tomas y pide que impriman la toma 1 (que probablemente haya sido la más espontánea dada la distención y naturalidad de los actores que se fue perdiendo a medida que grababan más y más veces lo mismo), Mark sólo tiene una oportunidad de lograrlo, una toma única e irrepetible, justamente porque carece del despliegue técnico. Por eso podemos entenderlo cuando se frustra ante la toma de Viv que salió mal, porque sabe que no puede repetirla. Y también podemos entender la sensación contraria del director, que puede repetir infinita cantidad de tomas pero no lograr nunca lo que pretende. Otra diferencia radical entre ambos es que Arthur tiene el control total de lo que sucede en el set, la última decisión siempre pasa por él. Mark no tiene esa toma de decisión, en parte porque su movilizador a grabar ""películas"" es que simplemente no conoce otra forma de ver la realidad pero también porque su búsqueda le impide intervenir en eso que está grabando.
Como conclusión de esta cuestión, a Arthur como director le falta lo que tiene Mark y a Mark le falta lo que tiene Arthur. La carencia de ambos nos lleva a pensar que uno de los mensajes de esta película es, justamente, que el cine no es y nunca va a ser perfecto. O mejor dicho, nunca va a responder 100% a las expectativas de todos (léase como realizadores y espectadores). En cada forma diferente que existe de hacer cine siempre va a faltar algo que sí existe en otra forma, pero que de aplicarse, cambiaría totalmente el resultado.
Es por esto último que, al mismo tiempo que se genera esta compración implícita entre ambas formas, Michael Powell decide ponernos a nosotros espectadores en el lugar del director/camarógrafo. Por momentos nos encontramos involuntariamente detrás de una cámara por cómo está compuesto el encuadre, por momentos replicamos los movimientos que hace Mark cuando graba a sus víctimas, y por momentos somos simplemente técnicos ocupando nuestro espacio en el set, siendo parte de la parafernalia. Por eso no sólo se genera la dicotomía entre Arthur y Mark, entre la ficción pretendiendo ser realidad y la realidad pretendiendo ser ficcionalizada; sino que también está el espacio cinematográfico extradiegético, del que los personajes no están enterados pero nosotros sí, y que pone en juego todas estas cuestiones que estuve mencionando para que, incluso 64 años después, nos sigamos preguntando ¿qué es el cine?",4.5
"saw this at the american cinematheque's premiere of the new 4k restoration, and given powell's genius for color, set design, and composition, it's no surprise how amazing it looks. in karlheinz böhm, the peeping tom in question, michael powell found the perfect mix of peter o'toole and peter lorre. he's good-looking enough to get next to women, but vibes window-shade peeper and panty-sniffer in every scene. böhm plays a focus puller at a movie studio who moonlights on photo porn shoots. he also murders women and films them in the first person for a ""documentary"" he's making, following in his psychologist father's sadistic studies about fear – the very studies that turned his own son into a monster.
anyhoo, there's a funny scene early on in a london newsstand shop where pervs pick-up the latest issue of kamera club, a bettie page-style nude pin-up magazine, and one sweaty guy buys some of böhm's custom model photo shoots. it's a lot like george c. scott prowling porn stores in hardcore in his undercover 'stache and wig. there's no way to look cool in a porn store.
not all of peeping tom works. i wish powell could laugh more at the nightcrawler he and böhm created, bc he red flags weirdo every second, something everyone around him would eventually notice. powell paces it all pretty slow, and böhm's whole kink – getting off filming terrified women as they die – requires a suspension of disbelief. he needs a bell & howell handheld camera, proper lighting, and film reloads. he's got everything but a catering truck. i mean, how could he not get caught? he leaves empty film boxes at murder scenes and for some reason stages an elaborate murder at a movie studio on a film set where he works – but never seems to have considered someone might find the body? powell makes so many hitchcock references here – voyeurism, pop psychology, body hidden in a trunk – that it feels like he's making a film about hitchcock. idk, maybe he was.
anyway hitchcock came out with psycho in 1960 and reinvented himself a cinema god. powell released peeping tom in 1960 and reinvented himself a retiree, bc this one apparently ended his career.",0.0

"I can finally cross this one off my list. Oddly enough,
It’s a film I’ve known about forever and just had never watched it. The Slasher Film is one of my absolute favorite genres and this one is often cited as one of the first. Hmm, I can see it in the slight use of the POV shots, as our killer Mark likes to film his victims as he’s killing them. Though we never really see much of it. It is 1960 after all. Glad to cross this one off my list, for me personally, It didn’t feel anywhere near the craft of any of the Hitchcock films that deal with horror or thriller elements, but Hitch is a master so that’s not really a slight on this film. I wouldn’t consider this a Slasher personally, I’ve heard many consider it as such. I’ve also heard the term, Proto slasher, I guess I could come around to that one for this film.
I’d put PSYCHO from this same year as closer to a Slasher, Norman is atleast dressing up as his mother and is definitely a far more terrifying killer. Shit now I want to watch Psycho, such a classic.  
I have a few more films even older than this one that many consider Slashers that I’m still yet to see. I think next I may finally watch M - Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder from 1931, many call this the actual OG Slasher. At the moment Bay of Blood is one of the oldest to closely feel very Slasher to me, though it’s been a while since I’ve watched it. I need to give it a rewatch as well,  anyway on to the next one.

"The conclusion of the Second World War saw the seeds of pessimistic grit begin to take their root where devastation struck hardest, with Italy spearheading the trend with the rise of Neorealism. In other places, the idealistic foundations that had long cloistered the concept of cinema -- the comfort of cautionary, conservative and complacent escapism -- was beginning to collapse under the mounting collective weight of irreversible change and consequence. Workplace autonomy for women was viciously revoked in favor of fortifying domesticity and the Red Scare rippled through every echelon of Hollywood’s Elite with unforgiving violence; the safety of the Isolationist world was forever gone, yielding a newfound, reticent curiosity of more resonant reflection steeped in realism. Still, it was mired in risk: nobody wanted to undertake the endeavor in fear of jeopardizing their career.
Great innovation demands intrepidity at every corner --- a gamble where the odds of failure considerably outweigh success, albeit strictly speaking in the short term. Even still, in a contemporary age, we struggle to reckon with films that dare to venture in a darker direction, threatened by our own vulnerability and thus unwilling to make the emotional plight. Oftentimes we cling to the vestiges of willful blindness is a desperate bid to eschew such long standing revelations, reluctant to confront the darker facets of ourselves as reflected back to us on screen.
And yet, even by 1960 -- a year in which the rigidity of constraint was in evident flux -- Michael Powell’s PEEPING TOM created ripples of controversy with its unnerving precocity, to the extent that it effectively ended his prolific career. Two months later, another film touting similarly salacious themes was heralded with wondrous reverence in what was a most vexing, antithetical declaration. What was so damningly impermissible about Powell’s film-savvy, murderous voyeur that eluded Hitchock’s deranged and deadly mama’s boy? There’s an unmistakable specificity to the stricken nerve in question, one that not so much condemns the act of voyeurism as much as it does the mere insinuation that we are all willing and complicit participants.
Norman Bates can creep, leer, and snear to his heart’s content in existing as a separate component of a strictly fictional -- and thus, inconsequential -- story that bears no reflection of judgment on the viewer. His perversions are fine, as they are isolated incidents rooted in a torrent of fictional trauma specific only to his life as written. When stark boundaries are visible and in place, it allows for a comfortable separation between passivity and participation, helping the audience to remove themselves from the larger equation to zero in at textual face value.
In PEEPING TOM, we are all collectively complicit in Mark’s (Karlheinz Bohm) exploits, powerless to the piquant pull of his sordid affair -- and in doing so, begin to question our own ethical motivations in procuring cinematic escapism. Powell at times places us directly behind the camera as he pans in on horror, fusing our gaze with Mark’s in a rush of disquieting self-reflection and terror. It begs further reckoning: are we guilty by association, defenseless bystanders, too rapt by spectacle of it all to take any agency or accountability of our own?
Powell’s design is experimental and presciently brilliant, a claustrophobic magnifying lens of sorts into the primal pinnings of human behavior. Weaponizing the medium of film was a new and intrepid endeavor, a dimension that had yet to be explored beyond a mere suggestion. More than sixty years later, and the potent breadth of PEEPING TOM’S proliferation on cinema is unmistakable -- from de Palma to Coppola and inbetween, the cinematic auteurs of today and yesterday have crafted and carved acclaimed masterworks that have built upon Powell’s point blank ponderance of elevated voyeurism. It’s tragic he was never extended the same open reverence in his time.",3.5

The score was also fantastic, and was incorporated as something in the movie itself in several scenes which I always think is neat.

"Peeping Tom is so deeply upsetting because it forces us to come face to face with the abusive behaviour carried out by megalomaniacal artists. It is impossible not to think of Alfred Hitchcock as you watch the film. I kept thinking of all of the adulation that he receives for being so tortured and troubled. His difficult relationship with sexuality and decision to associate it with violence and punishment have become a part of his legend. His habit of essentially forcing actors to live out the traumatic experiences that their characters were supposed to experience on screen, was often presented as an example of a director being committed to his craft. He was an eccentric genius and Tippi Hedren’s allegations of abuse mean nothing because she’s just an actress. Auteurs should have the power to do whatever they want.
Peeping Tom reminds us that it is not right to simply indulge the problematic behaviour of directors. Even if they had difficult childhoods and have the ability to be nice to certain people, it does not invalidate the abuse that others have faced. If you let these people run wild, they will abuse their power and find ways to satisfy their desire to hurt people. It is all the more effective because we are asked to extend some sympathy towards Mark Lewis. He might be a monster, but he has a human side and it becomes easy to relate to him when we realise that he suffered from abuse at the hands of his father. Even though he reveals flashes of charm, it does not make up for the fact that he stabs and kills people.
The film also manages to turn its gaze back onto the audience and question why some take so much pleasure in stories about crazed men murdering sexually active women. It does not do this in an effort to shield itself against accusations of using titillating content to excite its audience. Unlike The Birds (1963), it is open about the fact that it is an exploitation flick. This means that its argument remains fairly compelling and it convinces as a slasher film that actually has something to say about genre tropes.",4.0
"Peeping Tom is only my second Michael Powell film, after Black Narcissus, but, between those two, it's abundantly clear why Powell (and Pressburger... although he isn't involved with this one) is/are seen as one of the best filmmakers of all time.

"Peeping Tom est un film époustouflant qui est non seulement un classique de l'horreur, mais aussi un classique du cinéma en général. Michael Powell a conçu une belle œuvre en utilisant l'atmosphère, les sensations fortes et le suspense et en laissant l’imagination du spectateur remplir les blancs, ce qui parvient à installer une ambiance saisissante. 
Ce film ne suggère que ce que l'esprit ne peut pas voir et le rend à son tour beaucoup plus implacable pour le spectateur. Peeping Tom est l'exemple parfait d'un film qui utilise l'atmosphère et le suspense pour créer l'ambiance et le ton du film, une technique qui sera utilisée au début des Slashers des années 1970. Peeping Tom était un film qui était vraiment en avance sur son temps, il a révolutionné les thrillers d'horreur pour toujours et a ajouté une dimension bien nécessaire au genre en prenant des risques et au final on distingue clairement comment il a influencé un genre entier. 
Comme Psycho, cela reste une référence du cinéma d'horreur, qui à su réinventé les règles. La performance de Karlheinz Böhm est époustouflante dans le rôle de Mark Lewis, le tueur qui a un appétit pour les belles femmes qu’il tue devant la caméra dans un style voyeuriste. Le film dénonce la portée de voyeurisme des spectateurs regardant un film mais également celle des réalisateurs et de l’action de réaliser un film en général. C'est un film brillant que les fans de genre apprécieront sûrement.",4.0
"I really thought this film would be much scarier than it was. Don't get me wrong it has some very disturbing and creepy scenes but nothing really terrifying that will haunt me forever. However, the film while not that scary has a lot of positive qualities about it. The story is well-told enough, the cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is great, the atmosphere is chilling as hell, the direction is amazing, the editing is really good, there are some pretty disturbing and tension-filled scenes, and the acting is stellar from everyone but the one that stands is Karlheinz ""Carl"" Boehm who delivers a very creepy but amazing performance playing a character with a serious problem. Almost every scene he is in he owns it even when he doesn't say or do much. Even with all the great qualities of the film, there are a few bad ones that did keep it from being amazing. The story itself can be very predictable and it's not easy to see what the outcome will be, the film is not that scary outside of a few disturbing and creepy moments, and the film really does feel like it's trying to be an Alfred Hitchcock film. While watching the film that was all I could think of and it's a problem considering it just made me wish I was watching something like Psycho or North by Northwest. Those issues really made me not like this film as much as some other people do but I still found it to be very good regardless. Not a masterpiece but I got a good amount of enjoyment out of it for me to recommend it. If you haven't seen it yet and are interested then it is worth watching at least once.",4.0
"Powell consistently deflates any expectations of gothic thriller with moments of humor, and assiduously avoids the monsterization of Böhm's character with any binary moral POV. Though a lurid pulp aesthetic is invoked throughout, it's never really the POV of the film. The multiple tape recorder scene near the end is chilling, especially since Böhm later said his understanding of the character was of someone traumatized by growing up in Nazi Germany.",5.0

"In a way this is more proto De Palma than any of his more overt well known influences such as the obvious Hitchcock one. Speaking of Hitch—It’s still so incredible to me in the coincidence of this releasing the same year as Psycho. Just two perfect examples that transition beautifully from the horror sensibilities of the previous decades into what was to come. The sound design and use of color does a fantastic job conveying the uncomfortable off putting quality of the entire experience. I will say tho that it does suffer a bit from a sort of awkward meandering pace that was very similarly an issue with Polanski’s The Tenant. That being said, this is still essential.",0.0

"“Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.”
Peeping Tom is a 1960 horror/thriller movie directed by Michael Powell which stars Karlheinz Böhm as a young man who murders women, using a movie camera to film their dying expressions of terror.
Released to controversy that essentially killed Powell’s career, the film was labelled vile and perverted at the time, much like Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, which dropped in the same year. 
There are a lot of comparisons to Psycho to be made here, most noticeably how influential both films were in reinventing the horror genre. 
With its opening POV shot, Peeping Tom inspired the later Black Christmas, which in turn inspired Halloween and so on and so forth, and just as in those films, the method is extremely effective, putting you in the mindset of our killer from the opening sequence.
Speaking of which, Böhm is nothing short of fantastic in his role, similar to Anthony Perkins’ Norman Bates in his introverted shyness around women but also bringing a level of innocence to the role in his romance with Anna Massey’s Helen.  It’s an interesting angle of how he refuses to hurt her and brings an added layer of tragedy to the character.
The movie looks gorgeous too in the classic technicolour, with Powell’s direction really shining alongside Brian Easdale’s score. 
Overall, this is a tense, creepy movie that makes you feel like a voyeur throughout and definitely deserves more recognition.",5.0

"Augen der Angst sorgte zu seiner Entstehungszeit für einen weitreichenden Skandal, der die Weltkarriere von Regisseur Michael Powell schlagartig beendete. „Krankhaft, abwegig und peinlich geschmacklos“, brachte der Katholische Filmdienst die Meinung von Kritik wie Publikum auf den Punkt. Die Identifikation mit einem voyeuristischen Frauenmörder war ein Tabubruch, der in der Analogie zwischen dem Auge der Kamera und dem Auge des Zuschauers gipfelte. Die Kamera nimmt die Morde nicht nur auf, sie selbst wird zum Instrument des Todes und bannt dabei eine perverse Lust an der Zerstörung aufs Bild, von der sich auch das Publikum nicht freisprechen konnte. Diese latenten aggressiven Triebe holt Powell aus den schwülen Hinterzimmern heraus und hält sie den Zuschauern in Großaufnahme vor – die Reaktionen zeigen, dass er damit einen wunden Punkt im bürgerlichen Selbstverständnis getroffen hat.
Als klassische Außenseiterfigur verkörpert Mark all das, was keinen Platz in der Gesellschaft hat, aber dennoch unbewusst in ihr schlummert. In seiner obsessiven Jagd nach dem perfekten Bild, ist er aber auch eine tragische Künstlerfigur. Die Totalität des Bildes, die der Ästhetizist anstrebt, lässt sich nicht erreichen – sein Schicksal am Ende des Films ist bereits präfiguriert. Dabei zeigt Augen der Angst seinen Protagonisten auch als Opfer eines Kindheitstraumas, das weniger erklärt, als in seinen drastischen Auswirkungen gezeigt wird. Damit gleicht der raffiniert inszenierte Thriller in vielem Hitchcocks Psycho, der im selben Jahr erschien. Doch während Norman Bates zu Weltruhm gelangte, hat es Mark Lewis lange Zeit nicht aus den dunklen Hinterzimmern herausgeschafft. Inzwischen gilt Augen der Angst längst als Klassiker, der die besondere Verführungsmacht des Mediums Kino darstellt wie kaum ein zweiter Film.",4.5
Fabulous to see Michael Powell use his extraordinary craftsmanship of mise-en-scene (color! lighting! set design!) towards a genre not known for its tremendous production value.

"Masterful levels of direction, framing, production design - Peeping Tom is a film that knows what you don’t show is far more unsettling than what you do. It’s easy to see why Powell’s film was criticised on release, just as it’s easy to see why that opinion changed with time. It’s psychologically disturbing, placing us firmly with the killer rather than his victims. Böhm is brilliantly unsettling as Mark, managing to show the hint of humanity beneath the twisted psychology. His acts are repulsive, but we almost understand them; he admits he’s a madman, and yet there is the slightest glimmer of hope that his story will end well. It’s ever so subtle, making it all the more troubling the more we discover about his crimes. Rather than explain everything, Powell lets you watch and decide yourself (almost like a peeping tom). Is this all some Freudian catharsis, or simply the result of a monstrous father? Has this been happening for a long time, or are we joining Mark at the beginning of his dark decent into murder? He’s a fascinating character who keeps you guessing throughout. 
It’s worth a watch for the performance alone; luckily the work behind the camera is just as good. Colourful yet shadowy sets, characters who will test our protagonists limits, even a few laughs throughout. It feels seedy without ever showing anything explicit. I guess it goes to show that initial critical response isn’t everything.",4.0

"The producer (Jarvis) says, “Take a memo to all producers and directors, in light of the new economy drive, if you can see it and hear it, the first take’s okay.”
Mark only ever gets one take...
I first read about Peeping Tom in my Alfred Hitchcock class last fall. The author of the article (definitely either Robin Wood or Tania Modleski) was always speaking about these films in a sort of abstract way, making me think many of their interpretations (in the case of the Hitchcock films) were just “reading into” the psychoanalytic stuff. When it comes to Peeping Tom, not so! This film comes right out and defines scoptophilia! “The morbid urge to gaze.” Remind anyone else of Hitchcock? Even apart from that, this film is a psychoanalytic's dream. The tripod leg which he strokes phallically, the knife concealed underneath which he stabs the women with (and strokes phallically...), it's just rife with psychosexual imagery.
This is one of those films where every other scene seems like a ripoff, but then you remember it was actually the inspiration! The chilling first-person stalking opening sequence reminded me of Halloween (1978) right away.
I thought this was just gonna be pulpy/trashy, but it's actually very impressive cinematically. The cinematography and mise-en-scène of the scene in the empty soundstage, when Vivian (Moira Shearer) performs her little number while he makes the scene “perfect” (if you know what I mean) is amazing.
An excellent companion piece to Psycho. If you have the time, the inclination, and you haven't seen either film, that would be a great double feature.
Ooh, and the editing! I love the transitions, with the drinks overlapping twice, and then the jokester investigator’s flashlight causing a sort of “fade to white,” if you will.
The pencils and stuff falling out of Mark’s pocket is such a suspenseful moment. I love how Powell uses the the low angle, slow-motion shot to convey that. It's a really striking image.
I love movies about making movies, even psychologically disturbing slashers! The scenes at the studio are such an interesting look into filmmaking in the 60s.
There are some chillingly funny bits of dry humor, too. Like when Mrs. Stephens says “The back of my neck”<then a close-up>”The part I talk out of.” here are even a few little in-jokes about the director being more interesting to the psychologist than Mark, the actual killer. And then Mark's assistant says to him about a pin-up photo: “You don’t get that in Sight & Sound. She’s terrific."" Take that, Sight & Sound! Powell must have had a grudge.
This is such an elegant and stylish film, and then that's juxtaposed with the pulpy murder-scenes. The grisly scenes are also accomplished with minimal gore, given the sensibility of the time. Funnily enough, it was still too much for the audiences of the time, who found it horrifying. Oh well. You can't please everyone.",5.0

"Pretty remarkable as far as horror movies are concerned and can still resonate well with audiences today. I imagine that this must have been quite controversial for its time period but it seems people hold this to high regard now. When it comes down to it this is probably the number one alternative to Hitchcock. And as far as 'being edgy' goes it seems like ""Peeping Tom"" rises well above the standard of what's to be expected. It definitely has a more violent and morbid nature to it compared to other films released at the time. Director Powell's focus on sex and violence will eventually inspire future filmmakers with its voyeuristic style. At the same time though there is no doubt an art-house vibe going on here which is maybe why this has become more credible over the years. If you are looking for a dark and exciting watch then don't overlook this one.",5.0
"Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom is a terrific film. Often cited in counterpoint to Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (also 1960), it’s a dark portrait of a psychologically unbalanced cameraman who doubles as a serial killer. It’s all voyeurism, the male gaze, and a reflection of the art and act of cinema. It was also controversial on its release and was a huge hit on Powell’s career, stark contrast there with Hitch.

"Hoop-tober! Part 4.
I've loved the three earlier Michael Powell films that I've seen, I was excited to see the controversial movie that sadly almost ended his career, and to top it all off, my name is even in the title. How could this go wrong? And yet, somehow, go wrong it did.
There was just so much stuff that took me out of this. Why is everyone so fascinated by the charmless guy at the centre of it all? Why does he have an Austrian accent? Why is so much of the acting so distractingly poor? Why doesn't anyone seem to shut, let alone lock their doors, even when they're serial killers? Less than a month after A Matter of Life and Death shot to the top of the list of the best things I've seen this year, Peeping Tom finds itself on a new list (albeit one that doesn't actually exist): Biggest Disappointments of 2015.

"I live for one of those treasured movie moments: the deja vu. The moment where either a scene or quote is presented and due to several reasons (pop culture, film montages, etc) I experience it all again, however in the right context. I had it when I viewed Boris Karloff's Frankenstein for the first time and the iconic character descends the stairs, I had it while hearing I coulda been a contender in the flesh. Sometimes these moments are expected, and sometimes they catch you by surprise such as a tiny little scene in Peeping Tom.
The scene is when Mark is being confronted by Vivian's mother and he throws himself in agony at the blank white projection screen. His navy blazer bursts with colour against this void and his heavy shadow; it's highly stylized, very Hitchcockian. I know I've seen the moment before, but I really cannot account for where nor does it really matter except for that I revelled in something like a, dare I say, accomplished little feeling for having seen it again.
Wistful remarks aside, Peeping Tom is simply a fine film; it manages to intimate its viewers with its disturbing subject matter, but takes it further by having the same viewers share perspective. Having the audience step into the shoes of the murderer or even just seeing through the lens of his camera, broadens the acts of the crimes. We become the bystanders who say nothing, the witnesses who stand around in awe without interfering; we can also be held accountable for these murders if this weren't a form of fiction. It's truly genius film making and tests the concept and purpose of a movie audience.
The colours are rich and the shadows are prominent; the cinematography experiments with Mark's camera, how shadows reflect on one's face and the manipulation of mirrors. It's all very stylized without losing its core target, what the camera puts into sharp focus: the fear of others and the fear of ourselves.",4.0
"One of the most influential horror films ever. The voyeuristic concept is brilliant, and the technical merits of the film are remarkable which is no surprise with Michael Powell at the helm.

Clearly he should have been commended for crafting this unforgettable classic.",4.5

Remarkable disturbing film that may very will be the ultimate screen examination of voyeurism. As a big fan of Brian De Palma's various meditations on the subject (Dressed to Kill, Body Double etc) it was startling to see it done so much better back in 1960. Also startling was just how bright and genius the technicolor cinematography is here throughout. From about the hour mark on to the end I thought was just incredibly suspenseful, a movie that really holds up on all levels.

If you were to ask my friends or family what is my favorite genre, they'd, presumably, and mistakenly, say horror films; though, I do not understand why. I did not start to study the evolution of the slasher subgenre until late 2019 when I met Scout Taylor-Compton. (Though I did have to take a substantial step back from the research for awhile)
If you were to categorize my physical media collection and graph the answers, it'd say comedy is my favorite genre - which is close... comedy is my second favorite.
Psychological thriller is my favorite genre. I do love psychological ""horror"" films, though - typically labeled horror, though, I'd typically disagree that they are, indeed, horror.
This is a very old school psychological thriller. Disturbing upon its release, yet regrettably mild by today's standards.
This expertly builds suspense, and the leads psychology. It's intense, to even me, who has seen most of the films deemed ""the most"" disturbing.
It's easy to see how inspirational this film would be to the golden era slashers, but this is still something quite different.
Love this master class piece of work from the same year as Psycho; actually being released internationally before Psycho's American release. Though if you truly want to understand the American slasher history, you need to start with European art, and not with Psycho - though Psycho is widely famous and a perfect example of film after the erosion of the then American production code.
The directions, performances, and score are calculated perfectly and add maximum suspense and unease, particularly for the era.

At times I found myself unsure if I should feel bad for Mark or hate him because his character is so wonderfully layered it is nearly impossible to decide. Also why does he sound exactly like Peter Lorre??",4.5
"Considered despicable upon its initial release, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom has recently been reappraised and also been famously cited by Martin Scorsese in that it can ""say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two.""
And I'm inclined to agree.
This film is one of the best ""movies about movies"" stories I've seen. The premise is simple, yet unique - and allows for some interesting twisting narrative revelations. Peeping Tom puts you in the place of a voyeuristic killer (played brilliantly by Carl Boehem), whose modus operandi includes killing women and filming their dying expressions. Powell's technique of showing the feed of the killer's camera is an important and controversial one. He comments on the dangers, and power of cinema and the element of film by making the audience into voyeurs themselves. It - along with the excellently dark score - create an immensely uncomfortable feeling, which only makes the film more rewarding in the end. It also examines Freudian concepts of the main character's traumatic childhood and its repression, but Powell's comments on film are undeniably perfect, and executed with remarkable innovation.
Of course, being a production of an archer, the film looks amazing. The cinematography is brilliant, and the color in every frame is meticulously vibrant, and just pops effortlessly off the screen. And not only does it just look pretty but, as I mentioned before, the cinematography really has a purpose to further the story - thematically and in the surface narrative. It gives the film an above-average feeling, that left me stunned. And speaking of surface narrative, it's pretty great too, even on its own. It's a chilling thriller, with an impeccable ending. Powell's directorial mastery just makes it all the better.
Peeping Tom likely Powell's masterpiece, and I doubt I'll appreciate another of his films as much as this one (although, who doesn't like pleasant surprises?)",4.5

Peeping Tom zeigt einen doppelten Voyeurismus. Zum einen den des Zuschauers von Filmen, die anonym andere Menschen beobachten. Zum anderen hier in Peeping Tom, der einen Mann zeigt der seine Opfer filmt während er sie tötet.

Aus diesen Gründen wurde der Film zerrissen und beendete die Karriere Michael Powells.
Für Mark, unsere Hauptfigur ist das Filmen untrennbar mit den eigenen Emotionen verbunden. Wir bekommen hierzu Hinweise auf seine Erziehung. Hieraus schafft Powell einen intelligenten, spannenden psychologischen Thriller, der vielleicht für heutige Sehgewohnheiten leicht behäbig daher kommt, aufgrund des doppelten Voyeurismus jedoch gesehen werden sollte.

Peeping Tom shows a double voyeurism. On the one hand, that of the viewer of films that anonymously observe other people. On the other hand, here in Peeping Tom, which shows a man filming his victims while he kills them.
This confrontation crosses the previously ""taboo"" line and entangles the previously anonymous voyeurism with that of ""Peeping Tom"". Keeping your distance is no longer possible.
For these reasons the film was torn apart and ended Michael Powell's career.
For Mark, our main character, filming is inextricably linked to his own emotions. We get information about his upbringing. From this, Powell creates an intelligent, exciting psychological thriller that may seem a little sedate for today's viewing habits, but should be seen due to the double voyeurism.

Which were the first slashers is a topic of discussion, for most they are “Black Christmas” and “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” both from 1974, and others mention Pyscho (1960) and many other people mention this film. I don't consider this to be the first slasher but one of the greatest influencers for the sub-genre
This film, being a precursor to slashers, puts many elements on the table that, at least at the time of release, were not so common, in addition to being a brilliant and very well-written film that really becomes disturbing without the need for be so graphic and for the time it is a daring film
I very much applaud the performance, especially that of Karlheinz Böhm. It really is a disturbing and hypnotizing performance that captivates us from the first scene where it appears and when it appears on the screen you feel a discomfort that very few movies can do

This felt like a much classier version of what William Lustig would do 20 years later with Maniac. By making the audience's POV the eyes (or camera in this case) of the killer it almost makes us feel like we're complicit in his murders, which me feel far more disturbed than pretty much any other slasher I've seen (besides Maniac of course). Lewis is also such an interesting complex killer who, due to Powell and Marks, almost comes across as a tragic figure who could have been a functioning, non-murderous human if not for his father's disturbing experiments.

A lot of the appeal of this one comes from the great technicolor and Karlheinz Böhm's skin-crawl inducing performance as the killer, though i will say this does suffer from some pacing issues that I feel psycho does not suffer from as much!
That being said this really does live up to its modern reputation, one of the all time great British horror films!",5.0
"A very lavish and stylish thriller. It feels really damn modern in some ways, instead of the typical mommy problems our psycho is driven mad by his father voyeuristic documenting his life as a boy. Makes me think of those poor vlogger kids of the past decade. He's also a full on video creep, he wants to be a director, he loves to watch, and he wants to control. The subtext here is not buried very deep at all. The POV kills are also very proto-slasher and not something I can think of as having been done before, so even if it's a bit clunky in this film it is nice to see the origins of that shot style. While not particularly grisly, I can see why it was controversial on release.",4.0

"Peeping Tom is like watching an Edward Hopper painting through the lens of a voyeuristic videographer. Like the paintings, the theme of isolation and gaze is prominent. The male gaze in particular is under a magnifying lens, exposing itself through pornography, film industry, and the social climate of the 60’s in general.
Another main theme is fear. Whether it’s fear of death, of being exposed, or the psychological response to this primitive human emotion.
Similar to Hitchcock’s Rear Window, it investigates the ethics of voyeurism in film and at the same time using that same medium to capture cinema’s best qualities.",4.5
"This movie takes its time, a bit slow in spots but well worth the journey. A weird dude, raised without privacy, always in front of or behind a camera, is a killer taking more and more chances as the film goes on, his repressed desires and childhood trauma no longer able to be contained.
The colors in this are beautiful. The story is very well done. Definitely recommend.

"""I'm familiar with that kind of terror, this is something new to me.""
This one hooked me right off, and just got better, and better as it went on. A proto-slasher that, unlike most of the genre to come, approaches the material with the most elegant and beautiful ways possible. I absolutely loved it.
This isn't giallo, but it does have some commonalities. First and foremost it shares the same influences (mainly Hitchcock, but also M), has themes of sexuality and sexual repression, and a brilliant use of color and lighting. In fact the only thing that really separates this from the giallo or krimi genres (besides its nation of origin) is the lack of a mystery. The detectives don't even appear in this film until a solid hour in!",4.5

It’s one of those films where I think everything has been said before.

The fact that he has a knife attached to his camera is kind of goofy but I don’t mind it. The treatment of the female characters is also pretty good considering the time period.",5.0

""Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.""
A true psychological horror film that was unfortunately ahead of its time and was so hated and misunderstood that it destroyed Michael Powell's directorial career. Peeping Tom is tame by today's standards, since almost all the deaths and violence are off-screen, yet the pure horror has aged well as the POV cinematography turns the audience into voyeurs and makes us complicit with the male gaze as we watch the victims' frightened reactions as they die. Rather than be exploitative trash, Powell has an interest in exploring the killer's need and compulsion to photograph and document, wringing character-driven depths, and Peeping Tom turns into a fascinating examination of sexuality, death, fear and filmmaking.
Gosh, British horror really is excellent and dominant anti-horror critics are the worst, huh?",4.0

"From the kills, to the attempts to incorporate psychology into the motivation, to the discussions of sexuality, to the proto-slasher, to the discussions on voyeurism, to the fixation on visually recording everything, this film feels amazingly ahead of its time.
I recently watched the Vincent Price movie The Last Man on Earth. I was really stunned that it came out in 1964 because it really feels like a 50s throwback.
Hammer Films wanted to make the movie first. They ultimately passed because they thought it would be too graphic. It seems incongruous to me that Peeping Tom was made four years before The Last Man on Earth, but American censorship tends to be more accepting of violence than Europe, while Europe tends to be more accepting of sex.
That does explain how this movie got made, but man, it is done so well, and feels so ahead of its time.

"Peeping Tom é conhecido como o filme que acabou com a carreira do diretor Michael Powell, após uma enxurrada de críticas negativas no lançamento. Só veio a ganhar reconhecimento como um clássico cult no final da década de 70, graças ao diretor Martin Scorsese. Como já havia assistido Os Sapatinhos Vermelhos que é do mesmo diretor e adorado, decidi assistir esse filme.
O voyeurismo é um tema recorrente no cinema, lembrado principalmente por Janela Indiscreta, de Alfred Hitchcock. Nesse longa, temos uma premissa muito semelhante ao que Hitchcock usava em seus filmes, com um suspense muito bem construído.
Extremamente inteligente, coloca o espectador na mesma posição do nosso protagonista (aliás, que atuação. Seus olhares passavam o tom necessário ao filme sem cair em algo que soe como uma caricatura). Esse posicionamento é reforçado principalmente pelos vários enquadramentos envolvendo câmeras e luzes. Também é muito interessante como o diretor trabalha o desenvolvimento das personagens femininas, todas peculiares. Interessante também o modo em que ele traz uma sutil homenagem ao Os Sapatinhos Vermelhos na parte com Moira Shearer.
Com uma ótima direção de arte e montagem, tudo está perfeitamente harmonizado e sincronizado e acaba criando o suspense e o medo, que é o elemento principal do filme, de uma maneira impressionante.
Mórbido, sinistro, tenso. Com certeza, vale a pena conferir não apenas o filme, mas toda a história que envolve Peeping Tom.",4.5
"I have a very small list of films that are fantastic, but that I refuse to watch again because they were too overwhelming for me for one reason or another: American Sniper, Mysterious Skin, Hereditary and now I can add Peeping Tom to that list.
From the very first scene, I felt a tightness in my stomach that never went away throughout the 100 minute runtime. If this had that kind of effect on me, I cannot imagine the reactions of those who intially watched the film upon its 1960 release. I've had decades of creepy uncomfortable films, whereas those audience were used to watching 30+ years of sanitized Code films. This film has truly left me speechless.",4.0
"I was expecting the average slasher film with this movie but it had blown me away!! the way the killer kills is unique and I believe that he isn't truly evil but he is a person haunted by what his father had done to him and he cannot control what he does when he is in a trance. criterion should definitely rerelease this film, it deserves it and I would potentially buy it if I had the money too!!",5.0
"Altro masterpiece? Altro masterpiece. Powell smaschera le logiche della macchina-cinema in modo splendido, denotandole un ruolo alquanto scomodo, ovvero quello di portatrice delle pulsioni sessuali umane e portandole ad un'escalation violenta e senza freni. Un'opera radicale, che diventa un saggio meta-filmico che unisce varie caratteristiche. Voyeurismo, riflessione sul cinema, trattato sui traumi infantili, necrofilia, indagine del subconscio, repressione, morbosità del desiderio carnale e, soprattutto, una sconvolgente provocazione allo spettatore si uniscono su schermo per dare il ritratto di un protagonista disturbato, perverso e deviato.
Ed è soprattutto grazie ad una componente tecnica semplicemente spaventosa che Powell riesce nell'impresa. Regia che si staticizza, la macchina da presa evita movimenti eccessivi ed è sempre posizionata in modo strategico, infibulata con un'asciuttezza sicuramente invidiabile e con un rigore formale assolutamente perfetto.
Fotografia accesissima, che accentua i colori RGB quasi ad inventarsi una dimensione surreale, che diventa la componente in più per questo capolavoro.

"Film theorists would have you believe that every film ever made was for the express purpose of voyeurism - that every weapon represents the phallus - that the core aspects we love about movies are all intrinsically linked to sex. Frankly... I think that's a load of horse shit. But in this one case, I think it absolutely rings true.
The themes of sexual repression, voyeuristic intent, and even the cyclical nature of abuse are all fully on display here - crafting the character of Mark Lewis into memorable and multi-dimensional character, a far cry from the generic serial killer archetypes he inspired (as this, along with the original Psycho, really serves as a sort of proto-slasher film). Director Michael Powell's decision to include murderous shots from the point of view of the camera's viewfinder immediately causes the audience to reflect on their own viewing of these horrible crimes. And really, there's just some fantastic visuals in this thing - perhaps my favorite shot being Mark's eyes glaring through the film reel, showing the unique perspective in which he looks upon the world.
There are, of course, certain aspects I'm less fond of. Whereas Carl Boehm's performance as the titular ""peeping tom"" is wonderfully nuanced, Anna Massey gives a terribly overacted and borderline unwatchable performance as (what is essentially) this film's ""final girl"". And, despite the subject matter, the film isn't always as compelling as it should be. Still, Peeing Tom is iconic as both an entry point into film theory and as the progenitor of an entire subgenre (though it is sort of baffling how poorly it was received at the time considering the complete and total lack of gore on display).",3.0
"So, Powell out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock, basically gives birth to De Palma’s entire career and it ruins his? 
The reaction to this film back then makes this seem like some blood-drenched exercise in masturbatory bad-taste, but in truth it’s a very stylish, well-acted thriller about movie making, fear, and trauma. 
It’s certainly a departure from the man who made such lovely films in the 40’s with Emeric Pressburger, but he didn’t become *less* of a director, and it’s a shame he wasn’t allowed to keep making pictures this lush and odd going forward.",4.0

A maldição que o pai de Mark passa ao seu jovem filho é aquela que nos aflinge: o ímpeto de filmar e de assistir, de ver e ser visto. O instrumento desta maldição é a câmera, passada pelo próprio Michael Powell para seu filho (ambos atuam como pai e filho nos vídeos que retratam a infância de Mark). Assim, o diretor se coloca na posição daquele que cria a condição do protagonista, perturbando em todos os momentos com uma câmera.
Enquanto um diretor amador ele mesmo, o protagonista Mark encarna a violência da câmera. Violência em dois sentidos: 1) a câmera recorta a realidade, apresentando a nós apenas um fragmento do todo; 2) a câmera é violenta com aqueles que estão a sua frente, com os atores. Essas duas violências compõem os curtas de Mark, construídos a partir do assassinato daquelas que ele filma.

"“Yes, that would be frightening.”
Apparently Peeping Tom’s depiction of violence and sexual content was seen as so beyond immoral, that it completely ended the directors career. I found this on some ‘controversial’ list somewhere, and boy, was this ever tame. I can see how this was shocking to audiences in 1960, but this was also released the same year as Psycho, which contains the same level of ‘immoral’ content as this film. The Hitchcock name must’ve certainly supported Psycho’s reception, but Peeping Tom is essentially another pioneer in the Slasher sub genre. 
I enjoyed it, even though it may have been a drag at times. The character’s interactions with different mediums, and the meta, behind-the-scenes setting of the story seems innovative, and also interesting to look back on. I was a huge fan of the lighting and camerawork (especially the last 15 minutes). What could’ve elevated the story was a pick-up in the pacing, as well as diluting the expositional nature of each side character. It’s great this developed a cult following, and it’s a shame it didn’t reach its intended audience for its time.",4.0

Many pieces of dialogue and plot points are unexpected, and welcome even today when we’re all very familiar with these types of films.

I feel this will only gets better the more I keep thinking about it. It's quite ahead of its time and is deeply rooted in psychology. There must be so many papers out there dealing with the psychology of Peeping Tom, those must be fascinating. Karlheinz Böhm, a complete stranger to me, is incredible as Mark. It's like he manages to play more than one character since Mark's interactions with people always change with whom he's talking. With Mary he feels quite nervous and reminded of a little boy. Then there's the other Mark, notably with Vivian. A completely in control and frightening Mark. Really quite the performance from Böhm. The pacing might have been a bit weird, but other than that... pretty damn great. Powell's direction is again on point and there's still the whole psychology of the film which touches so many subjects. It will clearly grow on me for sure.",4.0
"Released shortly before Psycho (1960), both movies provoked a torrent of abuse in the English press, partly, no doubt, because they are among the most complex and intelligent films ever made about the cinema and bring us face to face with the unspeakable but indispensable desires without which cinema would not exist. Powell's film is the most direct representation to date of the specifically scopophilic relationship that binds viewer and spectacle together in the cinema. (Hardy 135)
Indeed, Peeping Tom is well known as the film that destroyed Michael Powell's career. I can understand why. Although the film isn't explicit by today's standards, it implies issues that are much more graphically explored in movies like Tesis (1996). A serial killer who films his killings? And—as if that weren't bad enough—we begin to feel sympathy for him!
Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) works for a movie company as a focus puller. In his free time, he takes moving pictures ""for a documentary."" Oh, and he kills women. Indeed, it seems as if Mark can only relate to women if they're in terror and on a screen.
Mark rents out the house wherein he grew up, and one of the tenants is a nice young woman named Helen (Anna Massey). She befriends Mark, and she even convinces him to leave his ever-present camera at home one evening when they go out on a date. She can tell that Mark is quirky, but she has no idea . . . But will Mark be able to control his urges around Helen, or will she become another victim?
One of the reasons the film makes people so uncomfortable is that it asks us, the audience, to examine our love of ""peeping""—while we're all looking at a screen ""peeping""! When you watch a movie like Misery (1990), you might feel a degree of sympathy for Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), but you probably don't identify with her. (I never wanted to kidnap and ""hobble"" anyone.) But when you're watching Peeping Tom, you can't keep a safe distance from Mark. His mania is yours, at least to some degree. You can't help but ask yourself, Why am I watching this?

"There's absolutely no doubt that Michael Powell is a good director; in fact I'm sure a few of you reading this are assured that as one of the men behind classics like 'The Red Shoes' and 'Black Narcissus' he is in the pantheon of the greatest directors. After making some of the best British films of the 40s, Powell directed this Leo Marks penned oddity, which would be seen on release as controversially tasteless and it effectively tanked the man's career. Its had a vast re-appraisal ever since though, and its now considered by many as some sort of ahead-of-its-time masterpiece. I can definitely see why, I liked it quite a bit, but heres when my introduction links in: Powell is a good director, and yet I don't feel like he's the right fit for the material. This is gonna sound irrational but I kinda wish Hitchcock had just directed this..... I mean this came out the same year as 'Psycho' and definitely suffers for the comparison, its less effectively made and isn't nearly as tight of a thriller as the aforementioned. However 'Peeping Tom' is different enough in its story and approach then Hitchcock's film to make its own interesting path; after the incredible opening sequence of the demise Mark's first victim as seen through the camera's lens, it took me around 20 minutes or so the properly sink my teeth into the film. I even considered just switching it off and saving it for another day but I'm so so happy that I stuck it out as the film payed back in spades.
Where the movie really succeeds is as a deep character study of the psyche of this psychotic stalker; Carl Bohm (whose European accent I swear came out of nowhere after a couple of scenes) is fantastic as Mark, the titular peeping tom. He's awkward yet strangely charismatic; he has a certain quality of Perkins as Bates but is more sharp, astute and grave. He's also more dashing than the geeky Norman, and yet he's much creepier from the offset. Also, he isn't quite the villainous character you would expect him to be; obviously he's a cold-blood killer, but he's more of an anti-hero, someone who against all odds you can sympathise with to a certain extent. We learn that he's been messed up since he was a child, and that his father was a psychologist, who would cruelly abuse a young Mark's emotions, treating him as a guinea pig in his tests. I was reminded in a strange way of the stuff in 'Three Identical Strangers' that the scientists performed on the triplets as kids, but evidently Mark's father operated at a far harsher level (such as letting a lizard crawl over a terrified little child).
You can easily see why critics and the mass media were so instant to shun and scorn at the film on its release in the early sixties because of its frank examination of sexual fetishism and the humanity behind serial killers. But none of those themes are glamorised - the complete opposite is true, they're merely examined in a precise and profound manners - its an extremely intriguing plot than gets only more compelling with the involvement of Anna Massey's Helen, a pure love interest of Mark. Mark strives to reform from his tendencies and lusts, but is he able to save Helen and to be free in their relationship?

"Peeping Tom came out the same year as Psycho, 1960, but while the latter only confirmed Alfred Hitchcock as the master of suspense, perhaps because the director of this, Michael Powell, wasn't known for shockers but for rather more wholesome works, the film ruined his career. Is this the first slasher movie? Although it has several of the hallmarks that would come to define the genre – multiple attractive young female victims killed with a stabbing weapon and even a final girl – there is one key difference. The killer here is no Michael Myers, Freddy or Jason, he has a face. While we learn that Norman Bates is the product of a very strange and sad home, he still fits into the mould of cinematic monster: more an abstract force of possessed evil than a sympathetic character. On the other hand in Peeping Tom, Mark Lewis, the bad man with a movie camera, is clearly disturbed and does almost nothing to earn the audience's favour, yet somehow we're on his side and feel sorry for him. Perhaps that is due to Carl Boehm's performance or that he is the central character of the story despite being in the traditional villain role, or that he had an even more disturbing upbringing than young master Bates.
While Peeping Tom shocked conservative Britain of the time, it is rather tame by today's standards: most of the kills happen off screen and a three second shot of a topless woman apparently constituted the first on screen nudity in a mainstream UK film, quelle horreur. However this didn't stop the press at the time from labelling the movie filth and demanding it banned. The themes of voyeurism and technology explored here would seem, even more than Hitchcock, to define the oeuvre of Brian De Palma, and Martin Scorsese is a huge fan of this film, even arranging its first proper theatrical release in the United States almost 20 years after it was made. A landmark in both horror and thriller cinema, the fact that Peeping Tom is undeniably dated shouldn't be seen as a condemnation, but just a reflection of evolving public tastes. Someone always has to be ahead of the curve, and in 1960 Michael Powell most certainly was, more so than Hitchcock, and this is a better film than Psycho.",3.5

""Whatever I photograph I always lose.""
Mark Lewis, like most filmmakers, is a mentally screwed up person. He aspires to be a documentarian but takes part time work as a photographer of stag erotica, which only exacerbates his obsession with voyeurism, and his obsession with murdering prostitutes on camera. And murdering them with his camera. Things are going swimmingly for the awkward serial killer auteur until one of the tenants in his boarding house begins to take an interest in him, and the more she learns the more his quiet, mild mannered veneer begins to fall away.
Peeping Tom is an oddly prescient exploration of living life through the camera lens that ends up playing out like a 1960s version of doing it for the Vine (RIP). When you consider what society looks like now and how more and more of our experiences - both good and ill - are being lived with a camera trained on us, it is interesting to watch a film from an era where that idea was so rare it was completely and utterly misunderstood by contemporary viewers. In 2016 you'd probably roll your eyes at a movie, especially a horror movie, where the killer records his kills and there are explorations of the fleeting permanence of photography or the disconnect from reality that comes from documenting everything through video. I don't think Michael Powell, as brilliant as he could be as a director, had the foresight to know how relevant this would be 50 years down the line, but that does nothing to dull its effectiveness.
Considering the lead character is a quiet, strange, emotionally stunted only child the comparisons to Psycho are inevitable, and it is interesting that the two came out almost at the exact same time with Peeping Tom actually beating it to the punch by a few months. There are some thematic similarities that make the coincidence of their close release act as solid proof to there being some sort of shared well of creation that artists borrow from. Both films are heavily psychological and deal with adults who were screwed up from their upringings, Mark being fucked up here because of his father's experiments with fear instead of Norman's mother's experiments with incest. Peeping Tom does not have as grand a twist as Psycho, instead going with a ""shocking"" turn at the end as opposed to a grand reveal. Both films also act as their respective film industry's proto-slasher and serve as an influential point where what was ""appropriate"" in a film began to soften. Although, in Peeping Tom's case, that did not come easily.
Peeping Tom is one of the best movies to ever completely ruin someone's career. It was so controversial when it came out that Michael Powell, despite being an iconic mainstay in film for almost 40 years, found it nearly impossible to find work in his home country. Stuffy uptight British herbs were so incensed by a movie that had sex AND violence that they excoriated it through brutal reviews and censurus editing. Luckily time has proved the English and the olds wrong while proving the youngs and the French right - as usual - and now Peeping Tom is rightly appreciated for being one of the most important building blocks of psychological horror.

"I first encountered Michael Powell's Peeping Tom in film studies at university. Only the opening sequence was shown and the artifice of the backlot and the lighting scheme grabbed my attention. I sought out the Criterion DVD and watched the film several times. Now, here it is, back in the Criterion Collection and restored in 4K UHD by StudioCanal. Right off the bat, this is one of the finest looking 4K's I have seen all year - although Criterion still have issues when it comes to encoding, oi vey! This film destroyed Michael Powell's flawless career. The pearl clutching critics at the time absolutely savaged it, and down went Powell's career. That same year, a little film called Psycho was unleashed. Hitch told the studio and warned critics that ""I won't have what happened to poor Mickey Powell happen to me with Psycho."" Indeed, Psycho was heralded as a masterpiece whereas Peeping Tom was dismissed as trash. Years later, Martin Scorsese would sing its praises and the film would finally be re-evaluated for the transgressive masterpiece that it is.
Carl Boehm stars as Mark Lewis - a psychopathic snuff filmmaker whose day job is as a focus puller on studio pictures in London. He also photographs nudies that are sold illegally at a corner newspaper shop. It's a simple premise and Powell delves deeply into Mark's psychology throughout the course of the film. In a meta touch, Powell plays Mark's father in old footage - if memory serves, Powell's own son plays Mark in said footage as well. Another metatextual touch is the casting of Moira Sheerer as a dancing victim - Powell and Sheerer previously collaborated on the classic The Red Shoes in 1948. Anna Massey plays something of a love interest in Helen, and Massey would eventually go on to work for Hitchcock in 1972's Frenzy - a later and much lesser Hitch effort. Otto Heller's cinematography here is astoundingly good and one could be forgiven in thinking that it was in fact Powell's usual Archer collaborator Jack Cardiff. It's a lush looking flick, all off Powell's are. Everything congeals into a wondrous nightmare of a thriller. Peeping Tom gets my patented strong recommend as does this release.",4.5

"Der Großvater des Slashers.
Ja, mehr muss man wohl nicht sagen.
Nein, natürlich gibt es etwas darüber zu besprechen.
""Peeping Tom"" (Deutsch: ""Augen der Angst"") hat als Film wohl schon alles durchgemacht, was man durchmachen kann. Die Karrieren von Regisseur Michael Powell und Schauspieler Karlheinz Böhm (der perfekt als Mark Hamills Vater durchgehen kann) wurden schlagartig beendet, der Film wurde von der Kritik aus aller Welt vernichtet, das Publikum protestierte gegen die nahegelegene Lust an Gewalt (besonders in Deutschland, wo man Böhm noch als Liebhaber Frrranz von Sissi liebte) und ja, FSK 18.
Und noch dazu wurde Michael Powell vorgeworfen, wo er kurz als Vater des Mörders sich darstellt und ihm Sympathie zum Mörder früher vorgeworfen wurde.
Das war damals wie ein Schuss ins Knie, aber heute wird er wirklich als den Mitbegründer des Slasher-Genres und als Meisterwerk bezeichnet, obwohl er an sich keine expliziten Gewaltszenen zeigt, was aber die Gewalt in den Köpfen des Publikums reproduziert.
Die Handlung ist kurz und prägnant:
Ein von einer psychisch verstörenden und von Angst begleitenden Kindheit, die durch den Vater beeinflusst wurde, arbeitet ein junger, introvertierter Mann namens Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) als Kameramann in einem Filmstudio. Keiner weiß aber von seinen Machenschaften. Er tötet Frauen, wenn sie alleine mit ihm sind. Dabei filmt er mit einer Kamera ihre letzten Momente vor dem Tod (der Beginn ist fantastisch, weil er mit der Kameraperspektive den ersten Mord verfolgt), die besonders von der totalen Angst gepackt sind. Aber bald lernt er die junge Nachbarin Helen (Anna Massey) kennen, zu die er eine putzige und merkwürdige Beziehung beginnt. Irgendwann wird ein von ihm begangener Mord von der Polizei ermittelt und ab da an befindet er sich auf einen schmalen Grat.
Im Cast sind noch Maxine Audley, die bezaubernde Tänzerin Moira Shearer, Michael Goodliffe und weitere britische Schauspieler, die ich noch nie in meinem Leben gehört und gesehen habe.
Vom Schauspiel her ist Karlheinz Böhm einsame Spitze. Er trägt förmlich den Film.
Der Zuschauer bekommt nur die Perspektive des Mörders geboten und das war damals ein absolutes No-Go. Weil in dem Sinne sind wir mit seinem Voyeurismus involviert, da er seine Taten aufnimmt und auf Filmband in seinem Hinterzimmer abspielt und sich ansieht. Es ist ein bewusst gewähltes Mittel der Schaulust und hat eine sehr psychologische Komponente. Ein Paradebeispiel für die Kraft der Verführung.
Außerdem spielt auch die Farbe Rot eine tragende Rolle und seine Waffe steht symbolträchtig für Männlichkeit. Das klingt zunächst verwirrend und ich nenne lieber seine Waffe.
Es ist ein Kamerastativ mit drei Beinen, wovon eins mit einer scharfen Klinge ausgestattet ist. Seht ihr die Referenz zur Männlichkeit schon? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Das aber ist alles nur unterschwellig zu der hervorragend erzählten Geschichte, die mit ihrem Ende ein wohl geniales Finale für solch einen Charakter im Gedächtnis lange bleiben wird.
Er wurde zerstückelt, besser gesagt gekürzt durch zu explizite Szenen der Nacktheit. Kürzungen oder Zerstückelung von Filmen ist in den meisten Fällen das Todesurteil für ein Kunstprodukt. Dennoch funktioniert der Film erstaunlich gut in dem Sinne der nicht gezeigten. Wie ich schon oben erwähnte, spielt da eine psychologische Komponente dazu, was für die Zeit, abseits der harten Kritik, ein frischer Wind sein muss. Durch die Erinnerungen, die mittels Kameraufnahmen des Vaters vorgestellt werden, hat man auch Mitleid für den Täter, der äußerlich sehr harmlos erscheint und das mochte das Publikum von 1960 ganz und gar nicht.
""Peeping Tom"" ist eine absolute Empfehlug meinerseits für alle Freunde des Krimi-Kinos und der Perspektivwahl des Mörders. Über eine Empfehlung an Psychologen muss ich nicht sprechen, denn das ist Pflicht!",4.5

"So transgressive in its time, Peeping Tom gives us the serial killer Mark as a point of view character. Mark is the ultimate voyeur: peeping Tom, pornographer, focus puller on a film set, street photographer, and a killer with a deadly camera. He brings us along with him, highlighting our own voyeurism as the audience. It also struck me just how funny and subserve the dialogue was, rife with dryly delivered jabs and japes. It cost Powell his career at the time but it stands as exemplary satire, taking swipes at so many industries and reflecting our own voyeurism back at us.

"Brian DePalma is so often compared to Alfred Hitchcock that it’s easy to forget that Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom walked so that DePalma could run with all of his creepy voyeuristic psychos. Even the opening scene of Peeping Tom, which is from the point of view of its main character, Mark Lewis’s handheld camera as he follows and murders his latest victim, is regurgitated by DePalma in the film-within-a-film that opens Blow Out.
Powell, who seems to be ahead of the times on more than one occasion, unfortunately saw a damaging blow to his reputation after Peeping Tom’s release. But it’s no surprise that the reaction to the film upon its release in 1960 was so negative. Sure, Psycho was released in the same year, but the audience doesn’t spend the entire runtime of that film with Norman Bates, nor does Hitchcock really try to have the audience empathize with him.
In Peeping Tom, Lewis (played by Carl Boehm, who wields a powerful combination of danger, meekness, and addictive impulse) is front and center throughout the film. His propensities are never hidden from the audience or treated as a simple plot twist. He’s a murderer, yes, but his true addiction is to filming the fear in his victims’ eyes, something we as a film-consuming society are arguably guilty of as well. And throughout the film it’s clear that Powell is empathizing with his serial killer protagonist. He gives Lewis a tragic backstory, or at least hints of one, in the form of an abusive, experiment-happy psychologist father. He also has the film’s most sympathetic character Helen (played very gracefully by Anna Massey) empathize with Lewis despite her growing knowledge of his activities.
This all isn’t necessarily a knock on Psycho, which is an absolute classic, but it does show how far ahead Peeping Tom is tonally and thematically. It doesn’t end on a note of hatred towards Lewis, nor does it punish its audience for empathizing with Lewis despite his murderous tendencies.
Of course, Peeping Tom is visually stunning as well. Powell continues with his fantastic use of color, albeit in a tonally dark, neon-like manner, and his camera movements throughout conjure the film’s theme of voyeurism perfectly. He’s also quite adept at building tension using sound, cinematography, and editing, especially in a long, taut scene between Lewis and Moira Shearer’s Vivian, a stand-in who unfortunately subjects herself to one of Lewis’s filming sessions.

Mini-Journey: Bullseye! with the Archers",4.5
"An exploration of the voyeuristic nature of the camera and the anxieties that are produced by the exploitative nature of the male gaze. Childhood trauma and excessive technological surroundings in youth is what has led the main character to behave in this voyeuristic way. Are these ideas all based on pure anxiety surrounding the effects of the camera's ability for constant documentation and exploitation or is there a genuine fear to be held?
Loved the absolute sinister usage of lighting/color play that leads to setting up various tense and downright alienating scenes that pay-off with a strong sense of mise-en-scène. Also love the self-reflexive nature of film-making that we're constantly reminded of. Film about film always seems to have an appealing quality.
One quote in particular, the one where another doctor informs the main character that he has ""his father's eyes"" produces a surprisingly chilling reaction and has every right to be examined and deconstructed.
Also the lead actor, Karlheinz Böhm ends up being a Fassbinder regular which makes watching his performance so much more exciting.",4.0

"The Criterion Challenge 2022 - Film #31
It feels impossible to talk about this movie without at least bringing up Psycho, which, like Peeping Tom, also came out in 1960 and touches on similar taboo topics such as voyeurism, obsession, and serial killers and draws a similar parallel between sex and violence. And while I don't think Peeping Tom is quite as good Hitchcock's masterpiece, it does push those particular boundaries just a little bit more. I can easily see why they both caused so much controversy upon release.
Even putting that aside though, Peeping Tom is also just a really well made and legitimately tense thriller beyond being so far ahead of its time and one of the first movies to really cover such dark subject matter so explicitly. Its influence can be felt even today, especially in the slasher genre. That long POV shot of the killer stalking his prey that the movie opens with feels downright modern and I'd be shocked if it wasn't a key inspiration for the opening sequence in the original Halloween.",4.0

The acting is superb too, with Karlheinz Bohm giving a particularly nuanced performance that is both heartbreaking and frightening.",4.5
"Para a nova edição da Multiplot! entitulada ""Pedagogias da Imagem"", escrevi sobre Peeping Tom e o encontro entre os dois significados de shoot (filmar/atirar) no texto Point and Shoot: Peeping Tom. Segue aqui o link e um trecho abaixo:
""Se filmar e matar se confundem, quando Lewis está conduzindo uma de suas vítimas para o abate, isso significa que, cinematograficamente, ela deve estar sob a perfeita posição, luz, ângulo e distância para ser enquadrada pela câmera. Em outras palavras, matar exige uma mise-en-scène, em que a cena do crime também se torna um palco ou um cenário, no qual a pessoa vira protagonista de sua própria morte. É exatamente isso que acontece na sequência que se passa no estúdio de Cinema, na qual a personagem da atriz, enquanto ensaia um número musical se movimentando pelos espaços, vai tendo seu posicionamento orquestrado por Lewis, sem que ela perceba algo de errado, até chegar na marcação ideal desejada por ele.
Na equivalência entre filmar e matar, Powell faz com que vejamos as sequências que conduzem ao assassinato a partir de uma câmera subjetiva, que é a própria filmagem diegética que o protagonista faz. Então, o resultado dessa escolha leva à uma confusão tripla do olhar, que envolve o diretor Powell, o protagonista Lewis e o próprio espectador. Nesse sentido, há um movimento pedagógico em dar luz ao próprio male gaze escondido pela indústria hollywoodiana. Segundo Anneke Smelik, em seu artigo Gaze, “nos filmes clássicos de Hollywood, o personagem masculino olha para uma mulher enquanto a câmera filma o que ele vê. Como a câmera filma junto com o personagem masculino, o espectador é convidado – ou melhor, forçado – a adotar uma posição masculina. O ‘male gaze’ é uma estrutura cinematográfica que combina um olhar triplo: câmera, personagem masculino e espectador.” Sendo assim, fazendo um movimento de tornar o simbólico algo literal, quando uma mulher é olhada e desejada pelo male gaze em Tortura do Medo, isso se torna igual a sua sentença de morte. Inclusive, Powell nunca mostra frontalmente os momentos de perfuração, sempre fazendo uma elipse, de modo que a última imagem daquelas mulheres não é a da penetração com a arma, mas do olhar apavorado para a câmera, predominando a ideia da morte pelo olhar do que pela morte física.""",4.0
"Peeping Tom è uno strabiliante film di genere, che prende il gusto più sordido dei thriller di Alfred Hitchcock quali The Lodger, per mettere in campo un trattato sul cinema e sul suo grande fascino morboso, rendendo noi allo stesso tempo i carnefici di questa visione collettiva di paura e morte (la scena in cui la ragazza osserva il filmato dell'omicidio fuori campo è un acuto ribaltamento che per un attimo ci fa indossare la maschera del protagonista voyeur in cerca di facili emozioni).
Nel tributare omaggio al cinema muto Powell fa di meglio, anticipando Kiyoshi Kurosawa, nell'utilizzarne il fascino anacronistico e grezzo; un audiovisivo che stride nella sua forma piana, bianco e nera, quasi meschina e blasfema, con il gusto figurativo postmoderno di luci dai colori inconfondibilmente puri e di decorazioni strabordanti degli appartamenti dove si consumano gli omicidi.
Spesso tra cinefili si parla di quanto un film sia invecchiato, mentre con il film di Powell accade che è il cinema stesso ad apparire vecchio nel contesto odierno; temo che oggi il cinema non sia più, in gran parte, uno strumento capace di essere un tale strumento di morte e suggestione criminale se portato ai suoi estremi sregolati. Penso che oggi quel ruolo di minaccia affascinante scaturita dalla riproduzione istantanea del reale sia incarnato dagli smartphone e dagli spazi condivisi social.",5.0

Michael Powell said Fuck YOU the fifties are over BITCH,5.0
"I thought this would be a lot trashier based on the poster and reception it received on release but this was a really well done, dark look at the psyche of a very sympathetic murderer.
I really like how the story starts out with a murder and it seems to set up a crazed killer but then spends a solid chunk of time getting to know him and his budding relationship with the woman downstairs as we learn that he had a super messed up childhood and his dad probably murdered his mom. It lends everything bad he does a sort of feeling that he isn't really responsible especially since he knows he has a problem.
The camerwork and editing were top notch shifting from voyeristic to almost documentary style but always making the characters feel relatable.
There were also a few lines that made me laugh including this one liner: [an elderly customer has just hurried out of the shop after purchasing pornography and a daily newspaper] ""Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight""
It's dirty but not trashy and I love how it actually spent enough time to let me get to know and sympathize with a murderer and then let me hate myself for it because it's so tragic.
Having a movie set play prominently in the story as the day job of the killer also gave a nice meta layer to everything and that ending was just killer.
Really well made movie that deserves a wider appreciation if only for subverting so many genre tropes and it's easy to see why this is a cult classic.",3.5
"A super slick, damningly disturbing thriller that's as creepy as it is stylish. Michael Powell is famous for packing his movies with so *much*, the seams are bursting with color, a meta conversation on his love of film, dancing, romance, trauma, fear, but the plot is never lost. Everything here is perfectly planned and laid out. The scares stand the test of time, and are probably just as impactful on a rewatch.",4.5

"“Peeping Tom” is unquestionably a film about voyeurism, but what makes it almost untouched by Cinema afterwards is that it critiques two subjects being studied: the main character, Mark Lewis, and the audience watching the film. It is perhaps the definitive film about voyeurism because it’s one of the few films that feels rooted in the topic – the subject under the filmmaker’s lens and the subjects observing the footage and their reactions; it is a circle of events all stemming back to “Peeping Tom.” Powell is a very precise filmmaker, a meticulous director with unquestionable attention to detail – any notion of someone even denying this clearly hasn’t seen anything he’s made with Pressburger. Even with Pressburger’s absence, Powell’s precision is still within the text of “Peeping Tom:” like all the great genre filmmakers, Powell only shows the audience how much he determines is right, how much of the horror we’re able to see in order to attempt to piece the puzzle. But in doing so, “Peeping Tom” is then critiquing us based off our reactions – our hunger for more violence and sex and death and the film delivers it in dosages, revealing at the end that we’re just as much of perverts or voyeurs as Mark is.
This calls into question Mark’s reasoning for his fascination for voyeurism and Powell reveals sparse details with the intent on allowing us to put Mark together. Mark’s fascination stems from his father’s abuse on him as a small child; Mark’s father, ever since Mark was a baby, would record him, studying him, provoking him, and tormenting him into getting reactions – Mark, in one scene, is watching some of these home videos and all we can see is his face and the sounds of a child pleading and crying: Mark pleading to his father to let him be and leave him alone. The screams get louder, more painful, and heard to listen to. Mark then tries to separate himself from this painful childhood as he talks to a doctor about if it’s possible for someone like him to be cured from his voyeuristic ways. Powell doesn’t want us to fear Mark: Powell wants us to empathize with him because he’s struggling to rid himself of these tendencies and ultimately fails. His camera is the manifestation of his gaze. An urge or a jolt and he’s grabbing the camera and acting out his documentary – his fetish for the murder and for sex – and he cannot stop. The moment when he realizes that his attempts at breaking away from what his father has programmed in his brain are fruitless, he finishes the documentary. It's both a fetish film and a film about his descent and struggle – he ends both.",5.0

"Released in 1960, just two months before Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, this influential British thriller is often cited as the first slasher film. It's about a photographer who films his victims as he stabs them - with a blade attached to the end of his tripod. He has an obsession with capturing authentic fear on camera thanks to an abusive father, a scientist who studied voyeurism and fear and used his son as a test subject. Many of the hallmarks of what would come to define the slasher genre are present here: a series of murders seen from the POV of the killer, victims that are exclusively young sexually active women, and an extremely phallic murder weapon.
It's criminal that this film isn't as well known as Psycho, because it's arguably just as good. At release it was panned by critics and audiences who found it too shocking and controversial, to the point where it pretty much ruined Powell's career as a director. It mostly feels pretty tame today though - despite the sometimes racy subject matter, there isn't any nudity or explicit violence on screen. The implied violence is disturbing enough on its own, and there are a couple of really good tense and scary scenes. This is a very stylish film too, with sometimes garish colored lighting that reminds me very much of Mario Bava. Blood and Black Lace came out four years later, and I have to imagine that this was an influence on Bava as he made that film.
While you can see the influence of this film throughout basically the whole slasher subgenre, the plot in particular was aped pretty heavily for the sleazy '80s slasher Maniac (and its less sleazy but more disturbing 2012 remake starring Elijah Wood). In the 60 years since it was released, both audiences and critics have come around on it and it is now widely considered to be a classic. Although it's much closer to Hitchcock than Halloween, it's importance in the birth of the slasher genre is unmistakable.",5.0

You get the feeling there's a part of him that's uncomfortable with the darkness within him and striving to overcome it for the sake of his love interest Helen. I imagine focusing the film on the killer rather than his victims, and attempting to humanize the monster were bold choices for the time. That Powell was able to make you feel both repulsed and invested in Mark's story is impressive as hell.

A Great idea, and it is superbly executed. The acting is magnificent, especially Mark the (Dare i say) protagonist. He brought so much humanity to such a menacing character. Helen and her mother were also great.
There were alot of GREAT cuts in the film, and the cinematography was amazing at times. The POV worked so well. There was one scene in particular, where he was filming the redheaded stand-in in the studio, where she started dancing, and Mark got to channel his inner director. It was so great, and i would say the best scene in the movie, even better than the finale.

I did't expect to have a screening, and I certainly didn't expect the film screened to be this classic British horror film I've had on my radar for some time. Of course, thematically Peeping Tom is perfectly in-line with what we've been looking at all semester. Sex, violence, voyeurism, and misogyny have been predominant ideas looked at throughout the course and they came through very strong in this psychologically probing horror movie. Like Psycho, the main character is a disturbed young man obsessed with violence, watching, and an unsettling fixation on a parental figure. Carl Boehm is great in the lead role, charming and sympathetic, but also awkward, obsessed, and deeply disturbed. The rest of the cast is full of actors who give interesting turns even in small roles. Michael Powell's colours are as vivid as ever and it's interesting to see them re-worked for something as overtly horrific as this. Additionally, the man crafts some really suspenseful scenes and the whole film builds to one hell of a climax.

The worst is when he shows his neighbor his ""home movies"". It starts out seemingly innocent, then quickly turns disturbing, and eventually we see Mark's father filming him as a child laying next to his mother's dead body. The movie always shows or tells us just enough to let our minds go wild filling in the rest. Like when the police say the dead victims have expressions of horror unlike anything they've ever seen, but we never see this ourselves. Peeping Tom is creepy as hell, and equally as brilliant, and it is at least tied for the best movie I watched during Hoop-Tober. It's a no-brainer must see classic of the genre.",5.0
"""Peeping Tom"" is all the more relevant today when everyone carries a camera in their pocket. It's a lot of things at once; a slasher film, a psychological thriller, a meditation on media, an indictment of movie goers looking for cheap thrills, a Freudian analysis of how our parents affect our adult selves. It's also just a damn good film, a contemporary of ""Psycho"" and - arguably - the better film for present day audiences. Highly recommended and somewhat newly out on Criterion.
(Sidenote: ""Psycho"" vs ""Peeping Tom""... They came out within months, so neither influenced the other. While I think ""Psycho"" is a great film, it is impossible for present day audiences to truly appreciate it when we know all the twists beforehand and entire cable series are made around the ending. See my recent-ish ""Psycho"" review if you care for more, but as far as it pertains to ""Peeping Tom,"" I think ""Psycho"" relies on tricks - albeit masterful ones - to keep the audience on its toes constantly. ""Peeping Tom"" touches the same prurient nerves for on-screen titillation, yet says more about human nature and who we are as an audience, all while telling a more complete narrative. For my money, ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" are both much better films than ""Psycho"" (and ""Peeping Tom"" for that matter, ""Vertigo"" is straight up one of the best films ever made. Complaints/complements in the comments...)",4.0
"Peeping Tom is a film that could have easily been better, or I could have enjoyed a greater deal. Sharing countless similarities to Hitchcock's nature and the nature of his penultimate masterpiece, Psycho, right down to the protagonists of both films and their fierce obsession to a particular parent, Peeping Tom is definitely creepy, often frightening, revolutionary and innovative piece of filmmaking that too often lingers outside of the exploration of the protagonist's psychological complications. Entertaining for the most part but slightly dull at other times, the best of Peeping Tom is exposed to the viewer in the very opening scene of the film, the scene being a clear indication to the timeless factor of the film.
Mark Lewis, an aspiring filmmaker, is a serial killer who murders young women and films their dying reactions.
Karlheinz Böhm plays Mark and his performance is fine. In a year which saw a phenomenal performance of a similarly maniacal antagonist, Norman Bates, Böhm's performance truly lacks the clear and believable psychological conflict of his character. Anne Massey as Helen, a rather interesting character, is also fine but not great.
Visually stunning in every possible frame of film, Otto Heller's cinematography allows the viewer to fall into the story. With explicit detail and immaculate framing, Peeping Tom is certainly a visual marvel. Conceptually, Peeping Tom is a masterpiece, completely fascinating, terrifying, mean and truly dark. Truly Hitchcock-ian in nature, where Peeping Tom fails to entertain, thrill and terrify is in the execution and the rather bland segments of the film that too heavily deal on the relationship between Böhm and Massey's respective characters.
Scenes that revolve around the camera or where the viewer is able to dwell into the fascinating history of Mark is compelling, well executed, filmed and scripted. Other scenes, too often linger in regions that do not necessarily destroy the film, but slightly harm it. A slight let down, at times brilliant and entertaining, but at other times overlong, Peeping Tom is nevertheless a film well ahead of its time and has transcended eras; still terrifying, innovative and mean by today's standards.

"Powerful, prophetic character study that's just...it's just so good. Like really, wow.
An exploration of cinematic voyeurism primarily focused on our love for seeing others in distress on film. 20 years later it would inspire a genre that it continues to perversely expose the perversion of to this day better than anything it could've been reacting to. But I don't know if I've seen a commentary on this subject that doubles as a celebration of cinema in the way this film does.
Having been raised as a subject of a science experiment constantly subjected to fear, Mark Lewis follows in his father's footsteps in this study, but now being numb to the concept of fear he goes to greater extremes. There are actually probably more interpretations of his motivation, as it remains pretty ambiguous. It does not chide the audience for sympathizing with him anymore than what is inherent in his actions. The important part is that he's lost his humanity. This is where maybe the most genius use of an audience stand in I've ever seen comes in.
It's established early on that Mark is possibly the most sympathetic horror movie villain of all time. He kills, but he's not irredeemable. This makes us, the audience, curious of him and want to see him regain his humanity. The same can be said of Helen, who's also written a book on a magic camera that sees people as they were when they were children. Mark's loss of a childhood fits perfectly here, meaning their relationship, if it blossomed, would've been the rekindling of life for him and a new beginning. The fact that someone treats him like a human being also makes him able to open up to her, making for expository moments that are actually lovely.
Mark works in a film studio, where we see what appears to be a light comedy being made. This is where the celebration of cinema aspect comes in, as it both injects humor into the film and gives us the joy of the movies we all crave as cinephiles. It would be obnoxious and hypocritical to suggest that film is purely voyeuristic in a cinematic context. My favorite film, Cache, dwells on this point without humor, but acknowledges that film is a means to exposing the truth. The humor here serves as a perfect counterpoint to the dour nature of the rest of the subject matter. There's also a theater mentioned twice called ""The Everyman"" which is another little aside on both the universal joy of film and how we're all guilty of this mad voyeurism.
The police are kind of fascinated with Mark's camera, as one holds it and at one points it at Mark and says ""gotcha!"" This scene of questioning Mark is seemingly perfunctory to the plot other than this. It's a quick aside to the fascination and perceived innocuousness of filming.
I could go on and on about all the wonderful little moments like this in the film. The one where the movie's being made and the actress has to keep fainting to comment on the parallels between cinema and stress and fear (or really emotion as a whole). The early ones that literalize the pornography comparison to get it out of the way early and not dwell on it, but remain meaningful. The ones with Helen's blind mother. But the truth is, as a whole, this is a poignant tragedy of a mad scientist doomed to take others down with him as he tries and fails to reclaim his humanity. In fact, perhaps the reason he was making the documentary, aside from following in his father's footsteps, was some vague subconscious attempt to get people to understand him. To show people the fear that he routinely felt. To make an achingly personal film and his persecution for trying to do so in the only insane way he knew how.

"Left me a bit cold, unfortunately — found the kills here to be really underwhelming and goofy a lot of the time (and not in an endearing way). And for a film as plainly set on doing set-up and payoff type thrills, there just isn’t much else to chew on as a detractor to the most of the genre stuff. There does seem to be some greater commentary about the media and how it relates to the titular ‘Peeping Tom’ ethos — a popular review for this reads “this is actually about vloggers.” — but frankly I don’t find that compelling enough for it to justify PEEPING TOM’s complete narrative monotony (which is made all the more insufferable by the shell of a protagonist). While sure, he’s outwardly an offbeat, crazed serial killer, it never really feels like he’s an engrossing character so much as a vessel for cheap thrills and surface-level social commentary (amplified by the ensemble of mannered performances, essentially gutting the film of any potential nuance). That being said, this is way too damn visually striking (viz. the bright and elaborate set design as well as the the lurid, over-saturated look of the whole thing) and idiosyncratic for the time it was released to discard in its entirety, but honestly it just leaves me disappointed that the narrative facelessness was never able to live up to the visual splendor. “Instinct’s a wonderful thing, isn’t it, Mark?”",2.0

"The camera is mystified, as some contorted entrance way into the soul, a third eye of sorts, enabling buried pleasures to find extolment via the mediation of the lens, the fetishized segregation of people from those whom are confronted. It's not the most densely stacked perspective on the violence of a camera, though its creative utility of the various parts in its machinery as literal weapon are humorous and ironically pointed, whether as phallic symbolism or antagonized modernity (in many ways, this reminds me of the specific playfulness of Modern Times' nightmare, though, more brashly realized in the genre). If this is the first slasher film, its only fitting: the genesis of such rampant cycles regarding murder was the camera, the razor-edge of its gaze, its victimization and objectification sprawling into a system of archetypes, further solidifying a relationship this film seems to be interested in unsettling. Romantic, but a bit lost in its own psychoanalysis, focused too much on the diegetic actions of a man and not on why he wields the camera.",0.0

"Hooptober 2018 Presents: Peeping Tom
Here's to the first of a potential six Halloween reviews, and I still need to watch three more horror films in the next eight hours in order to achieve Pumpkin King status. Kill me.
Anyways, let's talk about Michael Powell, the poor soul. His life was ruined - unlike mine - WITHOUT the aid of Hooptober. All he had to do was release an awesome film, the critics did the rest. Whereas Hitchcock delivered a 1960 feature about a deranged serial killer with parental issues and became universally acclaimed, Powell took all the same steps a few months earlier and had his career sent to hell. Why the world treated these two talented men differently I only may speculate; perhaps British people are more prude than Americans.
I think it's interesting to compare this movie to Funny Games because they both get meta with their horror in order to make a point about the genre's creation and consumption. Haneke criticized those who get off on pure suffering, enjoying the despair of fictional characters from the safety of behind a screen, but Powell puts the blame on the director themselves! He likens direction to a lunatic's urges, interested in their art to the extent that they might put human lives on the line. Funnily enough, Alfred ""I'll throw live birds at you for extra realism"" Hitchcock embodied this lifestyle more than Powell.
The camera is a murder instrument. Didn't people use to believe a photograph could steal your soul? Where exactly does that leave the recording of video?

"I don't think Mark ever moved past viewing himself as a lab rat. Whether his voyeuristic tendencies were what inspired his father to study him in the first place or they arose from a childhood filled with constant manipulation and documentation, we're not allowed to know, but it's clear his pathological need for a camera on his person at all time originates in those experiences. Where he's already drawn to lurk and stalk and peer at the taboo, the truth of the naked eye simply isn't enough for him - it all must go through the camera, must be relived on the projector hours later. If he can't catalog and study every tiny impulse, then his documentary goes incomplete, his understanding weakens, the experiment his father began so many years ago fails. What began as lizards in the bed and icy cold brutal emotional treatment becomes work in a film production's camera crew, private work producing naughty spreads for under-the-counter sale, late nights stalking prostitutes with specialty camera cum weaponry to produce and analyze the ultimate in terror. His entire life is a carefully constructed series of environmental triggers and control groups intended to fill in that forever blank final conclusion.
Under these circumstances, Mark cannot allow himself to act as a proper human. To be sure, when Helen from downstairs casts her attention on him and remains determined to know him even after getting overpowering glimpses into his past and pathology, it feels nice, warm, ever so tempting. A young woman who finds him interesting as a conversation partner and potentially more, who insists her way into his life and doesn't flinch regardless what horrors she sees, whose faces seems just perfect if contorted in ghastly, mortal terror before Mark's camera and mirror and knife. That's the catch, of course. Whatever Mark finds interesting, compelling, quickening, instantly becomes a candidate for his self-questioning experiments, which by this stage involve surreptitious machinations to frighten the subjects of his fascination near-to-death, then push them the rest of the way at steel's edge in a pristinely framed shot, so he might comprehend what draws him to such things, and in understanding perhaps destroy it. But he can't gain this knowledge without bloodshed, which means he cannot allow himself closeness with anyone he might value, which means the plot of Peeping Tom cannot happen without pushing Mark to near destruction.
He's a worthy successor to Peter Lorre's original serial killer in M, contrasting the mysterious shadow on the wall whose inner life went unknown until a desperate, pleading climax with a clinical young man who'll readily disgorge reams of detail about his past while leaving key inflection points unspoken, found only in twitchings on the face and recoilings of the spine. Certainly he deserves sympathy, circumstance and chemistry driving him to acts he knows reprehensible, history and habit leaving him only further indulgence of the very behaviors that make him a murderer as means of self-diagnosis and reflection. Compulsion and revulsion thereof never had a better screen avatar. Compared to cinematic twin and fellow slasher progenitor Norman Bates, though, it's hard to say whether audience sympathy might do Mark any good. Norman at least twisted squirmed against categorization, bloodletting people and celluloid alike whenever they try to make him fit, a true experiential outsider, an exploration of a mind made other in a world insistent nothing is truly beyond easy label. Even Lorre's killer made something of his pleas by revealing a disgusting tendency to want his ilk tortured more than his victims protected.
Mark can't gain anything from letting one's heart bleed for him. He was born in a ditch that other dug into a hole, and which he himself expanded into a pit. A circumstance all too common, if not so fantastically realized as in a Michael Powell production, the body who has known unkindness and depersonalization as their only tutors from out the womb, whose coping mechanisms and stabilizing practices are maladaptive to the core. We can hear what he says, fill in what he implies, say we know what he feels and want to see him redeemed through psychological help, or Helen's love, or justice at the inspector's hand, but it all comes to nothing. Once we learn enough about Mark, after practically no time at all as it happens, we can't escape the realization he will eventually succumb to the warring impulses between allowing his pathology run of his life and trying for something beyond it, and turn the camera on himself to seek the comfort of conclusions in the last possible unprobed corner. This is not a man whose suffering teaches us something about how we regard him, nor whose madness challenges what we think thinkable; Mark just shows a man failed by his family and by himself, who's bound for self-destruction and only rushes there faster the harder you pull him away.
If he got his answer in the end, hard to say it's one I'd ever want to know.",4.5
"great film - it’s layered with so many different emotions. i came into this thinking it’d be a conventional slasher-thriller film but it’s romantic, sad and covers the cyclical nature of abuse with surprising sensitivity. great acting performances too and adored the way the film picks up on some of the wider themes of british culture at the time",4.5
"""What would frighten me to death? Set the mood for me.""
Impossibly beautiful and exceptionally chilling. Part of what is so unnerving about this film is its astute, pretty understated observations about masculine psychology and the (usually) latent sadism of the male gaze. It indicts cinema as a medium, or at least the Hollywood system, in a way that's at once simple and profound. Why do we like to watch people who can't see us watching them? What characterizes the drive to create that kind of art?
It would be an overstatement to say that all film is exploitative or that all filmmakers are perverts, but voyeurism is a fundamental facet of the art form, not a niche. For that reason, Peeping Tom is an essential text. It's also just a damn good movie!",0.0

"Mark é um personagem fascinante e repleto de camadas, não dá para negar isso. Servindo de experimento pelo próprio pai, o filho acabou crescendo com a mente quebrada e refletindo no tratamento para com as mulheres. Ele acaba evoluindo o trabalho de pai, parecendo até uma homenagem mórbida. Como se quisesse agradecer pelo terror que passava durante a infância.
Seu Modus Operandi consiste em captar o medo das mulheres e documentar tudo. Claramente uma forma de exercer o seu poder e dominância para com elas. Desprezar é a palavra-chave de Mark. Parece ser totalmente o correto a ser feito. Cada serial killer tem a sua motivação que remonta à infância ou não, o gatilho necessário para desenvolver essa psique. Mark também traz o voyeur como seu aliado sombrio e abre discussão sobre temas que seriam amplamente discutidos em nossos dias.
Helen é bem importante para a trama pelo vínculo criado com Mark. Seria possível ele mudar? Ela poderia mostrar mais do lado humano? Dizem que pessoas ruins nascem ruins ou desenvolvem a ruindade ao longo da vida. Esse debate rende muito e nada é unânime. A figura da Mrs. Stephens foi tão importante quanto para mostrar alguma exceção às regras de Mark. A boa sacada de não ser vítima justamente por ser cega e Mark não poderia captar o que mais lhe estimula.
A Tortura do Medo desenvolve bem a psique de Mark e aborda sua infância traumática, conciliando seu lado voyeur. Assuntos que estariam sendo discutidos constantemente um bom tempo depois. Outro saldo positivo é o jeito de vermos as mortes. Somos tão voyeur quanto o personagem e temos a mesma visão privilegiada. Como se ele estivesse compartilhando seu segredo obscuro com a gente. A solução final da trama poderia ter sido de outro jeito, mas não tira o brilho do filme.",3.5
"Cinema is a perverts medium. Seamlessly shifting perspectives from eye to camera to the point of no longer knowing the difference: a fully complicit audience.  
goes further than Hitchcock manages I reckon, right into the psychosexual meat of voyeurism + paraphilic sexuality made infinitely more possible by the Industrial Revolution; these contraptions for us to exploit our own perversities. The spectacle of the horror on a woman’s face: thousands of people would flock the cinema for such an image; something Psycho becomes iconic for, but Powell holds us at a distance from this image and goes so far as to point a mirror right at us! as we merge with it. I just think the knife at the end of the camera stand with the mirror is genius

"I went into this with high hopes, and I’m now a little disappointed. Though I would rewatch this to further understand and examine, I didn’t really enjoy it. Maybe that’s not the intention, but Carl Boehm’s performance felt overacted to the point of feeling silly, which I didn’t care for all that much. The film’s look and atmosphere is thoughtful and well done, but the film’s overall execution didn’t land with me as I thought it would. If it landed with you, by all means go right ahead and love it.",3.0
"Perhaps the creepiest film I've ever seen. It just gets under my skin. The intimate psychology of a psychopath, without any remove. It is deeply uncomfortable to watch. Or at least I find it so. There is something in Venn diagram between the softness of the performances (Anna Massey and Carl Boehm); the exquisite colour photography, and the lurid seediness of violence, which I find deeply unpleasant. Only in the most positive way, of course.
Massey and Boehm deserve a lot of credit, they don't play it as victim and killer, but something more intimate. It is probably clichéd now, but the mix of romance, voyeurism, and murder. All swirling together within our protagonist still feels modern. There is intriguingly a psychological explanation for Boehm in the film; it plays somewhat as a reveal in the first and second act, but little directorial Freudian masturbation. Michael Powell makes psychological horror, but it is the text of the film. The subtext is the evisceration of filmmaking process. A horror film about following a director. Perhaps not subtle, but there are fascinating and precise details to follow behind the scenes of whatever kind of comedy Shirley Anne Field is in.
The highlight of the film is the sequence with Moira Shearer. She dances, as Boehm directs her, trying to make his masterpiece. It is tense, cinematic; a mixture of beautiful cinematography and incipient horror. Shearer, a Powell favourite, is tremendous.
Peeping Tom remains a remarkable achievement. A warmly lacquered, romantically colourful, deeply unpleasant horror film.",5.0
"Handsomely-photographed (with particularly stylish use of color and darkness), and foreshadows a lot of the avenues down which the horror genre would go over the next two decades, particularly with respect to voyeurism. There’s a very human aspect to our killer for much of the movie that is quite effective and chilling (and Bohm’s light accent has an endearing sort of quality that only enhances the unsettling nature of the character), and the murders are generally presented in a blunt, matter-of-fact way that feels very believable. It’s also a bit striking that a movie this openly perverse and fetishistic got made when it did.",3.5
"Fear is what makes looking in the mirror so fascinating. Powell employs a flamboyant use of color and a very stylized lighting for a morbid tale where images of death attract us magnetically to the celluloid as distress signals of obsession and bedazzlement. Filmmaking is analogous to sex because they both bring us closer to death. A brother film to Hitchcock’s ‘Rear Window’, but which goes even further in its wicked metaphor.",4.0
"I didn't know how influential this movie was until right before I had first seen it. With this second viewing, it's very apparent just how impactful this truly was.
There was nothing like this at the time and it was released right at the beginning of the 60s, no less! While the decade of horror would eventually be forever changed by Romero's Night of the Living Dead, this had to have still been quite a shock for audiences at the time. While it might be light on violence, there is a much deeper feeling of uneasiness and the horror left to our imagination. The physiological effect that this movie has on the viewer is nothing short of masterful. The human imagination can think of so many worse things than what could be shown onscreen at the time, but that final reveal opens up an entirely new form of horror that burrows itself into your brain long after seeing the movie.
I'm so glad that Martin Scorsese, Thelma Schoonmaker, The Film Foundation, The BFI National Archive, and Studio Canal gave this film the beautiful restoration it deserves. If you don't have a region free player like I do, Criterion is putting out their disc in May and I highly recommend adding it to your collection, whether you are a horror movie fan or a film history enthusiast. Scorsese himself cited it with 8½ as the two films that you could learn about the process of filmmaking from.

"I don't trust a man who walks quietly
Imagine this must've been greatly influential to Brian De Palma. Had this thought from the opening sequence, when we see a man with a camera proposition a sex worker through the lens of his camera and then kill her, watching the fear in her eyes consume the camera's view.
Really great mid-century psychosexual horror solo project from Michael Powell, but it gets really hampered by its often shoddy dialogue and stodgy acting. If you want us to feel enveloped in this world, maybe don't cast an Austrian actor to play a London cameraman named Mark Lewis. Karl Boehm is only a few steps away from Peter Lorre. Every time he speaks, it's definitely eerie, but it's so distracting to have his accent changing and the words feel unnatural coming out of his mouth.",3.5

I had only watched this once front to back with my Mother on PBS when I was like 8 and it scared the shit out of me. Subsequently after that only in parts. Same story with 10 Rillington Place which to me shares a lot of the same look despite being set a decade earlier and made a decade later.
Subbed this one on the wheel because Criterion just announced they were releasing it and I wanted to make sure I wanted to add it.
I can’t believe that this has the same approach to horror that Psycho does and they were both released the same year. There is more on screen violence here but both are equally disturbing. 
Rewatch this and tell me Mark Lewis doesn’t give off big Hans Beckert vibes only way more Herrenrasse.",4.5
"This film has a lot of ideas bubbling underneath the surface. But my favorite has to be its perspicacious clarity between obsession and compulsion, particularly how the two fuel one another through the eyes of serial killer who films his murders. Better yet: Mark is not just a killer; the movie argues, too, that he, like his victims, is human who feels and has needs. I enjoyed that it embraces the difficult task of asking the audience to try to understand the mind—and heart—of a killer despite his horrific actions. This movie is not about good or bad, good versus evil. It is far more interested in the grey. 
Carl Boehm is wonderful in this role. Particularly impressive to me is when his body language, face, and eyes evoke a little boy when he shows films of him as a child being tormented by his father. This is no typical role of a murderer simply being or becoming monstrous. It is paramount that we believe Mark being a slave to his own trauma while at the same time the trauma’s existence not necessarily absolve him of his decisions. The man is not insane, he is damaged.
Lastly, I appreciated that the movie is above cheap kills and thrills. When murders are shown, they are calculated, purposeful, sometimes even morbidly beautiful. It is never about the gore or violence but the fear before an object makes contact with the body.",4.0
"People often talk about the demise of the Hays Code as if it was the flip of a switch: before 1968 no sex was allowed in the movies, after 1968 it was. But it wasn't so simple- the breakdown of the Code was a long process whose beginning can be traced to the controversy over Otto Preminger's The Moon is Blue until it culminated on the official repeal of the code early into the New Hollywood era. We can see the slow erosion of the code through things like the final scene in Some Like It Hot, the frankness with which they discuss sexual assault in Anatomy of a Murder, and also everything about Peeping Tom*
This is a very interesting work on the act of looking, and more specifically the act of looking through the camera- making all of the viewers complicit in the spectacle of violence. There is some very interesting stuff about power, masculinity and the figure of the film director. Although female directors existed practically since the dawn of cinema (hi, Alice Guy-Blaché!) by the early 1960s the director is firmly conceptualized as a male figure. Mark- essentially a rather powerless person- seeks to play at power by brutalizing women through the frame of being a director. Stories of directors terrorizing female actors in order to ""achieve their vision"" (hi, Stanley Kubrick!) are nothing new; I thought the movie reflected that pretty well. It was also interesting to see how much this influenced the future slasher genre.

"Michael Powell's controversial meditation on violence and voyeurism effectively destroyed his career when it was first released, but later generations have come to regard it as a masterpiece. Karl Heinz Boehm stars as Mark, the son of a psychologist who kept a video journal of the boy's upbringing for research purposes. The constant intrusions profoundly affected the boy, who grew up to be a photographer himself; but his principal subject matter consists of women whom he murders before the camera. He then runs the films of his victims in their final throes so that he can study their reactions to death — a perverse extension of his father's experiments, which tormented Mark to analyze his reactions to raw fear. The British press had long been hostile to the unorthodox films of Powell and his partner Emeric Pressburger; when Peeping Tom came around, they used the film to castigate him as ""sick"" and tawdry. The passage of time has proven Peeping Tom as profound and accomplished as any of Powell's earlier films, and it ranks with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958) as a landmark exploration of the links among voyeurism, violence, and male sexual desire. Powell himself plays the evil father in the flashback sequences, and his son Colomba plays Mark as a child.",4.0
The strongest critique of the slasher genre before the genre was even created. That's how far ahead of it's time this is.,4.0
"A kind of Beauty and the Beast story, in which light grapples against darkness, as well as a self-reflexive study on the inherent voyeurism of the cinema in all its forms. Home movies, pornography and large budget studio filmmaking become set-pieces, each presenting a different focus on performance and manipulation. As a thriller it's remarkable, but it's also an affecting and sympathetic film about the scars of child abuse.
While Hitchcock's Psycho was (rightly) lauded as a horror masterpiece, Powell's film was largely censored and (wrongly) condemned. Looking at both films today can offer a surprising reversal of intent. Hitchcock’s film is lurid pulp, masterfully directed, but revelling in the tics and supposedly weird fetishes of his Norman Bates character in a manner that seems almost brazenly exploitative. Powell’s film is no less lurid, but it shows its protagonist nothing less than complete sympathy.
While the violence is no less shocking and voyeuristic, the entire film is defined by the sadness that Mark carries with him, and it ties this sadness into the childhood abuse he received from his father. The tragedy of this abuse, and the effect it has on the character, is felt but never exploited. At the time Peeping Tom was dismissed by critics as violent trash, no better than pornography, but in an age numbed into submission by endless serial killer procedurals, Powell’s film is still shocking, but also surprisingly progressive.",5.0
"Finally knocked this classic off the watchlist this weekend. Incredible to think about this proto-slasher character study releasing in the same year as Psycho. In contrast with the latter's black and white, Michael Powell's film pops with both rich color and fascinatingly realized b&w film within the film as it tracks photographer/murderer Mark from one job to another (with various degrees of acceptability in polite society). Following the opening murder of a prostitute, tracked through a camera in his jacket, we learn that he feels compelled to record everything: life and death.
When Mark forms a budding relationship with a neighbor, the possibility of real intimacy casts his voyeurism and violence into sharper relief, but he's unable to stop the fast approaching completion on the documentary of his own life that he has been making. This was odd and thrilling in a way that still feels ahead of its time, and has clearly influenced a great number of things I've been a fan of. The mystery man from Lost Highway comes to mind quickest. There are some breathtakingly tense and darkly comedic scenes, virtually all of them operating on a couple of different levels at once. I was particularly captivated by the lengthy dance number on the film set as Mark sets up cameras for one of the junior actresses to film a solo scene, all while we can tell something more is happening.
This reaches a dizzying kind of feedback loop between subject and object, voyeur and exhibitionist, still and moving image, and on and on. Mark has been doomed from birth by his family circumstance and the cruelty of his scientist father, and is thus incapable of living in the fleetingness of life, only the fleeting nature of a cycle in which to desire someone/something necessitates capturing, which necessitates flattening and freezing into a medium, which brings about loss and the need to recapture. The suspension of all this in the instant of a camera impression being made thus renders life impossible for him. The little sinking in his eyes after he asks a psychologist how one might be cured of the voyeuristic compulsion, and the doctor casually replies that it would be 3 years of therapy, was heartbreaking. He knows he could never make it, and that brief potential detour from his deadly path vanishes much more quickly than the possibility of hope had accumulated as he got to know Helen. A fleeting and doomed exchange, appropriately enough.
I loved the film-in-film staging of this, the in-your-face metaphor of the murder weapons and side-by-side events happening in the in-film film in production, the at-times Hitchcockian dark humor that's subsumed into the tragedy. Mark navigates most levels of respectability in society seamlessly but belongs to none of them. He belongs to no one but rather to the camera that served as his parent, rendering him unable to relate to the chaos and moment-to-moment death of an unrecorded life. There's an illusory stability in the compulsive playback, a fantasy that's also a reality, a kind of flatland that one can exist in because one has been shown out of the other dimensions and prevented from learning how to experience them. Finally the camera is a threshold of life and death, not just between desire and consumption, and he's been tiptoeing at thresholds the whole time without the courage or ability to cross any of them until he can only find one left to actually cross, instead studying his subjects as he himself once was studied by his father and now has been by us.",4.5

"""You don't get that in Sight & Sound!""
A stunning, voyeuristic, trailblazing piece of work. Michael Powell, one of the preeminent prestige filmmakers of his time, goes full Hitchcock mode (being perfectly in step with the release of PSYCHO) and basically creates every giallo film, every slasher film, every serial killer noir and psychological thriller at the same time. It's hilarious that this film was considered to be appallingly transgressive at its time, as it feels like a model of restraint and tact now by comparison, and Powell's veneer of sumptuous, classy filmmaking elevates what could've been sleazy and grody into a genuinely artful, singular psychological exploration of POV/the role cameras and perspective play in our experiences. That this killed Powell's career is a travesty, but also it might've been worth it tbh.",5.0

The cinematography is visually pleasing. I like the warm and vivid color palette. For some reason I think this works very well with the story.

"Delving deeply into voyeurism, paraphilia and childhood trauma, Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom is a psychologically richer affair than 1960’s other great film about a serial killer, and with none of Psycho’s lingering issues regarding implicit transphobia. Powell is less interested in shocks and experimental story structure than in developing a haunting character study of a damaged man who hides behind his camera and murders the women he films. As controversial as the film was upon its release, so much so that it ruined the legendary Powell’s career, it merits serious praise for its lack of sensationalism and commitment to harrowing reality. Rather than merely making the viewer complicit in its killer’s violence, Peeping Tom goes a step further and shows how society and especially families are complicit in the development of psychopaths.",4.5
"It’s pretty easy to see why this effectively finished off Michael Powell’s career. When Katherine Bigelow borrowed just one of the skeevy elements for Strange Days, it very nearly took down her career also.

"Talk about the male gaze!
What an early thriller gem made by the famous Michael Powell from Powell and Pressburger. A movie that was considered controversial and racy then is mild to our modern day comprehension, but the sexualization of women and the eroticism/perversity involved is as modern as ever. Another interesting aspect is the aspect of psychology and child development, and unlike Psycho with his mother, it’s with an abusive father, which is a new idea for the turn of the 60s. I must say it’s an interesting watch, and again like I said about Col. Blimp, it reminds me of a movie that was ahead of its time. The visceral visual quality of the movie is incredible,  now that is definitely ahead of its time. I really love that viewfinder POV use!

"In college I was the ""slasher kid"", by that I mean I made it a point to watch a lot of and at times only watch slashers so I could be pretentious to my fellow students about them. I somehow missed this one, but I was sure until watching it today that I had watched it. Peeping Tom is long for a movie of this type at the time, one of many things that this movie does that were clearly original and out there for the time.
That length is needed here, Peeping Tom is a complex story of a man and his delusions growing and controlling his life. Watching Mark become more out going with his social life, mirroring his progression in murders, seeing him obsess over every shot, needing to have it filmed. He plays in fantastically, his character is so creepy and troubled, we don't want to see him fail out of pity or succeed because our fear.
Color pops all throughout this movie, a brilliant example of fantastic camera work. Each shot is full of small details in the back of everything, the characters look like dolls in some scenes they're so perfectly shot. I was blown away the second we meet Helen and see her side by side with Mark, their hair and outfits were so eye catching while the scenery sang out its own vibrant colors.
Death in Peeping Tom is taken and done so seriously. Mark is obsessed with getting a life's end on film, the measures he goes through to get peoples reactions and the after math of his crimes is insane. He risks his life and being caught just to see someone appalled by his grizzly acts. Getting off on fright, Mark struggles at times to not hurt someone once he notices that fear like a shark to blood.
I was on the edge of my seat half the film, tension is on another level. Things are high stakes, literally life and death, the fear and fight in the women on the other side of Mark's camera are just as much the stars as he is. Their fear was so believable and it's made even more intense when we find that he's had a mirror on the camera this whole time, forcing the women to watch their deaths. He's clearly deranged and out of control, ramping up to his eventual downfall.
How they bring this to a close is just as riveting as the entire plot had been. He's the end, his own demise, his happiness at it all being over is just icing on the terrible cake. What a real goddamn movie, it's written, shot and preformed at the level of true classics. Exploring something movies were afraid to until much, much later, exposing some real horror that was so genuine and unique, this proto slasher is absolute gold.",5.0

Coming out just a few months before Psycho, 1960 was a great year for absolute creeps. I only recently became familiar with Powell and Pressburger this year with The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus and Colonel Blimp, so this kind of thing was highly unexpected.
much like Hitchcock would be doing in the same year, Michael Powell was really pushing the envelope. So much so, in fact, that it was said to have hurt his career due to the overwhelmingly negative response. I think this was one of the first mainstream films to feature nudity as well, if I'm not mistaken. I'd look it up but then I'd feel like a creep myself. Completely ahead of its time and a precursor to the slasher genre. That ending sequence was phenomenal.

"The sets and comic book visual style are crazily cool. Reminds me of Batman and Dick Tracy from 30 years later. Mario Bava might have picked up a few things as well. Michael Powell is highly respected in film circles, but he doesn't get much mainstream recognition. Hopefully that will change someday. Maybe when Peeping Tom gets a much needed Region 1 Blu Ray. Do you know how much the DVD goes for on Ebay? Fifty bucks!
Powell's movies can be hard to classify. Sometimes you don't know if you're watching a drama or a comedy or something else. Peeping Tom is firmly in the thriller/horror category. 
The obvious comparison is to Psycho, which came out the same year (although, the release date for Peeping Tom is listed differently everywhere). I think they're sort of equal in terms of suspense and technical prowess... but Peeping Tom might be more sadistic. The weakest part of both films is the ending, but Peeping has the advantage there.",4.0

Lol mark really was like my present to you on your 21st birthday, Vivian, is taking you on a trip down my traumatic childhood.
Going by Mindhunter, this film was ahead of its time — recording, visiting the crime scene, etc. Control & power by recreating situations wherein he had previously none. First eliciting the terror in other people who are stand-in for him, and then himself.
Karlheinz Böhm's performance is good; the soft-spoken nature, tortured looks of inner conflict, lustful eyes for the fearful countenance — every time he captures them via camera it's like he's m*king l*ve to them / the act.
The relationship dynamic between Vivian and Mark is too simplistic and it being the semi-driving force borders on rom-com american psycho lite. Not favourable.
The lighting and colors in this are *chef's kiss* I didn't know some shots were going to be this aesthetically pleasing.
I usually find drums beat emulating heartbeat sound in scores, as a way to evoke emotions / drive up the tension, very sneaky (not in a good way) but here it was communicating his, so it worked.

Task 15. A film you think would be PERFECT to see at a drive-in theatre.
I don’t feel surprised that Michael Powell would make a movie such as this given that most of his previous work with Emeric Pressburger leaned towards the phantasmagorical in terms of style.
Here we have a perfect horror film with a story of murder caught on camera, of voyeurism and of fear. But not only does this film scare you but it’s also a beautifully crafted piece of cinema. Every shaft of light and every shadow precisely placed. And the single piano score helps to heighten the melodrama and put me in mind of the accompaniment of movies from the silent era.
Such a tragedy therefore that its reception at the time was so negative and so damaging to Powell’s career.

"31 Days of Horror 2018 - Day 31

So, here we are! The final day of 31 Days of Horror! It's been a wild ride but I thought I'd finish with a classic.
Peeping Tom follows cameraman Mark Lewis who works in a film studio by day and murders women by night. He puts a spike on the end of one of the legs on his tripod and films his victims horrified reactions. He also holds up a mirror so his victims can see themselves die.
Peeping Tom is a film that I have heard a lot about, in fact, it's one of the most notorious films in cinema history. When it was released in 1960, critics and audiences condemned the film due to it's depiction of violence towards women and it famously destroyed director Michael Powell's career. Of course, as years have passed it has since developed a cult following. This is also considered to be one of the first slasher films along with Psycho and a precursor to contemporary slasher triggered by Halloween in 1978.
It is clear to see how influential this film has been on the horror genre, slasher in particular. It was one of the first films to put the audience into the killers point-of-view which had a huge impact on both Halloween and the original Friday The 13th. The camerawork in general is brilliant as well as the lighting especially in Mark's dark room; flooded with red light, a signifier of something sinister and like most films of the 50s and 60s, the colour palette was so lush I couldn't look away. Who knew British film could be so glamourous yet completely creepy!
I really liked Carl Boehm's performance as Mark. He comes of as such a shy and unassuming man who loves to film so it is understandable that nobody really suspected him of murder. Mark seems to be a character who is struggling with his identity; the film initially villainises him as we open the film with a murder, however, when Helen comes into the picture we begin to see his more human side and his battle to suppress his urges to murder. In that respect, I was surprised to see that not only is this a horror film, it's a love story. Mark's love for Helen is the reason why he begins to struggle with his killer needs.
The film discusses the topic of scopophilia/voyeurism, a subject tackles on a far less intense method in some of Hitchcock's films such as Rear Window and Vertigo but Peeping Tom is definitely a more morbid take on it. Voyeurism is what drives Mark to kill, it's an obsession passed down from his father. However, where is father was more interested in watching how his son grew up, Mark is drawn to visions of fear as people die and it's handled really effectively making for some really creepy scenes.
Overall, I can now finally understand why Peeping Tom is now regarded as a masterpiece. It was a film way ahead of its time, if only we could've seen which direction Michael Powell's career would have gone is the film had not been completely blackballed.

"""Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it Mark. A pity it can't be photographed.""
Peeping Tom is a voyeuristic film that examines scopophilia and violence through the eye of the artist. Mark Lewis is a troubled man with a troubled childhood who has an interest in filming the look on women's faces moments before they die. It's a dark theme; however, though unsettling, the film attempts to humanize Mark by introducing us to Helen, his downstairs neighbor and tenant. He begins to fall for her, vowing never to film her or ever to see her be frightened.
The film works best as a study of the psychology of a killer. We see the movie from the perspective of Mark, as well as through the lens of his video camera as he works to complete his ""documentary"" using footage of his killings and the subsequent police investigations. Mark is our anti-hero, and his character is very compelling to watch as he attempts to conform to social norms with Helen, while also dealing with his irresistible voyeuristic impulses.
The cinematography is colorful, yet darkly stylistic. The camerawork is powerful in communicating its dark themes while still striving to show the layered beauty of an obsessed artist. The ending of the film is also great, and it's easy to understand why this film was so controversial when it was first released in 1960.",4.0
I loved it but all I can think of saying right now is that Nigel Davenport looked hot in this because I don't think I can put into words anything else about this movie right now,4.5
"An interesting little film that has its audience spend a few days with a voyeuristic killer.  It's not really a horror film or a thriller, there's little in the way of a build or conflict or discovery.  It just presents a series of events in this characters life at a period of escalation in his habits.
The most distracting thing for me, and I guess it more belongs in a review of Red Dragon or Manhuntsr, is how obvious it is from where Thomas Harris took his inspiration for Francis Dolarhyde.  Both are introverted killers working with film, with abusive childhoods directly related to their violent acts.  Both film their murders and both put barriers between themselves and their violence in the form of mental illnesses.  Francis is at war with the Dragon, unknowingly his undiagnosed split personality, and Mark Lewis blames the camera for his crimes, an untreated case of scoptophilia.  They also both come under duress in trying to protect an outgoing, kind woman from the Dragon/Camera, and both films even feature a blind woman unable to watch the violent snuff films playing in front of her.
There are still plenty of differences and nuances, and I would argue that Harris sculpted and refined the character, which was then perfected by Tom Noonan, Ralph Fiennes, and finally Richard Armitage.  
But back to this actual film, Peeping Tom is a daring piece of work for its time with a unique perspective on its subject matter, and an interesting look into the tortured soul of a violent character.  It ultimately loses its power and identity somewhat in the structure and overall arc, but the final film is still something entrancing to see.",3.5
"Shocking for 1960 cinema! I feel like the real horror in this film is the fear of being unable to live without the approval of the camera; this idea that he doesn't know how to experience emotion without removing himself from reality and viewing it in this third person....hey, sure sounds like a modern culture we all know and love! Woo hoo!",4.5
"by /u/montypython22 on Reddit, who is also on Letterboxd!
That Michael Powell's film was a failure when it first came out is a reflection, I think, of the moviegoing public's desire to remain passive while watching a movie. We typically go the cinema to watch images happen before us; we receive them passively. But when a film like Peeping Tom violates this unspoken code by implicating and involving us so harshly in its images, the public—more often than not—raises an outcry. We don’t like to be manipulated or asked to be put in the perspective of people we don’t look (and who we’re not supposed to like). In many ways, we’ve changed as movie-goers. We’re more willing to go along with being challenged by frightening imagery, to being assaulted by images of reprehensible violence and sex and immorality. The question, then, becomes which films are doing this active provocation with meaningful, purposeful, and innovative intent…and which films are only provoking for the sake of provoking.
At least for now, we can say that in the case of Peeping Tom, Powell's provocation succeeds. Powell's movie refuses to let us stand on the sidelines at ANY point; we are implicit in the crimes committed by Mark, from the very first shot of the ominous eye to the very last shot of the rounded film-strip running out of the canister. Everything about the film works: from the sensitive and surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of the vicious serial-killer Mark by German actor Carl Boehm, to the gorgeously muted Eastman colors, to the frenetic and savage editing to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, Powell's film is a masterclass of technique and form. There is nothing fantastical about this movie; it is a carefully calculated assault on us, our psyches, our deep desires. And it makes us rethink our roles as movie-goers like no other film has before.",5.0

"Another film I just felt like watching as it seemed like one I'd enjoy and I'm glad I did.
The influence on the slasher genre is undeniable. There is a lot to admire in this film. The cinematography is great pretty much from the opening and the way color is used was pretty good throughout. The directing is strong and really helps us get into the mind of our psychotic serial killer main character. Karlheinz Böhm plays him fantastically because a careful balance is required in the performance that could go horribly wrong if not done well. He exudes a strange combination of charisma, childlike innocence coupled with a small hint of cold bloodedness.
The film is an interesting character study and it's approach would be something clearly controversial in 1960. It isn't so much that it attempts to excuse a deranged killer but instead examines what would lead a man to become that way. It's this examination that could make a lot of people uncomfortable. Mark Lewis isn't just a monster through and through with no emotions. In fact it is his relationship with Helen that helps keep the film grounded.
It's a pity in a way that I can't really call this film a horror film as it was more interesting and a little disturbing than it was terrifying. Naturally some of those original intentions have dated a bit. The reserved nature of how it depicts violence was a drawback a few times but on the whole I thought it served the film really well. There is a pervasiveness to a lot of how the film is shot. Obviously the theme of voyeurism is ever present in the film but how it's used to almost examine what we expect from the film was compelling. There are a lot of close up shots of people witnessing horrifying things but we are rarely shown them first hand. We aren't invested in a lot of these characters and we almost feel like we want to see what happens to them, but the camera denies us this.
The background of Mark's life makes him a somewhat sympathetic victim of abuse. I can't say I was emotionally invested but the ending feels tragic. We are denied what would be a predictable ending and we instead get one where no one except Mark gets what he wants. He gets what he wants and I can't help but wonder what could have been.
As a character study the film is pretty good and on a technical level it is fantastic. There are weird bits like Helen's mother that I wish would have been utilized more and her contribution to the plot feels weird, like it is missing a large chunk. The scene they first meet almost feels like he recognizes her or something. Either way the film is great and definitely better than I expected.",4.0
"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is both of its time and timeless. It still has the power to shock, and its story is as gripping as ever, but it feels like something from 1960. Perhaps that's why the character of Norman Bates has been revisited so often – in sequels, a serialized TV prequel, and Gus Van Sant's infamous (mostly) shot-for-shot remake – because he can be picked up and dropped into new contexts.
Conversely, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, which found theaters mere weeks ahead of Psycho, feels both of its time and out of it, simultaneously rooted in a particular moment and anachronous. Everything about the film works to generate this dichotomy: the lurid subject matter and the timidly sleazy way it's photographed; the stilted acting style that exists somewhere between melodrama and parody; and the saturated color palette that is so lush it's mocked by its main character's own color-drained videography.
This last point is one I'll elaborate on, after I sketch the film's plot. Peeping Tom is the story of Mark Lewis, a shy and conspicuous loner who works a day job at a movie studio as a focus puller. Literally, his job is to maintain the subjects of the camera in focus, taking into account factors like lighting, set design, and blocking. He also moonlights as a photographer of softcore pornography. From the studio, he heads to a newsagent's shop whose entrance is covered with pin-up images of topless or seminude models. Upstairs, he meets young women in various stages of undress and takes snaps of them in provocative poses, snaps which are then sold under the counter in the shop below.
As titillating as that sounds, it's his other nighttime hobby that's the real eye-popper. The movie starts with Mark strolling down an empty street. Ahead, a woman loiters outside a shop window. Mark approaches her, and, as he does so, surreptitiously turns on a handheld camera stuffed in his thick overcoat. We view the next few minutes through his viewfinder. ""It'll be two quid,"" she tells him dryly, without any trace of a sales pitch, and then leads him to her nearby flat. We watch her take off a skirt and a belt, her boredom with the prostitute routine etched in each movement. Mark lowers the camera briefly, we hear a snapping noise, and when he raises it again a distorted light shines on her face. Still in the viewfinder, we aren't privy to what she sees, but we get to see her expression as she works out what it is about to happen. First, we see puzzlement, followed by dawning realization, and, last of all, paralyzed terror. As Mark moves closer in, she opens her mouth and unleashes a caterwauling wail.
The murder is implied, but not immediately confirmed. Instead, we cut to a whirring film projector in an improvised home theater. On the wall ahead is the same footage we just saw through the viewfinder, only now rendered in silent black and white. Mark, whose face we still haven't seen, is watching the playback of his own macabre handiwork. Here, at last, the opening credits play. As we again watch the unfortunate victim scream her last, Mark sinks back into a chair, seemingly in a fit of ecstasy, and the words Directed by MICHAEL POWELL appear on screen.
In setting things up this way, Powell makes us complicit in what unfolds. Rather than letting us ""lurk anonymously in the dark,"" as Roger Ebert noted that most films do, Peeping Tom ""implicate[s] us in the voyeurism of the title character."" Kubrick, assuming he saw the film, probably had the same takeaway, as audience complicity is a theme that he would explore to similar effect via Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange a decade later.
I can't say enough about how brilliant this opening is. We may not meet Mark directly until after this sequence, yet we learn something important about him through it. Notwithstanding the dazzlingly colorful film that Powell has created here, with its highly saturated and diverse technicolor hues, Mark is most at home in his darkened laboratory, where deep black and harsh red permeate the frame, and where the snuff content filmed out in the world is developed and then displayed for an audience of one. What’s more, his camera captures a manichaean palette, lacking the rest of the film’s vibrancy: only black and white – no color, no sound.
If the rest of the film had lived up to this opening, Peeping Tom would've been very special indeed. Instead, I have to settle for calling it quite good. I won't write about the plot any further, except to say that not everything works. The character of Helen, whose head-over-heels fall for Mark oddly put me in mind of Judy in Rebel Without a Cause, is seriously underdeveloped. Why she would be drawn to Mark is a mystery that is never resolved or even raised, and her actions at the end when she learns the truth consequently just appear bizarre. As well, some of the explanations for Mark's antisocial behavior, shown to us via footage taken by his apparently malevolent father as part of an ongoing science experiment, are too tepid to have much power.
Other sequences work far better. The buildup to Mark's second murder, this one of a colleague at the movie studio where he works, is amazingly horrifying. It has all the elements of a scene out of a stereotypical slasher film, where the character about to be killed is naively unaware of the danger while we the audience are screaming at the soon-to-be victim to get out of there. A typical slasher, though, uses that tension for fun, knowingly playing on that emotion for release; here the moment is actually suffused with dread and terror. That feeling is only heightened as, once again, the film cuts away before the deed is done.
Where Peeping Tom is on less sure footing, though, is when it psychologizes Mark. Is he a serial killer produced by his father’s sadistic tutelage? Is he a scoptophiliac monster who views women’s bodies as his to do with as he pleases? The film suggests it’s a mix of both. There are audiotapes and home movies his father made and which Mark shares with Helen, but what we glimpse of these seems… shallow. The notion is compelling, but it hints at more than it reveals. On the other hand, we see much directly to confirm Mark’s voyeurism and sexual aberrance. His first murder is of a prostitute, after all, and only a couple scenes later we learn of his side gig photographing softcore models. At first, I thought these would be red herrings; they were revealed too soon. Upon reflection, however, I think Powell intended these as genuine evidence. In one later scene with a psychiatrist, Mark asks if there’s a cure for his derangement, and is disheartened when he learns it will take a long time. In another scene, Mark is above the newsagent’s shop again and taking photos. A model lies on a bed in front of him. From the initial angle, she is clothed, however skimpily. Then we get a reverse shot, in which she is totally naked. This is unlikely to be a continuity error – that would be an incredible oversight in an era where nudity in mainstream film was unheard of – so it is probably meant as an indication of the distortion within Mark's mind. In his murderous urge, he views her as ravenously as if they were about to have sex.
The trouble is that I find this a middling explanation for Mark’s deviancy. Maybe this is due to the limitations of the time – Powell was pushing the boundaries of decency pretty hard as it was – but it does dampen my appreciation nonetheless. In this way, it reminded me of Suddenly, Last Summer, an adaptation of a Tennessee Williams play from just a year prior. That film also seemed to want to say much more than it could get away with, but in its effort to conform to the standards of the time it turned so vague and obtuse that my primary response was exasperation and indifference. Peeping Tom fares far better. It’s supremely well made, and Powell’s willingness to test the limits of the period make this a solid success, even when its reach exceeds its grasp.

"Through a combination of modern horror movements and Hitchcock's often riveting chills of the same period, Peeping Tom just doesn't seem to bring the chills that filmmakers and critics seem to ascribe to it. Comparisons to the great American master have been evident since the film's inception, whether sincerely or sarcastically, and its easy to see why - thematically and technically, Peeping Tom seems to draw on many earlier works for influence, whether through the first-person camera angles, the psychology of a damaged criminal, the perspective of that criminal, etc. Boehm's Lewis is essentially a combination of a few pre-existing characters, particularly Norman Bates in Psycho and the duo of Shaw and Morgan in Rope (in turns, decisive and timid), and the film in general bears similarity to later works such as Frenzy as well. As has often been noted, the film's great feature is bringing the audience in on the crime, to become a voyeur by association, and to elicit a sense of sympathy for his circumstances even while his actions are summarily reviled. However, I think the film comes up short in that it doesn't provide any justification for the audience to share in Lewis' need, to feel his hunger for more of his precious moments, and in doing so fails to provide any gratuitous satisfaction for being complicit in his crimes. An interesting concept that integrates innovative shot design, but ultimately not quite the classic that everyone claims it to be, in my opinion.",3.5
"""Whatever I photograph I always lose.""
This movie is kind of an anti-Giallo. You get introduced to the killer right away, and the only mystery becomes finding out why he is so deeply troubled. As the story progresses and you come to understand why, you are torn between rooting for Mark, the killer, and rooting against him at the same time. His character is cute and likable, I thought, and in a genuine way rather than a creepy or manipulative one. At the movie's end, I was downright melancholy, feeling perhaps a little too sympathetic toward the wrong party.

"A HISTORY OF HORROR (2018 WEEKLY CHALLENGE)
WEEK 7 PSYCHOLOGICAL
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Ok, removing this movie from my watchlist was basically an impossible mission, this challenge saved this one from my nearly 5k titles. first of all, Helen's relationship with Mark reminded me of the relationship between Miranda and George (innocent girl falling in love with an intellectual figure) from my favorite book, The Collector, i have the habit of resembling movie characters because it's a way i think of interconnecting them, i mean, if someone asked me for a movie recommendation based on its plot, you know? haha, i already lost it, when i'm writing a review of a movie that i really liked, my mind really goes away. so, recapitulating, the imminent danger that every woman who creates a tie with Mark or is barely near him is just so unavoidable to think that he will do something to them and is about to discover a point in his reactions that he wants to film based on his murderous instincts, is quite uncomfortable. that is to say, this premise of voyeurism is inserted in the plot from a ""trauma"" of the protagonist, which is very interesting for the unfolding of its final result (the final lines, specifically) what i liked the most was the performance of Maxine Audley as Mrs. Stephens, who is blind but always suspicious and one step ahead. very captivating. anyhoo, the face of death right guys?",4.5

"This is such a brilliant and complicated film. From the opening credits I feel as an audience member that I am being accused of being an accessory. When Helen watches Mark’s film, we see her face and reaction rather than the film itself and see ourselves reflected in that. I’m also particularly impressed by Michael Powell’s cameo as Mark’s father, the architect of every monstrous action in the film. It’s incredible to think that this and Psycho were released in the same year, audiences weren’t really ready for Psycho, but they were even less prepared for this.",5.0
"There are several striking similarities between Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" Both films released the same year. Both films are about psychologically damaged loner male serial killers who prey on women. Both films tested how shocking, disturbing, and violent a movie could be upon their release.
However, ""Peeping Tom"" does provide what one might call a sympathetic portrait of its killer. In ""Psycho"" the viewer is only privy to details surrounding the mystery at the Bates Motel as they are revealed to investigating characters. In ""Peeping Tom"" the audience is placed in the shoes of the killer, in both a literal and narrative sense. The killer himself is the main character in ""Peeping Tom."" We never leave him. We even experience his murders through the perspective of the camera that he uses to record his deeds. Such proximity to the killer reveals details about a troubled childhood, including a long history of parental abuse.
Additionally, unlike Norman Bates, Mark Lewis nearly develops an actual relationship with a young woman who seems to want to care for Mark and to understand his eccentricities. Normand and Mark have both been made into monsters, but there's almost something tragic about Mark because of this budding relationship, whereas Norman remains sinister, placid, foreboding, and mysterious in the last shots of ""Psycho.""
""Psycho"" is one of my favorites and I consider it just about untouchable in terms of structure and plot, but I can also enjoy ""Peeping Tom."" The colors in this film do look gorgeous.",3.5
"In his brilliant career, Michael Powell (and Emeric Pressburger) created in a span of less than twenty years, several unforgettable, cherishable masterpieces. Frequently, these films challenged popular taste and generated controversy, even anger. In “49th Parallel” he gives us a sad, sensitive German soldier; in “Colonel Blimp,” there is a sympathetic German officer and mixed messages about the British sense of fair play. “Black Narcissus” shows nuns enflamed by disorienting sexual desire and “Red Shoes” captured the nearly psychotic obsession that is embedded in the world of dance. Powell got into trouble with authorities for much of this, but it did him no harm. He always came back with another great, challenging film.
In 1960, now without Pressburger, Powell made this astonishing movie which makes its murderous voyeur into a sad, complex creature. This is the film for which he was not forgiven. The main character, a damaged young man who works for a motion picture studio as a camera operator, films women at the instant he kills them so he can capture the deepest level of fear possible. A sympathetic slasher was too much for audiences and critics. Powell’s career never recovered.
Over time, “Peeping Tom” has come to be seen as another great Powell film, a critique of our own complicity in horror by our ever-deepening desire to see it. We hide behind the shield the movie gives us: but we all know there would be no movie if we didn’t want to watch it.
I think “Peeping Tom” can be understood as a work of self-loathing and rue. The murderer is seen as a child being filmed at every moment of his life by his father, a psychologist known for his studies of fear. And the father is played by Michael Powell himself. It is Powell who shaped the monster. It is this monster who stands in for Powell’s own obsession with red-haired actresses (Deborah Kerr, Kathleen Bryon, Moira Shearer) all of whom moved on from Powell. Here, in later life, he realizes he drove them away and confesses, everything he photographs he loses.",4.0

Brilliant performances too, especially Carl Boehm. it’s insane how this movie could be so confrontational to the audience’s viewing relationship to the horror on the screen when the genre as we understand it today was basically being reinvented by films like this one.

"Watched in the cinema, which was a nice treat, as part of a double bill with Psycho, which I couldn't stick around for unfortunately. There was a little talk at the beginning about the similarities between the two films, though nothing particularly new was shared there.
This is a wonderfully perverse watch, taking every director's favourite subject, voyeurism, and taking it to it's most extreme conclusion of murder and violence. Here, our camera is both our weapon, and an explicit phallic symbol, caressed by Mark, only to reveal the blade hidden beneath, and the mirror reflecting the image back on the victim.
A bit like Psycho, both Mark and Norman end up being semi-sympathetic killers, formed in some part by childhood trauma, and likeable in their own way. Mark here is particularly alien, especially as he is supposed to be a born and bred Londoner, but played with a clear German accent by Karlheinz Böhm, which just adds to his mystique.",0.0
"Always been vaguely aware of the context surrounding this film — a classic that's been collecting dust (like many others) on my ever growing watchlist — how it ruined the director's career and how shocking it was for the time. What I didn't realise was that it came out as early as 1960 and preceded Hitchcock's Psycho. I've no doubt that the black and white aesthetic and Hitchcock's reputation played a huge part in the contrast between his success and Powell's blacklisting, but surely Peeping Tom must have, to some extent, prepared audiences for what was to come?
There are some weak performances from minor characters here, but these are easy to dismiss in light of how successful the rest of the film is. With sick acts committed by an uncomfortably sympathetic character, it's no wonder it was rejected, not least for the provocative POV we're invited into. There's a meta angle here, and a few layers to pull back. With the audience placed both in front of and behind the camera, a light is shone on a seedier side of society that folks would have had no desire to face. Psycho is credited with breaking the Hay's code but surely this made some cracks in the foundation. No sugar coating here.",4.0

"It's safe to say that Peeping Tom was a film nobody wanted from Michael Powell or anybody else for that matter in 1960 - a crushing commercial and critical failure that more or less finished Powell as a major director. Cahiers' dismissal of it as ""totally platitudinous"" would have seemed like a sharp putdown and more evidence of the nouvelle vague-istes aversion to anything British were it not far less vitriolic than what the actual critics in Britain were saying at the time, a kind of moral outrage that revealed how deeply the film touched a nerve in its uncovering of the seedy underbelly of cinema as an artform and cinephilia more generally. Nevertheless, time has been kind to the film and its newfound classic status has been well-earned through both its own prowess as a film and its massive influence on much that has come since: those classic saturated Powell-ian colours turned sickly and lurid that would help influence the look of the giallo wave to come, the subjective PoV murder sequences that predate the rise of the slasher genre, and of course it would be as difficult to imagine what the career of Brian de Palma would have looked like without it almost as much as it would be Rear Window or Vertigo.
If the camera as phallic signifer symbolism is far from subtle it's fascinating just how complex the analogy is made and the suggestions made as to how Karlheinz Bohm's Mark Lewis became the way he did to begin with - always surveilled and always an object of the camera from as early as he could remember, subjected to abuses and ordeals by his own father, his need to photograph and film others seems as much an unconscious attempt to render himself a subject and give himself the power he was deprived of by his authoritarian upbringing as it does a sexual urge (though that element certainly isn't absent). His palpable discomfort in the rare moments where he's put on camera himself - as in the sequence with Moira Shearer - or when deprived of it and unable to render and control those he sees around him speaks to a deep neuroticism and warped personality that's fascinating to think about. At the same time those around him are far from unambiguously portrayed - the women of his photographs are certainly as keen to become representations while Anna Massey's Helen feels like a stand-in for the cinematic audience, at once horrified yet rapt with attention at Lewis' films; it becomes all the clearer that we are all voyeurs, with Lewis as simply the logical extreme, and the libidinal element in how people relate to cinema is given discomforting clarity.
Masterful command of form - the images being frequently warped, overlaid, put in first person throughout in a way that still feels impressive today and must have seemed even more so 60 years ago - a superb premise, riveting pacing and characterization and possibly an even greater relevance to the present day than to its own time now that we all have our own little cameras we carry around everywhere.",4.0

"EUREKA!
""The morbid urge to gaze."" Michael Powell twists Roosevelt's ""Fear itself"" proclamation into a vibrant and sensuous, playful yet menacing voyueristic gamble at pined connection. The camera literally becomes a mirror, capturing pain and terror like a trapped spirit. Reality and fiction are blurred, amidst a setting so fantastical yet so organic. Like an illustrated pulp fiction novel brought to vibrant Life.
Mark Lewis is a curious monster: boyish though menacing; impulsive though practical. His steps are not shy, but ""stealthy."" Of course, only a blind woman could have revealed his sinister center. The crux of Michael Powell's ironic filmic statement lies at the intersection of sight and sound; each is strengthened by the absence of the other, yet the beauty of cinema lies in the magic forged by their stimulating marriage.
A prelude to a murder acts out like a chilling musical, devoid of romance but seeped in psychosexual dread. As though Powell were laying his classic Red Shoes to rest -- inside a blue trunk on the set of some ditzy picture. And when it needs more comedy, Powell knows just where to put it, evolving Peeping Tom into a wondrously unique and confident horror venture, in which the rules governing filmmaking provide the killer his murderous tools of wicked abstraction.
For as much as cinema is doused in a healthy dose of fantasy, every authored movie provides a documentation of the human spirit, however fractured or strained. Which makes Peeping Tom (a film which desperately seeks out a means of preserving human touch forever) an ever-prescient and definitive horror statement. For to gaze is to judge; and Powell's film implements the righteous, horrific act of turning that gaze back at the observer. Mortality as indicated by pure, unabashed perception.

An ultimate rendition of man vs self, with an exquisite visual design that pre-echoes the rich palettes of Bava and Argento, a psychological complexity that rivals Demme, a story manipulation at the height of Hitchcock’s, and show-stopping performances by Maxine Audley, Anna Massey and, on an ungodly level, Karlheinz Böhm; Peeping Tom is as moving as it is disturbing.
It’s a morbid ode to filmmaking, a gripping thriller, a plunge into a disturbed mind, and a scene to scene delight. Looking at it is like staring at a mirror. For, though I’m not the first to ask this, aren’t we -the audience- the ultimate voyeurs of this violent tale?
So many layers yet for my mind to deconstruct but I can already praise enthusiastically every aspect of this film.
Almost everything that I love about horror came together in this one. A masterpiece at first sight.",5.0
"Peeping Tom plays with fear in a much different manner than most horror films, seeing as the audience views the plot from the perspective of the murderer, leaving little suspense in when the kills will occur. Powell examines the fear of not just the victims, but of Mark (the perpetrator) as well. Mark is a voyeur, not of sex but of fear, a subject which his psychologist father made a career out of, and turns to murder in order to record that raw emotion. It's a shame this got left in the dust while Psycho, a film with much of the same charm, found notoriety. Not to say Psycho is anything short of a masterpiece, I just think this deserves the same love.",4.5

Peeping Tom ist alleine deswegen schon unheimlich, weil Karlheinz Böhm aussieht wie Peter Lorre. Genauso unheimlich ist die Figur, die Böhm verkörpert. Die erinnert ein wenig an Jake Gyllenhaals Nightcrawler. Aber fernab von irgendwelchen verrückten Vergleichen:
Peeping Tom hat mir richtig gut gefallen und ist vielleicht der beste meiner diesjährigen Horrorctober-Auswahl. Von Anfang an hat der Film eine beklemmende Atmosphäre. Obwohl man früh weiß, was die Stunde geschlagen hat, bleibt der Film spannend - auch wenn er auf ein vorhersehbares Ende zu steuert.

"2018 Cult Movie Challenge
Week 1 - Elvira Week
This film is an excellently constructed, truly unsettling voyeuristic killer thriller. Its disturbing nature is brought to prominence through its excellent score and a fantastic performance by Karlheinz Böhm, who perfectly captures the quiet, socially inept psychopath that has now become a classic trope of a character. Other highlights are the brilliant use of color and some incredibly designed set pieces that last longer than expected, adding to the discomfort the viewer feels throughout them. It is not a perfect film (issues include some spotty supporting acting and a slightly disappointing conclusion), but it certainly does its job as a thriller, and Böhm's Mark Lewis certainly earns a spot among the ranks of most menacing characters in film history.",0.0
"Certainly well ahead of its time by having the narrative centered entirely on the villain (not to mention the decidedly conspicuous magazines depicting nude women plastered on a shop window and adorning its interior), even allowing an audience to sympathize with a serial murderer who finds someone he may truly care for; begging her to not show her frightened face (the supposed trigger that sets him off into a euphoric, deadly frenzy) as what he captures with his camera is revealed. Karlheinz Böhm plays the maddened lead with softened veracity, an airy voice not so dissimilar from Marilyn Monroe's, suggesting a timid, likely kind man who only knows not how to communicate with others adequately. Yet, this austere disposition hides nothing of sort, save for a tormented childhood that has channeled his disturbing desire to study fear. The comparison to Hitchcock, and specifically Psycho which released the same year, are unquestionably rampant, what with the themes of voyeurism, scopophilia, troubled youth, and the use of knives as the murder weapons (the two films acting as a dual precursor to the slasher genre), traits shared with Norman Bates, among other Hitchcock villains. I might even be pressed to say I admire Peeping Tom over Psycho for its transparent study of a deranged man, whereas Hitchcock keeps the violence cleverly hidden through his technique—though that is not to suggest Hitchcock's style is any less uniquely effective or good. Uncannily, too, does the film make one realize that we ourselves are being voyeuristic as we sit and watch cinema; this personalized espionage as we watch films no doubt also doubles as a form of scopophilia, as in many ways do we derive intellectual or entertained pleasure. Quite good this is, and it makes me all the more curious to see Powell's other work as this piece is evidently out of character for him, as well as being the film that disrupted his career.",3.5

"I think a second viewing would do wonders for Peeping Tom, as I may have spent a bit too much of the film with my attention split in several places. (What can I say; when your mother texts you asking to borrow a Harry Potter book, well, let's just say Harry Potter > everything.)
But even with my attention shorn in multiple directions, the muted, clammy expression of Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Bohm) is a fearsome thing to behold. This is a bit of double-edged sword; as effective as his performance is, it's a single-note performance that would be more fitting a secondary character, not the central figure of the film. There is little relief as he goes about his slow-paced study in fear.
Necessary texture is, thus, found in Helen (Anna Massey) and Mrs. Stephens (Maxine Audley). While a hint as to Massey's screen presence can be found in her fear-shot that graces this site's poster for the movie, her character is generally a more subdued one; she's freshly 21 and Mark has been noticing her from outside her window (they both have apartments in the same building). After he ignores her invitation to join her birthday party, she goes up to his door to deliver a piece of cake. What ensues is a romantic courtship that has Mrs. Stephens all suspicious--her blindness has blessed her with the ability to hear what goes on above, in addition to a cranky attitude and an alcoholic spirit.
It's this crankiness and constant tilting back of hard liquor that drives the best parts of Peeping Tom. It's not hard to wish that she had been made a more main character, rather than the stilted sallow of Mark's enduring presence.
To 2015 eyes Peeping Tom falls short at being either shocking or scary, both things I suspect that Michael Powell intended for his audience. However, the character study is deep enough to still create a taut narrative. I could easily see this gaining a star or so on a rewatch. Or, you know, not. Whatever. 3.5 stars is still in ""you should see it"" territory.",3.5
"Boy, talk about a penetrating gaze.
It’s daunting to attempt to write about this film, even in brief: there’s enough to unpack here to sustain a doctoral thesis, a series of commentaries, or a meandering conversation over the course of a 10-hour road trip. Of course there are the impressive formalist aspects on display: the wonderful use of color characteristic of Powell’s earlier films, and the clever framing, or the hypnotic point-of-view sequence which opens the film (a sequence which, in retrospect, seems to provide a visual blueprint for slasher films produced two decades later). Or perhaps one could focus on the rich subtext of the film, on its commentary(/critique?) of the male gaze or the evocation of voyeurism of cinema in tandem with the audience’s complicity in onscreen violence. Or one might focus instead on the fascinating historical context of the film: the inevitable Psycho comparisons, the film’s initial commercial failure and eventual rediscovery, or the tragic manner in which it all but ended Michael Powell’s career.
Above all else, though, the thing that I can’t shake is Carl Boehm’s performance. I hope I never see him in another film – not because his performance here is poor (it’s nuanced and richly layered, filled with warmth and fatalistic sadness), but because he simply is Mark Lewis now. That cannot be undone. His face is something unique: handsome to a point, but with eyes and lips suggesting Peter Lorre or a young Klaus Kinski. There’s something boyish there, along with a deep melancholy and a sense of something unspeakable.
In an oft-cited letter sent to Deborah Kerr, Emeric Pressburger outlined a manifesto for his work with Powell in order to attempt to sway her to appear in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. In it, he stated, “When we start work on a new idea we must be a year ahead, not only of our competitors, but also of the times.” Peeping Tom is decades ahead of its time; had Powell known what effect it would have on his career, would he have hesitated?
Highly recommended.",4.5
"POV shots and horror movies. Always a nice combination. I'm not a fan of the Austrian guy, but it's a fascinating lead nevertheless. A man who uses a camera as a weapon. Much like a filmmaker does, I suppose. I bet many directors are somehow influenced by this film. Psychologists will have a field day dissecting this character. In that regard it's a rich and daring movie. However, I can't get quite get into it. There's something in the vibe, the setting that leaves me too cold to fully enjoy it for what it is. Sorry, Marty.",3.0
"""He was interested in the reaction of the nervous system to fear.""
While it was was released the same year as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom had nowhere near the same impact despite being the more disturbing film. Made independently by Powell after his break with Emeric Pressburger (although he did get permission to use the Archers logo), the film was written by Leo Marks and starred Carl Boehm as Mark Lewis, a disturbed young man who is obsessed with capturing fear on camera. That's a trait he inherited from his father (played by Powell himself), a scientist who subjected him to the most reprehensible experiments when he was a child to see how he would react -- and filmed him the whole time. Anybody being raised under those circumstances would grow up to have problems.
Throughout the film we see Mark behind the camera in a number of situations: during the day he's the focus puller at a film studio working on a absurdly light comedy, after work he takes pornographic pictures at a corner shop, and on his own time he works on his ""documentary,"" in which he kills beautiful women while he films them. He won't be finished with that last project until he's been caught by the police, which he expects will happen soon, but in the meantime he strikes up a tentative (and, quite frankly, strange) relationship with his downstairs neighbor Helen (Anna Massey), an aspiring children's book author who lives with her blind mother (Maxine Audley). We first spy on Helen while she's having a rather boisterous birthday party, but it's the present Mark gives her in the privacy of his room that intrigues her more. The question is how close will he allow himself to get to her and how far will she go to try to understand him?
The film also features an extended cameo by Moira Shearer, who had starred in Powell & Pressburger's The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann, as a stand-in working on the same film as Mark who stays late one night to play a starring role in his film, little realizing what kind of film he's making. In a nod to their previous collaborations, Powell has Shearer do a dance routine around the studio to ""warm up,"" which makes it all the more shocking when Mark reveals his true purpose to her -- and us. (We didn't get a good look at the first murder since it was shown from the perspective of his camera, and we still don't get ""the whole picture"" until the very end of the film.)
For a film that was raked over the coals by critics when it was first released, Peeping Tom is actually quite restrained in its depictions of violence. While Hammer films were literally painting the screen red, there is nary a drop of blood shed in this one. That's because, like Mark, Powell isn't interested in the gory details of the killings. (If he was, he wouldn't go into a close-up at the crucial moment.) Rather, it's the reactions of the people watching them that is his primary concern -- and that's exactly what got Powell into hot water. After all, isn't everybody who sits down in a darkened room to watch a movie something of a voyeur?",4.5
"Powell's reflexive look at the ontology of image is......
Actually I won't write my thesis right now.
The use of the image and the effect that living life through the lens can have on the human psyche and sense of self and eventually our ability to experience anything without photographic documentary evidence is under the microscope in this wonderful piece of horrific melodrama from Michael Powell. I'd even suggest that more people in the 21st century are closer to the state of mind of peeping Tom/serial killer Mark Lewis than any of the innocents in this movie thanks to camera phones, facebook and twitter et al.
I tend not to appreciate horror films but a sense of dread permeates every frame of this film and builds to a shocking crescendo, it is something that is hard to ignore and even harder not to appreciate for any fan of the cinematic art form. This was my first Powell, despite watching bits and pieces during film school I was never tempted to watch an entire feature, what a silly schoolboy error that was.

"only occurs to me upon rewatching this decades after the first time i saw it that the crazy scientist father/abused guinea pig son relationship is the model for de palma's Raising Cain. for as much as people talk about de palma aping hitchcock, this movie seems like just as crucial an inspiration for his filmography (and really all thriller/slasher cinema). i know the lurking killer POV had probably been done before but never as effectively as the opening sequence here, which then gets replayed in black and white on a projector for the killer to watch, a template for the film's design: color/b&w, watching/being watched, filming/being filmed, stabbing/being stabbed, masculine/feminine. the overall portrait is that of a self-reflexive medium, of the abyss staring back through a 60mm lens. hard to think of a more formally rigorous interrogation of the medium than this.
also, since Peeping Tom and Psycho so often get lumped together due to their similar subject matter and public reaction, same release year, etc., i gotta say it: Peeping Tom has aged much better than Psycho.",5.0

It’s as creepy as it is original. A perverted film about how men can murder and blend into society without discretion. Mark Lewis is a seemingly harmless photographer who is shy, quiet and hiding a big secret. He takes pictures of models very similar to playboy and is a focus puller at a film studio. Yet Mark is a ruthless killer that is a danger to every model or actress he photographs.

I loved the creative staging of certain shots, like when Michael was spying on the investigators at a crime scene from above, and the camera follows as some pencils roll out of his shirt pocket, tipping off the police that they’re being watched. Interesting that for a film about a psychotic voyeur, there were no giallo style first person POV shots.

מהו הפחד הכי גדול שלכם?
אני בטוח שאותו פחד הוא גדול בטח, הייתי אומר שהוא בטח עצום.
אבל האם אי פעם חשבתם על אותה הרגשת פחד כמניע בלתי נמנע וסופי בשביל הרצונות שלכם?.... במיוחד בשביל הרצונות המזוויעים שלכם.
קחו לדוגמה את פוטין כרגע, הבן אדם מנסה לכבוש כרגע את אוקראינה כי הוא מפחד למות בלי שיזכרו אותו בשביל משהו עצום וענק.
הפחד שלו זה המניע שלו.
פחד לא רק משמש כמניע, הפחד יכול להיות גם נשק.
הפחד מוריד מבן אדם את הביטחון ואומץ שלו והופך אותו לבן אדם חסר הגנה כלשהי.
חס וחלילה אתם תרצחו מישהו והוא לא יפחד, במקרה הכי טוב בשבילכם אתם תצליחו להרוג את אותו בן אדם אבל הוא יחזיר פייט, ומי יודע אולי אתם תמותו איתו.
אין בדיוק הסבר מדויק ללמה פחד הוא דבר כל כך חזק וסביר להניח לעולם לא יהיה.
קיומינו תלוי על פחד, אם לא היינו מפחדים היינו מפוצצים את עצמנו ממזמן.
כל האנושיות נבנתה על פחד, מהימים של קין והבל ועד עכשיו, ולמי שלא מאמין בתורה הקדושה אז אפשר להגיד שפחד קיים עוד מאז הימים הפרהיסטוריים, כאשר איש המערות לא היה מפחד לצוד את האוכל שלו אך היה מפחד אם האוכל היה מחזיר.

Peeping Tom (1960)
This was a very late addition so that’s why I’m watching it today instead of a few days ago.
Well anyways, this was a very interesting watch, honestly throughout I couldn’t help but feel like I was watching Psycho. Just like Psycho, the film does have a good and intriguing story, but unlike that film, I don’t really care for any of the characters in this except Mark. Pretty much all of the performances are pretty bad. Every single actor felt like they just read the lines and that’s it, there’s no effort at all to make the performances really good, the only one who actually tried was Karlheinz Böhm. 
Another negative is the pacing, it’s really bad here. There’s many parts where the film flies by at a good pace then others where it feels like forever until the next scene which was disappointing, but I will say that the film was boring at all, just bad pacing.
Now as I said, the story was at least intriguing, I did find myself interested in everything going on, but the over the place pacing and not so good characters takes you out of the movie. And one more positive, the cinematography and many different POV shots were really nice and well done. 
Overall, Peeping Tom is definitely a weird and interesting film, but I’d still recommend this film to everyone. It’s different, but there’s a lot to enjoy.",4.0

"Released the same year as Hitchcock's Psycho, the similarities are striking. The plots are unique enough, but the two were clearly forged by the same zeitgeist. Peeping Tom also clearly contributes to the lineage of Bava's Blood and Black Lace and Antonioni's Blow-Up. From the opening scene on that gloriously lit set with the prostitute, you know you're in for some psychosexual chills.
This film has a lot of interesting ideas, and I liked watching the detectives try to solve the case. Unfortunately these elements were foregrounded by a focus on the machinations of protagonist Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm). Böhm struggles to nail an English accent, which might be why his performance is so wooden at points. But this is shot incredibly well, and there are lots of wry little meta-narrative conceits that I loved. The climax, though somewhat contrived, has an intense sexual energy that could stand to be imitated again and again. Peeping Tom doesn't feel like a film ahead of its time so much as it feels like a film that helped invent its time. Whenever audiences turn out to see found footage or slasher movies, each time critics praise the new ironic critique of media violence, they're feeling the reverberations of this picture.",3.5
"Peeping Tom is thoroughly engaging and captivating not solely due to its tense, suspenseful murder story, but--just as importantly--because it stirs up feelings of guilt and an uncomfortable level of self-awareness in the viewer; and brings along with it some fascinating insights on cinema. If in Rear Window Alfred Hitchcock proves cinema is an indulgence of man's obsession with voyeurism, then Peeping Tom proves, furthermore, that cinema is an indulgence of man's greatest perversions, and therefore is a perversion itself. However, no person has (or will) ever experience Peeping Tom without admitting it is the most thrilling, irresistible perversion. To expand its similarities to Rear Window, this film is not an indictment of the art it exists within, it is a resounding confession of cinema's true nature.
If we follow Michael Powell's implications of Mark as a symbol for a director and a metaphor for a filmmaker to their natural conclusion, it is a little disconcerting. This leads us to the inevitable deduction that cinema is an intrusion, an intrusion of a character's endeavors, faults, emotions, and privacy; and the director is the one who leads this intrusion. By letting his omniscient camera, at times, participate in similar patterns of unsettling observation, Powell reflects in us a position of accomplices to ""the great intrusion:"" cinema.",0.0

"Deliciously methodical and completely disturbing, the way great serial killer movies should be. At times it is extremely sad, both in its exploration of what it should have been, a beautiful romance film with all the charms of Hollywood, and in its horrendous approach to what it always was; a mind that is born condemned to face its demons, that goes through the bowels of the backstage of cinema and reverts the love for art into something purely animalistic, masochistic. Not only is there the most creative weapon for an assassin to have, it is also the most direct. A blade, a camera and many eyes in search of the same purpose: to observe. A complex character with a beginning, middle and end, master of the image in what he has mastered most perfectly.

"Overlooked & underrated classic Slasher.
The coolest, smartest, most creative & unusual murder weapon I seen. Finally, I found the perfect slasher film for me.
Perfect story of an almost perfect crime. Engaging character study of a murderer suffered from childhood trauma & mental disorder. I loved the late blooming love story that contrasted the dark themes & confused the audience to make them to sympathised the main character.
This makes the ending unpredictable but has this feeling of the upcoming inevitable kind of ending.
The actor is perfect for the main character role, you can feel his insanity & mentality. Also the actress for the female lead is perfect, I love that girl character, her personality is quirky, cheeky & sassy.
Also the sound, the cinematography especially the P.O.V. shots, the used of shadows & darkness and the colours too are all great.
Same year as Hitchcock’s Psycho, and I loved this more because its more daring, bulgar & brutal & its more character driven.",5.0
"I'm a little familiar with The Archers but I haven't seen that many of their films. This is just from one of them and you can tell. It's not standing out in the overall enjoyment, amazingly directed from Powell. He is just so good at it, it feels so modern that you can get lost it in and forget that it was made in the 60s. It really just feels like a modern film with old aesthetics. Where this falls short is the dialogue for me, absence of Pressburger (their movies have been based on his short stories, and he was assisting with the script) can be felt. It just feels very bare boned. A little unfinished especially in the second act. I think first and third acts are amazing, nearly perfect with few minor flaws but the second act, while interesting it never gets to the heights of the other two acts because of it's dialogue. I do also find the character of Mark a little undeveloped. I wish he just had a little more going on, but that's not the issues. I loved the ending, I didn't actually see that coming. He finished the documentary I guess, from his birth up till his death. I wish Mark's relationship with Helen was a little more fleshed out and we actually heard their conversations too. I think that would make Mark feel a look more developed but then maybe that wasn't the intention and he was supposed to be like this.

To me, the only thing that's holding this back is the pacing. It takes up a little too much time, and you can really feel it in some parts, even though it's only a 1hr and 41min movie. But apart from that, everything else in this film is executed wonderfully.",4.0

"É complicado ficar analisando o filme pelo que ele poderia ter sido ao invés do que ele é, mas a verdade é que eu gostaria de ter visto essa trama nas mãos de um Hitchcock da vida. Não à toa ele tem filmes como Psicose e Um Corpo que Cai que possuem elementos semelhantes, sobretudo o Psicose que acaba sendo até engraçado perceber que ele foi lançado no mesmo ano de Peeping Tom, e ambos abordando um personagem diferente por assim dizer para não dar spoilers a quem porventura não assistiu ainda.
Ganha pontos pela boa abordagem do voyeurismo e pela figura estranhamente cativante do protagonista, mas o ritmo um pouco inconsistente e alguns arcos que poderiam ser encurtados faz cair um pouco quando analisamos o todo. Ainda sim um bom filme e um dos precursores do que é provavelmente o maior subgênero do terror.",3.5
"I can’t imagine what kind of reaction this film got when it came out. I only know my own but judging from the time period this must have caused quite a stir for moviegoers and critics back in 1960. Also noticing that it predates Psycho by 3 months makes me wonder if one film influenced another while they were being made or if this one led to the success of Psycho, the film that often gets referred to as the birth of the modern horror era and slasher films. So if all that is in fact true, I guess it's time to recognize this film as a precursor to Psycho and it should be given credit where credit is due. Everything about this film was shocking to me not in the sense of being shocked emotionally but shocked to see these things being done in cinema in 1960. From the nudity to the profanity to the subject matter, everything about this film seems to be pushing the envelope for mainstream cinema, including the director whose other films seem to be some of the most critically acclaimed and successful contemporary films of the past two decades. The imagery is immaculate and absorbing, the subject matter is disturbing and the main character is such a slinky and genuinely twitchy awkward individual (sort of reminded me of Peter Lorre in M) that there is so much strength in its wheelhouse of dread that makes it so successful in so many ways. One of a kind.",4.0

You obviously can't compare it to today's films, however, what really doesn't make sense is how this destroyed Michael Powell's career yet Psycho, released only a few months later, was a massive box office success. I think Psycho is way more edgy and definitely pushes more boundaries than Peeping Tom. At the end of the day, both are brilliant. Peeping Tom is one of the greatest looking color films of all time. From start to finish this film is mesmerizing to look at. It's themes of voyeurism and man's obsession with viewing violence have only become more relevant over time. Thank God Martin Scorsese led the reappraisal of this film cause it is easily one of the greatest British films of all time. It's also baffling that Chris gave this a B minus.

"Trivia : Considered one of the first slasher films, ever made. When it came out critics panned it heavily. Which in turn destroyed Michael Powell’s Career. It is one of Martin Scorsese’s favorite films of all time. Matter of fact he helped it garner a re-release and praises it endlessly.
Michael Powell: This is the second film of his, that I’ve seen, after The Red Shoes. Based on this minimal exposure to his art, I can say he was a versatile director. For me the two films can’t be any different. Although the bright colors, careful blocking and framing in the scenes, are found in both features. This is extremely well directed. It is a slasher film with almost no visible violence. It all happens off screen. And that is also one of the highlights of the film. 
Psycho: A character study of an anti hero. You can’t help but feel for this troubled young man. His childhood was harrowing, due to his father. He inherits a lot of odd qualities and camera equipment from him. Young women are filmed while they are being murdered. It is sort of a science experiment for him. A dark and distressing tale about a killer. And yes it did remind me of a lot of horror flicks. But this has to be the OG. 
Fin: If a psychological horror from the 60’s is what you seek, look no further. This is an excellent film, which hasn’t aged even after all these years. That is a testimony to the fine filmmaking on display.",0.0

"Theories of gazing have been a dominant way in which theorists have understood the way film operates, and in many ways peeping Tom is the acme of this thought. While the always towering Vertigo, made pioneering insights into cinema as perversion from a sexual context, this film goes the next step and identifies it with violence. In this film the act of looking and gazing becomes an act of violence and perverted pleasure. Much has been said about this films pov’s and use of the cinematic lens as murder weapon and rightly so: it’s chillingly effective here. In this film we get the idea literalised that the camera can be a tool of violence, subjugation and voyeurism and implicates the cinematic spectator in this act, And boy is it thrilling to watch it play out. We almost forget that such a perverse understanding of cinema comes the genius minds of one cinemas great idealists. And  while some pnp energy does shine through (in how empathetic, humorous and lively this film is) the pervasion of their image, only makes this films themes stronger.",5.0

"Although the framework has changed into that of a Hitchcockian thriller, and one of the ""P's"""" is missing, this still somehow feels like a Powell and Pressburger film. The visuals are rich and exquisite, although a fair bit dirtier, all the while exploring interesting gaze dynamics (particularly through the use of first-person). There are some great set-pieces that explore the perverse side of filmmaking and spectatorship, even if this is ultimately explained away with neurological disorders. On the whole it delivers, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by what was considered to be one of the most depraved films ever made at the time. By today's standards it's quite tame.

"In this perverted dark depraved tale of desire, and abuse follows a film that’s deeply enthralling, made with such craft, and is just an all around captivating film by director Micheal Powell.
This follows tale of Mark Lewis lonely sad man who has a bizarre fascination, and gets kick out of fear of women. That he’s planning on making a twisted documentary on this subject.
This is deeply complicated film. For its in way tale a deeply twisted look at how men can fetishize women, and twist them into objects; versus regarding them as human beings.
While Mark actions are monstrous, I can’t say he’s monster or can I hate him. For he’s merely tragic product of being born into an abusive environment. An environment where he had his humanity stripped away, and was turn into some test object versus being treated like human being.
This is very much film about toxic ways people can view people. How these ideas are bred through toxic environments, and these toxic ideals rooted in society. For ultimately overall idea, that is film is intense critique of how society often choose to strip people of their humanity, and individuality.
To further elaborate on Mark he’s fascinating character. There is something strangely charming, tender, and likable about guys deep awkwardness. Despite his action being so monstrous, but I think this is due to film giving such empathetic look at this individual.
I think Helen Stephens adds an excellent ploy for Mark. She’s an upbeat, kind hearted, sweet individual who Mark begins form romantic feelings for, and it represents a clash with his monstrous addictions. It makes him want to change, and try seek way out.
I found his character to be fascinating. For reason, I couldn’t call him monster. Is that he over film begins to grow increasingly guilt ridden over his addiction, and he wants it to end; but he just can’t stop. Ultimately Mark needed help, and he needed someone who could genuinely raise him with care, yet he could never get it. That’s true tragedy of this film.
Moving on to performances, Karlheinz Boehm as Mark Lewis is excellent. For he wonderfully captures awkwardness, anxiety, and tender charming side of this character. Provides such empathy, and there’s also something so deeply unsettling. Anna Massey as Helen is excellent, she wonderfully captures tender, loving, and sweet qualities so well, adds such purity.
Then to add on cinematography by Otto Heller, and technical direction by Micheal Powell in this regards. Is quite frankly excellent this film has that beautiful filmic quality with that darkish brown melancholy look, and way film captures voyeurism is so powerful. Camera moves in such gawking way, and moves in such gaze. Then frame shots from point of view of camera provides such power in such disturbing way.
As for issues, film could be at times not most compelling. Then I felt film could feel off, I can’t exactly pin why. It feel unnatural, that said this is a small criticism in overall great film.
This is an overall excellent film by director Micheal Powell, and rest of artists involved.

"It seems strange to me that this movie was hated by the critics when it came out in 1960. I found ""Peeping Tom"" just perfect in every cinematic aspect! Maybe it was too bold for its time. Perhaps the critics were in for more political issues as kitchen sink realism was growing popular in Britain in those days. We'll never know what had gotten into them using verbal injuries like: ""The only really satisfactory way to dispose of Peeping Tom would be to shovel it up and flush it swiftly down the nearest sewer.""
Probably neither the critics nor the audience were ready to take the point of view of the murderer and identify with him. And it's that exactly what director Michael Powell and writer Leo Marks urge us to do.
Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) a shy young man has a part time job in a film studio where he pulls the camera; he earns some extra money photographing nude models in the back room of a news shop. Nobody suspects him to be a serial killer who so far stabbed two young women and who has the police on his tracks. Mark bonds with a girl living in the same apartment building, and as they fall in love Mark is able to reveal his terrible past to her - through old home movies his father (Michael Powell) made while examining the effect of fear on the human nerve system, using his boy as a test object...
""Peeping Tom"" takes us in as accomplices to the murderer, forcing us to be peeping Toms. The audience knows from the beginning that Mark is a killer - the first thing we see is him killing a prostitute filming her reaction of fear and terror. A bit later in the movie we are told the story of his childhood and from there we learn to understand how he became so troubled and even feel pity for him.
That is probably what upset the critics back in 1960.
The public disapproval was so thorough and strong it destroyed Michael Powell's career as a producer-director. The film was withdrawn from cinemas only five days after its premiere, then truncated and released later in a watered-down version.
Luckily we are able to see ""Peeping Tom"" today as it was meant to be. It's an outstanding movie in every aspect and it doesn't fit into any genre.
It's center is Mark's relationship to his scientist father, a man who's research method caused immense damage to his son's mind. In the film the man is nearly absent. We only get a two second glimpse of him when Mark shows some home movie footage to his girl friend Helen (Anna Massey). The scientists in this film appear to be crackers - there is also a slightly wacky German Psychiatrist (Martin Miller); furthermore the script emphasizes on the damage a dehumanized science can cause. ""Peeping Tom"" shows how the scientific methods used by Marks father live on in his son's mind - but in a form that is detached from its scientific purpose and perverted to a danger for those who live around him.
At the same time Powell and his author emphasize Marks kind and gentle nature and present him as a tormented cleft personality.
Apart from being an expertly crafted, gripping tale, ""Peeping Tom"" reaches a considerable human depth which is rare in the cinematic art of its time.",5.0

"Crazy that this and Psycho came out in the same year. There are pretty obvious parallels with both in its story about a damaged character with some disturbing habits, but beyond that it’s a film that is helmed by a filmmaker that seems to revel in his ability to manipulate the audience to the point where the film can step outside of itself and expose the tools it uses to have a viewer by the balls. What keeps them glued to the screen and how we as a society share traits with the main character in some alarming ways. 
I can see the influence on the works of other directors, David Fincher and Michael Haneke come to mind. The device of having the Mark character work on a film set seems a commentary on the filmmaking process and how directors( especially back then) seemed to cross certain boundaries that wouldn’t normally be acceptable. The blurred lines between exploitation and art, it’s a shame that this film derailed the career of Powell, but maybe it was just too ahead of its time.",4.0
"I watched this in a sync viewing with my buddies on Discord that was from Tubi because I heard good things about this film and that it inspired a lot of filmmakers out there like Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Wes Craven, etc. Peeping Tom is quite a complex psychological study of someone who's obsessed with filming someone.
The performances are great, especially Carl Boehm who plays his character as someone that we do feel somewhat bad for him due to his horrible past. It also lets us know that it doesn't make it justifiable for the actions that he had done. The score, for the most part, is well-orchestrated, and it does keep you tense of what's going on, especially when you have no idea what the main character is going to do. It's interesting how they explore the themes of what the main character is going through that is uncommon in films nowadays. Even though it wasn't scary or creepy to me personally, I'm very impressed with how they present the suspense in those scenes.
While most of the music is effective, some of them are overbearing and just a little too over-the-top of what they're presenting here. I get why they used some of the piano work here, but it was a little distracting at some points that it's slightly laughable. Carl Boehm does go slightly over-the-top in being weird at some points that I'm surprised some characters didn't notice how he acts a little strange. Regardless, it's a shame that this killed the director's career because this was an effective psychological thriller that might be more relevant than we think, knowing how connected we are with our smartphones.",4.5

"Voyeurism is cinema's favourite guilty obsession. The need to look, to stare with perverse intensity is a key theme in some of the most well-regarded movies out there, with Alfred Hitchcock making a career out of exposing and playing into the audience's voyeuristic intentions (Rear Window being the most obvious example, but Psycho also plays into the idea). However, it's in the cinema of fear that it's most clear, which is a big part of the reason why Peeping Tom is such a great film.
It concerns a disturbed man who goes around videotaping everything and, if that weren't creepy enough, he also kills women in such a way that they are absolutely and completely terrified at the moment of their death. The film delves deep into this man's mind, as we see glimpses of his childhood which led him to these actions, but it works best when Michael acts as a thematic stand-in. Through close-up, POV shots, the film suggests that we are complicit in this man's actions. That, just as he gets pleasure from seeing these women completely terrified, so do we when watching and enjoying films.
The medium of film is an invasive one. We are watching these people and, while they are fictional, it's still a little disturbing when you think about (which is also why documentaries are such a complicated business). Naturally, the audiences at the time didn't really respond to this idea. This is odd considering how similar this and Psycho are. Both are concerned with charming disturbed killers who have a Freudian obsession with their parents and are concerned with themes of voyeurism (although, I would argue that Psycho lets the audience off the hook a bit and just allows the viewer to get taken in with the action and excitement). However, while that film helped launch a new stage of Alfred Hitchcock's career, Peeping Tom was the end of Michael Powell's.
The British film public despised this film, especially considering Powell and Pressburger generally didn't make this type of film (but did always make consistently great films. Several of them on this list). However, this is clearly their style, with bold beautiful colours ensuring a film that looks absolutely stunning. Some of the film's most disturbing moments are also its most visually stunning. Take the scene where Maura Shearer's character dances in a carefree manner, unaware of the danger that awaits her. It's a masterpiece of mise-en-scene, visual beauty and mounting horror.
The fact that audiences didn't see this for what it was, a stunning and troubling examination of our need to look and cinema's obsession with violence, only seems to work in its favour.",4.0
"Recommended by Andrew Rhyne in the Metropolis Roulette.
I don't know why I was taken aback by how vivid the colors are in this, after all it is a Michael Powell film. I really wish I had more to say about this though, it's really well-made obviously, and I enjoyed watching it, but there just doesn't feel like a whole lot to dig into beyond the surface. Comparisons always feel reductive, but I think Hitchcock—and De Palma later on—dealt with the nature of voyeurism/film/sex/violence in more interesting ways. I just didn't find the internal psychology of the central character to be all that compelling. This has got some stunning sequences and images which will stick with me for a while though, I'll give it that. And there's something to be said about Powell casting his son as the younger version of the protagonist—as well as himself as the abusive dad. Maybe it's just a sick joke? Who knows.",3.5
"Photographing you, photographing me. I can see why this was so unnerving to audiences in its time, but I think the main reason for that goes beyond just attributing it to its disturbing subject matter. It came out in 1960, around the same time as “Psycho,"" and is sometimes regarded as the first slasher film. The story revolves around an introverted camera assistant for a film studio, who also performs side gigs like photographing nude women for seedy establishments. He harbors secret urges, like aspiring to become a film director himself, and the much darker obsession to stalk and kill women while simultaneously filming them at the same time.
This basic plot, allows for surprising depth in character relationships, including making the main character (Mark), somewhat sympathetic in his portrayal, especially as we learn more of his backstory through the eyes of a female neighbor who he forms a budding romantic relationship with. To me, the more interesting thing, and the reason this movie endures so well, is how it incorporated the act of filmmaking and voyeurism into the overall story. The act of watching is linked directly to the act of killing, and Mark sees himself more as an instrument (a focus puller directing the eye) in a larger documentary/experiment on the nature of fear. We, the audience of course, are implicated as co-conspirators by our very act of watching. Our perversion is his shared perversion. This cinematic convention is rather common and even tame today, but you can imagine how a less sophisticated audience of the time would have reacted, which undoubtedly was a big reason this was so scandalous, and why audiences and critics alike reacted with the amount of vitriol they did (it practically ruined Michael Powell’s career). There’s a scene in the original Japanese version of “The Ring,"" where a ghost suddenly emerges out from a television set into the real world. Asian audiences at the time, were said to be especially horrified at that particular scene. I believe the truly disturbing thing about this film for initial audiences, was a similar notion of a “violation"" of the barrier between clearly delineated worlds of the viewer and the story proper that's being viewed.
But even discarding all that historical context, this movie was effective and fascinating on a base level as both a thriller and in its character examination of a dark subject matter. It perhaps suffers a bit, from dominant and rather simplistic Freudian psychoanalytical theories that seemed to be prevalent in a lot of films during this time, but like I mentioned, the sympathetic portrait of the killer and his underlying motives would continue to be exceedingly rare for a long time following this film.
It feels like I’ve discovered Michael Powell’s films (along with his famous collaboration with Emeric Pressburger) a bit late in my cinematic journey. “Black Narcissus” similarly stunned me in its visual splendor and how it projected its subtle psychological depth about repression onto an exotic and isolated outer environment. This was also visually interesting, with a tinge of expressionism in its lighting and visual design. But it also feels ahead of its time, not only in the subject matter, but in the warped reflection it shines onto both the cinematic medium and the audience alike; on the complex nature of voyeurism and the complicit relationship we continually partake in through our compulsive urge to see more.",4.5

"Why does she do it? I keep asking myself about Helen as she inserts herself deeper and deeper into Mark's life.

She's as much a voyeur as the guy leering in windows and rigging up recording devices in people's rooms. She has to see where this all goes even if it scares her.
We all do. We're all so goddamned curious. It's why we're watching the movie. And I think that's what really animates Michael Powell's storytelling here.
I don't think it's coincidence that all of the physical structures of the murders in this film (the movie set, the screening room, the boudoir) are hidden away or difficult to find for most of the characters.

"I'm still trying to process this one. I'm writing the review a full day after seeing it and now I think that's a good thing, because my initial reaction was that Peeping Tom was distasteful. I'm not a prude. I've watched far more graphic horror films, but I was left feeling like I needed a shower. I've seen a lot of Michael Powell's movies, although admittedly not all of them and not in chronological order, and Peeping Tom feels out of place.
But I kept thinking about the movie. I'm still thinking about the movie.
To dismiss this as solely as ""distasteful"" would be a mistake. It is totally distasteful, but that's partly the point I think. And watching this now, in the age of #metoo I can't help but look at this from the POV of some of the women depicted in this film.
Anna Massey's Helen knows something isn't quite right. She seems to think she can fix Mark and doesn't understand the depth of his problems. Moira Shearer's Vivian wants a break and she wants a break so badly that she's ignoring all the red flags around her. You have Lorraine (Susan Travers) who's working in a world where the whole point is that men can feel free to rip off their masks whenever they want to, as long as they pay for it. And lastly, there's Maxine Audley (who is remarkable in this) as the alcoholic blind mother. Her character intuits almost immediately that something is really wrong with Mark. She's learned to trust her instincts in the way women eventually learn that they have to. Because #metoo.

Peeping Tom is often considered the first Slasher film.

More than anything, it feels like a character study of a deeply troubled man, so it's really more of a Drama in my opinion. Karlheinz Böhm is really good in the lead role, the supporting cast is pretty good as well, and the film is well shot and has a number of great scenes.

"Hooptober 4.0: 8/31

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why this film failed when it was released. Audiences were not ready for an opening murder scene to be presented from a first person perspective. They were even less ready to learn that the murderer, a socially maladjusted man who carries around a camera and shoots pinups when he isn’t killing women, was their protagonist. This was an era after Fritz Lang’s M and at the same time as Hitchcock’s Psycho, but the former was accepted as a pre-Nazi allegory and the latter brilliantly masked the identity of its murderer before the revelation. Peeping Tom’s lead was front-and-center meant to be empathized, and no one would have it. As the events of the film go on, it’s hard not to imagine the monocles dropping and pearls being clutched. The UK was only starting to get around to its social change from conservatism, as were the neighbors across the pond. Arguably, they were more intense about it, given that there was nobody to defend this film and calls for its destruction were universal, destroying the career of its director. Truth of the matter is the rage is more than understandable, as no one was ready for Michael Powell to test the bounds of their voyeurism.
Combining artistic flourish with melodrama or sleaze has been Powell’s forte dating back to his collaborations with Emeric Pressberger, but in this solo effort, it reaches something of a grand culmination. Bathing the intensity of watching women scream in terror upon being killed in dazzling colors, or obscured by a punctuating editing style did the film no favors in the eyes of the public, perceiving it as sensationalizing the horror. It’s not entirely wrong as the opening sequence, Mark showing Helen the source for his filmmaking obsession, and murdering Vivian are expertly crafted through that lens. A lot of things without a moral center look great when seen through such operatic lighting work. Powell may have been just as obsessed with getting these shots as Mark, played by Austrian actor Carl Boehm in a most eerie presence, was with his own grisly passion project. In fact, the parallel of the killer and the director can’t be drawn clearer, and that doesn’t just stem from his father being played by Powell in a cameo. 
Mark’s upbringing forces him to find comfort in monitoring everything as he was, and the pleasure he receives from these actions holds a Freudian weight as he chooses to go further than his old man ever could. Peeping Tom is Powell’s own draw of being more dangerous with his work by going as far as to challenge an audience’s growth with the young art of cinema, relating youthful experiences to our most vicious desires, daring to identify a disturbed individual as just another film lover like yourself. There’s a catalog of reasons people hated this that go beyond the vehement superiority complex, and it makes the film more radical through the number of buttons it pushes while selling something sinister and predating an entire genre of mad killers which would saturate the market within a couple decades. It goes to show what change in time and attitude does to a work of art.",4.5

Like I said in my Jigoku review last month: This was made in 1960?! I am stunned by the psychological complexity going on here and the amount of empathy Michael Powell creates for our protagonist. (Special mention to the lush primary-color lighting he uses throughout, too—crazy effective.)
And, of course, that doesn't even begin to touch on the complicity of the audience in these murders and this story. By literally turning the camera into a weapon, Powell forces us to watch these death scenes, too, just like Mark's victims and Mark himself. It's easy to call him a voyeur, but that's not the end of it. Just look to the sequence of Helen discovering one of Mark's films toward the end of the movie: We don't see the film she's watching at all, but the camera never leaves her face for seconds on end, tracking her across the room until she runs into Mark himself. Who's the voyeur now?

"Very interesting, but I'm not really feeling all the wow and shock that this film gets on Letterboxd.
There's no question it's notable for being one of the first films - to the best of my knowledge - to give empathic insight into a serious criminal and the fucked-up upbringing that led to his voyeurism and then to murder. Perhaps that's more disturbing if you haven't studied psychology or ever done work which sometimes involved talking to criminals where their offences would be mentioned as part of a mental health history. (As far as I know, I never filled in any disability forms for murderers - phew! - though there were a few ageing ex-bouncer types who'd been done for GBH.)
In The Entertainer, a film made shortly after Peeping Tom, one character is a social worker and several others are sceptical of her approach to the 'delinquent' teenagers she works with. They're less serious offenders, but coupled with the reception of Peeping Tom, and the condemnation of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner it shows that understanding, and to some extent empathising with the psychology of criminals (rather than condemning these people without thought) was to many in the early 60's, a new-fangled and 'dangerous' idea.
And what of the shock of the mirror: the film viewer as potentially destructive voyeur?
Not knowing anyone who grew up without screens it's impossible to comment absolutely - my grandparents are too long gone and wouldn't have been the types to give much insightful comment into the different world view one may have had spending much of your life without television. Helen comments, as a contrast to Tom, that she likes to be able to understand and engage with what she's watching, whereas he watches because he doesn't know how else to be - and sometimes he destroys, horrifically, those he watches. It's an unusual problem: it's not that he's passive and just lets bad things happen without commenting on them or doing anything about them, something most people in modern society do to some extent. Helen's thinking approach, seeking empathy with the film in front of her, is surely the best we can do. Tom could perhaps be a metaphor for the destructive elements of the entertainment industry, but it seems a little absurd to ascribe guilt to the average individual viewer of a mainstream film for this.

"It's interesting to compare the reactions to Peeping Tom and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Psycho was a box-office phenomenon and became arguably the work most people identify with Alfred Hitchcock. Peeping Tom made Michael Powell a pariah. He spent part of the remaining portion of his career making films in West Germany and Australia.
Certainly Hitchcock had more standing prior to the release of Psycho than Powell did pre-Peeping Tom. The shower scene in Psycho is more explicit than the violence in Peeping Tom, but the latter gnaws away with repeated acts of violence, psychological terror and self-harm.
Mark's (Böhm) mental illness and childhood trauma are less flamboyantly portrayed than Norman Bates' too. There is a grim reality to it. Powell's repeated use of Mark's point-of-view (via a camera lens) adds to the sick sense that the audience is a passive participant in these grisly murders. Additionally, Mark employs the tripod stand in ways that are overtly phallic.
The lurid colour palette contrasts with aloof, socially awkward and shy mannerisms of Böhm's character. Mark is perhaps left undetected because outwardly there are few cues to identify his behaviour as being untoward. His strange nature is often only revealed to others when he brings out his camera. At first they brush it off as eccentricities until his behaviour becomes uncomfortable.
While the pop-Freudian psychology employed in Peeping Tom is very mid-20th century, one cannot help but see a linear path between Mark's persistent desire to bring out his camera to capture inane and profane aspects of his life and the willingness of many in contemporary society's selfie culture to record and share a variety of images. 1960 audiences would have found vulgarity in that connection. Modern audiences might overlook the likelihood that in some respect many of us are voyeurs.
The performances in Peeping Tom often have an affected, theatrical quality that is likely a product of its time. It's easy to see how this film likely influenced directors such as Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese, as well as the entire slasher sub-genre.",4.0

"Not sure where to begin. Although it does have some slower moments (I don’t think any film, ever, doesn’t), this is an amazing film. Lots of suspenseful moments in the film. The sound was great. Great set design that is reminiscent of Powell’s Technicolor film’s with Emeric Pressburger. The has elements reminiscent of, and I’d say was built upon, films like The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann which have horror, thriller and melodramatic elements also felt in Peeping Tom. The editing and shot composition really captures the film’s subject matter. We get POV shots through the lens of Mark’s camera that give the feeling of a film within a film. This is a film about film. We see films being made in a studio, sexual/erotic photography being taken, red light rooms, camera lights, cameras and film projectors. We see the world that Mark lives in. He’s physically surrounded yet psychologically alone. The theme of voyeurism is omnipresent throughout his life. It’s all rooted in his father’s (a quick cameo by director Michael Powell) work, to which Mark was a subject. Said work was about fear and how it affected, and was exhibited in, children.
Mark knows he’s a peeping Tom, he knows the root of his sickness yet cannot seem to cease his acts of violence. There’s even a scene when he tries to find a cure for it. But sadly that cure is out of reach for him and dooms him. Cure by death. I think is alludes to the idea of one’s identity, or at least what one think’s it to be, and how one’ actions will be tailored to that identity. Maybe it’s a reach but that’s how I perceived the film. I liked how Mark was continuously working on his documentary of fear. I think one of if not my favorite scene from the film was the main Moira Shearer scene. She’s just a wonder to watch in dance. She also dances in The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann. I’d recommend this film for the technicals alone. But, I’d recommend it, especially, if you’re a fan of The Archers (Michael Powell and his frequent collaborator Emeric Pressburger). Is this better than Psycho? I can’t really say. But what I can say is Psycho is much more polished and has a less profane feeling than what we see here (if that makes sense).",5.0

Michael Powell, bekannt durch ""Red Shoes"", zeigt das Innenleben eines Serienmörders - toll dargestellt durch Karlheinz Böhm - und lässt den Zuschauer auch durch seine Kamera dessen Perspektive einnehmen.
Das dürfte Anfang der 60er Jahre zu viel des Guten gewesen sein und der Film versank recht schnell in der Versenkung. Erst Martin Scorsese machte sich Jahre später für den Film stark und gab eine Restauration in Auftrag bzw. beteiligte sich an selbiger.
Neben der provozierenden Darstellung des Serienmörders als vielschichtige Persönlichkeit und der famosen Kameraarbeit bleibt aus heutiger Sicht ein Plot, den man so oder so ähnlich schon gesehen haben dürfte. Wahrscheinlich sogar meistens begleitet durch deutlich drastischere Bilder. Das zeigt einerseits wie einflussreich der Film gewesen sein dürfte, hat es für mich aber auch etwas schwierig gemacht, so richtig in den Film zu versinken, da ich vergleichbare Werke jüngeren Alters dann emotional eindringlicher empfinde. Nichtsdestotrotz ist ""Peeping Tom"" ein einflussreiches Werk, das nachwirkt.

"How does a movie like this that is so good destroy a man’s career?  Michael Powell did tv episodes and minor films after this movie - which is a shame. How?
Fucking Puritans that’s how 
And it’s no salve that BFI named it the 78th greatest British film of all time and actors and directors voted it the 27th best British film ever. A case of too little too late. 
This tale of a serial killer who films his murders so that he can see their expressions as they are dying and which he combines into his own personal snuff film is terrific.  More than just the first slasher film it is a brilliant psychological horror film. 
I’m just glad that director Michael Powell- before he died in 1990 - got to see the critical reappraisal and appreciation of the film. 
Fucking Puritans.

"Firstly, two anecdotes:
I had my sister on FaceTime watching the start of it with me because she wanted to see my reaction to the film.
After it ended, I had to wash pans and had a crisis I had to expel so quickly because I could tell I would spiral if I thought too much about how uncomfortable I was looking at my hands doing something, and noticing I was looking at myself doing something. I am still having a kind of out of body experience typing this an hour later.
That’s how clinically effective this film’s craft is. So clever in a kind of metacommentary and with the story it tells. A neat little red connective thread on my detective pinboard of horror inspirations. I’d love to watch it with The Tingler and Manhunter in particular.",4.5

""But then, as Dora begins to get undressed, the scene changes again. Almost imperceptibly, voyeurism shifts to its close associate: sadism.""
An illuminating watch/listen. Laura Mulvey's richly detailed visual essay deconstructs both the production and psychology behind Powell's film. It's like attending a brilliant lecture, with Mulvey peeling back the layers and stretching our awareness - not just to the depths of Peeping Tom, but film analysis as a whole. Her observations and conclusions make you want to be a more savvy moviegoer, pay closer attention and push past a surface reading of things. There's more to unlock, more to decode.

"Peeping Tom is a film of many layers. On the surface, it is a creepy film about voyeurism and exploitation. However, when you unpeel the layers underneath, you may find that the ugliness does not necessarily come from what's on the screen.
For a film made in 1960, Peeping Tom seems modern. After all, we live in a world where we hide ourselves behind masks of many layers, be it in our daily interactions with people, or social media. In addition to that, we live in an era of television where it is common to see shows that track the lives of celebrities, people with mental illness, and dermatologists who stylize themselves as ""pimple poppers"".
But who really is the voyeur?
Martin Scorsese has always extolled the virtues of Michael Powell's filmmaking style, even going so far as to claim that Peeping Tom is one of the films that can teach you all you need to know about filmmaking. It's hard to argue with that sentiment. Not only does the film utilize a number of interesting cinematic techniques for the time, it also tackles the ethics of filming people at their most vulnerable.
It is the equivalent of cinematic violence, brilliantly shot and staged by the late great Michael Powell. A flop during its initial run, it gained cult status in the early 1970's when filmmakers like Martin Scorsese started promoting it. Today, it is rightly considered a classic.",5.0

"Peeping Tom was Powell's 2nd film following his split from Pressburger. The film was so hated by critics and audiences at the time of release, that it made Powell's career decline big time. I guess people were expecting a film with Powell's name on it to be vibrant and colorful, unaware that director's can switch their styles up if they feel like it.
A shocking progression of what fear and a lack of privacy can do to an individual, Peeping Tom brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ""all the world's a stage"".",4.0
"A truly disturbing and wonderful film. Gorgeously shot, which the new 4K remaster highly details, and doesn't hold back on how dark it can get. There's a sympathy here which we struggle with having but have anyway. Doing that with such a character is a high feat to accomplish. I'm sure this was beyond shocking when it came out in 1960 but that shock can still be felt today. I don't see the finale ever losing the gut punch it has.",5.0
"An absolute tour de force from Michael Powell but somewhat in the ""just not for me camp"". I'm not the best with this kind of heightened psychodrama and this film leans heavily into it. Mark is such a weirdo creep it just isn't credible anyone would want to spend time with him but this is the movies so it happens. Something about that and the pop psych on display turns me off. I found it hard not to roll my eyes whenever there was dialogue.
But Powell's direction is kind of undeniable. The meta film commentary is bountiful. The framing, the angles, the colour: perfect. It's an unnerving film but exciting and dynamic. Powell combines that with a really aggressive and successful sound mix. It's a film I doubt I can forget.
Order of Merit: Director, Sound",3.5
"Easily one of the best looking films of all time. Michael Powell’s proto-giallo plays with blocking and lighting in ways that are both really fun and play directly into the story. Setting it on movie sets opened up a lot of possibilities to keep the cinematography exciting. It’s a great story too. Fucked up for the 60’s I guess, but still surprising that this ruined Powell’s career because it was so grotesque, despite not being anymore violent or sadistic than Psycho; though Mark Lewis is more unsettling than Norman Bates (because German). Anyway I wish movies still looked like this.",5.0
"Director Michael Powell worked with Alfred Hitchcock on his films in the early 1920s and it truly bleeds through in almost every aspect of this production. Our main character Mark Lewis is charming, debonair, soft spoken, and an artistic cameraman searching for the perfect scene in a true voyeuristic manner. Coincidentally, another charming, soft spoken, debonair villain is introduced to the big screen in Psycho by Hitchcock six months after this films release.  I’m sure there is no relation. The lush early 1960s color only beg a macro dose to push the visual aesthetics over the edge and line up a potential panic attack. But just think of the stories you can tell your friends afterwards! “Scopophilia!”",4.5
"‘Peeping tom’ is a film Hitchcock could have only dreamt of making, a endless game with suspense and beauty against the backdrop of a conventional 60s horror, it conforms to all the rules of Hitchockian horror and still breaks free from them. It becomes skmethjnf really meaningful and despite it as a whole not being ahead of its time, narratively it is. The voyeurism and the necessity to be attracted to being filmed and popularised. Beyond all that, front and centre it is incredibly composed film, plays with suspense and information so well and filmed so incredibly with the way it plays with colours and positions and most importantly you cannot speak about ‘Peeping tom’ without speaking about Karlheinz Böhm performance, something really incredible and a dead pan performance ahead of its time, it can’t be comparable to Anthony Perkins raw and human performance in ‘Psycho’ and yet they feel very on par with each other. Really incredible",4.5

"So yeah, this ain’t exactly your usual Michael Powell venture. Must have been quite the shock back then. I’ll confess, I admired this more than loved it, and not sold on it as a “masterpiece”. But it is fascinating. Carl Boehm amazing in the lead, couldn’t imagine finding anyone creepier. Excellent turns too from Anna Massey, Maxine Audley, the latter’s appearance in Boehm’s apartment truly great scene. Though her role really just a cameo, Moira Shearer still so enchanting a presence.",4.0

"I knew based on reputation that this would be a dramatic swerve for Michael Powell but I certainly underestimated by just how much. An unsettling psychological thriller that leans on theatricality in the same way his work with Pressburger did, Peeping Tom is every bit as shocking as its most frequent point of comparison and fellow 1960 film Psycho. We watch from the killer's point of view as he corners and kills women while filming in a handheld camera to watch the footage later. These sequences rely on the power of suggestion as first the murder weapon is obscured and then finally the true cause of the terror in a memorably creepy and sleazy reveal. The script's approach to its protagonist and murderer is more sympathetic than the premise would suggest and builds towards a finale where he's trying to stop himself from killing, extending a self-awareness of his issues to a suspense set piece. Not quite a tragic figure but also not quite an unfeeling killer, you can see the vestiges of Powell's original idea for a Freud biopic manifesting itself in the childhood explanations of his behavior. I'm a little torn on whether Karl Böhm's necessarily awkward performance is one of the few weak points or a stroke of genius but he certainly brings a creepiness tinged with humor that could easily have gone wrong. New restoration looked fantastic on the big screen.",4.0
"WHY DON’T WE MAKE HIM A PRESENT OF THAT WINDOW? HE PRACTICALLY LIVES THERE.

THE BACK OF MY NECK TOLD ME.
This was pulled from theaters just days into its release in the UK due to public outcry, yet Psycho went on to do a full healthy run with US audiences that same year. Both films walk us right up to the edge of the actual violence without showing it, but both are psychologically distressing.  
Peeping Tom, however, has only one set that feels claustrophobic. Everything else here is well lit and out in the open. This is a suited-up gainfully employed red-scooter riding landlord. He’s hiding in plain sight and empowered until he encounters a very sweet, naive and perhaps unintentionally nosy tenant. Through Mark’s ever-awkward budding thing with Helen, we get to know him in a clinical way. From the science experiment childhood straight to the adult he is now…a father’s predilection being perpetuated through his son.
That first “real time” color tracking shot is sublime…and then you get to experience it again in black and white. This alone got me all goose-bumpy. We will see snippets of that same activity in bursts throughout, but what an opener!  
This film does not keep the pedal to the metal. It distresses us in fits & starts, but never more (for me) than when Mark is on his home turf, in that darkroom, speaking as if in a trance.
This is on my list for future viewings. I sense there is a lot here that escaped me on first blush as I was caught up in the psychology of the whole thing (and also distracted by that insanely cool reel-to-reel radio!)


Psychobabble:
I realize we’re talking 1960, but what I found most interesting about Peeping Tom was the idea that Mark knows what sets him off, true to pure psychopathy, yet he’s able to form an attachment to Helen and warn her - he then removes the threat instead of harming her. 
Psycho was released the same year and has a much more intrinsic sense of cause-and-effect mental illness. Norman is unaware of his breaks and he presents not as a psychopath but as D.I.D.
I would love to know the research behind both of these films and how they fit in with the late 50s understanding/applications for mental illness.",4.0

"a somewhat slow paced pseudo-slasher (without the slashing) that does - as Letterboxd’s tagline eludes - have a pretty fucking wild murder weapon. 
was a strange watch for me, coming off of Powell’s Black Narcissus a few weeks ago; a film I liked almost purely because of how beautiful it looks. to realize, within the first 20 minutes of Peeping Tom that it was helmed by the same director was jarring. and THEN to find out it was his career killer was a major bummer.
Powell makes the very disturbing story of a traumatized boy turned depraved man a colorful visual feast, with really good use reds and pinks and shadows. the plot drags at times, but I was interested enough to see how it all ended. I could understand how the subject matter - particularly the reveal towards the end that delves into the full “family history” - would be an easy chopping block for critics to hack at, but this film does feel a little ahead of its time in some ways, particularly with the voyeuristic camera.

"Gorgeous cinematography and an almost overwhelming bruising of lush colour in the lighting, costuming and production can't save this rather tepid examination of childhood abuse and adult psychopathy.
Despite the nifty production, the script and storytelling really sag in properly building up the tension and inviting us into the voyeurism of our protagonist, Tom Peepers (he's actually called Mark, but chance would be a fine thing.)
What is most underwhelming is the lack of violent or pre-/post- violent imagery, which for a film focused on the madness of a film-obsessed psycho killer seems an odd choice. Fair that this was a British production from 1960, and apparently led to Powell's exile from UK film production, but it is surprisingly tame.
Compared with Hitchcock's Psycho, which regularly shows and builds towards its unseen violence so well that you think you've seen it, Peeping Tom hints at a terror so profound it leaves corpses curdled with facial disfigurement - it's a suggestion that is more farce than fear.
Performances are good, making the most of suggestive dialogue despite it often being too on-the-nose, and generally lending a stylised credibility to actions. Karlheinz Bohm is a good lead, his Germanic accent is a touch confusing although also intriguing.
As a big fan on anything that explores the inherent voyeurism of cinema, this didn't live up to my expectations due to its reliance on dialogue and production design over imagery and perspective.",2.0

"A disturbing, yet empathetic look at the dangerously voyeuristic mind of a deeply traumatized young man determined to complete a truly sick documentary. Karlheinz Böhm pulls off acting charming and shy and creepy in a heartbeat. You can’t take your eyes off him. The colors here are beautiful, as expected from a film made by one of the Archers. It’s dripping with rich, lurid emotions to match the seediness of early 60s Soho presented on screen. Never before has a film so deeply implicated it’s audience in what the antagonist does before. We gaze upon the murders Mark commits, and we are just as guilty. We, as much as we don’t want to admit it, want to see the look of fear as much as he does. We are complicit in these crimes. Very angered at how the British public destroyed this gem at the time, and publicly soiled Powell’s reputation. It’s a shame because this film ages incredibly well, and it sits alongside Georges Franju’s Eyes Without a Face as disturbing horror films from 1960 that are better than Hitchcock’s Psycho.

Mark's relationship with his father reminded me of how (Salvador) Dalí’s father reportedly showed him a book about venereal diseases which caused him to have an aversion towards sex. Also liked Böhm's performance; he effortlessly switches from off-putting weirdo in one shot to having some sort of normality in the next.,4.0
"Forever obsessed with how the darkroom was shot like something out of a dark fairytale. Everything is cruelly beautiful and painstakingly human.
Mark was always watched, he has no keys, only doors, he cannot fantasize but only do, enact, be a director. Helen is curious, only afraid of what she can’t see, and after meeting Mark she can only write about a magic camera that sees children in adults’ faces - as her eyes did. Helen’s mother is blind but she can feel Mark watching, hear him walk around his room, take his picture with her hands, and she knows he needs help. He knows too, knows he’s crazy. He never really thought about getting out.
Psycho came out a few months later, and I can’t help but think of its ending, the infamous monologue of the psychiatrist. Hitchcock was clever: after that, on the page, the story is that of a madman. Not about us, the viewers. Couldn’t be us, or parts of us. Powell does no such thing here.",5.0

It’s pretty fascinating to think that one of the biggest horror films of all time could have ended this director’s career. The amount of controversy surrounding this film when it came out is insane. Way ahead of its time. I’m giving it a pretty low rating since I feel like it was pretty slow and often didn’t lead anywhere.,3.5

"Unlike anything I’ve ever seen - truly one of the most unsettling films I’ve seen in my entire life.
The way I’ve been wanting to see this for longer than I can even remember and it still absolutely blew me away.  Just an exquisitely filmed, lurid extravaganza.
Functions both as a genuinely disturbing psychological horror movie, but is also positively drenched in that singular Michael Powell technicolor direction that every single scene feels like it could break into a fully-fledged MGM musical at a moments notice.
So much to praise, but I think the sheer level of restraint on display here - it’s a tremendously elegant movie, and it’s such a shame the reputation it gained at the time, because it really is so beautifully made.  There are also at least three … reveals here which blew me out of the water from a storytelling perspective, which is doubly wild given that it’s a sixty plus year old film.  An absolute MASTERPIECE, I’m in awe.",5.0
"“What am I seeing, Mark?”
Props to that Lost opening with that killer eye shot. Definitely a good way to set up a film about voyeurism. As the story continues, Powell adds a lot of detail to Mark’s character study through psychoanalysis of the character’s childhood (“I never knew one moment’s privacy”), effective production design of his world, the pov camera angles and Karlheinz’s performance. If only it didnt drag dreadfully particularly in the middle hour. I may have been able enjoy it or give the movie a free pass. But the pacing was so terrible and I couldn’t latch onto any specific story beats because I was so bloody bored. Carry on already!

Peeping Tom ist ein Vorreiter des Slasher-Genres, was ihn zu einem Meilenstein des Horrorfilmes macht. Der Film von Regielegende Michael Powell möchte in erster Linie aber gar nicht gruseln. Suspense ist der zentrale Begriff in Peeping Tom, da Powell den Zuschauer in einigen Szenen kaum Luft zum Atmen geben will. Vor allem die ersten 45 Minuten stechen für mich hervor, da der Alltag des psychopathischen Mörders Mark wirklich faszinierend ist. Als Mark seine Nachbarin Helen näher kennenlernt, nahm für mich die Spannung und die Intensität jedoch ab. Erst im Finale konnte Peeping Tom meine Aufmerksamkeit zurückgewinnen. Dies gelingt insbesondere dank Karlheinz Böhm und den vielen visuellen Ideen, welche mir sehr gut gefallen haben. Gerade in der Kameraführung merkt man die Erfahrung und Klasse Powells. Für mich besteht Peeping Tom den Test der Zeit.",3.5

"Watching the cinema of yesteryears could be a two-pronged sword. On the one hand, if you compare Peeping Tom with the slashers of not just present years, but even the slashers of the successive decade, this film is tame by comparison. On-screen violence could barely be counted, blood is barely seen. Violence is implied.
On the other hand, the cinema of yesteryears is teachable about cinema itself. The aspect of a man obsessed with watching other people (voyeurism, as it is called nowadays), all to satisfy or capture that precise moment of fear gives dimensions to the term ""creepy"". The fact that the film never really shies away from giving the ""murderer"" a protagonist or anti-heroic arc could be one of those moments where the critics would have been creeped out. But Michael Powell being the masterful director that he is, knows of his inherent male gaze but also knows where to direct it. The women, with their beauty, with the moments of fear flitting through their eyes, are as integral a part of that movie as is the gaze directed at the serial killer himself. And Karl Boehm is magnificent in depicting the inherent psychopathy and the distress within Mark's character. The movie doesn't sympathize with him, far from it. But it does try to give us a point of view.
But like his work in the film studio, that of a focus puller, Peeping Tom is also a story of the power of the camera and the power of filmmaking itself. The film itself is a transactional relationship between the audience and the director, where we essentially are voyeurs, watching other people enact life. It's also a commentary about vision. The moment of Helen Stephens' blind mother empathizing somewhat with the serial killer is a note of irony. Her touching and feeling of the contours of his face are the closest someone has come to capturing the contours of his face, irrespective of emotions. The different types of vision explored - the physical and the mechanical is a fascinating juxtapositions. When the movie focuses on the mechanical aspect, you can see Powell's technical aspect as a filmmaker come to the forefront. Like most Powell and Pressburger joints, Powell's choice of framing of shots, the use of lighting and primary colours are almost impeccable. It doesn't overpower you as a Giallo would, but its impeccable alchemy means you are unable to look away. Powell also manages to infuse some humour and some satire about the filmmaking industry itself, and while that is an interesting wrinkle, it is one of the weaker elements of the movie. The other is actress Anna Massey, who plays the girl next door. While she is fine in the conversational moments, she is surprisingly flat during the moments of showing abject horror, especially when Powell chooses to use a tracking shot holding on to her face, as she sees the violence implied on screen.
Peeping Tom is a contemporary of Psycho, but somehow it lacks the luridness and has a degree of sensitivity, which is a tad bit hard to imagine. It shows surprising amounts of restraint, but that could be attributed to Powell's method of directing more than anything else.",4.0
"Mark works behind the camera for a film studio by day, moonlights as a nude model photographer, and at night he hunts for women to murder while recording his kills in hopes of capturing the portrait of abject fear as he commits his heinous acts. The film follows Mark as he slowly unravels, grows sloppy, and begins hunting too close to home while also courting his downstairs neighbor who isn't aware of his secret life, even though her blind mother figures out that something isn't right.
I can see why this movie was seen as a raunchy and scandalous film when it first came out, especially when compared to the much tamer films being made in the United States at the time. It is also one of the first serial killer films that lacks any of the blood or violence we would see in just a handful of years in Italian giallo films, but does introduce the POV perspective as well as other tropes we've grown used to in the past 60 years.
The film, though, is not that well acted and tonally never quite manages to achieve any sort of tension or blood curdling. It also feels incredibly tied to the soundstage it was filmed on, which is surprising when considering that Michael Powell was the director, the man behind incredibly beautiful and powerful films, especially when collaborating with Emeric Pressburger.
While I acknowledge this film's legacy and influence, I was not quite blown away by it and found it a little cheesy and underwritten. We never quite understand why the killer hates women and chooses them as his intended victims, especially since it is clearly established that he has major daddy issues, other than it's ""fun"" to watch women scream and die on screen. There are a lot of missing pieces to this story that don't add up and it failed to really impress me the way other films in the genre and of the period have. This movie did come out the same year as Psycho, after all, one of the most incredible films ever made that still holds up to this day. Peeping Tom? Not so much.",2.5

"Couldn't get into it. A bit too slow paced and tame for it's subject matter. That this was considered so scandalous in the 60s that it led to destroying the directors career is quite sad because 1) I don't understand what the fuss was all about and 2) it's a perfectly fine film with a range of huge pluses like great sets, great acting by the lead, some very good sound design and a few unsettling scenes despite its mild nature. I can see how this inspired horror filmmaking for generations to come.

"Peeping Tom opens with a bang, an incredible opening sequence with a graphic event that is then played back in chilling fashion.
Voyerism is unsurprisingly a captivating and fascinating film subject for many cinephiles, myself included, so I was locked in. Peeping Tom gets compared to Hitchcock, and it does really share DNA with Rear Window, Vertigo and Psyhco - strong company if the film works - and Peeping Tom is Great.
Dark and grimy themes and actions that the characters are subjected to. Thrilling and tense throughout. The scene with the Red Shoes' Moira Shearer in particular is a brilliantly staged chill fest, and carries on to a scene set the next day.
Some of the acting feels a little hokey almost but I put that to the tone Powell is trying to create.
Controversial film that apparently nearly ruined the careers of one of the greats, who is famous for collaborations with Pressberger, but here is sole credited. I have now seen Red Shoes, Matter of Life and Death (aka Stairway to Heaven), Canterbury Tale, Black Narsisus, Colonel Blimp and even the Thief of Bagdad (he is listed as one of many directors) and all are varying degrees of good to very good to great. Ill now add Peeping Tom to that list.

"„Voajer“ je film koji je teško voleti. Nije čudno da je ovo bio kraj Pauelovog ozbiljnog rada na filmu jer je uperen upravo protiv onih koji treba da ga afirmišu - kritike. Sugestivno budi iz podsvesti ono najtamnijie – fetiše i patologiju, uvlačeći nas u sivu zonu u kojoj se susrećemo sa svojim voajerstvom, u kojoj nikom nije lagodno. Jedini likovi u filmu koji su iskreni i koji mogu da uspostave neko razumevanje pate od neke vrste defekta. Sa druge strane, oni koji su „normlani“ su obučeni u odoru moralnog čistunstva, al isto tako poremećeni – rutinsko zgražavanje nad ubistvom sa početka filma uz odsustvo bio kakve empatije, čikica sa šeširom (uzorni građaniin) koji obazrivo kupuje gole slike, psihijatar koji uživa u patnji glumice na setu..
Filmu kada se pojavio, nije pomoglo ni to što je glavni lik, Mark psihopata, ali simpatični psihopata sa kojim se donekle čak i saosećamo jer se čini da za njega druga sudbina ne postoji. Njegov put istreniranog psa mu je ostavljen u amanet. Kada se upoznaje sa Vivijan, koja ga pritom poziva na žurku, izgovara „I’m Mark“, našta ona zbunjeno reaguje jer je već prošla fazu razgovora namenjenu upoznavanju. On se brzo ispravlja – „I am Mark“, misleći da mu to zamera.
Takođe je prisutna neizvesnost oko budućeg razvoja audio-video tehnologija i potencijalnog ukidanja privatnosti, mada danas smo svedoci stvari koje 1960. nisu bile ni zamislive, tako da je suvišno govoriti o tome. Skorceze uviđa u filmu i momenat patnje kroz koji prolazi režiser pri stvaranju filma i posvećenost koja se graniči sa ludilom – neka bude.
Ko iskreno voli ovaj film ili je neka vrsta mazohiste kojem prija nelagodnost ili ga posmatra kao standardni horor slešer u kojem manijak ubije neke žene.
Spojler:
P. S. Iako mu Vivijan postaje draga tokom filma, ni u jednom trenutku se ne uspostavlja razumevanje, čime je i ona „normalna“.To se vidi na kraju kada otkriva film ubistva i pravi zaprepašćenu grimasu, ali ne skida pogled sa ekrana čak ni kad pobegne u drugi deo sobe.",3.5
Alexa play “Daddy Issues” by Demi Lovato,3.5
"The opening sequence of the film is one of the strongest: we see the killer following a woman while filming her. But the camera lens, like a target, announces the bloody murder. The filmic act is thus a murderous act, and Mark Lewis' gaze substitutes itself in a necessarily provocative way for that of the filmmaker. One may however regret that this transgressive impulse is not pursued over the duration of a feature film that is worthwhile above all for its aggressive photography, which brings out dynamic colors representative of the tortured mind of the male protagonist, undeniably perverse but also fragile and lucid.
The film, if it seems to play its cards very quickly, finds a clever way out thanks to the idea that the killer must feed on the fear of his victims to kill them, a necessary act that sends Mark back to his past where the father is both the executioner and the mirror of a child who in turn becomes the monster. Peeping Tom is an interesting film, even exciting at times, but we would have liked it to be even more complex, to find a dizzying form that would match the psychology of its main character.
A very unhealthy film but intelligently well constructed and directed. Definitely ahead of its time.",4.0

Peeping Tom I would personally classify more in the thriller category, but I’ll place in the the early stages of horror genre.

"Anything can be a tool to harm others as you have been harmed. In this case it seems that tool/weapon is not only a camera but the discomfort it causes to be filmed during your most sensitive and intimate moments. And what moment is most intimate if not the moment you are about to die?
This seems like a criticism of the very common voyeurism of most film makers and how apathetic audiences can become to it. For once the voyeurism is shown just for what it is, a sick very individualistic way of seeing people.

Peeping Tom impishly blurs the line between reality and fiction, between Mark's, Powell's, and the audience's gaze, in a way many films have come to copy since.
Surprisingly complex and somber, Peeping Tom is an early, disturbing exploration of voyeurism both through and in cinema.

"""Take me to your cinema.""
The camera has an opus. It starts simple enough, one murder: the lens the barrel from which the gaze is shot like a bullet; the woman, a prostitute, its receiver. But instead of playing it out as straight succession of ever-increasingly orchestrated killings, Powell doesn't ever feel tempted to turn this into something like a proto-giallo (not that there would be anything wrong with that, mind you); he instead uses this premisse to build a fully formed structure from the psychoanalytical aspects the concept radiates. Mark, more than a mere photographer, is a director of (female) actors; he builds every single murdering detail with the utmost precision and care, creating the perfect conditions for the emotion he wants seared into celluloid -- in this case, livid fear. And Powell expertly shifts the viewer between both ends of the gaze, leaving one in a perpetual seesaw of obsessive interest and nail-bitting tension, masterstrokes of which are delivered in Vivian's audition scene, and in Mrs. Stephens' riveting confrontation in chiaroscuro. Effectively, Peeping Tom ""outhitchcocks"" Hitchcock in one sweeping motion.",4.5

I talk about this all the time in my reviews, but this is one of those movies that got so hyped up from friends or reviews or whatever that I just kept putting it off out of fear that it would disappoint. And just like Psycho, a movie I have seen and heard it compared to, it definitely did not disappoint.
With a sympathetic protagonist, likeable characters, great acting, and beautiful set and location work, I found this movie fascinating to watch. As someone mentioned in the reviews before me, every scene I found it easy to get lost just exploring the backgrounds. I wanted to visit that location and touch the artifacts of the movie. I kind of wanted to live in that world, where I shared a house with several other tenants, where I could ride a scooter to work and walk to the restaurant around the corner.

"Patrick Bateman was grinning macabrely.
""Contemporary influence in its finest shades"" is the perfect phrase to illustratively designate Michael Powell's eye for filmmaking. His stylistic effect and aroma that develops throughout the conceiving of a screenplay have emanated a vision for suspenseful cinema that's unlike any other British auteur. Nonetheless, his work throughout a motion picture such as Peeping Tom may serve as his most profound effect upon an individual directorial effort. Moreover, the set-pieces are dark and harrowing, but they still depict a tale in which emotional character development remains persistent. And, without any doubt, the visual flair on display within world cinema aficionados' favorite classic concoction The Red Shoes (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's classic collaboration piece in 1948) is still subtly presented; however, the tonal continuities were much more shallow and the story did not grasp the archival status of Powell's preceding works. In other words, the attraction of the subtextual prevalence was much more under-developed within Peeping Tom, but without a doubt, the exposition is quite breathtaking.
Building upon the beauty of Peeping Tom's initial act, Karlheinz Böhm (portraying the character of Mark Lewis) achieves a phenomenal conveyance that involves exhibiting a character through an eerie depiction of his murderous desires within the primary sequence. Additionally, he displays a facial tone that reaks of monotonous tendencies, but could not be any more of a complex depiction of the premodern Patrick Bateman. Furthermore, his structural development throughout the rising action fragment of Peeping Tom presents a top-tier representation of how to internally alter a protagonistic character with an antagonistic disposition. In this sense, screenwriter Leo Marks reinvigorates the classic revisionist narrative and molds this piece of art into such a meticulous construction that is saturated with the prime facets when developing a mystery that mingles together with a very vague medley of different thriller sub-genres. And at this point, the direction of Michael Powell generates an even more noticeable effect upon the film as the dark nature has interlaced beautifully with Marks' carefully crafted writing.
The production-design displayed another unique aroma that surrounds the foundational joints of Peeping Tom as a whole. Truthfully, the lighting worked astoundingly well with some of the more inspirational sequences for modern-day psychological thriller-based auteurs. Primarily, the scene in which Mark is presenting Helen with some of his childhood films that were pictured from a more external perspective, in my opinion, depicts the most impressive elemental concepts throughout the picture. Moreover, the scene entails Helen and Mark watching these motion compilations of the past. However, there is a consistent technique that's utilized in which Helen's character, portrayed by Anna Massey, is enveloped in blaring red light that signifies panic and confusion as she watches these sorrowful rolls of film from Mark's past. In the case, of Karlheinz Böhm's character, his face is tinted peculiarly amidst this light blue color in which, I feel, is a representation of his cold persona as well as his unapologetic view upon life. As a result of the foreshadowed madness within this sequence, these frames pose as one of the finalizing pieces of Peeping Tom's mesmerizing exposition.
Unfortunately, Michael Powell's tonal brilliance does disperse slightly throughout the climactic development period as well as the denouement. Furthermore, the screenplay's powerful impact that was revealed during the initial segment felt underutilized. Needless to say, the nature of the chilling opening felt so disappointingly obsolete as there is a decent amount of glaring tonal inconsistencies within the back-half. In a strange manner, the second and third acts felt slightly less energized as if the suspenseful growth was not, from any distinct angle, sufficiently complimented. Indeed, this is a quite nit-picky outlook upon Michael Powell's work, but due to the flawless identity that is unveiled among The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus, I hold a high standard to each and every one of Powell's motion picture concoctions. But overall, the aspectual relationship between each plot-defining ingredient is executed in a manner that spews of ambition and confidence and although Peeping Tom is a film that's fairly clean of visual flaws, it is a thrilling experience with an ingenious screenplay and influential visual stylistics.",4.0
"Peeping Tom é, antes de tudo, uma obra muito a frente do seu tempo.
O diretor Michael Powell quase teve sua carreira destruída pela censura da época por causa da violência e nudez presentes nesse filme, características que anos depois viriam se tornar quase que essenciais no cinema de terror.
Juntamente com Psicose, esse filme é considerado por algumas pessoas como um proto slasher, e também as duas obras falam sobre um assassino que possui um transtorno mental causado por traumas na infância que o leva a cometer crimes.
Outra coisa muito interessante aqui é como a câmera do Mark é usada não somente como um objeto de cena, mas quase como uma extensão da própria pisique dele. E nós, assim como ele, somos voyers nesse espetáculo de sexo e violência que é o cinema de terror.

El ejercicio que Powell muestra es difícilmente igualable, pues no es un asesina habitual el que vemos aunque parezca que sí. Tenemos a un depravado, un mirón, un asesino absolutamente loco que aprovecha todo para poder ser quien es en realidad.

Yes, the story is far from being the best part of this film, but it's the way it makes you part of the voyeur that makes it the cult movie that it eventually became.
And more than anything it reminds us how the act of watching movies is an act of voyeur, in which we see the lives of so many people through the camera. From fantasy and fiction to the worst horrors.
Peeping Tom is the story of a man who filmed his victims as they died, therefore he became the director of the last seconds of his life.
This is a film about watching and it lets you know and it makes you participate, because otherwise it wouldn't be the film that it is.
It's an incredibly well shot film that shows the mastery of Michael Powell.
It's a shame it had such a negative impact on his career.
Another one of those sad cases in which recognition comes too late.
It wasn't that monstrous classic that I had heard about, but so far of all the films I've seen in my marathon, it's the only one that has met the best of my expectations.",3.5
"Michael Powell whom along with his directing partner Eric Pressburger have been known as some of the greatest filmmakers ever to work on the medium. So why did I chose to watch A film by only one of them and one that ended Powell's career, well specifically for that reason. All I knew is that it is a slasher film. But took me by surprise was that it is from POV of a killer. This film kind of left me speechless. The direction and the staging of scenes and mise-en scene and the colours in each frame just pop. It's a disturbing character who you never really get a grasp on. You never know when he'll act and that's what makes him so unpredictable. Especially the jaw dropping scene in the film studio where Mark gets one of his victims. I was on the edge for the entirety of that scene. Honestly one of the most brilliantly directed creepy scenes I have ever seen. The film is a statement on fear and perverism. And it's interesting to watch this film now with social media and how that's made everyone into peeping toms. There is not even any violence that occurs on screen most of it is off screen. Compared to films made later it's nowhere there in terms of violence but what makes it horrifying is watching a man observe people and capture their intimate moments for himself and their fear for himself. It's definitely a dangerous film as it tries to show you the side of a killer and shows you how years of mental trauma got him to this point. But it's endlessly fascinating. It's brilliant.",4.5
"As Vivian dances around while Mark sets the “scene” to kill her, with that banging score setting the constant rhythm of the scene, I really couldn’t stop grinning... that’s some true cinematic craftsmanship right there. Not sure of what others feel about Mark in the lead role, but due to his past that is integrated into the story, I found him to be incredibly sympathetic despite these urges that possess him to do the horrendous things he does, all mainly because of Carl Boehm’s soft face and boyish demeanor mixed with his small, innocent voice.
And what a provocative movie, I’m glad this movie is getting the attention it deserves all these years after release because the initial public response was such a negative backlash that it seriously damaged the directors career for years after, due to the violent and perverse nature of it. What the movie does by silently commenting on how voyeurism itself is hypocritical to critique when we, the audience, refuse to stop watching fictional murders as we are put in the POV of the killer himself is nothing short of brilliant. It is not only a commentary on what it means to be a director, work in filmmaking and put together your own ideas, but the nature in which these actions are viewed depending on the perspective and what the audience is allowed to see and/or partake in. Where is the line drawn? What leeway are filmmakers and artists granted because of the nature of their craft? It’s impressive these questions were being asked of the general moviegoing audience by people other than just Hitchcock, as I’m aware there were many foreign directors asking the same questions with their art. Lastly, it was really just great to finally watch it after years of hearing about it and the comparisons it garners to 2 of Hitchcock’s most violent affairs, 1960’s Psycho and 1972’s Frenzy",4.0

I was skeptical of how much I would enjoy this, given my general lack of interest in psychological thrillers, slasher films, etc. I was also concerned that perhaps this would not measure up to the absolute magnificence of Powell’s collaborative efforts with Emeric Pressburger, but I was quite pleasantly surprised!

"Really, truly one of the creative high points of classic horror cinema. Credited as one of filmdom's first slasher films I'd also argue that it's among the most emotionally interesting of the films in the genre.
As screenwriter Leo Marks and director Michael Powell unpack the idea of a maniac killer, a man driven to commit violent crimes over and over again, they do a lot of honest, interesting work to bring life to that character. For what would quickly become a series of faceless, emotionless, near-demonic terrors, Mark (the film's villain) is a pretty nuanced fully realized person on screen. His history of trauma and abuse is expertly unfolded and connected to his obsession not just with capturing his crimes on camera, but also with creating fear and capturing fear. His attempts to battle his own demons feel natural and the smutty, pseudo-porn industry he's involved in feels like the perfect support system for the kind of criminal he became.
Even decades later, Peeping Tom stands out among the slasher genre as something less camp, less unkowable and much closer to finding a more meaningful message in its story than just watching a bunch of kids get chopped up.
Personal enjoyment is a 3.5/5.",4.0

"Peeping Tom is a 60s horror film following a young man who murders women, using a movie camera to film their dying expressions of terror.
1960 truly was a very daring year for Horror with classics such as Psycho, Black Sunday and Eyes Without a Face all released within that year and all of which feeling ahead of their time. Peeping Tom is no exception to said category as it feels both extremely bold for the time it was released and very ahead of it’s time. Introducing both early elements of the found footage sub genre and executed as one of the first slasher movies ever made, this British flick nails every single target it’s going for on an expert level. It’s an extremely close and intimate film that has some magnificent cinematography that helps keep things constantly feeling intrusive and claustrophobic.
The idea of this socially awkward loner, who just looks like any guy you’d pass on the street, being this obsessive stalker/serial killer is chilling because of the amount of realism it brings to the table, even from a modern sensibility. Karlheinz Böhm plays the lead role of Mark so damn well to the point that every line and action he delivers is so believable, making him all the more terrifying. He’s not your conventional horror film antagonist, he doesn’t have big and elaborate weapons, he isn’t disfigured or wearing a mask and it’s almost as if he can’t see anything wrong with what he’s doing, in turn humanising this horrific monster and making him feel far too close to home.
There’s no grizzly death scenes or buckets of gore, this film relies solely on dread, build up and atmosphere which makes it even more effective than if it was an in your face gorefest. The supporting cast all do such an incredible job alongside Böhm, with chemistry that just adds more and more to the realism. The soundtrack is fantastic and so precise in the way it’s used to capture the dark tone portrayed throughout. It’s noticeably highly influential with any scenes looking like they were pulled straight from films that have been released years after its release including the likes of Silence of the Lambs, Black Christmas and Halloween to name a few. 
Overall, Peeping Tom is a horror masterpiece that blends subtlety, dread and atmosphere to create a very disturbing and chilling ahead of its time slasher flick. The minimalism in this film just goes to show that sometimes the films that show you the least are the scariest.

"La cámara utilizada como arma asesina y la cinefilia como víctima y creadora de monstruos a la vez. Michael Powell entiende el cine y a través del mismo revela su lado más oscuro. Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) es un camárografo que en sus ratos libres filma como asesina prostitutas con su cámara y la extensión filosa de su trípode. En más de un sentido Powell nos convierte en Mark. No solo gracias al, por ese entonces, innovador punto de vista subjetivo de la cámara con el cual somos obligados a ocupar el lugar del asesino, sino también al mórbido deseo de presenciar el crimen. Ese oscuro objeto del deseo vouyerístico. Observar da placer y aún más si se trata de algo prohibido.
Las múltiples funciones o niveles de interpretación que tiene la cámara cinematográfica en manos de Powell asusta más que el peor de los asesinos. Su protagonista al filmar y editar las muertes en cierta forma ficcionaliza el crimen. Esa búsqueda del miedo a través de la imagen es puro placer para él… así como para nosotros cuando vemos un film de terror buscamos asustarnos banalizando el hecho en pos del disfrute. El miedo se desfigura al igual que las víctimas de Mark observando su propio rostro antes de morir.
Más interesante aún resulta que la némesis de Mark, la persona que lo «ve» como realmente es y que lo enfrenta es una mujer ciega que a la vez es su igual. Ambos poseen impedimientos, Mark solo logra ver realmente a través de su cámara y la impotencia sexual solo es eliminada penetrando la anatomía femenina con su arma fálica. Explorar la psiquis y ponerse en el lugar del asesino era una idea de moda en los sesenta ya que el mismo año se estrenaba Psycho de Alfred Hitchcock.
Lo que diferencia a Peeping Tom de la obra de Hitchcock es justamente la ausencia de suspenso. Sabemos quién es el asesino, conocemos sus pasos a seguir y su inevitable conclusión. La pregunta es si lo sabemos debido a una estructura narrativa que no opta por el suspenso o porque llegamos a tal punto de identificación con el cinéfilo macabro que es imposible separar ficción de realidad y conocemos nuestro final. Distorsión de la cámara… reflejo de nuestro placer.

"A wonderful precursor to the slasher genre. An awkward, emotionally scarred man devotes his life to filming, becoming the obsessive director of a murder-driven, psychosexual documentary.
Camera-as-weapon is the most immediate motif, one that threads in a self-reflexive dimension to all of the films developments. Every time we're confronted with Mark's voyeuristic habits, much of the disgust and shock is rerouted onto the spectacle of cinema itself. The violence is never isolated from the conceit of film making and so it draws attention to our own position as spectators, forcing us to ruminate on our own morals and motivations for watching violent cinema.
Seeing this highly conscious approach to violence on screen as early as 1960 provides a great beginning point for understanding the horror/slasher genre. Horror is ostensibly seen as violence-for-violence's-sake, however Peeping Tom demonstrates the much deeper concerns that lie in the employment of brutality.
The symbol of the camera holds an astonishing amount of meaning. It is fetishized by Mark throughout as he caresses it both whilst filming and whilst simply holding it. In the tormented landscape of his psychology, love and affection can only be placed onto the camera. His childhood memories of his mother have been replaced by films which lack the emotional inconsistencies which are unique to memory. Mark has the power to construct and reconstruct his experiences ad infinitum.
This detaches him from real life, feeding his obsession for the perfect representation of fear. The idea of infinite reproduction that's afforded by the camera is mapped onto the number of murders that he commits. The blurring of life and film set results in Mark murdering three women as though each murder is simply a resetting of the scene. Distinctly, the perverse voyeurism that cinema embodies floods into Mark's everyday existence, leading to him being a Peeping Tom.
The film's psychological text introduces the idea of understanding. Instead of just taking Mark's behaviour at face-value, we're encouraged to dig deeper into the social and emotional conditions that lead to his actions. This acts as an invitation for analysis, opening up the film for interpretation. Just as we unravel the impetus behind Mark's actions, we also consider the the subtext of the film itself.
The camera, the murders, the violence against women, cease to be mere points of spectacle and instead become symbols that reflect a wider meaning. The camera as a phallic substitute provokes us as viewers to consider how Powell is making a commentary on cinema as a perverse, fetishistic medium.
This is mainly just rambling, but I'm hungry...",4.0

Vaya, nunca había visto esta película y es auténticamente una obra maestra. Psicológicamente compleja y metaficticia, es elevada por la forma incómoda en que enfrenta al espectador con su propio voyeurismo. Esta cinta no pretende manejar ningún misterio, desde el principio sabemos quién es el asesino (lo cual nos hace sus cómplices). Mark Lewis es uno de los grandes psicópatas del cine, pero logra generar empatía en nosotros pues su arco es más bien trágico.

"There are a number of words that can be used to describe Peeping Tom (thrilling, disturbing, intriguing), but the most appropriate one is masterpiece. Yes, I have been a fan of this film since I first saw it and nothing has ever changed my mind about that, nor do I think it ever will. Arguably much too far ahead of its time for the cinema audiences of 1960, Peeping Tom holds up today as a fascinating study of someone affected by the constant eye of an impassive camera lens looking to catch every feeling and moment, including fear and death.
Carl Boehm (or Karlheinz Böhm to give him his proper name) plays Mark Lewis, a young man we see giving in to his deadly urges from the very start of the movie. He is compelled to film women, continue filming them while killing them, and then spending a lot of his spare time watching the movie that he has made. Things get complicated, as they tend to do, when he gets close to a young woman named Helen (Anna Massey). He doesn't want to hurt her, but can he manage to restrain himself?
Written by Leo Marks and directed by Michael Powell, celebrated during his time making movies as part of the powerhouse Powell & Pressburger duo, Peeping Tom certainly has the right people behind the camera (no pun intended) to deliver a movie that handles potentially salacious and sleazy material with just the right mix of fearlessness and finesse. The cinematography by Otto Heller and music by Brian Easdale also helps, both being wonderful additions to the film.
You do get a number of set-pieces here that start off playful and teasing, before leading to the inevitably horrific finale, but everything is underscored by the fact that we know what will be coming. We are just as voyeuristic as Mark, having chosen to watch a film which then sets out to challenge that viewing choice throughout, a wonderfully complex layer over the movie that may also have put people off back when it was first released.
Boehm is superb in the central role. He's as nervy and awkward as you'd expect, at times, especially during the moments when he tries to battle against his impulses, but always more confident, and often seeming to be on some form of auto-pilot, when he is working his camera. Massey is good in the role of Helen, perhaps a little bit too sweet and innocent (although that is exactly why she has quite an effect on Boehm's character), and Maxine Audley gives a great performance as her blind mother, her condition immediately fascinating for our main character. You also get a great little role for Moira Shearer, and Jack Watson and Nigel Davenport doing excellent work as two cops after a killer.
It's a great shame that the hostile reception to this film effectively marked the end of Michael Powell's directorial career (he has a few credits after this, with his last feature film being for the Children's Film Foundation, but nothing on the same level as this, or any of his previous pictures). There's stuff here that we've seen reworked a number of times in more recent years, with characters either attracted or repelled by the age we live in, an age in which we are constantly in front of webcams, phone cams, security cameras, and so many other lenses. Some of those films are better than others, but none of them are better than Peeping Tom.",5.0

"An astoundingly fresh and modern-feeling film about sexual repression and inflicted fear in a post-war London. Coming the same year as Psycho, it's amazing how many of the now-common tropes of the slasher and giallo genres met (what is likely) their inception in 1960.
Released in a time of Hammer Horror doing their best to revitalise the classic monsters of literature, Peeping Tom takes a contemporary setting, a humanised psychopath and bathes him in sumptuous colour. His interactions with those around him paint a quiet figure who keeps to himself, reminiscent of John Christie or Denis Nilsen. His need for voyeurism only works within the contemporary setting. The POV shots and need to relive a grisly moment is characteristically in-keeping with serial killers, as is his escalation. I can't imagine how unnerving this film must've been, viewed in a darkened theatre at the turn of the sixties.",5.0

Peeping Tom (1960) is always discussed in regards to a psychoanalytic reading about the voyeuristic gaze and comparing, while it also has to stand in the shadow of Psycho (1960) for an eternity.
But why aren't we talking about the colours in this film? So great and some truly iconic shots. Definitely need to check out more of Michael Powell.",3.5
"Hooptober 5 - It's Alive!
As we ourselves gaze on a film with beautiful women, a gorgeous colour scheme, a sympathetic killer and exciting violence, we see that voyeurism is used as the true source of horror. So where does that lead us? Aren't we the voyeurs in this situation? We're watching, waiting for the murders, we're enjoying the sensuality and the violence in near equal measure, and now we're reveling in the idea that we may be as voyeuristic as the murderer himself.
After a run including A Matter of Life or Death, Black Narcissius, and The Red Shoes, Powell breaks from Pressburger here and performs what at first glance seems like a total 180. Shifting from beauty and romance in technicolour to a violent grimy London underworld seems out of form, but in reality Powell hasn't created as seismic a shift as it seems at first. Peeping Tom is as beautiful and romantic as the eyes we view it through, and we view it through the eyes, and often the camera of Mark Lewis. Taking pleasure in watching the fear in the eyes of his sporadic murder victims through his lens, Mark is clearly a villain, but as we gaze through his eyes, we see the fear that lives in him, and the trauma that led him to where he is.
Peeping Tom features a bunch of spectacular performances. Karlheinz Bohm's Mark is a strange sort of guy, though charming enough that the women he eventually shifts in to victims want to spend time alone with him, the performance enhances this, he's creepy enough, but in the performance is mystery, and sympathy. Anna Massey's Helen is one who in particular sees the trauma in Mark's eyes, even towards the end. Massey's child-like charm bounces off of her murderous friend so effectively, as does her red hair with Powell's technicolour cinematography. A signature Powell redhead briefly returns here too in Moira Shearer, dancing around the film stage in a film reminiscent of her role in the red shoes, her red hair fitting in with the film's aesthetic smoothly, and her joy-turned fear adding to the shifting tones of Peeping Tom so naturally.
This is a film of contrasts right the way through, like a British-set Psycho shot through Norman Bates' eyes. The pace is slow but deliberate, the character set-up is brief but strong enough for us to almost understand, and begin to sympathise. As far as it being a straight-up horror, that's a difficult definition to give, as there are moments of significant violence, multiple brutal murders, but we rarely see our protagonist in danger. This is a sexy, violent, voyeuristic type of horror that was so revolutionary, yet outshined by Hitchcock less than a year later. The colour scheme and lighting is gorgeous, offsetting the griminess of the setting. And the build-up pays off to a spectacularly melodramatic ending. My Hooptober may have peaked already, and I haven't even hit my start date.",4.5

"One of the most quietly horrifying films I have ever seen. Michael Powell must have been crazy to make this movie. Peeping Tom combines it's creepy subject matter with a chilling performance by Karlheinz Böhm to make a film that sends chills down your spine for the entire runtime.
The character study of a deranged psychopath who can't control his devious actions is incredible. Although Mark can't control his natural killing habit, he is very well planned out and demonic. This is emphasized with the final scene which shows Mark-who was about to be caught by the police- kill himself the same way he has killed all of his victims. Despite this, the beginning seems to fall flat for various reasons. I feel that the psychopath plot doesn't get interesting until midway through. That was my main issue with the film. The beginning simply didn't pull me in, and the film was saved by an incredible ending.

What makes this film work in some aspects is the main character, who is impossible to stop watching. Like Taxi Driver, you see this clearly unstable man as he walks through normal everyday life. But a good plot can't save the film from dragging at times, especially in the middle. But the ending was cool enough to bring the rating up to a six.",3.0

I have always found it fascinating (as a viewer) and terrifying (as a filmmaker) how important films in cinematic history either hinder, or ruin, a director's career. Stanley Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Frank Capra, David Fincher, and many other directors' seminal works have bombed at the box office and/or gotten mixed reviews. These directors all had to regroup in some form other another, and march on. Most of the time it takes decades for these important pieces of art to be recognized for their importance.
Peeping Tom is one such film, which was so divisive that it destroyed Powell's career. Nevertheless, this film is important because of its visual aesthetic, its deliberate, careful plotting, and how it treats its main character.",4.5

Movie #10
Peeping Tom is a 1960 film by Michael Powell and is arguably the first slasher film ever made. In it, a photographer named Mark Lewis moonlights as a peeping Tom, taking racy photographs and video of women. While obsessed with making a documentary on fear, he lures women to his apartment where he films him murdering them.
This film destroyed the career of Powell and after watching it, it's easy to see why. Not because the film is bad, far from it, but it was so beyond its time and could not be appreciated for what it is. Not only is it the pioneer for slashers and British horror, it also featured a serial killer pervert as a protagonist, 4 months before Norman Bates would terrorize the silver screen.
The film is just as effective in building its creepy atmosphere and terrifyingly disassociative protagonist as it was then. It's a hugely original film that has inspired hundreds if not thousands since, and seeing where it all stemmed from is fascinating. Deeply psychological yet still physically terrifying, Peeping Tom opens with the viewer trapped in the voyeuristic mind of its deranged and deeply troubled protagonist and never lets go. It works as a psychological thriller, a slasher horror, and a meta-commentary on filmmaking and the role of an audience in cinema viewing. Peeping Tom is one of the all-time greats, a crucial staple in the history of cinema. It deserves so much more insight and retrospection than this brief speel.",4.5

"Hoop-Tober: Film #7
In 1960, two British directors released films about a socially awkward introvert, obsessed with a parent who spends his off-time from work killing women. One was called Psycho, the other was called Peeping Tom. Psycho would go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all-time, commenting the legacy of the director, Alfred Hitchcock. The latter would ruin director, Mitchell Powers' career. Funny how things work in the movie industry. While Peeping Tom is well-acted and beautifully shot, the film never matches the level of pure suspense of its film rival.",3.0

"One of the most mentally terrifying films ever made, Peeping Tom is a very overlooked film from the 1960s. Deemed to violent and gratuitous for audiences, it has since been reevaluated and is now considered a masterpiece. But it should have never been looked over. It may seem like nothing to today's standards, but I find it shocking and horrifying. The fact that Boehm's character Mark Lewis is experimented on at a young age by this father for research of fear is horrifying. But because like his father filmed his son off of fear, Mark Lewis feeds off the fear of females and kills them while filming their deaths. It's not very graphic but the reactions of the females make it more shocking. It's just a very strange but brilliant film. I just wish it did not ruin Michael Powlle's career. But thank goodness this is now deemed a classic like it should have been.",4.5

Peeping Tom is an interesting case. Rarely was I scared and rarely did I feel this sense of unease that would accompany a movie of this subject, yet I loved it because I found it fascinating.
The peeping tom in question is Mark, a serial killer who stalks his victims, weeding out the perfect subjects, then he luring them into a false sense of ease with his good looks and charm, much like Frank Zito in Maniac. When he has them he strikes, filming their reactions as they die. He keeps the films to watch. It's like some sick pornography. This is his pleasure. The look of helplessness and fear followed by death. He soaks it in and revels in his art.
Mark makes for one of the most intriguing horror villains I've ever seen. By looking through the visual documents of his everyday life we in a way look into his mind. We see the kind of person he is and why he is so twisted through film.
The best scene in the movie in my opinion is when Mark secretly films a young actress for a role in his film. She's youthful and energetic, dancing around the set as Mark sets up the lights and positions the camera. What makes it a great scene is Mark's eye for detail. He knows she has only moments to live and yet he wants it perfect. Because of his passion for directing he makes sure the lighting is just right, the angle is perfect and she is as radiant as possible. Then when he goes in for the kill it is like a director working an actor up for a scene.
To me Peeping Tom doesn't feel like a horror movie, but a psychological drama about one man's struggling with his inner demons. Once he has this beacon of light in his life he tries to steer away from his passion, but it always rears its ugly head.
And the ending perfectly sums up what Mark is all about. So wrapped up in his art that fear no longer exists. It's a dark and yet beautiful way to wrap up this story.
I'd recommend watching Peeping Tom as something more than a slasher movie, or a psychological thriller. It's none of those. It's more than that to me. It's a character study on a sick and tortured individual who has feelings unlike most horror villains. He hates who he is and yet his thirst for killing pushes him forward. And that angle isn't something seen often in horror movies. Normally the killer is far too gone to feel anguish or self loathing. But Mark is a much more three dimensional character. He feels human and is believable as both a cold-hearted killer and a sympathetic loner. A large part of that is the performance by Karlheinz Böhm, who nails down this character from the awkward body language to the eyes that show more expression than anything.
I don't really know how to end this review. I had an ending, but then I just continued to gush. Hopefully this is the end. Watch this movie.

"Film #15 in Letterboxd Season Challenge 2015-16
Was it Godard who said that cinema is men filming women? Peeping Tom boldly breaks down this idea of the male camera and its appropriation of the female body by featuring a voyeur who kills females with his camera while filming them. The metaphor could not be more clear, yet it remains graceful and powerful under Michael Powell's skilled directorial hand. Every second of the film is perfect, from the repeated first scene (in which we see the violence first from the terrifying perspective of the killer and second from the terrifyingly reserved perspective of the voyeur) to the excellently constructed final moments. Peeping Tom is essentially an essay film on cinema and how we watch it. It is more of a summation of cinema than a satire, though there is surely the bitter idea that not everything is right in the male gender's possession of the camera and the female gender's victimization in front of it. It might take another viewing to fully understand the film's genius, though the reams of pages written about Peeping Tom do a great job in elucidating much of it. This film explores the nature of watching in a way that places the watcher in both an active and a passive role, implicating us as criminals in the act of voyeurism while proving that the effects of watching can be harmful for us as well. It was original for its time, and it is certainly relevant now; Peeping Tom is one of the greatest films ever made.",5.0
"Powell and Pressberger were famous British directors from the 1950's. They were behind the camera for films like The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus (Movie #22). For this film Powell set out on his own and he paid the price for independence. The film was considered to be near filth based on it's subject matter and Powell was basically blacklisted for it.
The film centers around a man who is obsessed with his movie camera. He is also a bit of a voyeur. And to make the perfect trio he is driven by a compulsion to capture the ultimate fear on woman's faces on his camera. He does this by filming them as he murders them. We find out through the course of the film that Mark's father was a biologist and he conducted some bizarre and disgusting experiments on Mark as a young boy. Clearly this is a delicate web to weave for a film maker. Peeping Tom contains not a drop of blood, nor does it have any nudity. But it feel like one of the more graphically violent films in recent memory.
Moria Shearer plays Vivian. The lovely woman downstairs with the blind mother. Marks falls in love with Vivian and he has to protect her. Even from himself. His mother is safe from Marks attacks because she can not see what is coming from her, her face shows no fear.
This film is an ode to snuff films in a way and I think that is why this film was banned and ruined Powell's carrer. It is not what is shown, but what is suggested. I can see where audiences of the late 50's would think that only a sick man could make a film as perverse as this one. One film fan felt differently though. Martin Scorsese saw this film when it opened and fell in love with it. Now he is one of the major reasons that the film is getting the re-release and praise it deserves. You can see it's influence in Scorsese's work. Taxi Driver in particular.",3.5

""Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight.""
Rear Window meets Psycho in this career ending film by Michael Powell. Peeping Tom was trashed by critics upon release, with one critic describing it as more nauseating than leper colonies in Pakistan. It was banned in Finland for 20 years. However as is so often the way, (in this case due to Martin Scorsese, who financed its redistribution) this film gained a cult following and has come back into fashion.
It's the story of Mark Lewis, a serial killer whose point of difference is that when he kills his victims he films their terror. As such there are lots of what are essentially point of view shots, as Lewis looks through the camera. Unlike Maniac however, this is not a gimmick, but used to make a point. The plot is thrilling, with a love interest who we hope might cure Lewis of his insanity, but who doesn't know quite what she is dealing with. In a sense, she represents the innocence of society - we don't know who are the sociopaths and psychopaths walking amongst us. The reason the film is so disturbing is that Lewis is us. Cinema is by definition voyeurism, and the success and failures of so many films depends upon the extent to which they manage the pleasure and self-loathing that comes with that. Powell doesn't try to play this balancing act - Peeping Tom is the film maker holding a mirror up to the camera and asking us how different we are from Lewis as we peep into peoples lives. If anything, Lewis might be better than us, as at least he knows and admits he is a peeping tom...
Two word review: Violent voyeurism",5.0
A truly riveting and unsettling film from Michael Powell that explores the world of voyeurism through a young filmmaker who kills women for his own sick pleasure through a camera.,0.0
"Michael Powell's (sans Emeric Pressburger) slasher released in the same year as Hitchcock's Psycho, follows Mark (Karlheinz Böhm) a voyeuristic chap who films his victims as he kills them. Panned by critics upon its release, it pretty much ruined the career of one of Britain's most talented directors. It wasn't until maybe 10 or more years after when, with assistance from Scorsese, it became an influential cult classic.
Whilst the context and importance of Peeping Tom should not be understated, it's not really that good. Yes the inventiveness of it is admirable, with some very unique/original POV camera shots. The fact you as a viewer are forced into an uncomfortable situation where you become the killer, or are at least given this behind the lens look at the motivations of a killer (or even a director) is genius and so revolutionary. However, the script has more than its fair share of dubious dialogue and there's some ropey acting taking place here.
That said, Böhm is actually fine. His tortured, twitching, tormented demeanour is perfect for this character. The link to his fathers psychological experiments on him combined with his obsession with the camera provide a metaphorical comparison to cinema and its relationship to the audience. The more we demand, the more we experiment, the darker it will become and it's up to us to deal with the consequences of our actions. It's all very clever indeed and I understand it (I think I understand it anyway) but it's just a shame I didn't really enjoy it that much.
I can certainly see why it was so controversial back in 1960. It's possible it was made a decade too soon. By the same token, without radical films like this being made when they are made, the genre might not have even gotten started at all so maybe it came at the perfect time. Maybe that's what gave it such poignancy. Either way, it was worth a watch and clear why it has garnered the reputation it has earned.",3.0
"""I'd like to understand what I'm shown.""
Most importantly (?): Karlheinz Böhm's performance is orders of magnitude more compelling and terrifying than (almost) anything in that other 1960 proto-slasher--but nothing here aims for the sort of dislocating blackout terror of, say, this.
Instead: a lurid feast of dreadful images, dread that comes from inevitability, inevitability that forms around a man's strikingly coherent narrative for his own neurosis, and the documentary he eventually completes with the skeleton of that narrative.

Peeping Tom is one of the scariest movies I have seen. How a seemingly innocent person with a peak urge to capture the perfect shot becomes a pathetic and cold serial killer, you got to watch to believe it.
Karlheinz Bohm with those still, wide eyes was very good as Michael (Mark) Lewis. Voyeurism is often seen as creepy, but it can give birth to a murderer. The murder weapon is unique, almost as unique as the subject of this film, a tripod stand.

"the worst questions to ask are those you believe you can answer, and PEEPING TOM suffers of attempting to resolve the question of fear that Hitchcock's PSYCHO more famously and successfully posed two years before this ones release: how can we create fear, and whats the pleasure in watching the faces of those around us change into horror? The most annoying trends of pseudo Freudian interest here, trying to explain away a person's criminality through the failings of the father and absence of the mother, a deterministic trend of through that fucks up the most disadvantaged communities and solidifies power in the people who are furthest away from need, and therefore perceived criminality.
Although it has a masterful use of music and color, the protagonist is a dull experiment in reproducing allegedly creepy manhood, instead unconvincingly performing softness and patheticness. The movie doesn't for a second scare you, just attempts to titillate with the idea of something scary. what's the most frightening thing? it asks, ""fear!"" it clumsily responds (without a beat of dramatic tension), and proceeds to show us nothing that causes fear other than the indication that other people are scared.
The love for film and the fears of the building of a not-quite-human-body make this film genuinely masterful visually. For that, I give it three stars. Everything else about it is frankly, and unfortunately, a little embarrassing.",3.0

EDIT: Here’s my review!!!

Peeping Tom: Voyeurism in the Age of Information

Note: These are my immediate first impressions and my thoughts so excuse the scrambled nature. I’ll have to take more time to write a coherent essay.





It’s a good feeling seeing a film in a theatre. Even better when it’s a packed theatre. You can hear the small chit chat before the film starts. The opening of Cracker Jack boxes, the snap\crack of a can of pop opening. The sounds of the theatre. Although it was rather odd to see a theatre so packed when the title of the picture you’re all seeing is called Peeping Tom. 



From the very first shot of the film, I can already sus out what the directors wants to do to us. He wants us to make uncomfortable. To make us complicit in the act of voyeurism, in the act of peeping. It’s a shame then that such commentary may fall deaf on modern ears.

Before I dive deep into what I mean by th first paragraph let me first state that I loved this film and thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ll state what I loved about it and the few gripes I had.



What I loved: 

The cinematography is immaculate. Whether it be the POV shots of the 16mm camera Mark carries around with him, or the low key, high contrast lighting used for the his private theatre to create stellar drama, the cinematography was easily a point for me. I especially loved the film studio murder. Especially how the scenes begins with the victim shrouded in darkness and one by one the lights start to come on. Very dramatic. I also loved how Mark essentially blocked his murder like a director blocks a scene. As I mentioned before the opening scene is probably one of the best opening scenes of a film that I’ve seen before. The scenes in Mark’s private theatre are pure kino on account the lighting that shrouds Mark in darkness. In that darkness he experiences emotions that can only be truly felt in there. Just like at a movie theatre. As for the music, the use of the piano was lovely as I grew up playing piano (can’t play for shit anymore) It was very dramatic and was used in various obvious ways but nevertheless I loved it.



My only gripe: 

This film has some of the most over the top acting I’ve seen in awhile. It was too the point that the audience spent a lot of the time laughing which odd considering the film’s subject matter. Which leads me to my explanation of my 2nd paragraph. 

There were various scenes where the audience was laughing that I knew just wasn’t the reaction Michael Powell intended. In fact the reaction he probably wanted was the same the reaction that unfortunately wound up hurting his career in British Cinema. By can you blame the audience for laughing? In today’s social media run landscape, not only is voyeurism common, but it’s used as a means to make money. Think of twitch and vlogging. People pay money to watch people go about their daily lives. It should be sick but it’s so common that no one really bats an eye to it. Cruising through someone’s IG page is normal. Having your phone out and recording stuff in public is normal (it can even be helpful especially when it comes to bringing cops to justice). As I left the theatre I wondered what Michael Powell would think of today’s generation of peepers. Would he be shocked or did he know that this was inevitable from the get go? Maybe that’s part of the reason he got shunned and banned in Britain. He tapped into something the audience at the time wasn’t ready to admit. That we as a society love watching. We love peeping. I’ll end this review\ novice essay with a quote from one of my fav filmmakers.

"""Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? Fear.""

Peeping Tom explores the desire to document life and human emotion - specifically fear - on film. There are layers upon layers of voyeurism at play: Mark filming his subjects, Helen watching Mark's films, Mark watching Helen's reaction to his films, the cop watching Mark, Mark filming the cop watching him, the filmmaker filming the movie, us (the audience) watching the movie. I think there is a lot to unpack here about the desire to make films and the desire to watch films. Is having Mark turn the camera on himself at the end symbolic of the director turning the camera on himself and on us? Is there some significance behind the blind mother being the person who clearly ""sees"" the danger in Mark's hobby?
I found it interesting that this came out in the same year as Psycho, as there are some key similarities, including the fact that both films feature a psychopath offering their guests milk.",3.0

"Powell movies are always gorgeous and so ahead of their times. Peeping Tom is no different, although ironically how different it was at its release was enough to tarnish Powell's career. Peeping Tom is a great psychological horror film as you are forced to see the perspective of the killer, forced to be uncomfortable and terrified alongside his victims. What makes it unique though is how almost sympathetic the main protagonist is portrayed as. He's reserved and awkard, but he seems to treat the people he interacts with care and respect. We learn later that he was experimented on as a child and he seems to truly love Helen. One would think being a murderer would eclipse any positive aspects of a character, yet one feels a bit of pity and sympathy for our protagonist Mark. He's a victim of his father and a victim of scopophilia. Truly a revolutionary concept for 1960.
There is so much to praise for this film. I would need an entire essay on the meta-commentary on movie watching and making, but that is for another day. Instead I will praise the gorgeous sets and color of the film, the phenomenal perfomance by Carl Boehm, the enchanting shots from the perspective of the handheld camera, the qualties worth shouting out are limitless. It's so hard for me to give a five star rating to a movie so unsettling, but it truly is an extraordinary movie. Tentative 4.5 as I continue to process what I've seen.",4.5

"Um dos filmes favoritos de Martin Scorsese, Lançado, em 1960, “A Tortura do Medo” causou um escândalo que destruiu a carreira do diretor Michael Powell. Os protestos da crítica e do público fizeram com que o filme fosse retirado de cartaz após 5 dias de seu lançamento apenas. Não só isso, mas acabou que Michael Powell se tornou um concorrente de Alfred Hitchcock em 1960.
Lançados no mesmo ano, ambas as produções foram tidas como reveladoras de traumas da época ( Psicose e Tortura do Medo ). O problema é que Powell não tankou, sem a mesma experiência que Hitchcock para lidar com a crítica e suas percussão no sucesso ou fracasso de um filme.
Mark Lewis é um personagem traumatizado por conta de experiências realizadas quando criança, da mente instável de seu pai. Lewis, em seu terrivel passado, foi laboratório para um estudo sobre a resistência das pessoas diante de seus medos e por isso, tornou-se um assassino que utiliza sua câmera como arma para o crime. Ele vive uma existência pacata, mas discreta. Um indivíduo acima de qualquer suspeita, mas que esconde a sua personalidade assassina. Ao se posicionar para filmar a pessoa que sequer espera ser aniquilada, ele capta a expressão de horror estampada no rosto das pessoas. Embora suas atitudes sejam terríveis, ele se torna um personagem muito bem escrito e desenvolvido na história toda.
A trama nos leva por esse mundo de mortes ( e claro sem quase mostrar sangue e cenas que sejam realmente muito pesadas) e fetiche pela imagem através da direção de fotografia eficiente, sempre bem acompanhada da condução musical. É uma linguagem muito boa, onde entregam um filme com atmosfera muito bem realizada, repleta de detalhes alegóricos e também aborda muito bem o Voyeurismo.
Como curiosidade, em Pânico 4, perto do desfecho, o assassino faz algumas perguntas ao telefone e uma delas é sobre o primeiro filme de assassino em série. A personagem responde Psicose, mas Ghostface retruca e diz que não, pois antes, Michael Powell havia lançado o primeiro filme do tema com os assassinatos sob o ponto de vista do assassino.
Tratado como revoltante e repugnante, o filme teve dificuldades para ser lançado. Powell, guiado pelo roteiro e história original de Leo Marks, tornou imagem as ideias do roteirista, num filme com reconhecimento que teria futuramente. Tendo experimentado várias funções no processo de realização de um filme, Powell teria um destino menos trágico se não tivesse se importado com as avaliações de Peeping Tom.",4.0

Season 8: Week 7
Recommend by: Claire
The craftsmanship behind Peeping Tom is commendable. Director Michael Powell delves into the psyche of the protagonist, using the camera as a tool that mirrors his disturbed perspective. The result is an immersive experience that forces viewers to confront the unsettling nature of voyeurism and the blurred boundaries between filmmaker and audience. One of the film's notable achievements is its handling of horror without resorting to explicit visuals. The implication and suggestion employed create a more profound impact, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. This subtle approach enhances the psychological horror, making it more enduring and thought-provoking. In the realm of psychological horror, this is a landmark film that merits attention and acclaim. Its unique narrative approach, coupled with superb direction and a captivating performance, ensures its lasting impact.",4.0
"What a strange coincidence that this was the next film I wanted to watch after... Frenzy. Anyways- surprisingly anxiety inducing and gruesome despite the fact that it doesn't really show any of the murders- the tension building up to them is more than enough. There were times where I couldn't help things were going too slow, but some of the slow moments do help provide more details and end up being of importance from the climax onwards. Overall, disturbing, strangely informative, obsessively colourful. Was great enough to perhaps end up as a Halloween rewatch.",4.5

Psychological creepfest as lurid as it is beautiful. Fascinating to watch Michael Powell apply his style to something so sleazy and (at least for the period) transgressive.

"The infamous Micheal Powell career killer known as Peeping Tom was revered at the time of its release due to its controversial nature. Only one month after this film was released, Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho would hit the big screen and become a mega success. I’ve always been struck with curiosity regarding this film, it pretty much ended Michael Powell’s career for depicting controversial themes, but I feel that Powell made a brilliant film. Boasted by an incredible lead performance and score, Peeping Tom is a horrific tale about a filmmaker who films his victims faces before death. This film doesn’t rely on graphic violence or anything If the sort, in fact I’m pretty sure only one scene in this entire movie has blood in it and it’s kind of hard to notice. This film uses beautiful imagery and long takes to create an aura of suspense that is so hard to capture. You feel frightened for every character, even Mark Lewis. Speaking of Mark, he is one of the most complex and interesting characters I’ve seen in a film during this time. He is an absolutely awful person, who gets such gratification off of seeing women’s final moments. But yet you feel for him, learning his backstory and seeing how he himself is a victim. I think if not for Karlheinz Böhm this character would’ve been much less interesting. Böhm is able to capture this character through his incredible performance. The pure confidence of Lewis when he is about to perform one of his crimes as opposed to his usual nervous self is such a fantastic way to juxtapose his character, and Böhm knocked it out of the park. Peeping Tom is a great watch if you’re at all interested in films based around crime or character studies. Even on its own merit it’s a wonderfully executed film that I’m so glad I’ve finally seen, definitely seek this out if you haven’t yet.",4.5
"While this film actually had a fair bit going for it, it also had a fair bit going against it as well. It was definitely stylishly and innovatively shot especially for the time. The story is quite interesting, we have a weirdo who was raised by weirdos who likes to take pictures of people's fear (as he's about to kill them). It becomes a bit more involved when he sort of stars a relationship with the neighbor, and well it's a little more difficult than anticipated. The murders are actually pretty well done and bloody for the time and everything, it's quite a bit shocking but the big issue is all the dead dialogue time. The film should be about a half hour shorter because it's exciting, then it drags and the pattern repeats until the film finishes. I certainly see why it's achieved classic status but it's pretty sad when you wish you had the cut version. Still worthwhile, I just wish it had a little tweaking I suppose.",4.5
"🧛 Hooptober X ... The Unknown - Part 4 🐺
Often described as a proto-slasher, Peeping Tom also functions as a metatextual commentary on the slasher genre, despite the fact that the genre didn't even properly exist yet.

"This movie is incredible. It was my first time watching it since I purchased it on blu-ray and, damn, it is so colourful. The scenes with Helen and Mark up in his room when he's first showing her some films almost had me drooling over all those gorgeous colours! And there's one scene of Moira Shearer in the dressing room, after the lights are turned off, that is so crisp and beautifully lit, I was gobsmacked. I remembered it being beautiful, but I'd forgotten just how visually stunning it is!
(And, after watching a bunch of flatly filmed movies this year, it's so nice to go back to something so beautifully shot)
Karlheinz Böhm, aside from being very handsome, plays Mark so well. His performance is both unsettling and weirdly moving. He truly makes me feel for Mark, while I'm simultaneously repulsed by him! The ending made me cry this time
This movie is so twisted and disturbing and absolutely brilliant.
(Despite my glowing words, I'm still debating on whether this is an all time favourite. Of the 1960s? Yes! Of horror? Undoubtedly? But all time? I really can't decide. And such an important decision to make too lol I'm leaving it for now because I can't even make simple decisions at the moment XD)

"Time to revisit an old classic. A movie so reviled at the time that it efefctively broke the director's UK career.
And for what? If anything, it now holds up as a very well crafted psychological thriller. One could even see a prototype for what later became Maniac.
As the movie progresses, we get deeper into Mark's disturbed psyche and how he became the man he is in this story. The product from all the experiments his father put him through. A killer who executes his victims with a camera while filming them in their utterly terrified last moments. Making not only for what can be considered as a precursor to what later became found footage, but also for some very disturbing scenes.
Not in the least in the scenes with Helen, where we see how he still has a small connection with reality. Or how he takes his own life in the end. Since he feels he has nowhere else to run, he ends it all. In the only way he knows how.
Great horror. Four stars.",4.0

"Hearing a discussion on the harm of having your child constantly recorded and a severe lack of privacy have aged like fine wine. Psycho is a great film on its own right, and led to the slasher age, Peeping Tom also set the stage for films like Maniac, Christmas Evil, and Don’t Go in the House that explored the psyche of the killer, but without making excuses for their actions, but Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) is easily the most sympathetic of the bunch. There’s these moments of normalcy that twinkle in his eyes, but always seems to be dissolving away as quick as it shows it’s head. There’s no doubt he’s a product of nurture in the debate of birth and made, because he was ultimately so close to being just a charming, intelligent man. Thanks to the excellent photography by Michael Powell, the audience is treated to the beauty within the horror to have a glimpse at seeing what Mark sees, even if we only get a peep into his soul.",5.0

"Peeping Tom es de esas pelis que salen en cuanta lista respetable de serial killers que hay, y pues tal vez el poster tan clásico y la sensación de que es como la respuesta inglesa a Psycho del mismo año o lo que sea, la verdad es que la postpuse por tanto tiempo que tuve que meterla en la lista de watchlist más pequeña que tengo para poder sacarla algún día.
Es una combinación muy inusual de technicolor clásico de finales de la era dorada de hollywood, que todos los tonos educados de actuación de la época, pero es sumamente sucia y perversa... la manera en la que contrasta la trama con cómo se ve, de momentos es como si dos cosas que NUNCA se han combinado están combinándose de una manera muy satisfactoria vistualmente y solo están ahí funcionando un pichazo. Al ser Inglesa tiene esa libertad que USA no tenía para mostrar cosas, y a pesar de que la peli nunca es ""explotativa o vulgar"" definitivamente se codea con clásicos explotativos de la época.
El personaje principal de Mark, es un enigma durante toda la película, él solamente es una persona diferente para cada momento para cada interacción, sin embargo, nos deja ver que oculta algo que se escabulle detrás de sus mil caras, algo que sabemos que está haciendo, pero que realmente nunca vemos, él es un cineasta independiente atrapado en un mundo de cine corporativo, no para de grabar y está obsesionado con documentar. La película nos hace creer por mucho rato que está documentando su perversión, pero lo que parece ser su perversión realmente es el vehículo de algo más turbio que está detrás de las apariencias y realmente la trama de la película y su construcción lo plantean muy bien. Definitivamente la película es adelantada a su tiempo, pero más allá de eso es bastante efectiva en atraparnos en la metanarración de director dentro de una pelicula dirigida por un director. Siento que incluso para ser una peli sesentera, no se siente caricaturesca o ridícula, sino que siempre es de buen gusto.
En fin, por algo está en tantas listas, y la gente la mama tanto. Sólido early take del género de asesinos seriales con enfoque psicológico. No decepciona.",5.0
"Peeping Tom, the underseen progenitor of the slasher and British cousin of Psycho, deserves to be uttered in the same breath as all the classics. A tragic character study, propelled by Böhm’s simultaneously frightening and charming lead performance, Peeping Tom has more in common with Hitchcock and crime thrillers than any slasher or exploitation flick.
My favorite sequence is Viv on the film set, because every movie should have some kind of dance routine or musical number, but the script is full of great moments that are equally well-written and well-executed. Peeping Tom is definitely slow-paced and less shocking by modern standards, but when the whole package is so well-crafted, it deserves to be seen and praised.",4.5

"I’ve seen the idea of the “camera as a voyeur” applied to several films, but never before has that concept felt so ingrained and crucial to a film’s DNA than in Peeping Tom. For Mark, the camera lens is both a barrier detaching him from human connection and emotion, and it’s also the only way he can see people with a sense of identification and clarity. His films feel more tangible and alive to him than the world and people it captures, they’re something which lasts; he needs to see the film of his victims’ last moments to feel something, the actual act doesn’t hold weight to him. He can’t hold a job which doesn’t involve filming or photographing something or someone, they’re his ultimate connection to humanity. Ever since his childhood he’s been conditioned to associate his emotions with the camera, and he can’t reconcile that when he forms a connection with Helen and doesn’t want to see her filmed. Even his death must be captured on film, it won’t be permanent otherwise. Mark is like a stand-in for the audience and filmmakers, those who similarly seek to see a portrait of a private life. He is a character who makes us see our own face of death, a twisted reflection, who blurs the line of disconnection between reality and the camera which immortalizes it. There’s a cutting sense of irony regarding how despite Mark needing to see everything captured on film, the murders are all seen offscreen, we aren’t allowed to feel the closure that Mark does. While that’s most likely a result of film regulations and censors at this time, it nonetheless serves the way this film implicates its audience in what it portrays.",4.5

A very interesting and altogether Hitchcockian film, Peeping Tom was released two short months prior to Hitchcock's Psycho and yet the films share a few striking similarities. As I'm a big fan of Hitchcock, I enjoyed my first Powell film very much. More than I expected to, even.

the concept was great but could be outdated, the performance's fantastic too but it's the visuals and cinematography the ones i was enthralled by it and i can recognize Michael Powell's work because of it. i am pleased i brought this on a wonderful 60th-anniversary edition blu-ray a while ago with such fantastic high-quality so you can see the grains embedded into the film, definitely will rewatch this anytime next time.",4.5

"Art sleaze on full tilt. The most perverse intersection of the film gaze and psychological damage. You can almost see Brian De Palma's entire essence being birthed here... It's funny because many of his ideas revolve around using the camera as a weapon, and of course that is also true in this movie, but let's just say that when a camera is revealed as an *actual* physical weapon, I was on the floor.
In many ways it predicts so many of the (still current) studies of murderous calculating men, but it's also far more than that; filmmaking exists as both an evil deed and a mission towards higher purpose. There's something particularly devious about the movie cackling at its own nastiness, all the stuff with the film crew is basically taken from a screwball comedy. In that way it's something truly unhinged.",4.5
"The film that inspired generations of filmmakers, that even reached to be compared with one of Hitchcock's mssterpieces, that and many more things are what Peeping Tom is.
We are introduced without seeing our main character, the camera takes his perspective and then the camera takes the camera in the protagonist's hands' perspective, and gets us in a deeply disturbing film, for the realism it was made with. It uses the theme of obsession as a motor but despite being considered a horror slasher, murder takes a very little time out of the film's total runtime and works to boost the main topics of the film, obession as I mentioned before, and then also a peeping tom, with traumas from his past causing his disease.
The film combines the unconventional camera angles with the dirty enviroments and the characteristic color of films at the time to create an eerie ambiance when the protagonist's camera starts rolling.
Karlheinz Böhm gives one of the best perfomances I've ever seen taking the role of the titular Peeping Tom and the rest of the cast works around him, all this alongside outstanding direction made this film one of my favorites of all time.
100/100",5.0
"The unsung hero of horror movies. Alongside Psycho they both remain as some of the most highly influential horror genre pictures. While Psycho went on to be classic and remembered for decades to come, Peeping Tom faded more into obscurity. This isn’t some sort of hidden gem, but the average person is way more likely to have heard of Norman Bates instead of Mark Lewis.
This isn’t really scary as it is suspenseful. You’ll be mainly watching this for the interesting ideas it presents instead of the thrills anyways. The themes of voyeurism, psychoanalysis, child-abuse, and the filmmaking process are all combined to create a creepy and controversial portrait of a crazed killer. Because of those themes of voyeurism, Peeping Tom
actually remains relevant today due to social media. 
This is the  second time I learn about my boy Laurence Harvey being cucked out of a good role. Karlheimz Böhm does make me happy that the under-appreciated Manchurian Candidate star didn’t get this role. Like Anthony Perkins, they have small minute details that make them so interesting to watch. The creepy gazes they have, or the constant stuttering comes to mind. The anti-social tendencies both characters have and that strong feeling of shame are both characteristics they share. I love that he character of Mark Lewis is an aspiring filmmaker, just that his projects are snuff films. His drive to create the perfect shot of someone being frightened. I love how we are shown his backstory through one of the movies he has. The silent movies his father made explains, but leaves enough ambiguity to explain why Mark is insane.  This is how you make good a serial killer in a movie. 
These kinds of movies where the killer is the protagonist always have a sense of fatalism. The ones that bring alongside love interest always feel tragic. You genuinely want them to be fixed, but it’s naive to think such a thing would ever happen. That trope has been done several times already, but it probably originates here. 
This movie is very stylized with its great usage of color, especially the greens and reds. This is coming from the same guy who made The Red Shoes, so it isn’t really surprising. An underrated aspect is the music. It sounds like an orchestral score from a silent horror movie. It’s very fitting for the scene in which Mark watches his snuff movies which happen to lack sound. 
Powell’s career went into the gutter after this was released. It was probably largely in part to the moral ambiguity faced in the end. I loved it because it feels more realistic as to how a normal person would react emotionally in that situation.  This is my first Powell movie, but I already love his style. He had another 30 years left in his life so it’s a shame no one wanted to help him make movies anymore after this. 
People like De Palma would be working at a McDonalds if it were not for Peeping Tom. In some ways I feel like this may have had more influence than Psycho. It has more in common with slashers. At least the ones where the killer is the protagonist.  It’s the kind of movie that’s an essential viewing for people who want to learn how to make movies. Also this is technically the first slasher because it was released 3 months before Psycho fuck you alfred hitchcock.",4.5

"""The British Psycho"" some have called it- although this film beat Psycho to the theater by a couple weeks, but that's besides the point. The fact that this film even exists is a blessing as not only was it made by master director Michael Powell (The Red Shoes, Age of Consent) - some say it was the film that brought his prestigious career to a screeching halt after it was torn apart by critics and the conservative groups of the day.
The story focuses around MARK (Karlheinz Bohm) - a timid and quiet young man who works as a focus puller on film sets and also moonlights as an exotic photographer. He lives on the top floor of his fathers old house and rents out the rest of the house to tenants - including a young woman named Helen (Anna Massey) who lives there with her mother. Anna begins to take to Mark, who is surprised and confused by this as he has never had a true connection with any human other than his father, especially of the female sex. The reason this becomes a distraction for him is because Mark you see is a serial killer who uses the sharpened blade at the end of his camera tripod to kill young and promiscuous women - all the while filming them. Will Mark be able to put his baser instincts aside to pursue a future with Helen, or will his little pet project draw the attention of the law- forcing him to make a fatal decision?
The photography of this film is incredible- typical of Powell- rich with color and oozing with style. Censors of the day had a field day chopping out scenes of violence and one of the first shots of full frontal nudity in a mainstream picture. The film was essentially buried and banned in some countries - but has been hailed by filmmakers such as DePalma, Scorsese and Coppola as a major influence to their work. This is a must see for any fan of classic thrillers and masterful cinematography.",4.0
"What makes a great film great?
It holds up with time.
Before Halloween, Friday the 13th, Black Christmas, The last House on the Left and countless other horror movies... there is this one.
It's not scary but tense & creepy which lasts longer than just cheap scares.
What's interesting about this is how many deep questions it asks without being direct about them.
It's subtle and well paced to creep under your ""skin"" . The cinematography... beautiful. The set designs are gorgeous... you can tell this is the same director as the Red Shoes masterpiece.",5.0

"Decent.
The whole ‘first slasher’ reputation this has is what intrigued me but personally I wasn’t a huge fan of this. It was good but kind of a let down at the same time. It was well filmed and looked gorgeous but felt a little unfocused at times. I just didn’t find the character of Mark to be that interesting either. The acting was good but I don’t know I just didn’t love the movie. I love what this film did for the genre, essentially giving birth to my favourite subgenre of cinema, but just taking it as face value, it could have been a bit better. It does have some nice ideas though and it’s definitely a good movie. I liked the twisted nature of the tripod kills and the symbolism of that and everything, and it handled the violence very tastefully, you really don’t see anything. I get that was still more than what people were used to at the time but I still can’t see how anyone could have called this exploitative or anything.
Overall, Peeping Tom is a good movie and I’d say it’s slightly underrated but I just didn’t love it.

"If you haven't heard of this one, it's sort of the ""Spree"" of its day. Powell unfurls his pageantry inside the helpless mind of a horny little murderer, without downplaying the passion to account for good taste -- an understandable career killer. The most compassionate exploration of violence, because, obviously, it's actually a self-portrait. Sensuous, but there aren't a lot of places to go in an abyss and the film quickly curdles academic and dull.",2.5
"-ive felt frustrated with how many movies about scopophilia have this very literal 1:1 understanding of the proclivity—someone is watching someone. peeping tom depicts the ways voyeurism is often about being seen. or seeing someone be seen. it’s about seeing yourself watching someone. or watching yourself.

"I have been meaning to watch Peeping Tom for a long time now and was so grateful to have it assigned as homework for the podcast. I was blown away - I honestly had no idea what this movie was really about, I just knew that it was a classic and that I would need to watch it at some point to hold onto my horror card.
Because I had no expectations, the experience of this watch was completely engrossing for me and so surprising in the greatest way. I found this movie to be so interesting, so unique and groundbreaking, so original - all of the greatest attributes for me. What's especially great is that it's an older movie that still totally stands alone, even though it has inspired and influenced a lot of other films.
The killer is complex and empathetic but still totally nuts and has quite a kill count under his belt (we can only assume it's even more extensive than what we're privy too). The supporting characters are perfect at challenging our main character/killer and helping him to grow and develop. I love that the main character is the killer and this lends to us feeling a certain amount of empathy for him even though he's a murderer.
Aesthetically this movie is BRILLIANT! Great loud colors/palette, amazing set pieces, great direction (even musical-esque scenes); the art direction is only second to the greatest thing about this movie, which is the concept/story.
For me the only downfall was the ending, which was such a bummer! And the ending on paper is great, it's just not executed to the caliber of the rest of the movie leading up to it. Had the ending been better, this score would have been at least half a point higher for me.

"31 Days of Halloween - #6 - 1960
damn okay... well this was much more unsettling than i was expecting, the main character mike played by karlheinz böhm is delightfully creepy as a camera operator with a bloodlust and some fuckin issues that he needs to work out. this movie is super slick, loved the direction and the acting. i honestly think this is much more of a horror than it gets credit for, it gets spoken about a lot as an early inspiration for the slasher genre, but outside of that i see this labeled primarily as a thriller or drama, whereas there are so many scenes with terrifying set ups and payoffs and some really creepy and malicious kills, this felt like a straight up horror movie to me.
this would make a great double feature with psycho which i see it brought up next to often anyways. both would inspire the slasher genre and horror filmmaking as a whole, and both feature deranged killers with some uh... parental issues to say the least.",4.0

"Puestos a imaginar, uno puede espiar por la cabina de proyección de cierto cine londinense donde se estrenaba, un día de abril de 1960, ""El fotógrafo del pánico"". Desde esta privilegiada posición, a modo de panóptico foucaultiano, descubrimos a lo largo del patio de butacas un bosque de cabezas, las miradas ocultas, caras vueltas a nuestro deseo de vislumbrar la expresión de esos rostros, mientras en la pantalla se desarrolla la primera de las escenas del film: el asesinato de una prostituta desde el punto de vista del criminal.
Antes de que este momento climático se materialice en nuestra sala de cine, adivinamos un destello casi imperceptible en la parte baja de la esquina derecha de la gran pantalla. Lo percibimos también por que la larga cortina vertical, que había servido de gran telón, se ha movido sutilmente. El destello pertenece a la lente de una pequeña cámara cinematográfica portátil, tras la cual se encuentra un hombre de calvicie incipiente y bigotito en forma de sonrisa triste. Es Michael Powell, el director de la cinta que estamos proyectando.
Ni más ni menos.
Justo cuando intuimos, por los desasosegantes sonidos emitidos por los espectadores, y por las imágenes que percibimos en la gran pantalla, que el cruel asesinato se va a cometer ante nuestra deliciosa incapacidad como voyeures —un erotismo de muerte, en este caso, o la muerte como acto erótico—, justo en ese momento, justo entonces, sabemos sin ningún género de dudas que allí abajo, tras las oscuras bambalinas, Mr. Powell ha activado el motor de su cámara de cine y está rodando la expresión de terror dibujada en el rostro de sus espectadores: la verdadera película, el auténtico ""El fotógrafo del pánico"",
El cine como esa muerte eterna, donde todo aquél que sale ahí, delante de una cámara, en una película, vivirá más allá de su muerte física.
La vida (y su inevitable asesinato a manos del tiempo) como ese film del que somos protagonistas principales.
El miedo, por tanto, a la vida.
Un cuadro de deslumbrante estética pop, una paleta de energía cromática, que esconde, a poco que raspemos a lo largo de la superficie, un poso hediondo y sucio.
Un palimpsesto donde intuimos los renglones torcidos de la empatía y lo deshumanizante.
Una morbosa terapia psicológica para adentrarse en el amor mal comprendido en alas de la ciencia y en como éste, el amor, otro tipo de amor, puede sanarnos.
En definitiva, ""El fotógrafo del pánico"": una obra maestra del suspense y el terror. ¿Puede haber algo más horrible?",4.5

"Confesso que sempre que me deparava com o subtítulo de peeping tom, um profundo sentimento de curiosidade me era despertado.
Afinal, o mero questionamento da possibilidade de a arma utilizada pelo psicopata durante a trama ser a mais diabólica de todas, já nos provoca um sentimento de profunda inquietação. Pois, afinal, o que esse questionamento representa?
Em uma leitura primeira, poderíamos acreditar que o pretenso caráter diabólico da arma, seria fruto do alto potencial destrutivo que ela venha possuir.
Contudo, ao mergulhar na experiência de peeping tom, fui supreendentemente exposto a uma resposta completamente diferente.
A começar, por óbvio, pela escolha peculiar da arma utilizada pelo protagonista, uma câmera com um tripé contendo uma faca em sua base.
Escolha esta que já nos permite construir um norte de qual seria essa peculiar característica diabólica que envolve toda a atmosfera do longa, pois, em verdade, o que mais amedronta e impacta, não é o mero potencial de dano físico da arma em si, mas sim a mensagem que ela passa.
Afinal, a câmera e a lente fotográfica são para o diretor, tal qual o pincel para o pintor, a ferramenta de criação e tradução de seu estado espírito, sua arma final para difusão de sua visão artística e humana.
E, a partir do momento que o filme nos apresenta essa mesma ferramenta, como o artifício de um serial killer, também nos mostra que sua letalidade vai muito além do dano físico que ela possa ocasionar.
Pois, muito mais do que o matar pelo matar, encontra-se consubstanciado na trama o “matar como forma de transmissão da arte da personagem”, a letalidade, nesse caso, é muito mais presente mais pelo “como”, do que pelo “o quê”.
Dito de outro modo, o que mais perturba e, consequentemente, o que traz o de mais diabólico, é a forma como o protagonista utiliza sua arma, não só para matar, mas sim para eternizar sua arte cinematográfica mórbida para o todo o sempre, assustando, perturbando e impactando todos aqueles ousarem assistí-la.
Uma verdadeira arma de letal e diabólica sem precedentes, se assim pudesse definir, tão assassina e funesta, que nem o protagonista dela pode escapar, demonstrando que a letalidade, assustadoramente, pode alcançar a todos, inclusive o seu próprio criador.
Por conta disso, creio que posso me permitir a concluir que o real caráter diabólico trazido pelo instrumento manuseado pelo protagonista, seja a visão artística (de uma maneira um tanto mórbida, é verdade) reflexiva, profunda e aterradora que ela nos provoca, e creio que isso basta.
Acompanhando o grande Scorcese, posso dizer que a arma mais letal dos cinemas, também nos trouxe um dos melhores filmes de terror de todos os tempos.",5.0

"C'est fou. Au delà de l'incroyable beauté formelle, le film offre une vraie réflexion sur le cinéma et l'art en général. Cela m'a notamment fait penser au concept du complexe de la momie théorisé par André Bazin : De tout temps, l'art a tenté de lutter contre la mort. C'est vrai pour les sarcophages de l'egypte antique mais encore plus vrai pour la photographie et par extension le cinéma. Un homme peut mourir mais sa photographie lui survivra. Le concept est ici poussé à l'extrême puisque le sujet est immortalisé au moment même de sa mort. C'est aussi évidemment un film sur le voyeurisme. Le spectateur est ici mis en face de ses propres pulsions scopiques ceistallisées dans le personnage principal. Au delà de ça, je ne suis pas encore apte à m'en rendre compte mais j'imagine que ce film a eu une grande influence sur les films qui ont suivi. Par exemple, le film m'a rappelé un petit peu Le Daim de Quentin Dupieux sur l'idée de base, et la manière avec laquelle Mark tue ses victimes m'a fait penser à une scène de la cité des enfants perdus. Ça va sûrement bcp plus loin que ça, j'ai entendu parler d'une influence sur le travail de De Palma par exemple (que je connais trop peu), mais je n'ai pas encore assez de culture ciné. En tt cas je le reverrai avec plaisir dans plusieurs années, c'est sans aucun doute possible un grand film, à voir absolument comme tout ce qu'a fait Powell",4.5

It is also imply that the father killed his wife or has beaten her just to film his son's reaction. Due to this tragic event growing up, his father's actions carry on.

Mark, like most people hiding behind a sinister past is a very timid and shy man. He talks with a soft voice and seems to stutter on his words not sure if what he's saying is right. He works in the film industry working as one of the camera guys but secretly he's creeping around for women with red hair to record and eventually kill with a sharp blade at the end of his camera stand. This plays into the whole Joker theme. How far are you willing to feel bad for a villain because of his dark evocative past? I wouldn't say Mark is a villian per say, he's just messed up in the head, traumatized by what he's haunted by.

So after this creepy fellow kills off his second victim and sparing his love interest's mother who is blind, he meets a young woman (Love Interest) who is living in the same building named Helen. She starts to change Mark for the better. At first, she is shocked at Mark's obsession with filming but she stills wants to hang out with Mark while he making a movie on the women he has killed. After revealing what has happen to him and Helen discovering what he did, she is scared to the bones but still believes he can help Mark. However like most tragic fools, Mark refuses to get help, refuses help at the offer, and plans to kill himself with his own weapon. He tells Helen that he could never photograph her because if he did, he would kill her. This is likely due to Helen looking similar to Mark's mother or Mark has found someone who he truly cares about not to kill. As the police comes rushing into Mark's apartment to arrest him for the killings, he stabs himself in the neck, leaving a unconscious Helen in shock.

This was a great first watch, I love that this movie can build tension without scary music or jump scares, just from the actor's performance and the setting. The moment with Mark and the blind mother was probably the best part for me and I'm glad Mark didn't kill her or Helen. It's a very devastating and yet controversial movie. I for one understood Mark's behavior and why he did what he did but at the end of day, killing is wrong and filming every reaction especially fear is downright disturbing. Mark should have gotten help once he was free of his father's control. Overall check this one for a good debate amongst friends and be prepared to be somewhat disturbed mentally.",4.0
"I was intrigued by the story direction this film went in, going far beyond the simple creepy tendencies of a voyeur. His ""documentary of fear"" as it were, feels like a love child between Werner Herzog and The Scarecrow.

"We hardly need to talk about the themes, I’m sure there’s already a thousand essays about that. Some things I liked:
-Mark’s horror that Helen’s mother was “spying” on him all this time. Nothing more horrifying to a voyeur than having it turned back on you. 
-I know Mark is a “mentally insane killer of women” but I liked him, was rooting for him and Helen. Those kids were cute together. 
-Mark directing the murder was an amazing sequence, the little dance number Powell whips up without breaking a sweat, the dawning horror, but also the humor. Riffs on two different levels of meta, the obvious directing satire, but also our own narrative expectations. Mark trying to go on for the kill but keeps getting interrupted by his oblivious victim, then all the deadpan shots of his face where we the audience share in his little inside joke. 
-Odd how the time period can make this feel so much more lurid. You can see stuff a thousand times more vulgar on a random Netflix show, but this still feels a bit shocking, like they’re getting away with something.",4.5

"Psycho's Technicolor cousin, made by another master craftsman who hailed from the same side of the Atlantic but preferred to stay in the motherland.
Remastered, Psycho stands as one of the best examples of monochrome photography, impeccably crisp and clean, its lighting masterful and atmospheric. Similarly, Peeping Tom's use of colour is phenomenal, giving the locations a fantastical, dreamlike aura without becoming obviously artificial. Both films are charged with psychoanalytic and voyeuristic themes, although Psycho discusses the first explicitly and Peeping Tom is more directly concerned with the latter. Though they're the parents of the slasher genre, we can't measure one against the other.
As Mark Lewis, Carl Boehm is the heart of Peeping Tom - everything hinges on him. He's spectral, slightly otherworldly, yet solid. It's an extraordinary bit of acting that never feels like a performance, for all its tics and mannerisms. The supporting cast are excellent - in particular, Moira Shearer gives a terrific performance as one of Mark's colleagues, while Anna Massey is perfect as the girl downstairs. There's a touch of Phantom of the Opera to its blend of tragedy and sympathy for the grotesque, and Powell isn't afraid to let some humour into the narrative. The cinematography is gorgeous, moving effortlessly from composition to composition, each shot smooth and precise. I know more than enough's been written on Powell's use of colour but it really is extraordinary.
Psycho is about the victim and the hunt for the killer, while Peeping Tom puts us into his point of view. It's at once ""artier"" yet closer to later slasher films in its plot and archetypes. It may steer into melodrama at times, but this is virtuoso filmmaking. Highly recommended.",4.0

"This ahead-of-its-time horror classic from producer/director Michael Powell(BLACK NARCISSUS,AGE OF CONSENT) was released the same year as PSYCHO but was yet overshadowed by Alfred Hitchcock's better known film as PEEPING TOM takes a different approach in covering its main psychopath Mark(Carl Boehm[FOX AND HIS FRIENDS,SISSI]),a lone camera man who spends his days working at a film studio while moonlights as a photographer whose models usually wind up dead as he suffers from memories of his father who tormented him as a youth as the reluctant subject of his father's photography experiments. Mark son finds romance with a neighbor(Anna Massey[FRENZY,THE VAULT OF HORROR]) who finds him strange yet appealing,much to the dismal of her blind mother(Maxine Audley[THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL,FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED]) as the police slowly get a hold of him possibly being the killer that they are seeking.
Severely trashed by the film critics in England during its theatrical release(which ruined Powell's mainstream career[and the film pulled out of theaters five days after its release) but rescued from obscurity by Martin Scorsese in 1979(with film critic Roger Ebert rightfully including it on his Great Films list),PEEPING TOM is a strongly effective thriller thanks to Powell's stunning directing,the tightly written screenplay by Leo Marks(TWISTED NERVE,UNDERCOVERS HERO),and the magnificent performances from the cast with Boehm making a chilling killer who is given a fascinating character study and Massey making a sympathetic love interest/friend for Boehm is display his humanity to,as PEEEPING TIM is truly one of the all-time classics in horror cinema(and deservingly so). With Moira Shearer(THE TALES OF HOFFMANN,BLACK TIGHTS) as a dancing extra(and soon-to-be victim),jack Watson(THE GORGON,THE HILL),(pin-up model)Pamela Green(THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE,AS NATURE INTENDED),and (a mustache sporting)Nigel Davenport(PHASE IV,NIGHTHAWKS[1981]) as a police detective.",5.0

Abound with shadows and referential bits towards filmmaking, the film features a twisted protagonist with one dark desire: photograph expressions of death.

"While this is well-made, it simply doesn't stand the test of time on any level aside from a clinical one.

Hollywood loves movies about movies but I wonder how they would feel about this one. We go to the movies for diversion. For catharsis. To forget. To be broken apart and made whole again. We go to see good triumph and evil perish. But we also go for more sadistic pleasures. To leer at the nudity on screen.  To revel in the violence. To indulge in depravity. 
In Michael Powell's solo masterpiece, cinema is the weapon and we are the murderer. His iconic use of technicolor here is perverted to something gross and seedy. The screen oozes with a sense of unease. Long before SILENCE OF THE LAMBS did it, Powell puts us in the eyes of the killer. The POV shots depicting women at their most terrified, right before death is sickening to watch but even more disturbing is the implication. We are that murderer. We paid to see this. We're just as complicit. Lately Hollywood has taken a turn to the ""gritty."" To ""realism."" And they're not wrong to. After all this is what the box office has shown that people want. Even in 1960, our titular Peeping Tom, Mark, overhears his boss, the director, tells his lead actress ""just this once, forget that you're stunning and try to look stunned!"" We don't want phony sets, and technicolor and starlets. We want the real thing! But how long before it gets too real? How long until the violence on screen becomes too real? America loves a HACKSAW RIDGE for its bone crunching, gut splattering gore. But it's okay because our Christlike hero can just wash the blood off and we can go home clean. We can go back to buying guns and writing nasty proposals to photos of Instagram girls. Culture is an all absorbing, all implicating beast that's never satisfied. And like our Peeping Tom, we'll never be satisfied until we're caught. Our deepest shames exposed. In order to truly be eradicated, Powell suggests, culture must devour itself. In his final moments, Mark turns the camera on himself. Capturing his own final moments. His own fear. PEEPING TOM offers us the very weapon that Mark wields. A camera with a knife and a mirror. We get to step back and look at ourselves as the lens pulls ever nearer. Hopefully, we can make a change before it's too late or we'll be devoured too.",5.0
"Some films are so innovative, so ahead of their time, so wholly engaging, that they leave the audience in a perpetual state of ""wow"" as they watch; Peeping Tom is one such film. Directed by Michael Powell in 1960 explores voyeurism and hypocrisy in a similar fashion to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho released the same year. Starring Karlheinz Böhm and Anna Massey, Peeping Tom delves into the emotional psyche of a man who uses his camera to kill people while simultaneously using it to film their dying reactions. Powell manages to tap into the sexual interest of voyeurism of his principle characters as well as the hypocrisy of what constitutes art in amazing ways. Showing such stark juxtapositions to illustrate hypocrisy was stunning. To watch this film in 2017, it's possible to miss just how revolutionary this film was for 1960, but nonetheless, Powell deserves to be recognized and praised for his innovative film.
Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm) is an introspective, shy man who works as a production assistant on British films. When he is not working on the film set, Mark takes pictures of naked women to be sold somewhat secretly by a store in town. Mark attempts to take artistic shots but is always brought back by the owner of the shop who constantly reminds him to only photograph naked women, as that is what sells. When Mark is not on film sets, or at a porn shoot, he spends the majority of his spare time tucked away in a bonus room in his flat watching reels of footage, that he makes, trying to chase his dream of becoming a filmmaker. The unsettling aspect is what Mark is viewing, Mark shoots murders, ones that he commits, and then watches them later in his flat. Mark's sexual repression is never more clear than when he is watching these films and becoming aroused by them. It becomes clear that Mark is obsessed with the effect of fear, and how it is experienced by others. Believing he is doing somewhat of a service by continuing his father's work on fear and the central nervous system, Mark views his films as research, thereby absolving himself of any guilt of committing murder. Mark fills his life with the different forms terror assumes, becoming obsessed with the emotion and willing to chase it no matter the cost.
The most mesmerizing thing that Peeping Tom does is explore hypocrisy. Mark has the drive to create art, he wants to be a filmmaker, creating something for the rest of mankind, but is continuously denied the chance. Mark has taken to photographing subjects believing it to be an artistic outlet until he realizes he is supposed to take the most carnal of photos. Art is only valuable if it sells, and the naked women are all that his boss is interested in selling. Powell's ability to make such a statement on art and the way it is created and consumed was masterful. Peeping Tom is a wonderful suspense film, with each line of dialogue and image shown to the camera having a distinct place in the film. Any decent suspense film is dependent upon its score, and Peeping Tom has the perfect score for a suspense film. Another stand out technical aspect of the film is the interesting way in which color is used. Powell creates a world in Peeping Tom and uses color as an aid in such a way that the audience actually feels drawn into Mark's screening room. Karlheinz Böhm absolutely makes the film, creating a creepy yet unassuming Peter Lorre-type of performance, demanding attention from even his most subtle times on screen. Peeping Tom laid a foundation for many films to come yet continue to hold the respect of being one of the first of its kind, that ""originals"" often lose.",4.0

"Hooptober 3.0 #31
Absolutely my favorite movie from this line-up: so much so that I watched it twice.
Perhaps the most personal connection an audience can form with an on-screen killer is to share their gaze. It doesn't help to learn tragic backstory or dig at the root of trauma, because humanization only goes so far to fully paint the picture of motive. It doesn't help to hear their inner monologue: odds are, the musings of a murderous maniac won't resonate very strongly with you. But in sharing a killer's line of vision, we see the monstrous act firsthand. The trappings of motive and intent matter so much less when we, as viewers, are ripped from our front-row seats and thrust into a foreign body, as we watch limbs and hands and instruments of death that are not our own -- yet very conceivably could be -- deftly work to take the life of another person mere inches away through a danse macabre so deeply personal that we can hear the throes of death from start to finish. From punctuated shrieks and desperate pleading to the ever so chilling cadence that signifies completion. Release.
Peeping Tom does exactly this through all of its extended POV sequences: Mark's dual roles as voyeur and predator become jarringly indistinguishable; as do ours. It's uncomfortable. It's tense. It's equal parts provocative and unsettling. It's lovely.",5.0

"Film #1 of Hooptober 3.0: The Quickening.
Michael Powell's film, the first true slasher movie, was virulently hated upon its release. That just solidifies its status as a groundbreaking piece of work. Powell's film has been oft-cited as incredibly influential in the horror genre and it's an accurate description; it is a film that helped create many of the genre conventions that are part and parcel of movies centered on maniacs. Leo Marks' script does a fantastic job of getting inside its murderous protagonist, conducting an exploration of the character's past while laying out how it led to his voyeuristic killing obsessions. Marks and Powell mix in just enough comedy to keep the proceedings from being too bleak, while Carl Boehm gives a nuanced, dedicated performance Mark Lewis as the killer himself. It's always difficult to create sympathy for a serial killer but Boehm creates the portrait of a character who is trying desperately to understand the human condition and goes to extremes in order to do so.
Much has been made of the Peeping Tom's commentary on filmmaking itself, and these are valid points. Powell has Mark living alone with his camera, manipulating his ""actors"" to inspire emotion in order to make his perfect movie. Peeping Tom is a landmark film not just for horror, but for cinema as a whole.",4.5

Murder in modern horror, specifically slasher movies, seem to be glossed over without much thought to how horrific the act is. Which is odd seen as Peeping Tom is the movie that started the slasher genre and, along with Hitchcock's Psycho really pushed what was considered tasteful back when they were released.

Peeping Tom explores the idea of the madness of the artist, how fiction impacts reality.

"Over the years, there have been so many films to be hailed as the precursor to the Slasher film. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho has had a profound influence on the genre, creating many imitators such as Black Christmas and Halloween to name a few. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom was highly controversial at the time of its release, prompting an end to his career in cinema. This is a stellar work of film making and it was the first film to feature the murders in the killer's POV (as referenced in Scream 4). This is a stunning piece of cinema that not only is a classic of horror, but is also a classic of cinema.
This film suggests only what the mind can't see, and in turn makes it much more unrelenting on the viewer. Peeping Tom is the perfect example of a film that uses atmosphere and suspense to create the mood and tone of the film, which is a technique that would be used in the early Slashers of the 1970's. Peeping Tom was a film that truly was ahead of its time, and it seems pretty tame nowadays, but back then, this was a film that caused a stir, but with that said, it revolutionized horror thrillers forever and added a much needed dimension to the genre. This film took risks and pushed the envelope and over the years, you can clearly see how this film influenced a genre.
Like Psycho, this remains a benchmark of horror filmmaking, and in turn reinvented the rules. Karlheinz Böhm's performance is stunning as Mark Lewis, the killer who has an appetite for beautiful women who kills them on camera in a voyeuristic style. This is a brilliant film that genre fans will surely enjoy. Peeping Tom is often overlooked as it was certainly eclipsed by Psycho, which was released the same year, and wasn't as vilified as this film. In terms of a horror picture, Peeping Tom succeeds on many levels, and is a unique and standout film that revolutionized the genre forever. Michael Powell has crafted a fine picture using atmosphere, thrills and suspense and leaves your imagination to fill in the blanks, which is far more terrifying.",4.0
"This kind of pop-psychology story could've easily ended up as a lousy D-grade movie, but Powell's confident, golden-age direction, the beautiful cinematography, and the earnest performances make it not only oddly likeable, but also far more disturbing (entirely intentionally) than you'd expect from a glossy, graphically tame picture. The protagonist echoes 'Psycho's Norman Bates—but with mercifully less psychobabble—and 'Equus's Alan Strang in his sexual isolation and naiveté. This may be the sleekest exploitation movie you'll ever see.",4.0

I will flat out say I think this is the weakest archers film I have seen. Not to say it is bad, it fucking eclipses Psycho, but simply that it is not the sort of film that resonates with me.
Opening on a scene that perfectly matches the painted artifice of The Red Shoes or Black Narcissus, (I actually found that street scene to look quite similar to the stage of the Red Shoes), this movie is blatantly obsessed with a set, not its scene. This film is built around a production’s tech crew: those working the cameras, a director between takes, or the actors having a breakdown. Special attention is called to blocking a scene, developing film, or setting up lights. When Mark says he wants to be a director (huge red flag btw, all directors are monsters), I understand it as a need to control. Like his father controlled and recorded him, he too must record and control the world. (This observation is kinda... boring. I am not really grasping at anything implicit or meta-textual, I don't know if I took much away from this movie outside of the way it exists formally.)
I am curious to better understand the nature of this movie in relation to the history of how pornography is shot and created. If one were to take Mark's spear/camera zoom-in murder thing and swap it for a penis, it would be indistinguishable from like 40% of the internet. Did this movie foreshadow the existence of POV pornography??? If so....that's fucking weird. This could also totally be bullshit. I am not about to google '60s porn' and see what comes up, but maybe this normalized formal language already existed. Maybe I'm overthinking a movie about a blond British guy who stabs women and in 20 years this review is going to prevent me from getting a job offer or some shit, I don't know.
That aside, I find the concept of linking a camera to horror to be fascinating, especially how those connotations change. Within Peeping Tom, the implication/horror of the camera seems to stem from a never ending voyeurism. That someone is able to steal and do whatever the fuck they want with your likeness, is horrifying. I find it interesting how this idea has changed tho. With the advent of the internet and the cesspool the world has come afterwards (I say this as someone who was born after 9/11 and literally cannot comprehend of a world without the internet) the idea of a camera capturing someones image implies an amount of public humiliation, hatred, or blacklisting. Everyone has to protest in masks and sunglasses now or risk having their literal livelihood ripped apart because right wing fascists have too much power and influence on twitter. That's insane.",5.0

"As my first time watching a Powell film, this has left quite a mark (pun not intended).
Peeping Tom is a claustrophobic experience. Every scene feels tightly packed with little room to move as every shot is so packed with props or people. The film feels almost oppressive as Mark must have felt as a child, always being monitored by his father.
Every action taken by Mark is influenced by his upbringing, he has adapted his father's traits and fascination with fear, but to a fatal degree. It is this fascination that influences the narrative and places the the term 'Peeping Tom' upon this production.
This film, despite coming before the boom of horror, really questions the audiences obsession with watching the fear in one's eyes, it makes you question why we are so enthralled by such entertainment.
The final scene is the most graphic and also the most uncomfortable. My eyes were glued to the screen out of the fear of watching the events take place, a perfect way to end this film.
I'm very glad I got to watch this on the big screen, it captured me totally, and didn't let go until the credits rolled. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys meta commentary on the audiences of cinema itself, and those who enjoy a good psychological thriller.",4.5

Still, Michael Powell's use of color reigns supreme.) This movie is so much more shocking, lurid, and graphic than I expected, I can't believe it was made as early as it was. I watched a video piece a while ago with Christopher Frayling where he talked about Peeping Tom (he was mainly talking about Night of the Demon, but he briefly touched on this movie). He said that in the British film industry at the time, mixing sex and violence was extremely taboo, which is why this one got people so riled up. It's a tragedy that this movie pretty much ended Powell's career, especially seeing as how if it had been made not too much later I imagine it would have been much more well-received.

Kinda insane this came out in 1960. Movies were not at all this sexual or anything like that. I loved the story and all that, I love seeing early slasher type films. It's fun to see what helped kick off certain genres. The quality does get to it at times, though you can't blame it. Technicolor can look wonky sometimes, but that's really it about the quality. Mark is such a good and compelling character. You really want to root for him but he is so so broken and does so many terrible things. But he really tries to stop at times and he has a moral compass and he just can't. It's so sad to see what happens.

É nesta dualidade entre nutrir alguma empatia pela personagem mas também ficar horrorizado pelas suas ações que jaz o brilho do filme.

"Michael Powell was ahead of his time. Revealing darker, dirtier truths about movie making and photography that the British public refused to accept was possible at the time, outright censoring such bold works of art as a way to silence the truth and avoid conquering their fears.
Scorsese: “It’s almost like a pathology of cinema. You want to possess the people on film, you want to live through them. You want to possess their spirits, their souls, in a way. And ultimately you can’t stop. It has to be done. Until you get to the bitter end. … The only thing to do is to make another picture. It’s gotta be done again.”
What you can conjure from this is that filmmaking is both something to be celebrated but also be made aware of its pitfalls. To be a director one must have an obsession with film. A need to be voyeuristic, crazy and weird. They must see things other people don’t or wish not to. They must be perverse yet critical with their integrity intact. They mustn’t be judgemental and devoid of empathy and willingness to understand perspective. Cinema is an art form with endless potential and possibilities but one must be brave enough to explore them, willingly sacrificing their own souls and sanity, facing their fears to be one step closer to the truth that others shy away from.",4.5
"loooooved this. phenomenal.
finally could see this masterpiece. thinking about how this pairs sooo damn well w/ david holzman’s diary and the works of which that movie is a caricature. both deal with how the characters treat the people around them and how they emotionally connect and relate to society. casting is perfect. karlheinz bohm is a master of conveying and showing all kinds of emotions and really gets under your skin in this one - as he especially does in martha. it’s interesting though when he shows his sweet but very sinister soft side… some of those very brief moments were comical. he is an emotional chameleon - from the way he acts towards helen vs the women in the movie he kills. he plays disgusting people so well - the man can act. Moira Shearer’s character (she’s the perfect person to display a very outward and theatrical look of shock) and Anna Massey’s (dressed more simply, understated, yet turns out to be almost equally as voyeuristic as Mark is) are also polar opposites too.
peeping tom is such an inventive and unique exploration of familial trauma, the psychology of fear and how it’s unleashed, and the devastating impact that having your critical development / early years caught on footage can have on your psyche (Mark sweats with fury when part of his footage is cut off in one of the scenes). speaking of video and media being at the forefront of this, I first and foremost think about Fassbinder I think about Scorsese i think about Egoyan i think about Haneke i think about sex lies videotape/soderbergh i think about De Palma I think about most slasher directors i think about every director who has explored the male gaze from the first perspective/perspective of the perpetrator of perversion + violence. this set the standard for so many movies. helen’s mom in the story being the primary figure to sense that Mark has murdered these women despite the fact that she is blind and unable to see the footage shocked me - incorporating blindness as a theme into a movie that’s essentially about something that alludes to its exact opposite (as an illusion) - voyeurism - is so smart. but at the end of the day, he has never had any sight of himself and his actions destroy his own life as the spectacle unfolds at the end. he is the beholder of fear at the end of the day. what a minacious and psychologically terrifying film. yet visually, it has the characteristic Powell touch.",5.0

"Last month wound up being my quietest month on Letterboxd since I registered a year ago, but when some restaurant plans didn't pan out at the month's end, I fell into killing time with an unexpectedly seasonal movie.
Originality. 3/5. A proto-slasher released in 1960! That's long enough before the Sixties became Swinging that Peeping Tom feels like a holdover from the '50s. PT's also a relatively early entry in cinema linking voyeurism/scop(t)ophilia and violence, which boomed in the rest of the '60s and never really went away. Arguably it rides a genre line too, with Wikipedia calling it a ""horror-thriller"". (Shades of '90s banger Perfect Blue.)
Adequacy. 4/5. I don't know whether to blame the composer or the solo pianist, but the ostentatiously nervous forte piano playing over some high-tension scenes is distracting, and some of the acting is very Theatrical, even outside the scenes literally set on stage. But these critiques are trifling.
Watchability. 5/5. PT wastes no time, opening straight into a scene — shot through the crosshairs(!) viewfinder of a camera — of a streetwalker being followed and assaulted. From that first minute the narrative never lets up, but nor is it ever hectic and rushed.
The movie's coloring is vivid, mining the full range of brightness, and benefiting from the classic mid-century Technicolor/Eastmancolor look & feel. Even the plentiful scenes set in the darkroom of main character Mark feature chiaroscuro and a photographer's profondo rosso. In other words, the wide color gamut and HDR of the coming 4K release are very much warranted. Disregard the new restoration's trailer, which is only in 2K resolution and has, in some dark shots, gross banding/false contouring I didn't see in the movie itself.
Resonance. 3/5. PT's first half is consistently unsettling, and the second half creeps me out, inculcating some dread. In one central sequence, Mark lures coworker and actress Vivian to an unused studio set in the guise of recording a screen test. Unease mounts as Vivian sneaks into the set under a shutter and it lowers behind her; as Vivian walks uncertainly among the set's scenery and an unseen Mark turns on one blinding stage light after another (as well as the red filming-in-progress light outside); as Mark reveals himself to set up the camera and Vivian warms up with a dance, mills around, temporarily swaps places with Mark behind the camera...and that's before Mark presents his solution to Vivian's complaint that she's too relaxed to play scared. Kinda reminds me of the All That Jazz scene where Joe walks in on Audrey practicing dance moves and verbally spars with her (""Straighten that leg."") until he leaves with a glimmer of inspiration. PT's Vivian doesn't get off so lightly.
The more-exciting scenes are impressive because, compared to modern horror, PT fights with one hand behind its back. The movie's change in rating from 1960 to 2023 summarizes changes in horror-movie norms: the original ""British Board of Film Censors"" certificate shown at the start bears an X rating, but the new restoration's rated 15. I can see why the latter-day British censo—uh, certifiers think modern teenagers can handle this. Every coup de grâce but the last is offscreen or occluded. The stabbings are the least bloody I've seen in a long time. Props and the cops investigating Vivian's murder are positioned to obscure her corpse.
Headline average. 3.75 stars. PT is sturdy and far less annoying than a significant fraction of horror movies I've seen. It doesn't wow me quite enough to round up to a full 4.0 stars, but that's a knife-edge call. The movie's genuinely exciting.",3.5

I loved this on first watch last year, however rewatching it on the big screen, this time knowing what I’m going in to, this really really clicked for me.
A film that is Michael Powell’s expression through film about people that express themselves through film. Mark doesn’t know how to convey his emotions unless he puts a lens in front of them. Really cleverly done. Documenting his trauma and, later, repeating the cycles of abuse on unsuspecting women.
The way Mark veers at his subjects. His sympathetic demeanour that can turn menacing at the drop of a hat. The passion he speaks about cinema or Helen with. Absolute powerhouse performance. 
A film that says so much about cinema. The passion. The obsession. The dehumanisation of the voyeur/auteur who is viewing from a distance, unable or unwilling to intervene in the perverse actions unfolding before their eyes. Really has so much to say about the way we look at and consume media, the way we interact with one another, when does vicarious cross in to perverse? The line between subjectivity and objectivity especially as it pertains to viewing someone else’s version of events via a camera. A look at how the camera can violate someone’s security and privacy in more than just the obvious ways. Fascinating stuff that’s years ahead of it’s time with it’s subject matter, themes, presentation and obscenity (which is needed to tie everything together.)

"Peeping Tom (1960) Review:
Peeping Tom is a 1960 psychological horror-thriller movie that's produced and directed by Michael Powell. The screenplay was written by Leo Marks. He directed such films as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1943), Black Narcissus (1947), and The Red Shoes (1948). The film's production company is Michael Powell (Theatre), and it is distributed by Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors. The film stars Karlheinz Boehm, Anna Massey, Moira Shearer, Maxine Audley, Brenda Bruce, Esmond Knight, Martin Miller, Michael Goodliffe, Jack Watson, and Nigel Davenport.
“The movie's story revolves around Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Boehm), a shy and loner photographer who works at a film studio. However, at night, he becomes a serial killer who murders women while using a portable film camera. Mark is also making a documentary that features all the dying expressions of his victims as a means for his own self-pleasure. He then befriends one of the tenants living in the apartment, a sweet-natured young woman, Helen Stephens (Anna Massey). Mark then tells her vaguely about the movie he is making while he continues to murder women at night with his film camera.”
1960 had been a solid year for horror movies. Psycho, Eyes Without a Face, and Peeping Tom were all released in the same year. All of these movies are excellent and have pushed the genre of horror in a lot of ways. This movie actually has a lot of history to it, in particular during the time it was released. It received so much controversy that it basically almost ruined the director's whole career. But as time passes, more and more people have begun to appreciate this film a lot more, and now it is considered a classic. I loved this film when I first saw it, and upon rewatching it, I loved it even more.
Peeping Tom (1960) is such a phenomenal psychological horror-thriller movie. It is a very dark, disturbing, unsettling, and masterfully crafted movie by Michael Powell. It's phenomenally written by Leo Marks, as he presents a very fascinating character study that's brilliantly portrayed by Karlheinz Boehm. The entire cast here is incredible. Visually, it looks absolutely stunning, with an incredible use of vibrant colors and lighting. The overall tone and themes about voyeurism are really well represented in this movie. It's also filled with incredible moments that will resonate. Here are my thoughts on the movie:
Positives:
- It's a masterfully crafted film. Michael Powell does a phenomenal job directing this movie. Every aspect feels meticulously crafted. There are a lot of details to be seen in this movie. I loved how, for the majority of the film's runtime, it doesn't really feel like it was made during that time period. It still pretty much holds up extremely well to this day. I think this is a film that feels ahead of its time and has gotten even better today. It's just so well-made from beginning to end.
- Aside from Michael Powell's masterful directing, the screenplay written by Leo Marks is also really incredible. The story is incredible, and it's told in a complex and interesting way. I really liked how the film takes its time to properly set up its plot. It was pretty consistent throughout its runtime. This is also an excellent character study. They've done an excellent job of making the lead character menacing while also sympathetic. He's a very well-developed character.
- The cast here is pretty excellent. All of them did a phenomenal job with their overall performances and chemistry with one another. Karlheinz Bohm was absolutely spectacular in this movie. He brought the character to life in such an effective manner. It is one of the best aspects of the film, and it works so well. His performance here is so incredible that you can sympathize with his character while also being afraid of him when he tries to do sadistic things.
- In terms of its overall tone, I thought it was handled extremely well. This is a dark, disturbing, and violent movie. There are so many moments in this movie that will make you feel unsettled. It was handled in such a very effective manner, and a lot of it still holds up to this day. There is a pretty great balance between the different tones. Aside from that, the themes of the film were also handled extremely well. Voyeurism is one of the film's main themes, and the way they were able to present it was incredible.
- Visually, the movie looks absolutely stunning. Rewatching it, I've honestly forgotten how beautiful this film looks. There are so many shots here that are just really incredible. The camera work was handled really well. I absolutely loved what they were able to do with their use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie pop a lot more and is more appealing to watch, despite its obviously dark tone and themes. Even the movie's positioning of the lighting was really excellent.
- This is also a pretty atmospheric movie. One that's very effective, in my opinion. Aside from its overall cinematography and atmosphere, the music composed by Brian Easdale was also excellent. I liked the piano theme for the movie, as it fits pretty well with its overall tone. It added a lot more effectiveness to its atmosphere. I thought the production design here was also pretty great. I really liked what they were able to do with a lot of the sets in this movie.
- In terms of its pacing, I thought it was fairly well executed. I appreciate how the movie takes its time to set up its narrative and its lead character. That being said, there are definitely some aspects that could've been handled a bit better. The movie has so many incredible and memorable moments. This is a film that has resonated with me and has gotten even better on rewatch. Again, this is a film that was ahead of its time, and it still holds up really well to this day.
Negatives:
- As for my overall criticisms, I don't really have many issues with this movie. The pacing could've been a little bit better. It's more of a slow-paced film, and while I did like its approach, there were a few moments that felt a little bit slow. Those few moments could've been handled a bit better. Aside from that, there were also a few aspects of its narrative that I kind of wish were explored a bit more. But apart from those, I don't really have any major issues with this movie.
Final Thoughts:
Overall, Peeping Tom (1960) is a masterfully crafted psychological horror-thriller film by Michael Powell. It's dark, disturbing, and violent, and it still holds really well up to this day. Michael Powell has done such an excellent job meticulously crafting this movie, as every detail was executed extremely well. The writing by Leo Mark was also really amazing. This is very much a character-driven movie, and they've done it not only by making a complex character but also with its narrative. The cast is magnificent. I thought they did such an excellent job with their overall performances, especially with Karlheinz Boehm.
In terms of its overall tone, the movie does a phenomenal job handling this aspect. This is a dark and unsettling movie. The film has moments that are very effective. Aside from its tone, the themes that the film presented, such as voyeurism, were shown incredibly well here. I thought there was a great balance between the different tones and themes that the movie has explored. Visually, the film also looks absolutely stunning. I was quite surprised that there are so many beautiful shots here. The vibrant colors that they've used in this movie are amazing. It makes the overall film pop a lot more.
I also absolutely loved what they were able to do with the movie's lighting. The positioning was just spectacular. Aside from its cinematography, the film also has incredible music that's composed by Brian Easdale. The piano fits incredibly well with the movie's tone and has also added a lot more effectiveness to the overall atmosphere. Now, speaking of the movie's atmosphere, this one handles it very effectively. The editing is pretty great, and the production design is also really amazing. There are a lot of terrific scenes in this movie. Ones that will definitely leave a mark of how incredible they are.
My only criticism of the film is its pacing. It could've been handled a bit better. While I do like its slower-paced approach, the film did have a couple of moments that were a little bit slow. Some scenes here tend to drag a little bit, in my opinion. Aside from that, some aspects of its narrative could've also been fleshed out a bit more. But other than those minor complaints, I honestly don't really have any major issues with this movie. This is such a phenomenal flick that's brilliantly crafted in many aspects. It's such a classic movie that was ahead of its time and one that will completely resonate with you.

Peeping Tom (1960), Psycho (1960), and Eyes Without A Face (1960) laid the foundation for modern psychoanalytic thrillers. As one of the first proto slasher films, Peeping Tom is a masterpiece that methodically explores the psychology of the killer. A first for making a film from the perspective of the killer in POV shots, making the viewpoint come directly from the killer while also exposing voyeurism. For the first time in UK cinema, horror wasn't exerted from the supernatural or violence but rather the sympathy and melancholy of a broken man. The film addresses child abuse, sadism, and scopophilic fetishism. For a film to explore those themes in 1960, it would have taken daring and extremely risky ambition. Director Michael Powell received backlash and harsh ratings from critics, claiming that his film depicted violence and lurid sexual content which the general audience have never been exposed to before. Because of this, Michael Powell’s career as a director in the UK ended. 
The style of this film is so pleasing with its vibrant color scheme and cinematography. Almost every shot in a scene could just be a photograph that highlights an emotion from the lead character. Actor Karlheinz Böhm did an incredible job in his performance as the lead character, perfecting the role of a deeply disturbed and shy individual. The POV kill sequences are unsettling and tension filled which could serve the argument of Peeping Tom being the first proto slasher film. Its use of POV shots, tracking the victim, and the execution are borrowed in Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), and Friday the 13th (1980). It's unfortunate that this film didn't receive the recognition it deserved upon release but it's evident that it's a well crafted masterpiece that all horror and slasher fans should watch.",4.5

"he has his father’s eyes.
1960 genuinely might be the best year of all time for horror. man. rewatching this and psycho so close to each other was just… chef’s kiss. also. petition to build a time machine so that i can go back in time and convince moira shearer to be in more movies? she hardly made any. she’s such a wonderful actor, really wonderful. i didn’t know who she was when i first saw this, but man. man. 
peeping tom is a film of starting psychological complexity. the thing that struck me most while watching this was that it felt like a film written with the intention of using slasher tropes to deconstruct themselves, something like last year’s X, but that stood out because i know and knew that this is widely regarded as the original of its genre. it’s a fascinating, deeply layered slasher film, and a true work of cinematic art. i struggle to think of a slasher film that came out post 1960 which lacks the impression of tom’s footprint. that’s incredible. 
the most obvious and prominent theme in the film, down to the title, is the link between voyeurism 
voyeurism and the male gaze. almost every slasher film has a sexual charge between killer and heroine (something i am under the impression is even more true in giallos, though i’m dreadfully underexperienced with those). beyond the obvious goal of penetration, the two are always intrinsically linked. carol clover argued in her seminal piece on the final girl trope that many slasher films begin with a sadistic pleasure, getting gratification out of watching victims (primarily women) being brutalized (semi-often naked). what’s interesting about her genre-wide analysis in regards to this film is that it seems to exist to comment on that trend before it really existed. those moments don’t come with any satisfactory framing, and much of the violence appears off screen. the film focuses on the voyeurism in a way that challenges the viewer- similar to what haneke would do with funny games- and removes any potential gratification. and the first person shots through mark’s camera are echoed throughout slasher films as well- the opening of halloween, a film i consider a strong contender for the greatest horror film ever made, is a prime example. we see from michael’s perspective as he kills his (naked) sister. friday the 13th takes this approach for most of its kills as well, although that’s at least in part to keep the killer’s identity a secret. still, two of the films most famous for their linking sexuality to violent punishment clearly quote the visual language of this one. 
i mentioned psycho already, but hitchcock also had voyeurism as a recurring motif in his films- obviously most evident in rear window- including that one. marion dies because of norman watching her shower; another 1960 slasher directly links the killer’s sexual desire to his corresponding murder (a murder of which moments are shot similarly to that same halloween opening, all of this is connected). but here is different, because here that’s the central tension. the act of norman (well, mother) killing marion isn’t meant to be read as a subtextually sexual act, whereas the murders here, in a freudian sense, are also another kind of penetration. powell makes the camera both a murder weapon and a phallus, and mark’s obsession with photography terrifies him. he cares for helen but fears desiring her, because he’s incapable of viewing her as fully human. that fear is key, because fear is what truly arouses him. the murder is perfunctory, almost. it’s the orgasm to conclude the act. the foreplay is the fear- again commenting on the masochistic thrills this genre can skew towards, and the patriarchal allure of violence. importantly though, mark’s past abuse from his father demonstrates that his attitude towards woman is not innate. powell posits that men who view women as sexual objects devoid of humanity don’t fear that way because of some sort of intrinsic flaw of the male gender, but because of social conditioning. mark is the way he is because he was raised the way he was. he does, as the doctor says, “[have] his father’s eyes.”it’s genuinely remarkable that a film from 1960, directed by (wonderful and brilliant and impossibly talented) man, is so stupendously nuanced and concise. powerful skewers the patriarchy in an unabashedly transgressive manner, that’s still bold today. 
this isn’t the only film (co-)directed by powell to have had a huge influence on the horror genre. the red shoes very obviously has a huge red-shoeprint as well, most notably on black swan. why i bring that up here is because i felt that this film also had a lot in common with aronofsky’s ballet horror. peeping tom and the red shoes both trace a protagonist struggling to balance artistic obsession and a romantic relationship. but the red shoes’s vicky doesn’t really struggle with perfectionism, whereas both mark and swan’s nina absolutely do. the whole “obsessed artist” trope has been talked to death in a shallow sense, but all three of these films fall squarely into it. interestingly again, this film brings ballet back into it with shearer’s character vivian. the second victim we see, mark is frustrated by the lighting of his murder; but notably, he has her dance for him beforehand- now going from making a ballet drama with horror tinges to a horror picture with traces of ballet. again influencing the eternal legacy of ballet as a part of horror cinema. and, spoiler alert for the other two films, all three leads end up dying at their own hand. mark kills himself with his own camera, dying in the fear he tried so hard to capture from his women. with his death, he finds perfection, and at last, true gratification.
powell’s groundbreaking slasher originator is an invaluable entry in the horror genre, a blazing indictment of the dangers of the unchecked male gaze, and fascinating character study into a deeply broken leading man.",4.5
"I don’t remember the last film I watched on Tubi, that oft invaluable streaming service for movies relegated to a rights purgatory, or otherwise neglected. 
Perhaps nothing fits that latter bill more than Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom. Does the modern slasher — your Black Christmas, your Halloween — exist without this? I don’t know, maybe? Pay me more and I’ll look into it. They give out PhDs for that kind of analysis these days. So until someone ponies up for a grant, maybe?
(Also Mario Bava’s Blood and Black Lace, the color palette of which seems directly borrowed from this.)
This wrecked Michael Powell’s career. One of the Archers with Emeric Pressburger, visionaries behind Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, etc., the man didn’t deserve to be done dirty like that. Mercifully, time has proven this to be a triumph, but Powell died in 1990, long before anyone besides real horror nerds and other film fans were singing its praises. 
That’s such a shame, because while some films deserve their place in cinema history for one element or another but lack timelessness, Peeping Tom has so many things working for it that it really was so far ahead of its time that I can’t imagine it being considered passé anytime soon. 
I initially hated Karlheinz Böhm as Mark Lewis — obviously, because the film opens with him murdering a prostitute — but pretty quickly we’re on his side. The film does a good job of showing both sides of this madman, a shy introvert but also a pretty charismatic guy when he’s enticing a stand-in actress to make an after-hours sizzle reel. We empathize with Mark because he was a victim of his manipulative father’s experiments, and he eventually takes responsibility for his actions. In a really sad and fucked up way, but still. 
(Another nifty anachronism occurs when Helen’s blind mother, played by Maxine Audley, detects that Mark is a liar because she feels his racing pulse, and later sneaks into his apartment to foil his plan. This was four years before the blind superhero Daredevil would appear in Marvel Comics.)",4.5

"Peeping Tom combines elements of iconic films such as Blow Out, Taxi Driver and even the opening scene is reminiscent of Wes Craven's Scream's opening scene. Yet, this came out decades before any of those films mentioned. The act of obsession and loneliness is excellently explored through this odd yet, craftfully made horror-drama. 
My love for Peeping Tom comes from how modern it feels. The conversations in this feel so real and natural. Additionally, the editing in this feels way ahead of it's time. There's one shot where a glass of whiskey is poured into a glass and transitions to another glass. It felt so rad. The lighting is amazing as well, when Mark takes Vivian to his photo room the use of red light and shadows are one of the best I've seen. Better than most modern films.
Powell is such an incredible film maker as he's able to show off an incredible story with fantastic filmmaking elements.

"Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom is a horror masterpiece, and for what is supposedly the first slasher flick, it’s beautifully confident and morbidly disturbing. Peeping Tom is a film I always had in mind. For one, I’ve always wanted to check out the famous British filmmaker, Michael Powell, and I also needed to experience the “original” slasher. To my surprise, I loved it more than I’ve experienced. In a film as experimental and daring as this, it’s no surprise how every aspect of the film is cinematically rich in every way. Also, I should mention that despite the fact it’s many decades old, Peeping Tom is pretty disturbing. It depicts psychopaths in a gripping manner. Powell’s direction is constantly shifting toward suspense, and if it isn’t working up towards a scare, it’s playing as a wonderfully crafted character study. Here, we’re introduced to one of cinema’s most insane serial killers. Sure, it’s relatively held back, as 60’s horror isn’t as gory as movies today, but I’m sure it worked its magic on its audiences when it first released. Peeping Tom is a film about fear, voyeurism, and scopophilia. Our protagonist fetishizes his camera. The origin of his psychotic behavior was inherited from his father, a mysterious figure we get to know very little about. After all, Peeping Tom is also a film about the art of photography. This is a film I’d come back to one day, and it’s very memorable. 
Peeping Tom follows the story of a young, aspired filmmaker and current photographer (and member of a film crew) who gathers footage for his documentary about fear. He spends his days murdering women and photographing their final moments. So, was he planning to have a screening for his murderous documentary he worked so hard on? Peeping Tom is a film I could praise in a variety of ways. It’s beautifully shot and the use of color (and odd vibrant lighting) is awesome. The camerawork and shot composition in Peeping Tom is also a prominent highlight. There’s a sense of elegance in the way the camera is moved. For a film about cameras, film sets, and photography, that’s expected. The lead performance by Karlheinz Böhm, playing the iconic psychopath, is great too. Peeping Tom is consistently engaging and entertaining. It’s inspiring to watch horror classics like these. To get a sense of “where it all started” is ideal. Amazing ending. So many unanswered questions, and if that’s done right, it’s chilling.

The set elements are perfectly matched to the plot scenario thanks to meticulous attention to detail. The movie's concepts and aesthetic are quite complex. It shows how Man (Mark) and the machine (camera) interact. It's actually a disconcerting look at the unstable person with his father's eyes. Son is much like his father. The camera, which serves as the murder weapon itself, is a key component of the film. Every scene has its own concepts and inquiries into the human condition.",4.0

Crazy to think that this was derided at the time for being to lurid. Especially when we consider that this came out the same year as Psycho.
This however is much more interested in developing it's killer into an actual character, with a real life and how he weaves that around his deadly compulsion.

Defendido por muitos como um dos precursores do que posteriormente seria conhecido como slasher, Peeping Tom protagonizou uma caminhada curiosa na história do cinema desde sua chegada a salas de cinema em 1960, sendo responsável pela notória façanha de encerrar a carreira de Powell como cineasta em seu país de origem, Reino Unido. Diferente de Psycho de Hitchcock, que estava sendo lançado na mesma época, a representação de violência e sexualidade não foi tão bem recebida tanto pelo público quanto pela própria crítica, gerando uma verdadeira avalanche de reações negativas.
Contudo, não há certeza que perdure para sempre no meio artístico. O que torna a arte, e principalmente o cinema, tão empolgante de ser consumida é justamente esta possibilidade de constante reavaliação, que permite que experiências possam ser ressignificadas. Embora não tenha alcançado o mesmo status que outros tantos clássicos alcançaram no decorrer dos anos, foi a redescoberta através de nomes como Scorsese que impediu que um erro fatal ocorresse com Peeping Tom, um longa que em muitos aspectos é fundamental para compreensão de um dos arquétipos mais famosos da sétima arte.
Antes de Michael Myers nascer das mentes criativas responsáveis por Halloween (1978) ou Billy Loomis e Stu Macher promoverem um banho de sangue na pacata Woodsboro em Scream (1996), existia Mark Lewis. Dono de um comportamento reservado, o fotógrafo tem uma notável obsessão pela imagem em movimento; protagonizando momentos de verdadeiro sadismo, ele está sempre filmando suas vítimas em seus minutos finais para que possa revisitar estes registros na solidão da sala escura improvisada em seu apartamento. Este fascínio pela morbidez não começou pelo mero acaso, nasceu na infância, das experiências traumáticas nas mãos do próprio pai.
Introduzindo um protagonista que personifica o observador voyeurista em sua máxima, Peeping Tom mergulha profundamente em sua mente conturbada, vasculhando centímetro por centímetro em busca de explicações racionais que o permitam compreender o porquê de o presente estar apresentando tais ocorrências. Eis que desta decisão surge a primeira subversão por parte da narrativa, apesar de suas atitudes serem dignas de julgamento e condenação imediata, o assassino também é uma vítima. Não tanto quanto aquelas que ele matou, mas ainda assim alguém que perdeu a completa conexão com o senso de moralidade, vivendo uma vida que lhe foi imposta indiretamente. 
Entre tentativas fracassadas de estabelecer vínculo com os que o cercam, principalmente sua vizinha do primeiro andar, e um intenso conflito interno contra a compulsão dos instintos humanos mais primitivos, o longa ilustra a existência de uma humanidade que está em um completo caos. Mark é um homem destruído por seu próprio passado, desesperado por reconexão e por uma cura, mas que mantém uma parte dentro de si consciente o bastante para compreender que está no fundo do poço, que não existe um retorno possível daquele ponto. 
Peeping Tom tem uma linguagem ousada, principalmente para época de seu lançamento. Sua utilização prioriza a construção de uma atmosfera psicanalítica, que reconhece a importância das alegorias na costura desta trama. Do voyeurismo à prática da produção de registros fílmicos, tanto através dos assassinatos quanto da filmagem de um longa-metragem no estúdio que serve de palco para uma das mortes, todos esses elementos são componentes importantes para um filme que está concentrado em destrinchar e estudar a mente de seu assassino/vítima e por extensão as relações humanas que o cercam.",4.5

"Made the same year as Psycho – there must have been something in the air – this has a crazy Freudian dad in place of a crazy Freudian mum, but also a rather more sympathetic treatment of its serial killer, who teeters on the edge of likability, or at least understanding. (Since he was supposedly born and raised in London, his German accent would seem a bit surprising, but everyone politely avoids mentioning it.)
Serial killers have since become a genre unto themselves, by the standards of which this now seems fairly tame. But the association with filmmaking – the voyeurism, the fundamental unhealthiness of looking at people this way – still works remarkably well, and you can see why original audiences felt not just revolted but personally attacked. For me the best part is all the shots of sleazy Soho – the dodgy photography studio, trashy corner shops and porn mags – all of which somehow looks even more grimy for being shot in lavish Eastmancolor.",3.5

"Was a bit embarrassed by my positive-yet-reserved 2017 review of this on LB basically ever since I wrote it—stating that the one of the most eminent directors was looking back from the future of filmic language seems awfully presumptuous and ill-advised coming from some rando. And yet, having seen it again years later I actually don't particularly disagree with what I wrote. Powell's (great, to be clear) direction really does feel old-hat stylistically compared not only to Hitchcock in Pyscho, but also the very subject matter of the film, which is probably more radical than the Master of Suspense's own 1960 horror flick. Peeping Tom plays its cards awfully close to its chest with its depiction of and identification with its central serial killer, never giving a clear takedown of him (not that one is exactly necessary, but that's how it usually goes). And yet, the retro formal feel defangs it somewhat—the film never feels particularly dangerous. With that said, Powell's flashy, inventive mise en scène is as appealing as in his lauded color collaborations with Pressburger, and while Peeping Tom may still not do much for me emotionally or psychologically, its clear accomplishments in terms of aesthetics and formal construction nonetheless had it strike me with great impact on this rewatch.",4.0

"Recommended by Ian
No one told me Michael Powell directed this! It’s a shame this tarnished the future of his career. Most of his films feel so ahead of its time and undoubtedly this controversial classic is one of them. From a historical standpoint I find this film to be very fascinating. It is tame in today’s standards, yet through a early 1960s lens, it is pretty risqué and disturbing in content and especially thematically. I feel certain lines evoke a layer of meta criticism interestingly enough (“I like to understand what I’m shown”) directed straight to the minds of viewers and repulsed critics of the time. Karlheinz Böhm is remarkable as the reserved, sexually repressed murderer who may be too attached to photography and capturing raw fear. The film does not depict him one-dimensionally, rather, the film makes him rounded, interesting, and even sympathetic at times through the supporting roles. If I had a complaint It would have to do with the way the movie can be paced—regardless, it is intriguing even in the sluggish areas. As expected from a visionary like Powell, the technicolor is top-rate and elevates the experience. An important movie for psychological thriller fans.

"Well, this was hard-hitting! It's both marveous/fascinating and egregiously unpleasant to see Michael Powell's cinematic genius applied to such an unrelentingly nasty, provocative story -- although the results never feel exploitative and your skin only crawls because it's so effective, though I have to admit my visceral reaction to several things that happened at the climax was physical and not a little unpleasant. Minimalism in both dialogue and the (broadly outstanding) performances helps make it all a capital-E Experience. And so many incidental thrills besides, from Moira Shearer's dancing cameo to Brian Easdale's extraordinarily tense music to the magnetically ugly style of it all; and of course, for the cinephile, it's a dream subject, examining the power and perversity of the camera from all angles.

The film is self reflexive and arguably post modern (before so called post modern cinema was produced). The blurring of reality and fiction is presented by surreal scenes, exaggerated sound and in places intentionally over dramatic acting.
The lighting and cinematography can be likened to pornographic films produced at the time. However the highly saturated color and impressionistic lighting seems very reminiscent of Giallo cinema. The film undoubtedly influenced many Giallo and slasher films that came afterwards.",4.5

In that manner, it reminds me of Hitchcock's Psycho, which isn't a bad thing at all.

"Peeping Tom is a film that has an infectious atmosphere more than anything, and that’s where the true horror of the film comes from.
The shots replicating the camera viewfinder put you in the position of the killer in such a way that intrinsically connects you with him, and in many ways, makes you actively participating in the crimes you see on screen. It’s a bold and chilling choice, especially for 1960 and I can almost guarantee this is what inspired the famously terrifying opening from John Carpenter’s Halloween. 
The film would’ve been exceptionally challenging for a 1960 audience and it’s no surprise that it was hated by critics. It’s a film that dared to be violent and sexual and have the villain be the protagonist so it was so incredibly ahead of it’s time. 
A lot of people liken this film to Psycho and can’t understand why this which is comparably less violent was hated while Psycho was praised, but I think that very much comes down to the perspective of the story. Psycho has a fairly standard story for the time- people investigate the murder of their friend- whereas Peeping Tom encouraged you to understand and be placed in the same position as a serial killer. Which was obviously a lot less palatable for a 60s audience. 
For me, the film works quite well as a black comedy. There’s a few lines and moments in the film that made me giggle, but they never lasted for long and instead they were replaced with a strong feeling of dread.
It’s a great film and it’s influence can be seen throughout cinema- from Halloween to the slasher genre as a whole, and even in films like Nightcrawler. It’s terrific.",4.0
"Qualquer um que se da o trabalho de estudar cinema, em algum momento de sua jornada, irá questionar essa arte, fazendo uma pergunta muito básica, mas muito difícil de responder. Uma pergunta tão simples, mas que demanda tamanha reflexão. Possivelmente, é improvável que alguém sequer encontre uma resposta. A pergunta é “o que é o cinema?”
 
Esse estudante que tropeçará neste questionamento, irá se deparar com reflexões a respeito do tema, mas somente capazes de cobrir parte da resposta, nunca conseguindo trazer uma solução geral para tudo. Um viés que é muito explorado e muito debatido é “se o cinema é uma janela?”, isso implicaria em uma divisão nós (público) e eles (ação fílmica) e, no meio, um vidro que separa ambos. Isso, ainda, expressa uma ideia de uma verdade sendo observada, sem interferência alguma do ser artístico.
 
Contudo, muitos teóricos do cinema, acreditam que esse não é o caso, e eu tendo a concordar com eles. Gosto de imaginar e interpretar a sétima arte de uma outra forma. O cinema é um olhar. Repare que eu não disse “O” olhar, mas sim “um”. Esclarecendo essa ideia: um filme é construído a partir de decisões, desde qual caneta usarei na cena, até onde colocarei a câmera. No momento em que os cineastas decidem fazer uma coisa, automaticamente estão excluindo outra. Já dizia o grande Scorsese “cinema é uma questão do que está no enquadramento e do que não está” (estou parafraseando).
 
No momento dessa decisão, houve uma escolha, houve uma subjetividade, houve um olhar. Se essa decisão fosse entregue para um determinado diretor, ele faria uma escolha, nas mãos de outra pessoa, essa escolha poderia ser diferente. Quando um roteirista decide contar uma estória sobre um homem, ele já excluiu todo um universo. Cinema é subjetividade, é um olhar.
 
O filme “A Tortura do Medo”, dirigido por Michael Powell, é um estudo perturbador sobre essa ideia. O cineasta se utiliza de seu olho para contar o que ele quer contar. A câmera, para aquele que faz cinema, é por onde ele vai olhar o mundo que ele quiser olhar. Ela se torna o olho do diretor, ela se torna uma subjetividade.
 
O protagonista do filme, Mark Lewis, é um desses olhares, uma dessas figuras que olham o mundo através de sua câmera. Observe como ele se sente, quando sua câmera é afastada dele, ou ele fica apreensivo, ou sente falta dela. Mark é apaixonado por cinema e ele usa seu olhar através dessa arte, moldando sua percepção, sua visão de mundo.
 
Mark é um cineasta e, ao mesmo tempo, é um serial killer, um psicopata. Sua paixão cinematográfica é p veículo para que ele cometa seus assassinatos. O que ele vê quando vai tirar a vida de alguém, é o olhar subjetivo de sua câmera. Ele jamais mata sem ser pela lente cinematográfica. A arma que ele utiliza é moldada a partir dessa ideia. Todo o tesão pelo cinema está ali. A ponta de um tripé ser uma faca. A maneira como ele ergue essa perna do tripé, é para gerar imagens sexuais em nossa mente, sem sombra de dúvidas. Não à toa que todas suas vítimas são mulheres. Eu me aprofundaria mais na arma do assassino, mas recomendo fortemente a leitura da reflexão feita por Pedro Santoro que é muito satisfatória e esclarece fortemente as ideias do filme.
 
A construção de “A Tortura do Medo” é voltada para esse olhar pessoal que representa o cinema. Apesar da morbidez, Mark é um artista, é um cineasta e toda a devoção dele a seu documentário é um retrato dessa paixão pelo cinema e como ele internalizou todas as questões vividas com seu pai, na sua infância, mais uma vez ressaltando a subjetividade e a construção artística proporcionada pelo indivíduo.
 
A ideia do “peeping tom” (título original do filme) é desenvolvida para outras direções. Essa é uma expressão da língua inglesa que se assemelha à um pervertido, um praticante do voyeurismo. Aquele que observa a privacidade, de uma fetichista. Se Mark se enquadra como um “peeping tom”, não seriam todos os cineastas “peeping toms”?
E são essas reflexões que o filme de Michael Powell traz para nós. Ele coloca em xeque o cineasta, a posição do cineasta diante da câmera. A câmera diante do público. Ele brinca com essas ideias através de um serial killer e, talvez, apresente um filme muito mais cinematográfico do que muitos por aí.

Very interesting film for Powell, considering what I've seen from him so far. It's an incredibly complex psychological proto-slasher with an absolutely gorgeous colour palette.

"It's easy to see why Peeping Tom outraged critics and audiences. More than Psycho, Peeping Tom implicates the viewer in a killer's crimes and feelings.
Like Halloween, Peeping Tom opens with a POV shot from the killer's perspective as he makes arrangements with a prostitute, eyes her stripping naked, and attacks her. However, the POV shot is coming from a literal camera stashed under the murderer's coat; footage he later uses as a source for pleasure.
Peeping Tom puts the killer's voyeuristic pleasure front-and-centre, so any pleasure the audience feels is shared by the killer.
Vertigo and Psycho played with this same theme of voyeurism and the male gaze, but never went as direct as Peeping Tom. Peeping Tom's cinematic form is a literal expression of the killer's perversion and proof that cinema's gaze is inescapably controlling and susceptible to violence.
Peeping Tom explores those themes with a creepy derangement. The story has a sickening balance between tension and sympathy as it follows the killer in his day-to-day life.
Mark Lewis is a polite, mild-mannered recluse, someone you wouldn't suspect to be a murderer, and it's horrifying to see Mark's psychology unravelled. Karlheinz Boehm gives a tortured performance reminiscent of Peter Lorre from M and he's engaging to watch and pretty tragic.
Michael Powell's penchant for classical beauty with his stunning cinematography and bright colours is turned on its head by Peeping Tom. Powell's classicism becomes toxic as it illuminates psychotic violence. It's incredible to see Powell reach Peeping Tom's conclusions about movies and voyeurism this late in his career, especially when he's known for passionate romanticism. It's also brutal critics ended Powell's career after Peeping Tom.
At the very least, Powell made a great movie. Peeping Tom is an unlikely horror classic. A creepy and powerful psychological treatise on cinema and violence.",4.5

"It seems almost a reflex to compare this to Psycho since they came out within months of each other, but I have always wondered why that film was accepted as white-knuckle entertainment and a return to form for Hitchcock while Peeping Tom effectively ended Michael Powell’s career. I think the answer lies in this film’s use of first person camera, which in its immediacy and realism had no cinematic precedent and was still shocking audiences at the turn of the millennium in The Blair Witch Project. But in 1960, Peeping Tom implicated audiences in its sadism to a greater extent than any movie that preceded it. The act of watching is the act of encouraging, of keeping the gate open and the film rolling as disbelief turns to terror turns to despair, and we are all leering and being leered at as death, our final satisfaction, approaches.",0.0

"It’s somewhat fitting that, in my beginning with the films of Michael Powell and Orville Pressburger, I start not with movies like Black Narcissus or The Red Shoes, movies that are part of a high-art milieu, and in the latter case is about one of the highest and most demanding of arts, ballet. I start instead with the movie that wrecked Michael Powell’s career — a devious, disturbing, unsettling horror film about filmmaking, about voyeurism, strikingly and unrespectably called Peeping Tom.

In our age where we are stunned, inundated, desensitized with graphic violence and extremity in the various slasher films we are privileged with, and in comparison to movies that just a few years later would become more unflinching, and even in comparison with Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, Peeping Tom is comparatively subdued, less filled with dread throughout, leavened with moments that feel “relaxed,” but not without menace.
But I can see, in its strikingly disturbing color and in its locking in with the perspective of a disturbed and psychologically troubled murderer, why this movie wrecked the career of Michael Powell. 
Without having yet seen any of his other movies, I can imagine a movie viewer with the impression of The Red Shoes, a high-art movie about the irreconcilability of high art and love, put to musical and visual beauty, would be struck by what seemed lower-culture, gritty, pulpy. Moira Shearer, there a ballet dancer, is here dancing freely, but not to anything “high.” Instead, she’s dancing to jazz, and seems very carefree right before she’s murdered and confronted with her own death.
Not less than that, the opening gives us a distorted, camera-focused view of our first victim; not the killer himself, but, in a sense, a disembodied camera. And we are, as a viewer, the cameraman, making the movie, as the character, Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is making the movie. And then we cut to that murder in its filmed version, and the killer sitting in the projection room. And cut. 
Already in that opening you have so much packed in there: the metaphor and theme of filmmaking, psychosis, sexual oddities, murder; and the audience’s complicity with the murderer as filmmaker, the audience’s own peeping-tom scoptophilia, the voyeurism not absent in the film camera.
Laura Mulvey’s Criterion essay quite brilliantly states the key about Peeping Tom:
Peeping Tom, as its title implies, is overtly about voyeuristic sadism. Its central character is a young cameraman and thus the story of voyeuristic perversion is, equally overtly, set within the film industry and the cinema itself, foregrounding its mechanisms of looking, and the gender divide that separates the secret observer (male) from the object of his gaze (female). The cinema spectator’s own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist.
And what is striking from this opening throughout, is that this movie will be insistently about the image, about the movie, and about itself. Again Mulvey:
Peeping Tom is a film of many layers and masks; its first reviewers were unable even to see it at face value. Entrenched in the traditions of English realism, these early critics saw an immoral film set in real life whose ironic comment on the mechanics of film spectatorship and identification confused them as viewers. But Peeping Tom offers realistic cinematic images that relate to the cinema and nothing more. It creates a magic space for its fiction somewhere between the camera’s lens and the projector’s beam of light on the screen.
And it’s telling that this movie about movies is a movie about fear, violence, sexuality, trauma, the psyche, the mind, the eye. All baked into cinema itself. Some of the earliest movies were horror films engaged with the fantastical and the psychological. Another great movie about movies, Sunset Boulevard, is itself a movie with elements of horror and Gothic. And as a work of art about art, Peeping Tom, in my mind, has so many affinities with Edgar Allan Poe, who strove for the strange, the beautiful, the shocking, and who wrote in all of this about art and the artistic process. This self-reflexive meta-cinematic feel can feel like an academic exercise, and on one level the movie, with its focus on generational trauma, childhood and parental relations and the impact on a man’s life, sexual repression me and loneliness, the movie is prime-made for academic, psychological, and Freudian analysis. But there’s something natural about how it all plays out, as in, it’s calculated in going for an effect, and it feels like an organic process unfolding, revealing, climaxing.
Also Poe-like is the feel for the exotic, the “other.” Mark Lewis, as played by Carl Boehm, is such an “other” in society. Lonely, a serial killer, cursed with a tormented childhood by being used for experiment, and using other humans as experiments in his lethal filmmaking, and with a German accent in the context of Britain, there’s a foreign otherness to a man we are, on one level, expected to take as a British man. He feels at once a little more cultured, a little more above the common lot, a little more disturbed, a little more sad. We of course follow him throughout, are kept with him for the majority of the film (except for some pivotal breaks), and we know his evil side. But at the same time, by his very foreignness, by his artistry, we are compelled by him.
Roger Ebert effectively says it very well:
The movie despises him, yet sympathizes with him. He is a very lonely man.
Many comparisons, apt, are made with Psycho, and I can’t add too much to that. I also need to rewatch Psycho.
But I thought throughout of the B-movie A Bucket of Blood, about the outcast who is tormented by sexual loneliness and loneliness in general, and who accessed his artistic muse while killing, while filling up a bucket of blood so to speak.
Here, interestingly, Mark seeks to keep his gaze, his camera, away from Helen Stephens (played well by Anna Massey), and, interestingly, away from her mother. Perhaps there’s something he doesn’t want to kill, whatever his artistic limitation. It’s striking, whereas another movie maker might have had him try to kill her too (I know the TV series You is one example that goes this right; so does A Bucket of Blood). 
Brian Easdale’s score can, to my mind, fit a silent horror film as well as it does this one.
And the cinematography of Otto Heller (Richard III, The Ladykillers) is spectacular in its rich color, its establishment of the audience’s complicity with Mark the killer, its effective conveying of the metacinematic quality of the movie.
Martin Scorsese, one of the film’s champions, says aptly of the movie’s quality:
I have always felt that Peeping Tom and 8½ say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two. 8½ captures the glamour and enjoyment of film-making, while Peeping Tom shows the aggression of it, how the camera violates... From studying them you can discover everything about people who make films, or at least people who express themselves through films.
To my mind I’d add, for films about filmmaking, The Other Side of the Wind, Sunset Boulevard, and In a Lonely Place. All about the dark side of creativity, the dark sides in creatives.
There are also some great twists, thanks to the script of Leo Marks. One is a piece of dialogue about the most frightening thing being fear (think of FDR’s nothing to fear but fear itself). And then, among other things, Mark’s final statement: “I’m afraid...I’m glad...I’m afraid,” right before, in the film’s only unmediated depiction of the actual moment of killing. That is packed enough. Is he glad that he’s afraid? (I’m glad I’m afraid) Glad he’s making his movie’s final moment but then he’s afraid? (Glad....[then break]...I’m afraid”
Plus, it’s fascinating how, in a movie that’s not very fantastical, that is actually quite realistic, is still part of the fantastic.
Mulvey states it quite well:
Powell always identified with the “fantastic” strand of English culture, and succeeded better than anyone in adapting it for the cinema. The “fantastic,” or the “gothic,” not only aims to disturb its reader or spectator; it disturbs the boundaries of cultural tradition. It stands in opposition to British realism and merges with the European fantastic, such as E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hans Christian Andersen, and also hovers on the edge between popular and high cultural traditions, marking the uneasiness of English culture, split as it has always been along class lines.
Again, similar to Poe, who was an American author who wrote about the exotic, who wrote like a pop-fiction author and like an avant-garde before the avant-garde became a movement. It feels like Powell’s work, which functions both as a seedily disturbing proto-slasher and an art film about the disturbing power of art.
Ebert’s great commentary on Powell’s strategy is a good note to close on:
He was a virtuoso of camera use, and in ""Peeping Tom"" the basic strategy is to always suggest that we are not just seeing, but looking. His film is a masterpiece precisely because it doesn't let us off the hook, like all of those silly teenage slasher movies do. We cannot laugh and keep our distance: We are forced to acknowledge that we watch, horrified but fascinated.",5.0

"I saw this a long time ago and was underwhelmed. I think I knew that it was a bit naughty, and I was disappointed how tame it actually was. I think if you’re expecting something like Wolf Creek or a Korean horror joint, sure, it’s tame.
Flash forward a number of years I won’t reveal since my age scares even me, and I’m a different viewer. I’m a failed film PhD student who knows his Mulvey & male gaze business, and I probably am a bit more sensitive about the stalking and mayhem involved in these incel serial killer movies. Most importantly though...I’m big on Michael Powell, and he’s got it cracking here.
Peeping Tom has all the things you’d expect visually from an Archers film — intricately detailed sets, meticulous camera placement and movement, and explosions of pop color. Enough to drive one’s own scopophilic delight. On the flip side, you definitely feel the absence of Pressburger; the plot drags and there’s some awkward dialogue that ol E.P. wouldn’t have laid out. A whole side plot about a blind mother (whose supernatural blindsight makes her suspect Mark before even meeting him) would definitely flow more smoothly.
Less surprise then that this is a great film, with layers of film and viewing and spectatorship that the viewer is forced into. Powell extends the gaze — that forced viewing of the director’s visual pleasures — into the screen itself. Of course the actual first person killings caught on film play into this, but it might be more effective when we see Helen watching Mark’s films. Her horror at seeing his childhood films and her eventual discovery of his adulthood films is great to watch.

- Week 4 / Watch a Horror Movie -
This one has been on my bucket list for years, mostly because of how many people compare it to Psycho (which is one of my favorite films of all time).
The similarities are definitely there:
• Focuses on an outsider with a terrible mental illness
• Both of the killers were tormented by their parents as children
• Strong uses of shadows and close-ups
• Striking musical stings
Both of the films would be great for a double feature, in my opinion.
Also, the colouration in this is just wonderful, I really can't get enough of that vintage Technicolor aesthetic",4.5
"Much like M or SEVEN SAMURAI (both first-time watches for me in 2020), PEEPING TOM is one of those seminal viewings that serves to define a broad spectrum of what is to come in many of my favorite genres and sub-genres of cinema. It's a proto-slasher, one of the first meta-horror movies, a technicolor nightmare, and a gorgeous, grim melding of classic melodrama and no-punches-pulled psychological thriller. Since Ari Aster's press tour for MIDSOMMAR in which he singled out the film's of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger as tonal and aesthetic influences, I've sought to remedy the hole in my filmic knowledge that is their careers. This was my first, though it was made by Powell alone.
As you may have guessed, it blew me away. I'd seen the opening multiple times in college—a common choice by film faculty to represent early Killer POV camera work in a horror film—so I thought I knew what to expect. What I hadn't anticipated was the thematic richness or how effective the metatextual elements would be. Many more educated and eloquent than I have extolled the virtues of PEEPING TOM so I'll skip ahead to compliment the talents of pretty much everyone involved with the movie in any way. It looks brilliant, sounds brilliant, is brilliant.
It's a masterpiece.",5.0

"I don’t know if any filmmaker past or present understands the relationship between light, colour, décor and movement in the frame as well as Michael Powell. Look at those wide shots of Boehm and Massey in the screening room, or Shearer’s dance on the set - they’re exquisitely, overwhelmingly beautiful, which of course only makes the ugliness of what lies beneath all the more disturbing. This is one of the best horror films ever made, and possibly the saddest - Vertigo and Blue Velvet (which wouldn’t exist, or at least would look very different, without this) are the only other films which have the same curious, undefinable mixture of the lyrical and the awful. Boehm and Massey are incredible; they’re such fully felt, fearless performances, especially in those haunting last few minutes. The beauty and terror of cinema, the slipperiness of images, is alive in this film. Embrace it.",4.5
"This move was fascinating. I love the subtle self-awareness, from the first shot with the clearly artificial street, the first victim waiting in front of a shop window full of women's body parts. Seeing everything through Mark's camera before we see his face, and drawing attention to the funny and slightly alienated way people behave when they are being filmed.
There were several occurrences of doubles, like when the detective was following him following the girl, or when he filmed the actress filming him. Excellent foreshadowing for the final reveal.
Overall I'm not sure what to make of it, except that it was captivating, well-paced, sometimes funny and I might need to watch it a couple more times to take it in.",4.0

"Hach Michael Powell... Ich glaube du und ich sind einfach nicht wirklich kompatibel. Nachdem ich im vergangenen Jahr sehr enttäuscht von A Matter of Life and Death war, konnte mich auch Peeping Tom nicht wirklich überzeugen. Genau festmachen woran das nun liegt kann ich leider immer noch nicht. Viele der Filme von Powell klingen auf dem Papier großartig und wie für mich gemacht, vor alle Peeping Tom steht schon seit Jahren recht weit oben auf meiner Watchlist. Vieles klingt vielversprechend (Horror, Voyeurismus, Film übers Filmemachen und den Zuschauer) trotzdem hat mich der Film und seine Figuren recht kalt gelassen.
Optisch ist Peeing Tom jedoch großartig. Die Kulissen, der Einsatz der Kameraperspektive, die wie das Fadenkreuz eines Jagdgewehres wirkt und natürlich die tolle Beleuchtung. Zumindest daran konnte ich mich immer wieder erfreuen. Die Reflexion, die auf den Gesichtern der Opfer zu sehen ist, die eingefärbten Straßenlaternen, der kreative Einsatz der Studiobeleuchtung, das Blitzlichtgewitter.

"Peeping Tom is a signed confession from a filmmaker. It's not a particularly suspenseful film; that's not the point. But it's horrifying. We see the perpetrator's MO up close and we are shown the act through his POV in the very first scene. From now on, we are his partners-in-crime, seeing what he sees, and practically encouraging him.
The film also serves as a definitive testament in favor of the argument of not separating art from the artist. For whatever psychological reasons from their past, people are obsessed with certain themes, emotions, or ideas: decadence, dreams, faith, violence, masculinity, sexuality... maybe fear. Powell takes us along a terrifying ride that peered into the dangerously uncontrollable urge of the artist to express. While doing so, the film exploits, scoffs at, and tests our own natural urge to peep. I flinched several times but I kept looking.",5.0

Karlheinz Böhm is wonderful as a soft-spoken, socially awkward cameraman who moonlights as a serial killer - due, as in Psycho, to the trauma inflicted by an abusive parent throughout his youth. Unlike Norman Bates, however, Mark Lewis is fully cognizant of his disorder and seemingly capable of love outside of his urge to kill, carefully compartmentalized via the controlled gaze of his camera.
However compartmentalized it may be, though the act of looking remains a destructive and consuming one; eyes and lenses dominate the screen. There are some really lovely shots, like the protagonist staring through a roll of film as it's run through a projector or shadows eclipsing all but a victim's eyes as her snuff film plays on a theater screen.
It's a simple story cleverly and engagingly told, the kind of film one can easily enjoy watching again and again - if you can stomach the content!",5.0
"Sorry to say, I was not that into this. I was expecting a tense and uncomfortable psychological thriller, but I found the script silly and the central performances mediocre-to-bad. Böhm is fine as Mark, but he over-acts and leans heavily on tics when he has to do anything besides act shy. Anna Massey is straight-up bad as Helen, the downstairs neighbor girl who becomes infatuated with Mark despite him possessing no positive qualities whatsoever (Ladies, if your man declines your party invite and you have to barge your way into his apartment and beg to see his movie and then he shows you a film of his dad abusing him, he's not your boyfriend--he's a serial killer). I almost laughed out loud when Helen's blind mother is introduced. I imagined a comic book blurb proclaiming ""the man who films everything has met his match: the woman who can't watch anything!""

"“Whatever I photograph I always lose.“
It is a story about a man obsessed with recreating the visions of a monstrous creator—for the sole reason being that there was no one else to aspire to—no matter how much harm it causes. It is the grotesque side of auteur theory via pulp confectionary horror. It is like Powell saw the future of filmmaking and this was his gallant attempt to break that cycle. I don’t know if it did more harm than good but I admire the attempt.",4.0
"Resulta casi inevitable caer en el tópico de la comparación con varias películas y tramas de Hitchcock al hablar de Peeping Tom porque sí, es verdad, tanto él como Michael Powell parecen interesados en explorar tanto los recovecos más oscuros de la mente humana como ese proceso de vampirización inherente al acto de filmar. Sin embargo, y aunque esta se me asemeja más a Rear Window que a Psycho o Vertigo –propone el mismo juego meta a través de sendas cámaras fotográfica y de vídeo–, me interesa mucho más cómo el propio Powell teoriza sobre la morbosidad de cualquier acto criminal u obsceno cuando se ve sometido al filtro de la lente –""It's horrible! It's a movie, isn't it?""–, que parece restar gravedad a hechos que se escapan a nuestro entendimiento. Y así, con el río de imágenes siniestras al que nos someten/sometemos día tras día, aparte de ser incapaces, muchas veces, de discernir entre realidad y ficción, nos vamos inmunizando contra el miedo.",3.0
"I've seen this classified as a horror movie. Why? It was about as scary as watching paint dry and half as interesting. ""My dad scared me with a lizard once and now I kill women and can barely put a sentence together."" Oh. What a chilling exploration of the mind. The piano score was annoying and reminded me of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. Terrifying! Melodramatic, ham-acted, and sooo boring. The scariest thing in this movie is the mom pounding down Johnny Walker Red neat. That shit is nasty.
I did like the scene where the actress was dancing around the movie set before being killed, it was the only part of the movie with any energy. Also when the shopkeeper was like, ""He won't be doing the crossword tonight!"" That was funny.",1.5

so fantastic to see something like this - a pretty gorgeous, but so sad, film so ambitious and raw made by a master craftsman like powell. it feels pretty fresh even generations later, somehow so violent but never mean spirited. you really root for the guy, i even had a big huge soft spot in my heart for him by the end of it! i was really crushed. maybe a good movie about what it means to be a son to a father, about the act of seeing and being perceived, about how glacial catastrophe can feel.

"The morbid urge to gaze. Michael Powell's run with Emeric Pressburger in the 1940s is the stuff of legend, resulting in some of the greatest films of the period: Black Narcissus, A Matter of Life and Death, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, and of course The Red Shoes. These films brim with color and fantastical portraits of wartime England. Peeping Tom, while retaining that color and the same precision that makes Powell & Pressburger films so enriching, is a darker and more acidic take on filmmaking. Carl Boehm's central performance is quite honestly in the upper echelon of horror performances, maniacally stilted but still retaining enough sympathy that we are left conflicted by his actions. Famously, the film was controversial enough in its sexuality and violence that it practically ended Powell's career. By today's standards, it's tame but there's a deep-seeded air of macabre and darkness that permeates throughout the film that makes it such a great October watch. And, of course, the film is rife for analysis of the way it comments on the camera as an observer, how images represent the world based on who is directing them. What a great fright!",4.5

"In Brazil, we don't have the term ""Peeping Tom"" so I was completely blind on what this movie is about, and is a crazy journey! The movie itself is a heavy horror movie with so much drama and the way everything is connected feels natural to us as spectators to discover.
The characters layer by layer are revealing themselves and every character is singular, the history is so well crafted and the cinematography is almost pure perfection, the variation of compositions (with meaning), colors used and shapes represented by silhouettes make the movie shines a lot more, I am willing to see more from Michael Powell, his cinematography vision is pure art.",5.0
"From the opening shot it becomes clear that this film is deeply interested in playing around with images. We first see the world through a camera, which functions both as a lens through which the film's antagonist is documenting and seeing the world, and a metaphor for the ways in which we see the world. This fits with the way the camera is used in the film, capturing its victims and then using this image to allow its victims to see themselves from this perspective.
To see themselves as a film frame, one which is able to interpret their sense of fear and offer it back to them as a kind of climatic finish to their life story.
This use of a film within a film, and the incorporating the design of a film set was a masterful way at subtly inverting this stories use of the ""male gaze"", allowing it to function as a commentary on itself. It is kind of ingenious actually how it imagines this, and I would say demonstrates this as a film ahead of it's time. I couldn't help but feel like if this had been made today it likely would have felt the need to make it explicit. This is decidedly reserved, which only increases the sense of dread.
And the colors and visuals here are really gorgeous as well, allowing the cinematography to stand out as a functional part of the story. This is, after all, a film about capturing beauty and preying on fear, which is mirrored by the aesthetics.
This is definitely one I could revisit, as so much of the framing and the way it plays with the visuals laves plenty to unpack and appreciate.",4.0

"My 5th Michael Powell film, and my first non-Archers movie. I really liked this one. It takes all the Hitchcock influence and makes their sexual subtext outright text, and their violence much more explicit. It’s still satisfying in that Hitchcockian sense, while also feeling like a straight psychological horror/slasher film. It feels really ahead of its time to me, particularly in how explicit the movie is—the violence, but there’s also naked boobs in this movie on a woman who is about to be killed.
The camera/murder stuff could feel annoying, but the first-person camera’s perspective is really novel, and so is the weapon the killer uses, which feels like its from a very different kind of movie.
Also, this movie just looks beautiful, a nice update of the premium Archer look through a 50s Hitchcockian lens—the lighting and colors feel very Hitchcockian. Very stylish.
There are moments it can feel a little slow, but these moments are minor and the central performance by Carl Boehm is more or less always pretty gripping.
I’m really blown away by this movie, and this is one I’m going to want to return to. Would be a unique addition to a 30 Days of Horror list.",5.0
"A picture that shows the danger of Gaze. Male gaze. Narcissistic gaze. The uncontrollable human impulse to watch. 
A 1960s film that is prescient. In my life time, the camera has become pocket sized. Everyone is a voyeur of some sorts, and it’s less socially awkward to be removed from the societal fabric and to communicate interpersonally, often through images. 
Culture has become the very dystopia that the film warns against. The male with the camera has the power to instill fear. The knife at the end is the “send” button which has more power than a knife. 
Additionally, the viewer is offered a meta analysis on film in general. Is the Director the mad man? The person who spends his/her whole life trying to capture artificial emotion because of a subconscious urge to push beyond the confines of morality in order to get the perfect “shot.” 
Peeping Tom is a picture that deserves more attention. It was released the same year as Psycho and it is arguably more intellectual. What Powell has done is make a horror film about everything: sex, communication, voyeurs, film, and patriarchy. The lead performance is haunting and the actor made me wonder if he was actually a serial killer sometimes.",0.0
"I can see why Peeping Tom is considered a classic. Not only was it a good 20 years ahead of its time thematically, but it is also at least a decade ahead of its time technically. Putting the audience in a psychopath’s shoes is always a fun time. There was some highly innovative and creative camerawork that tops a lot of movies in today’s Hollywood. And props to Karlheinz Böhm for not only having a badass name but for putting in one of the creepiest performances I’ve seen in any movie. Pitch perfect uncomfortable horror movie villain.
Despite being the first movie with such a blunt and mature subject matter I did feel like Peeping Tom has shown its age. Pacing wise Peeping Tom dragged its feet through the mud, trying to build tension that I never found. It felt very predictable as well, which I believe is more of a case of being copied by so many movies over the years. For as trailblazing as Peeping Tom is, I feel like I’ve seen the coolest parts of this movie done better before. Still worth a watch just for the cinematic history on screen.",3.5
I wasn’t expecting such an amazing movie way ahead of its time. It’s a perfect psychological thriller that goes way beyond just creating suspense. It’s also a psychological analysis of voyeurism and the consequences of childhood trauma. The movie is creepy with subtlety and lets the viewer guess and imagine. I have always been interested in how some movies get the viewer to feel sorry for the killer. This movie is the perfect example. The main character is played brilliantly by Karlheinz Bohm and as messed up and creepy as he is in the film he is also lovable in an odd way. It’s a must see and such a shame people couldn’t appreciate this movie when it came out.,5.0
Six words: Very much ahead of its time.,4.5
"Voyeurism has rarely seemed so unnerving. Just the use of first-person viewfinder shots [+] in Mark's camera are able to create an eerie sniper impression. (Right until the sharp tripod closes in.) And the sheer rhythm Powell gives toward each surreptitious step: a close-up of the hidden camera in the coat, followed by a third-person shot of screaming terror, is so expertly done that his career should've flourished even more. Instead, it nearly ended! The crowds weren't ready.
The intro sequence alone is such an encroaching masterclass. Whether it's the frequent whirs, discordant piano, sustained cross-hair gazes, and even Mark's wordless approach to the prostitute, which reaches its alarming apex as he watches the footage. Aside from that, couples kiss on the street, living room parties occur, and pornhounds enters his part-time job, yet he stares with a fixation that chilled me to the bone. Kudos to not making its predatory nature seem exploitative.
Straight up, Boehm's take on the perturbed outcast is fantastic. Simply because he offers a portrait of social dislocation and quiet menace. ""Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear"", he says, in a manner that's got the stealthy diction of his shuffled footsteps. His chemistry with Massey's sweet-natured tenant Helen kept me on my toes, as well, unsure of when he'd be unable to maintain that charming veneer. Though its film-within-a-film studio subplot is solid, if unexceptional, there's a tense waiting game of any slipping evidence.
Funny coincidence that Psycho was also released in 1960 since its about parental obsession. ""What makes people into Peeping Toms? One of his father's subjects, apparently"", says the doctor to an inspector, after a series of Mark's murders. I can't recall the victimization of childhood ever being so candid in its era. Those back-and-forths between Mark's experimented adolescence, and Helen's horrified look in the studio, also hint to our curious interest of a person's private life. Even Helen's batty blind mother seems to snoop inside his apartment.
Add the stunningly emphatic Eastmancolor for bonus points, too. If Powell's collabs with Pressburger had a peppy beauty, this shows a garish edge that might anticipate giallo. I'm not shocked this film was denigrated. (Ahead-of-its-time in various ways, but controversial in more.) Now it's rightly been reappraised. Aside from some very dated histrionics, which also includes Boehm in the final scene, this gnaws deep in its hair-raiser themes. A complex take on wanting taciturn pleasure from the scopophilic mindset. Desiring that look of slain fear is what made this so provocative.",4.0

"Chased by the perils of intrusion, it examines the uncontrollable desire of a man to peek into others' private moments. A week ago, I was praising Anthony Perkins' performance in Psycho. Karlheinz Bohm's acting is equally worthy and deserves a name right beside that of Perkins. The film is often compared to Psycho given their year of release and similar themes. On that front, I would have to say ""Peeping Tom"" is far ahead of any film dealing in this subject. As much as I adore Psycho for its Hitchcockian traits, Peeping Tom is far more complex and layered.
Its dense and compact narrative accentuated by a plume of lush colours and chilling score heightens the psychological gauge of a deeply wounded person. Far too many people have demonized Michael Powell for this film, to the extent that it almost ended his career. Apparently, the audience found it disturbing and traumatic- which shows the oversensitive British audience of that time. But to speak of Powell's understanding of the craft, it can be best defined by Hitchcock's quote- “Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.”

"Ce film est d'une richesse infinie et je me sens incapable, plus que jamais, d'en déceler tout les rouages et toutes les significations.
Mais je dois quand même dire que ce film est exceptionnel, un hommage magnfique et malsain au cinéma, à ce qui fait la beauté du cinéma. C'est un film d'une beauté esthétique à couper le souffle qui renferme une histoire glauque, une histoire glauque qui elle meme enferme quelque chose de beau dans ce qu'il montre du cinéma et de la passion. Cest un film multiple, qui a plusieurs visages et qui fait autant echo a d'autres films(évidemment les chaussons rouges dans le rapport passionnel et d'une magnfique dangerosité entre l'art et la vie) qu'il fait écho à lui-même.
C'est un film qui ne ressemble à aucun autre, malgré l'influences qu'il aura, parce que c'est un film qui semble constamment contradictoire mais toujours pertinent et cohérent. C'est un ovni. Je parle de son influence et cest évident, déjà dans le milieu du slasher puis il invente en quelque sorte le snuff movies et semble même être un pionnier du gialo quand on voit certaines scènes(celles dans sa chambre noire). Et je pense aussi au film La prisonnière de Clouzot ou même le cinéma de De Palma(cest évident) qui a l'air très inspiré de Peeping Tom. Chez De Palma un film comme Blow out a une esthétique et un lyrisme qui correspond totalement à Peeping Tom.
C'est un film qui à la fois montre les vices de la société et des spectateurs, en les plaçant en position de voyeur evidemment mais parce que nous sommes des voyeurs nous spectateurs. Quand il montre les visages effrayés aux victimes cest comme Powell qui avec ce film nous montre nos propres vices pour nous effrayer, et cest brillant.
Et en même temps cest un film qui ne juge pas les vices, le personnage de Mark étant plus attachant qu'effrayant, un homme transcendé par son art qui fait qu'un avec la caméra même quand il ne l'a pas sur lui, par exemple la scène où il il fait un cadre avec ses doigts ou tout simplement la scene où il observe les jeunes qui s'embrassent avec comme seule arme ses yeux. Mais les yeux, très importants dans le film, c'est une arme, une bénédiction, celle du voyeur, celle du cinéaste, celle du spectateur.",4.5

Peeping Tom es una de las mejores películas de terror que he visto porque encapsula un concepto totalmente nuevo para 1960, cuando salió, y que hoy en día pese a exploraciones de otros directores y artistas, sigue siendo impactante. Empieza así de manera única con el protagonista siguiendo a una mujer con su cámara, instrumento que jamás suelta y que cuando lo hace, no se siente él. La cercanía de la toma del protagonista, Mark, en cuanto a la mujer que él mata con su cámara, es impresionante, se ve tan real y fluida que supera la secuencia donde Regan muerde a alguien en The Exorcist y el seguimiento a la caída es muy bueno y real, dicha toma fue realizada trece años después que Peeping Tom. Una película pionera en efectos visuales.
Me ha dado las mismas sensaciones de Psycho y Repulsion, dos de mis películas de terror favoritas y las que en línea general están hechas de manera impecable. Una joya, un clásico que cuenta una historia escalofriante por lo cercana que se siente, y por la manera tan brusca que se esconde en un joven tímido que siente la necesidad de ver.",4.0

Visually and aesthetically pleasing, but I don't know how it is much different than your typical 1960s exploitation fare - except being one of the earliest in the genres of course. It's sloppy and resembles a collection of cool, chilly and tense scenes that could possibly work in a different context, but edited together they just make for a series of boring episodes. It gets much more intense and interesting near the end, especially in the scenes with the blind lady, but it still is not enough to save this supposedly shocking and disturbing flick. Anna Massey is fucking annoying and gets on my nerves and Carl Boehm gets on my nerves. Great mise-en-scene though.",2.5

I love how the film is extremely colourful, with the whole film deliberately looking like it takes place on a set, adding depth to the explorations of the power of film. And Karlheinz Böhm is fantastic; the way he shifts from confidence to timidity is quite remarkable. Not much more to say — just really enjoyed this one.

"Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is an excellent proto-slasher. We know from the outset that socially anxious cameraman Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is committing gruesome murders, so Peeping Tom isn't interested in presenting a mystery. Rather, it is about understanding Mark and his compulsions, as well as finding sympathy for him. The compositions and colors in the movie are exquisite, as one ought to expect from Powell, but those visuals are of particular importance here, considering we are looking through the eyes of a photographer. As such there are a couple of excellent POV shots in the movie, including a bravura long take in the picture's opening. Influential and engaging, Peeping Tom is a great film.",4.0

"Even without seeing much of Powell's work from the 40's with Pressburger, this looks a lot like a musical from the 40's. It has the same saturated, but natural look that only celluloid can give that I've seen in the color segments of The Wizard of Oz and Ivan the Terrible .
Three scenes of note: the first is the little girl walking in and buying candy while the old man is buying smut, while Mark is acting busy. You have three people who spend their lives putting on a performance to try and cover-up the lives they lead. Mark is hiding his serial killing life, his boss needs to hide to the little girl that he exploits women, and the customer needs to hide from his family that he is sexually frustrated.
The second, is Mark setting up the scene for which he will kill Vivian. In most movies, this scene would be very quick, showing the victim becoming naive, then frightened, and then dead. But Powell indulges in the set-up, bringing out the musical and dance elements that fittingly clash with the underlying focus of the scene, that being murder. We know he's going to kill her, but she needs time to give the dance of death.
The third is when Helen finally realizes who Mark is by looking at the projection of his footage. It's fitting that a movie about, and critiquing voyeurism doesn't even show us what she's looking at. All we see is her reaction, because that's all we really need, even if it isn't what we want. This is the main element that differentiates Michael Powell from Alfred Hitchcock. While Hitchcock doesn't shy away from voyeurism to tell his audience that they're all just like Norman Bates, Powell warns us that if we indulge too much, we may be like Mark Lewis. Mark Lewis, himself, realized that he could end up this way, too, but far too late to make any change for the better.",5.0

#OctoberOverlookMadness
You can read a somewhat short review of this near masterpiece: overlookhotelfilm.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/oom-12-peeping-tom-1960/",4.5
"Peeping Tom predates Psycho slightly, but got none of it's success. So badly panned by critics was it at the time, the film died a quick death at the UK box office, and may have led Alfred Hitchcock to release his own magnus opus a mere two months later without a press screening - the rest, as you know, is history. It took many years for Peeping Tom to resurface, be reevaluated, and come to be considered a classic of horror cinema. It is, then, a film of significance for film historians, and even film makers who profess admiration for it. However, watching it for the first time, 55 years after it's release, I can say there is absolutely nothing shocking to it - not by modern standards, and probably hardly by the standards of 1960. Violence is never graphic, mostly implied. There isn't that much of it. There are a few ladies in knickers living a somewhat ""low"" life. Big deal. Psychologically, however, it does portray a level of darkness and maturity that at the time should have been embraced and admired, but was probably rejected by the ""prim and proper"" religiously inclined elite of society, to which those critics that took care of panning it, probably belonged, or aspired to belong. In any case, it is a film constructed well by director Michael Powell and writer Leo Marks (as good a prototype for the modern serial killer film as you will ever find), with solid performances, especially from Carl Boehm, who brings to his character an interesting the right mix of clinical creepiness and sympathy. That said, it's slow pace did test by modern sensibilities, and the fact that any level of shock is absent, made it rather less than entertaining. For my taste, Psycho did it better, even if this one did it first.",3.0
"This film is acclaimed as one of the best thrillers in history and deals with voyeurism. I expected something terrifying, but that's not what I saw. I got very disappointed, perhaps because it suggests much more than it shows.",1.5
"Michael Powell is one crazy fucker for even considering to make this movie. After his usual output with paired director Emeric Pressburger, this personal experiment with voyeurism and serial killers essentially resulted in an abrupt halt to his filmmaking career despite his already high acclaim up until that point.
From the opening you are the voyeur. You are instantly forced to indulge in Mark Lewis' (Carl Boehm) viewpoint, experience his seedy world and have a front row seat to his murder of a prostitute. An up close sweat of uncomfortable atmosphere to his inherent shyness and social anxiety that almost makes you feel sorry for the character. Before the opening credits even roll you've been plunged straight into this world, and the mixed whirlwind of emotions between disgust or sympathy towards the character of Mark only heighten from here on out.
It's a character study well ahead of its time, prior to watching it from the synopsis I expected nothing more than a mimic of Hitchcock - since it included murders, suspense and the like. Powell, with his melodramatic performances from the cast and even more so dramatic and startlingly vibrant set design set itself apart from the master of suspense. It may include similar techniques in tension, while obviously utilising his own personal genius, his technique is more focused on entering the world of Mark than having the audience on the edge of their seats.
You, as an audience, are fed into Mark's head. His murderous antics may seem foreign (at least I hope so) but his discomfort around people and voyeurism, despite how in his case they are much more extreme compared to most people, are something that should be relatable to an extent. We currently live in a world heaving with voyeurism and everyone is eager to take a peek into each others lives, and with the birth of so many outlets its so much easier. Obviously, it'd be less simple back in the '50s or '60s which makes Mark's lifestyle so unique and alien. He has to be, if he wants to experience his indulgences.
Powell takes advantage of primary colours in his lighting which brings a theatrical visual style similar to his prior theatrical brand of filmmaking with Pressburger. The sets are magnificent and it has all the ticks of his other work, which he twists around a little for a much darker and seedier atmosphere.
Peeping Tom is a classic in voyeurism, it's a shame it created so many struggles for Powell's later career because it showed a lot of potential for what he could later create. Though it's understandable why audiences and critics had such a strong reaction to such a powerful display of taboo subjects.",4.0
"With a 'protagonist' who's utterly psychopathic (and knows it), an up-front admission of sexual repression and a lot of (admittedly implied) violence, it's easy to see why this courted so much controversy upon release.",5.0
"Halloween 2014
1960 will forever be a year that changed the landscape of film. No more of those production codes, where movies only hinted at things that were considered taboo or extreme for films. But than a little film called PSYCHO was released by a little known filmmaker named Alfred Hitchcock. Not only did it have an interesting selling point with Hitchcock not letting anyone in the theater after the film started. But it scared the pants off of people with its legendary shower scene. Also, it had a controversial plot, as a man who dresses up as a woman to fulfill his dark fantasies. No one thought anything could top Psycho, until British filmmaker Michael Powell released his version of a psycho who participates in Voyeurism, his thriller PEEPING TOM. Seeing PEEPING TOM even after its been out for decades, the film is still disturbing even by today's standards. With films that show buckets of gore and tons of sex this film, with its underlining messages, could be more disturbing than anything released now a days.
Carl Boehm is brilliant as Mark Lewis. An aspiring filmmaker who spends his work hours as a cameraman on a film, and his off hours as a psychotic madman who kills women while filming their horrible deaths with his camera. Lewis is 100% an A+ psychopath, who's tormented childhood brought on by his father using him as a genie pig for experiments has taken its toll into adulthood. The opening scene, done entirely in pov. A prostitute invites Lewis up for sex, but instead gets a tripod leg to the throat and her last breaths on film, so Lewis can go home and watch it over and over again. The film pretty much plays out like that for the entire running time, only stopping every once in a while to show Lewis develop a relationship with one of his neighbors who happens to be a women. He is obviously sexually attracted to her, which causes him to have conflicts with wanting to make love to her or kill her.... or both!
When all is said and done. And you've got films about zombies eating peoples brains, or a horrible virus peeling away at the human flesh. Nothing will prepare you for a man who's penis is a tripod leg and he uses it to penetrate his victims while filming them die. I was deeply disturbed by PEEPING TOM, but also admired its bravery in a time where no one would accept it. It destroyed the career of a very talented and underrated director in Michael Powell and set the bar for future films and what can be shown to the general audience. Not for the faint of heart, but will steal the hearts of those die-hard film freaks.",4.0

The surreal juxtiposition of vibrant technicolor and dark subject matter serves to make the events even more horrifying, and Powell's experienced direction draws the viewer into the film's world.
It's fitting that Moira Shearer's cameo as a victim marked one of her final film roles, nearly perfectly bookending her career with brilliant movies helmed by Michael Powell.",4.5
"It's hard to imagine how an audience in 1960 would have reacted to this film. Even thought it came out only a few months prior to ""Psycho"", the vivid Eastmancolor cinematography presents us with a more direct look at a murderer that Hitchcock only hints at and diffuses in black and white.",4.5

While watching this, I kept on comparing this psychological horror/thriller type of films with the bloodfilled gore ones that we see more and more today and concluded that these old films are just more original and bring the idea, the essential horror idea much better than modern horrors which could be made without having an original idea. Just wind some guy up in some barbed wire, roll him over for a few times and voila, horror. No that's not the way to go.",4.5
"This review contains spoilers for M and Psycho.
Peeping Tom is a frustratingly underwhelming exercise in cinematic voyeurism that never moves much beyond being a curiosity. Certainly shocking for the time (it effectively ended the British career of Michael Powell), many of its deficiencies only seem stronger now with the passage of time.
The story is about a disturbed young serial killer who films his victims during the act of murder (of course it's really about the dark, voyeuristic nature of cinema both for the audience and the filmmaker). Because almost everything is shown from the perspective of the killer, the film challenges the viewer to sympathize with him. There's two obvious comparisons to be made here.
Let's start with Fritz Lang, particularly M. M too features a serial killer that the audience is challenged to sympathize with, only M is a masterpiece of cinema that did it much, much better thirty years before Peeping Tom, and that's in large part because nobody, not even Hitchcock, does paranoia and sympathizing with the innocent man (""innocent"" in the case of M) as well as Lang does.
Everything in M from the use of sound, to what we are shown and aren't shown, to the carefully paced buildup and reveal of the character, all impress and challenge the viewer right until the end. In Peeping Tom we're supposed to be challenged and sympathize with the killer because he takes up so much of the film and because he talks about his tragic childhood to the audience surrogate character. Well, okay, fine, but don't expect me to be dazzled by the approach, especially when I'm trying to ignore the Peter Lorre in Karlheinz Böhm's performance.
But maybe I'm making an unfair comparison. The sympathetic element of the film isn't the main theme, and where it is important it's an arguably different, more perverse way of sympathizing because the voyeuristic angle more directly puts the audience in the shoes of the character than M does, or at least approaches it from a different perspective. But this voyeuristic element leads onto the next comparison: Hitchcock.
Hitchcock is a master of the voyeuristic element, most obviously in Rear Window but in many, many other works including Vertigo and Psycho. Let's stick with Psycho since it's the best comparison to Peeping Tom - it premiered only two months after this film and also features a sympathetic serial killer with mommy/daddy issues, and voyeuristic elements.
Simply put, as progressive as Peeping Tom is, Psycho makes it look twenty years old. It's not just because Psycho handles the issues more gracefully (expository ending aside), that it's better constructed and filmed movie, that like the best Hitchcock, it manages to be both artful and effortlessly entertaining to even casual viewers, but also because Psycho just, well, looks (and behaves) modern from the opening scene.
Ironically I was saying just a few days ago how strange black and white was in The Girl Who Knew Too Much but it's the opposite with Peeping Tom: the use of color, and the production design, looks both strangely outdated and overly stagey for the type of film it is. Psycho in contrast (heh) never feels like classic film horror like The Old Dark House does for example, despite the Bate's gothic home looming in the background, and plenty of use of stock elements like rain (and, it could be argued, campy characters).
Hitchcock's decision to use a television crew to shoot Psycho quick and dirty, a complete 180 from the gorgeous Technicolor-saturated VistaVision big screen thrillers like North by Northwest and To Catch a Thief that had become his trademark, was a masterstroke. The decision on Peeping Tom to keep with the same lavish cinematographic style doesn't come off well, no matter how good and technically proficient it may be. Nor does Peeping Tom use color and lighting in clever ways like Blood and Black Lace did only four years later, which opens with a darkly comic sequence comparing women to lit mannequins and later uses flashing lights for a big suspense moment among other things.
Incidentally when Peeping Tom first become famous in underground film circles in 1960s New York City, it was shown in seedy theaters in a cut black and white print. Peeping Tom is inferior to Psycho in every way. In short: I'm struggling to understand the popular appeal of this film, beyond the novelty.
But anyway, despite all this it isn't a bad movie and it's quite entertaining. It's probably not even fair to compare it to Lang and Hitchcock greats, but it is just as I said, an underwhelming curiosity. It has good ideas and even good implementation of some of those ideas (most obviously the camera POV shots), but I feel it doesn't stand out when held up to other films that deal with the same themes. Peeping Tom did however inspire a great many films that were even better, and I certainly can't fault it for its impact on film, nor on its daring approach to the subject matter for the time which is commendable.",2.0
"A classic thriller. Beautifully shot, edited and directed by Michael Powell. Sadly, he was pretty much black-listed after making this film (and the film itself was overshadowed by PSYCHO, which came out the same year). The cinematography is beautiful. The lighting is stunning. The film is a must see for any fan of shocking cinema.",4.5
The way in which he murders the women is so beyond chilling. He craves the fear and power unless of course she is the sweet innocent neighbor girl. white male rage needs to be fed,4.5
"Mark Lewis works on a studio film set during the day and photographs pornographic models at night. Much later in the night, obsessed with capturing fear, Mark unleashes his childhood traumas by murdering women while recording their deaths.
Mark’s two day jobs are on sets, where all aspects are contrived and artificial. A witless comedy is filmed on the studio set where he pulls focus and at the pornographic photography set, Mark is more interested in capturing a model’s hands impatiently tapping or another model’s scarred face that’s meant to be avoided for the shoot. There’s an importance in capturing the “truth” beneath the artifices. Perhaps also a nod to vérité and on-location filmmaking becoming the future of filmmaking.
In the opening, we’re immediately forced to face our own voyeuristic perversions: by being placed in the shoes of murderer during a kill. Mark’s killing sprees caution the dangers of a camera (literally!), the dangers of seeing without looking, and the resulting exploitation once something is captured and preserved forevermore. Such exploitative images haunt Mark as he obsessively recounts when his own father constantly put him under a microscope. 
Visually stunning, the glamorous dream of studio filmmaking is represented through bright pops of color, which contrasts against the dark shadows and red tints harkening to the intimacy of Mark’s dark room. I loved the obscuring of Mark’s face behind film reels, set beams, and obviously his second limb, his camera, allowing him to hide in the shadows until he decides it’s his time in the spotlight.
This was fun and fun to think about, however I have a few gripes that prevented me from really liking it. I believe this was purposeful, but the characters were more like psychology textbook archetypes rather than fleshed-out people, which put me at an arms-length. Additionally, there were a few big, melodramatic moments in order to show a performative nature within characters, but these moments came across more humourous and took out of the experience. Lastly, I believe we’re meant to sympathize with Mark as he’s recounting his childhood traumas, which I think is kind of bullshit as being treated shitily doesn’t mean one gets a pass to be more shit.",4.0

L'incubo di Michael Powell rappresenta una tappa fondamentale per gli amanti del thriller psicologico. La tormentata storia dell'aspirante regista londinese Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) semina il raccolto per la definizione di suspence odierna, un qualcosa che lo stesso Hitchcock avrebbe copiato volentieri. Non è un caso che, nel 1960, lo scontro tra ""Psycho"" e questo ""L'occhio che uccide"" sia per il sottoscritto una sfida senza pari.
Il magnetismo della fotografia multicolore firmata Otto Heller, l'impatto registico visionario, il carattere mellifluo della sceneggiatura e la marcata analisi psicologica di ciascun personaggio, Helen (Anna Massey) compresa, fanno di questo film un capolavoro dalla bellezza ineguagliabile. La mano di Powell è estremamente potente e a delinearlo è l'eccellente montaggio di Noreen Akland, che segue l'uniformità e potenza delle musiche di Brian Easdale, enfatiche e mai banali.

I guess you could say I’m a peeping tom.  peeping tomake-ah five star review 😎,5.0
"""Peeping Tom"" is definitely one of the most interesting psychological thrillers/ slashers that I have ever seen. The way in which it uses voyeurism and the connection between voyeurism and film, I feel does more than just act as an interesting gimmick and quality of the film. Rather, it also makes a pointed observation on the nature of the film industry and maybe just sometimes the nature of people. In terms of the film industry, this observation  feels very poignant in the wake of the recent reviews of ""Blonde"" (Dominik, 2022). For those who may not know the film completely exploits and tortures Marilyn Monroe as a person and as a character. A torture that appears to be rooted in voyeurism and sexual fantasies. Similarly, in this film the pain and fear of Mark's victims provide him pleasure through him being able to watch and capture their pain and its resulting spectacle. I mean don't take it from me, Jordan Peele made a whole movie commenting on how both the film industry and people in general (particularly in the online era) will happily capture and exploit horrific moments if they promise to be enough of a spectacle and people in general, will be very willingly watch those horrific moments due to some voyeuristic fascination with pain and fear.
Overall, I think the film was well-made. It definitely felt like a horror film from the '60s (I am using ""Psycho"" as my reference) but some of its themes seem a bit ahead of its time (which explains why the film was quite poorly received on its release) but also the person who wrote these lines below must be sued:

"Everything, from the brilliant direction by Michael Powell, the cinematography and especially the use of colours, to the performances, especially that of Karlheinz Böhm as the protagonist, to the plot, with the focus being placed squarely on the killer, to the point of making us sympathise with him to an extent, makes this film a must-see for anyone interested in general in the crime genre. The themes of fear, loneliness, trauma and voyeurism and handled excellently, and it is one of the instances when the medium of film works greatly to enhance such core concepts.
The killer being a camera operator and aspiring director, always carrying his camera which he uses not only to document his kills but also as the murder weapon itself is terrific and enhances the meta-narrative aspect considerably. It’s really a film about film, be it through the eyes of the killer and his camera or even regarding the inner workings of a film shoot, which is used mostly as a satire for some, admittedly welcome, comic relief that lightens the mood. Despite knowing from the start what is going on, the film still allows room for some questions left to be explained in the process, up until the end, while an underlying sense of dread lingers continuously in the background. There are some suspenseful sequences that are genuinely unpredictable and work exceptionally well at making the viewer uneasy, much like the film the protagonist is working on. Despite the plot being fairly straightforward, I was still surprised at the ending. 
The few things that held it back for me was the pacing at some points, especially after some tense scenes, that lets the tension wither away, and the fact that it could have gone further at some places, especially when taking account of its subject matter. But overall, this was a dark, psychological thriller that is really a suspenseful ride from the beginning until the very end.",4.5

This was better. The fact that this did such damage to Michael Powell's career is not only a travesty but indicative of how far ahead of its time this one was.
I only became aware of this one via Edgar Wright in October last year. In a Q&A with him following an opening weekend screening of Last Night in Soho, he was questioned about the influence that giallos of the 60s and 70s had on the picture; while those were undeniably there, he marked out Peeping Tom by name, commenting on how that was perhaps the single largest influence. You can see it all over, and that experience definitely lends to how much I adored this one.
The casting is sensational. Karlheinz Böhm is stellar as the lead, playing someone who is obviously heavily disturbed following a traumatic childhood, whilst simultaneously not letting the cat out of the bag when it comes to his true intentions. Anna Massey is a wonderful foil, giving off a youthful naïvety that never strays too far into cartoon territory; Helen is 21 but a realistic 21 that can see when something is amiss despite wanting to see the best in Böhm's Mark. While not as prominent as the two leads, Moira Shearer's Viv brings so much to this in her key scene, swiftly transforming from being giddy with joy to sheer terror in the blink of an eye.
The film looks wonderful. The framing and use of lighting are stellar, adding so much to the atmosphere. Mark's camera is as good as a character in itself; whenever a shot is shown through a viewfinder, there is an eerie calm before the inevitable tragedy. I don't recall a great deal regarding the sound, but I think it's testament to the film itself that something that is usually the most crucial element for me wasn't overly memorable and I still think the movie is worthy of that perfect five-star rating.
I purchased the 50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray to get the best experience I could with this one; an introduction from Martin Scorsese, coupled with Edgar Wright's glowing words, set up some lofty heights for this one to reach but it smashed my expectations. It's horrifying, but it's also beautiful. I haven't spoken much about Powell outside of the injustice I feel for the negative reception this received at the time; as this is the first movie of his I have seen, I don't have a frame of reference of his filmography but such is my adoration for this picture that despite it presumably being a completely different kind of movie, I'll be sure to check out The Red Shoes soon.",5.0

"Michael Powell, the man who did The Red Shoes, comes the complete opposite of that, a man who kills his victims and films them dying. This almost feels like he took a great inspiration to Alfred Hitchcock. It builds up to lead to a good climax that feels like something straight out of a Hitchcock suspense.
The POV shots and the cinematography are well shot, the editing is pretty good too, and I like the acting here very much from Karlheinz Böhm, the leading antagonist. The backstory behind his character is extremely well written and I think it has some similarities to Norman Bates.
The big question is: what came first? Peeping Tom or Psycho?",3.5
"There's a lot of quality sleaze and camp value to admire here, but I could never take any of it seriously. C'mon, four massive volumes on ""Fear and the Nervous System""? The entire backstory behind the Mark Lewis character is total absurdity. The connection behind the childhood fear of his past with the filmed murders in his present didn't quite compute. Karlheinz Böhm's performance isn't convincing either. He's obviously crazy, and the fact most of the characters, including the police, act oblivious to this was bothersome. The best scene involves Moira Shearer's dancing, and just made me wish I was watching The Red Shoes instead.",2.5

Someone told Michael Powell that if you make a movie about making movies you get an Oscar. Then he made this and destroyed his career. It's a shame because it is a great movie, and it culminates in a prophetic vision of the selfie stick half a century before its time.

"Hoop-Tober Film #2
Peeping Tom was very transgressive for it's time, while America was under the thumb of the Hollywood Production Code, Michael Powell pushed it about as far as he could with his UK produced psychological horror
And there are a lot of great things here. The concept itself of the murders is chilling, concentrating on the strained moments before death while one knows they're going to die. There is a fetishistic angle to it, as well, something seen in modern day takes on serial killers but less so in films around this era. The cinematography, set design, and camera work is also exceptional. More than once I was floored by some of the long takes Powell was able to accomplish
But perhaps the most interesting thing that separates this film from its modern contemporaries is the angle it takes on the serial killer. It is largely sympathetic. He is a victim himself of childhood psychological torture, and most of the film consists of the protagonist trying his best not to give into his psychotic urges, where a more modern film may revel in them. This leaves the tone of the film as one of palpable sadness, generating even more sympathy for the killer than would be present in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, released in the same year.
A film professor would probably talk up the parallels to audiences' obsession with onscreen horror to the main protagonists fetish, and consider it a deconstruction of the mass-voyeruism that is blended into film culture itself. The themes are there, but they are not as strong as some similar films that would come later. If the intent was to make the audience feel guilty for watching, ala Michael Haneke's masterpiece Funny Games, the end takeaway may be a little obtuse. Unfortunately, I will never be able to react to this film the way I would viewing it in its original context, but taking the step back and trying to place myself there, I can see why the passing of time has retroactively deemed this film a masterpiece.
Less a horror than a dark, sad character study, Peeping Tom harkins back to a period in film where horror was not considered cheap thrills to make easy money, but instead was a risky venture done for artistic fulfillment of the director, and for that reason more than any, it gets my respect",4.0

"Released in 1960, the same year as PSYCHO, both of them hugely influential foundation stones of what would become the slasher sub-genre. It's interesting to look at the similarities - repressed sexuality in timid men manifested in brutal outbursts of violence - but the differences are also fascinating. While PSYCHO plays out in classy black-and-white, Michael Powell presented PEEPING TOM in lurid colour, giving us a film dripping in passion and sleaze.
Impressively, for such an old film, PEEPING TOM is still laced with a palpable dread. The build-up to the killings - or even the red herrings that don't end up in violence - still hold the power to leave you squirming in your seat, building and building in a crescendo like a coiled spring, leaving you gasping for a release of tension, even if that release is bloodshed. A big part of the film's power lies in the sweaty-palmed performance of Karlheinz Bohm as the voyeuristic killer.
Also, quite cleverly, Powell works in another layer of voyeurism by tying the whole thing to a movie-making backdrop, which in turn turns the accusing finger of voyeurism towards us ourselves, watching this depravity. Yes, certain aspects of the psychology feel a bit dated, but still a powerful work of cinema.",4.5
"‘Peeping Tom’ is a treat. Knowing very little about the film other than it was British, I expected something gritty and overcast. Not so. The colour cinematography of Michael Powell’s film has an effect – I don’t know how to put it any better than that.

"From a technical standpoint, this film is great. I love watching films through the eyes of a videographer and seeing it through their lens. I can definitely see this being the proto-slasher film before its time and the entire scene with Viv was intense and entertaining, to see it shift from  relaxing environment to one of death was really well done. 
I’m assuming in 1960 this was groundbreaking because it evidently ruined Powell’s career. This was a very good film, the weakest part to me was his relationship with Helen. I know it was to try and tie him to some sort of humanity or goodness left in him, but clearly the trauma he experienced as a child at the hands of his father shaped him into the obsessive serial killer he became. There was also a scene where Mark & Helen were on a date and the score was timed perfectly to the sound of a kitchen timer, almost as if there was a finite amount of time before this fairy tale for Mark ended and he returned back to his normalcy.",4.5

"Loved it. Completely captivated by its direction, cinematography, and performances. Especially the main lead. I knew going in, that it was going to look gorgeous because of Powell’s previous works. But this time around with Peeping Tom, it is Powell’s solo directing credit. A film about voyeurism that goes deep into one character's mind. A mind that is fascinated or attracted by fear and filmed the victim's fear with his camera. It is thrilling and compelling to watch a film that has so much going on with its theme.

"Gotta say, I think my gender studies professor would approve of how this film weaponizes scoptophilia against the audience.
This... might just be my favorite of the early slasher genre, taking a spot long held by Psycho. Michael Powell's color pallete and direction feels very mannered and precise (brought out even more in the 4K restoration), not to mention the way he balances the dread in several scenes. The choice in weapon is highly creative, especially in bringing together the themes of voyeurism and violence between director and audience of Peeping Tom together. And it's all heightened by Karlheinz Böhm - who much like Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates brings an incredible mixture of uncomfortable tension and unassuming sympathy to the lead.",5.0
"All hail the genius of Michael Powell. Peeping Tom is the oldest movie I have seen that includes all the best parts of the slasher genre. On top of pioneering one of the most popular sub genres of horror, it also has enough character depth to function as a dramatic character study. 
I think where this movie really shines is it is not just a movie about voyeurism, it is a movie about why voyeurism exists and the forms it can take. I think this approach elevates this movie above even the Hitchcock classics of similar themes. I could easily make the case that this is now my favourite horror movie of all time, but I will need a few more watches to confirm that.",5.0

"I've wanted to watch Peeping Tom for a while now simply for being the first slasher film, but it was so much different and more involved than I ever could've expected.
This is a great horror film, and one where the killer is in a way the one you're rooting for. Sure, you aren't rooting for the actions he's doing, but because of how the film is presented, you sympathize with him, and more than anything want things to turn out alright in the end.
There's so much to love about this. The story is simple but very effectively presented. Though the violence is mostly shown off screen the buildup to said violence is more frightening than if the violence was shown. The sets as well as the lighting, especially in Mark's film studio, are very visually striking.
Even though this film is well known among horror fans, I hope that someday it'll become even more well known as akin to the likes of Psycho, it deserves it, and Mark, with one of the most creative weapons for a serial killer to use in any film ever, needs to be as recognizable as Jason Voorhees in the slasher genre.

"As my first film at the Berlinale 2024, I was immersed in the captivating documentary titled Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger. It was this very documentary which sparked my interest in Peeping Tom.
Made in England delved into the lives and works of two filmmakers previously unknown to me: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Perhaps it was my unfamiliarity with Powell and Pressburger that heightened my enjoyment of the documentary. Every frame resonated with the deep admiration and affection that the trio—Hinton, Schoonmaker, and Scorsese—held for the filmmakers' oeuvre. Their passion and dedication were obvious in every single second. A significant portion of the documentary was dedicated to Michael Powell’s final film: Peeping Tom. Especially Scorsese praised the film in high tones, so I immediately put the film on my watchlist.
A month later, I discovered that one of my favourite cinemas was hosting a Michael Powell retrospective and screening Peeping Tom in a newly restored version by Schoonmaker and Scorsese. Naturally, I seized the opportunity to watch it.
Peeping Tom proved to be ahead of its time. It was suspenseful, gloriously shot, and boasted exceptional lighting. What struck me most was the likability of the protagonist despite his unsettling nature. We couldn't help but empathise with him, much like Helen does, despite his disturbing actions.
The film serves as a portrait of a haunted artist, delving into themes of fear and existentialism. Moreover, it speaks volumes about the power of cinema and the potency of images. The narrative is remarkably well-written, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer's psyche.
Scorsese certainly didn’t promise too much. Peeping Tom undoubtedly remains one of the greatest films ever made.

this isn’t better than Hitchcock’s Psycho, both are equally great and disturbing in their own right.

And I’m not talking about the twist ending when I say this, or even the final shots, but I feel like the ending of Psycho in the police station is a little tacked on and takes away the fun of figuring out the movie on your own.

"This strikes me as a great film for cinephiles who would appreciate the history and influence Peeping Tom has had over its genre, and catnip for cinema bros (in particular) perpetually fascinated like bottomless wells by the theme of voyeurism. But as a piece of compelling storytelling—which for me is almost always the primary metric by which any film needs to be judged—the movie is decidedly “mid.” It is absolutely not on par with what Alfred Hitchcock was doing at the time, lacking as it does any truly complicated characters or even plot, unless you count the hoops everyone jumps through to treat Mark as if he isn’t a serial killer despite how baldly strange he is, loping about like the love child of Peter Lorre and Rolf from The Sound of Music with that camera. We get some backstory into this character’s childhood, which is interesting, and a solidly suspenseful ending, which works and has some great staging. Otherwise, it is simply a movie about a creep you know is a creep right off the bat, killing people in ways that, today, seem less gruesome than the film’s own color palette, and SPOILER ALERT getting caught.
Among other things, the reason Psycho is far and away better than Peeping Tom is because of Anthony Perkins’s absolutely disarming performance.

Peeping Tom is a stunning movie on several fronts. It’s a technical beast, with some beautiful technicolor photography and some gorgeous shot design. It also features an OUTSTANDING performance from Carl Böhm, who manages to garner sympathy while also doing such terrible, reprehensible things. His background is so upsetting, and the way it shaped him into then deviant he became is well laid out. 
There are several sequences I found positively nail biting, like when he’s filming cops from the rafter of the movie studio he works at, or when he has a certain conversation with his love interest’s blind mother. As well as the various murders, which while not graphic, are still pretty unnerving because of the camera conceit.

"A tormented young man tries to capture fear on camera by killing women.
Director Michael Powell often felt ahead of his time and I think this is the truest thing about this film. Released a few months before Psycho, we open with a camera viewing a prostitute being picked up by the cameraman, followed to her room and then murdered. Cue to the film being watched by Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Boehm), obviously both our killer and our protagonist.  An incredible opening which clearly sets the early tone for the film as well as an early influence on Halloween and other American slasher films as well as, I believe, the soon to arrive giallo genre. As we learn about Mark’s tortured (literally) childhood and his fetish with fear (though a conscious sexualization on Mark’s part doesn’t seem apparent) it’s hard to look at him as evil but more a deeply broken individual.  We see it as he struggles with interaction, working in the world of soft-core photography which often discomforts (primarily the casual interaction with others) but rarely fascinates him. Boehm gives a truly remarkable and nuanced performance on this pitiful but dangerously damaged young man.
His downstairs neighbour, Helen (Anna Massey) who lives with her mother, becomes interested in Mark and his work. This brings a conflict within Mark as he continues his killings while trying to see Helen as something else.  Helen’s interest in Mark is probably the weakest point in the film as I never really bought into her fascination with him but it doesn’t detract from the film as it works towards its inevitable end, which I think was always Mark’s planned endgame. Powell uses his fascination with color so effectively, pushing past the boundaries of the time to create a unique spectacle.
I’ve thought about the comparisons to Psycho (because they are hard to avoid), especially the diametrically opposed receptions they had and I think it is because of how the audience saw itself (whether they knew it or not). Psycho clearly let the audience know that it was aware of them (Norman’s final stare at the audience being the most obvious cue). Peeping Tom though, without obviously breaking the 4th wall, holds a mirror up to the audience, demonstrating not only an awareness but a reflection as if saying “As you judge me, so also do you judge yourself.”  I think that is why it was so reviled on its release (especially by critics far more comfortable judging others than being judged themselves) yet reassessed so highly as we have moved into such “look at me” times where more is about ourselves and having become so desensitized about the needs/plight of others. The slasher and giallo genres have ran with this for years, our celebration of the kills rather than being unsettled by them.
An effective film that was far ahead of its time and deserving of our reflection.

“Helen Stephens (Anna Massey) sits in the dimmed private screening room of cameraman Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm), watching anxiously as the young, unsettling gentleman shows her horrifying and inexplicable home movies. She pleads for answers with a telling line: “I like to understand what I’m shown.” One can imagine a viewer encountering Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom in 1960 and feeling quite similarly to Helen, begging for explanations as they experience a work of unprecedented sexual frankness and violent desire. That the film only burrows further into its world of depravity and perversion, without compromising its vision of our participation in dysfunctional practices of viewing, is a testament to its disturbing power.”",4.0
"No one can ever convince me that Psycho is better than the 1960 masterpiece Peeping Tom. Both films were released the same year, and while Hitchcock was rightfully praised for his brilliant directing in North America, Michael Powell was nearly blacklisted from the British film industry due to the controversy caused by Peeping Tom in the UK. It’s hard to believe it considering that the film’s violence is mild by our modern standards, but at the time, this shit was shocking. Fair enough —  Nothing like this had ever come before it. Show me a Hollywood film other than Psycho from this period that had the grittiness and balls that Peeping Tom had. Both films are genius character studies and quintessential slashers, but over 60 years later, it still feels like Peeping Tom is overlooked despite having a strong cult following.

"Saw this with my friend Grace and she loved it. Anyway this is one of the great Freudian classics of cinema and a master class on how to implicate the audience in the horrors unfolding before us. It's like Funny Games but much smarter bc there's no fourth wall breaking, only the sins of the father revisited upon the son a thousandfold. The pacing is beautiful, the editing is fantastic (those cuts of pouring liquid!), and the foreshadowing is top notch. Karlheinz Böhm's performance is absolutely fearless (and fearful) and he manages to excavate Mark's profound childhood trauma and the way he completely lives through the viewfinders of his cameras — his only true friends, family, & lovers (""Say goodbye to them, Helen!"") — so well that his obvious German accent ceases to be noticeable and only reinforces his awkwardness and psychological brokenness. The colors here are fucking fantastic as I said in my previous review; Powell was nothing if not a master of the purest, richest Technicolor around, but here it's in service of lurid inner torment and the most fucked-up recesses of our minds instead of ballerinas & lovelorn soldiers (what was implicit in Black Narcissus is explicit here). The best part for me is how Powell implicates us in the shameless voyeurism before us: we're so used to watching splatterfest horror flicks, explosive action pictures, and war movies replete with piles of corpses that we're numb to what we're seeing. We don't think we're partaking in living vicariously through human suffering even though we absolutely are. Powell doesn't let us off the hook; we literally see through Mark's viewfinder as he prowls London looking for a kill. A lesser movie would've made him the antagonist, a creeper in the shadows who would torment the virtuous final girl heroine before the brave bobbies showed up and restored order. That's not what happens here: here, we are Mark. Mark represents our hidden lusts, our buried traumas, our own attachments and resentments to our parents, our feeling about ourselves and our bodies and the morbid intersection of death, sex, and the camera. If anything this is even more relevant in an age where images of ourselves and others are broadcast from our phones every moment of the day and we can toggle from porn sites to war footage to true crime podcasts with ease. We are all Peeping Toms. We are all Mark Lewis. Don't be a silly boy, there's nothing to be afraid of.

"Peeping Tom (1960) 4K Restoration – 9/10
I had no idea what this was, but they had one screening of it at my local so I decided to pop along.
Turns out this is a quintessential slice of British horror history. It got removed from cinemas after just 5 days and all but destroyed the career of director Michael Powell (A Matter of Life and Death, The Red Shoes). This is one of Martin Scorsese’s favourite films of all time and he is the man responsible for replenishing its reputation as a pioneering piece of cinema.
I believe this is the first film to open with a POV shot of a serial killer committing an act of murder, which laid the foundations for the iconic opening in Halloween (1978), but what really makes this unique is that the killer is both the protagonist and the villain. Rarely will you ever see a serial killer written so sympathetically, it’s no wonder that this repulsed audiences back in 1960. They wouldn’t have had a clue how to process such vulgarity.
This is psychological horror at its best, and despite its age, there were one or two moments that gave me that disturbed feeling that is absent from so much modern horror. A warped little oddity and a great example of what the 4K format can do; the vivid colour palette looked amazing on the big screen.
While Psycho was cooking up a storm in the States, we had our own little Blighty version of Bates hidden away at home. It’s just a shame that Powell served up a dish that a 1960 audience couldn’t stomach.",4.5

Also the new restoration looked stunning. Powell was just one of those naturally gifted image makers, where have they all gone?
On a side note, I went to Film Forum tonight to see Black God, White Devil which I found to be a massive disappointment, indulging in all of the worst kind of 60’s arthouse messiness. But the restoration trailer for this played before and I felt like I needed some exquisite formal rigor to get my night back on track and I am so glad I was right.",5.0

"Michael Powell’s 1960 proto-slasher Peeping Tom is about a man who films his victims as he kills them in order to capture their expression of fear. We learn this immediately, in the third shot of the film. It’s also the masterwork that ruined the career of one of Britain’s greatest directors. Powell was previously known for films such as Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes, and The Life and Death of Col. Blimp. Peeping Tom was found so abhorrent and repellent at the press screening that it was pulled from circulation after two weeks. As a result, Alfred Hitchcock refused to have a press screening for Psycho which was released a few months later. Peeping Tom was sold to a low level distributor who sat on it. The film remained effectively a rumor and myth for decades until Martin Scorsese used his own money to enter it in the NY Film Festival in 1979. It was seen by the likes of Francis Ford Coppola who praised it and it was re-released in 1980. It has since been given its rightful place in Powell’s canon and is widely acknowledged as a classic.
To fully understand the nightmarish depravity that drives Peeping Tom one must go back to the history of its creation. As director Michael Powell was fond of joking “It’s my most autobiographical film!”. It’s also an autobiographical analogy of screenwriter Leo Marks. The protagonist of Peeping Tom, Mark Lewis (which is not quite an anagram of Leo Marks but close enough) was filmed from birth by his psychologist father to have a complete record of a child’s life with particular interest in his reaction to fear. In the real life case of Leo Marks, his father decided, before Leo was born, that Leo would run the family’s rare book store. The book store was where Leo would get introduced to cryptology, at which he became an expert. He was picked by the British Government to run the Special Operations Executive during WWII which coded and delivered secret messages. Many of the agents were young woman, who, if captured by the Nazis would be tortured and killed. Leo knew that many of the girls he sent out would not come back. These incidents scarred Leo and provided him with the impetus to create Peeping Tom’s sympathetic serial killer Mark Lewis. Coincidentally the book store was located at 84 Charing Cross Road. A book and film with that title details the book store and its involvement in cryptology and ciphers during the war.
In regard to Michael Powell’s claim about Peeping Tom being his most autobiographical film, Peeping Tom is now considered to be one of the the great films about movie making and the creative process. It is a true meta movie. The main character, Mark Lewis is given a movie camera at an early age. He carries a camera around for the rest of his life and it becomes his murder weapon. He also works for a major studio as a focus-puller and harbors dreams of becoming a director. He also works as a freelance pornographer. Through Mark’s eyes we see the film-making and creative processes. His father, a renowned psychologist, films every second of Mark’s and the family life. We see much of the home movies in Peeping Tom. In the home movies, the father and young Mark are portrayed by Michael Powell and his son Columba. The films are shot at the actual Powell home in London. In the home films, we see the tyrannical father/Powell directing every aspect of young Mark’s/Columba’s life. This is our explanation of the genesis of Mark’s psychopathology. 
Even though we know Mark is a deranged killer, we have sympathy for him. He had no say in what was done to him as a child. The adult Mark is shy, considerate, and gentile. He even attempts to have a normal life: he dates Helen, a boarder in his home and experiences joy. We could be Mark. And this is why the film was reviled by the critics. They expected to see a foul, crazed murderer. Instead they got a sick, yet empathetic character. They got a lurid, violent dissection of a sociopath and the inner workings of their beloved cinema. The viewers are now voyeurs and are participants in the horrible events. Filming Peeping Tom in sleazy Eastman color firmly cemented the reality of this noxious world.
Peeping Tom is a very dense and many layered film. In the words of Martin Scorsese: “To create anything, whether it’s writing or painting or music or dance or cinema, you have to be obsessed. But one can cross the line into danger, easily. Michael Powell didn’t just understand that danger – he lived it. And he actually expressed it in cinematic terms.”",5.0
"It’s really rather difficult to believe a lot of things about this film - first of all that Michael Powell directed this, second of all that this was allowed to be made in 1960, and third of all that blood disappears when one is stabbed in the neck but I digress. There’s something really quite uniquely trailblazing about this film, and it’s not just that it’s more perverse and violent than films made in its year. 1960 also had Psycho, Breathless, Les Amants, and La Dolce Vita. It’s more that, in having someone so experienced as Powell behind the camera, it’s very obvious to tell that this was made by a true craftsman. It’s not only that Peeping Tom’s content is more challenging for film distributors of its time; it’s also that Michael Powell has used his expertise with the medium to direct this in so utterly innovative way as to only amplify the effect of its morbid thematic explorations. It’s that point-of-view opening sequence, or indeed how the point-of-view shot as a whole is used as a narrative device. It’s how we aren’t shown our protagonist until around five minutes into the film despite the fact he’s been present the whole time, and that when we finally do see him, his characterisation is so totally different than his initial presentation. It’s the playing with shot types and angles, and the understanding of film composition and how to effectively utilise the camera (a particularly brilliant example of this being when, whilst a film is being screened within the shot, the camera tracks backwards as the camera in the screened film zooms in to create this incredibly original and utterly jarring dolly-zoom effect). It’s the typically Archers-esque use of colour too, the boldness of the colour and the strikingness of the lighting. It’s the way this film is edited especially for me: there is an incredibly effective cut-to-cut flow and rhythm which permeates this film. There’s innumerable instances where the juxtaposition or relation between shots or within a sequence assume this brilliant, dynamic effect. The pouring of a drink to the match cut of the pouring of chemicals for film development for instance, or the various scenes where the juxtaposition between noise and silence or erraticism and placidity is played with. It’s also the fact that for so morbid a film, it’s genuinely very funny. I think ultimately, this film is a greatly effective play on the audience’s emotions and perceptions, a heightened manipulation of the senses. I’m inclined to say there’s even something Hitchockian about this film - and there absolutely is for its use of point-of-view sequences, its manipulation of audience suspense, the dynamism of its camera, the expressive use of colour and editing, and the overall morbid British ironical wryness about the film - but there’s also something which remains from those masterful works of the forties from Powell and Pressburger too, however slight and hidden within the foliage of so dark a film. And granted, films like Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes do deal with darker topics surrounding sexuality, obsession, murder and suicide, but Peeping Tom takes it infinitely further.",4.0

"É interessante como a se alterna entre a forma documental e a estilizada.
O documental do trabalho aparece nos momentos em que está acontecendo um assassinato, por exemplo. A câmera possui um aspecto amador deveras chamativo, ainda mais por se apropriar do plano de ponto de vista. Técnicas essas que remetem ao que conhecemos hoje de found footage; ele não remete somente ao found footage, como também ao slasher.
A parte da estilização chama bastante atenção. Ela pode ser encontrada em cenas que se passam no set de filmagem (e em certos momentos na casa de Mark), com isso, é possível afirmar que Tortura do Medo (1960) fala sobre cinema. A obra evoca a manipulação audiovisual que filtra a naturalidade dos elementos do universo, sintetizando assim a convergência atrelada não somente ao cinema, mas consequentemente da fotografia. A capitalização do olho óptico se alia com a temática do filme, mais precisamente com o personagem principal; uma conjuntura manipuladora que chega às pessoas ao seu redor, desejando aliena-las com as mesmas se olhando enquanto são assassinadas, busca extrair o mesmo prazer sentido por ele, querendo de alguma maneira não se sentir sozinho.
Certamente é certificado que é introduzido o voyeurismo aqui. Ele possui um grande detalhe; as abstrações psíquicas do personagem não se confinam meramente na representação, ele se destrincha e encaminha até à semente do problema. Após chegar até a tal semente, se insere questões patológicas bastante dramáticas, onde vemos que de fato afetaram o personagem. A forma com que o filme demonstra tal patologia é curioso, pois é alicerçado à cinematografia novamente.
É proveitoso como é inserido o voyeurismo, pois não se abstrai a ideias como as de Janela Indiscreta (1954), onde somos voyuer juntamente do personagem porque o prazer se prolifera da mesmas origens. Aqui, nossa necessidade de observar advém do belo suspense criado pelos atos satisfatórios que o personagem tem, não dos seus desejos, mas do desejo que temos dele terminar logo suas ações, que emerge da criação da expectativa da nossa mente. A sequência de seus atos tem o poder maior que seus atos propriamente ditos.
A criação da expectativa nasce da estilização em que citei. Estilização essa que não se restringe apenas nas formas (mesmo que isso chame bastante atenção), a conjuntura com sua decupagem exterioriza a fatalidade das suas cenas. Como são escolhidos diversos vezes planos fechados, que surgem de repente, manifesta-se um sentimento escopofílico circunvalado de ambiguidade. O voyeurismo transparece com essa decupagem, pois o o uso de planos fechados chega ao ponto de potencializar o prazer de forma metafísica.

Michael Powell and Karlheinz Böhm immerse us in the lead character's psyche in a way that elicits a range of emotional responses from the audience. Fresh off my viewing, I feel like it's done more effectively here than in Psycho or M, and that's saying something. (Fritz Lang's piece must have been a major inspiration in terms of story and for how Böhm's performance recalls Peter Lorre's.)
The material can be taken on a number of levels. A straightforward reading of its disturbing premise is sufficient enough, but there's also commentary on filmmaking and film consumption itself. And on a technical level, I don't want to say a movie like this is a delight to behold, but...it's a delight to behold. Composition, framing, color, sound, all of it—as is always the case with Powell's films.

"”The morbid urge to gaze.”
Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom, an initially reviled masterpiece of sleaze, suspense and cinematic voyeurism, deserves a place in film history alongside Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho as a trailblazing work for the modern horror genre. It’d make a perfect psychological double feature as well — Psycho had a killer with mommy issues, and the loner protagonist of Peeping Tom is clearly working through some serious daddy issues through his spying camera lens. 1960 was evidently a very good year for respected English directors to shock audiences out of their seats with bold transgression and disturbing violence. In a story of a repressed young photographer and assistant cameraman’s salacious obsession with filming and killing women to capture the look of terror as they die, Powell highlights the inherent voyeuristic thrill of cinema itself while implicating the audience in its morbid vicarious appeal. In the dark of a movie theater, we’re all a little like Karlheinz Böhm’s perverse serial killer — anonymously watching strangers from the shadows.
Moira Shearer from The Red Shoes is only in this thing for like one scene, and she’s such a goddamned delight!

"no funny stuff this time, this is just a work of genius
pros:
- the symbols are everywhere and played with in fun ways. a movie that goes all in on its theme and premise.
- implicates the director, the actor, the viewer in an act of violence. cool!
- the wizard of oz of horror films. every shot is lit masterfully and the color scheme of every shot could and should be taught in film school. this goes for everything. it looks almost hand-painted it's so saturated and thick with color.
- karlheinz bohm is doing so many things in a film otherwise filled with talented but one-dimensional performances
- some of the compositions in this movie are going to be carved into my neural pathways for years. the shot from the rafters? the pencils dropping??
- I guess I understand why this was controversial, but it's hard not to see the sex and violence in this movie as making a point and a kind of quaint one at that by modern standards.
- the dialogue is so fun witty. there's a dry snap to a lot of the repartee between even just the side characters that is exhale-out-your-nose appreciable.
cons:
- none that stand out. the only thing I can say about it that I wasn't in love with was how stodgy it could occasionally be with its blocking for how otherwise modern feeling and dazzling all the other elements were. there's something keeping it from perfection and I think it's the general air of a past era in some of its filmmaking that feels a little unfit for the majesty of the rest of it. still absolutely loved this movie though.",4.5

"Powell's accidental shadow twin to Hitchcock's PSYCHO is enjoyable in two ways. On one level, it's a bit of horror archaeology that remains impressive in how it artfully pioneers so many future devices in gialli, slashers and psycho-thrillers: a killer driven by childhood trauma, the use of POV camera, the desire to kill paired with sexual dysfunction (stunningly literalized in the killer's weapon), the killer leading a double life that reflects the split in his psyche, etc. On the other level, it dazzles as the work of a director bringing masterful filmmaking technique into disreputable cinematic territory and reshaping what could have been cheap thrills into a gutsy autocritique that not only dissects the voyeurism and psychological manipulation inherent in being a filmmaker but also suggests that the voyeuristic impulse puts up a wall between filmmaker and life itself. Both levels connect with power because Powell's direction is so precise and skilled at couching his ideas in seductive visual language and strong performances, with Bohm making an unusually sympathetic killer, Massey making a heartbreakingly likeable love interest who represents the hope of a normal life and Audley making a vivid impression as a bitter yet insightful blind woman who sees through the antihero's facade. Bracing, brilliantly made stuff that remains required viewing for students of psychological horror.",0.0

The kind of film you can only make with 30 years of directorial experience. A foundational slasher that actually makes you care about the characters.

I was really surprised by the plot of this being that its from 1960.
It has a real feeling of brutality with how Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Böhm)
uses his weapon of choice and the idea behind it is genuinely frightening. He is scary when we see him absolutely reeling in his own murderous intent and down right pitiful when we see him trying to quell those same urges. Its a great character portrayal that left me very conflicted. When we meet Helen (Anna Massey) and Mark becomes enamored by her instantly, Hits us with a constant uneasiness that doesnt stop. Hoping for her safety every second during their interactions as Mark unravels more and more. Great stuff!!
This has to have so many film ""firsts"". POV from the killer, close-up shots of diaglogue between characters, risqué photography brazenly scattered throughout and a weapon/motive that is FAR more terrifying and inventive then our typical long coat gunman of the 50s. Maybe I havent experienced enough films around this time (im venturing) but those feel like things that were typically unheard of! Adds alot to the films importance to me (if im correct).

"One of my favourite scenes in The Fabelmans (spoilers till the end of the paragraph) is when the parents tell their children that they're going to divorce. The sisters are crying and Sammy (Spielberg's persona) is also very sad. However, he discovers in shame how, even in such a serious moment, he can't help but keep thinking how he would film her sisters reaction if that was a movie.
Peeping Tom is a film all about that. It's a thriller about the obsession of filmmakers or photographers to capture emotion on film, an how cold, intrusive and weird that can be.
As far as I know, it might be the first movie to talk about this twisted side of filmmaking. Rear Window deals with similar topics, but that film is more about voyeurism as a way of entertainment, and not as much about capturing emotion on film to create art.
It's a very strange movie. It has taken me a couple of rewatches to get into it, and it's SO not for everyone. I find it kind of hard to do so for someone who is not already obsessed with movies. It's just so odd, so concrete, so uncomfortable.
There are couple of things that still don't totally work for me. There are a couple of scenes that can get pretty over-the-top and corny. Even if they don't work that well for me, they are definitely intentional choices. They don't make that much sense on the real world, but they perfectly fit in the world of the film.
This is still a movie by the guy behind The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus. It's all very theatrical, with gorgeous colors, literary dialogue and huge emotions (ironic considering how cold it can feel). The music is great but what impressed me the most about it is the camera work. The blocking is fantastic, there are a lot of very long shots where the camera and the characters are constantly moving and creating a lot of shot sizes within the same shot. Fantastic work.
And finally, Mark Lewis (played by the Austrian Karlheinz Böhm) is a fantastic main character. A very unique and layered individual. Everything related to his father (played by Michael Powell himself, and young Mark is played by Powell's son) is extremely interesting.
His experiments, the way he first appears into camera, appearing first out of focus and increasing our anticipation, the reverence in which Mark talks about him, his recordings and his whispering voice, the way Mark (surely influenced by him) refers to his second wife as a ""successor""...
Everything is very chilling, and probably the extra ingredient that was needed to make this very unique film into a truly great movie.",4.0

""Existe uma fantasia sexual muito mais forte no extraordinário filme de Michael Powell intitulado A tortura do medo (1960), que não trata de um voyeur, como o título sugere, mas de um psicopata que mata mulheres com uma arma oculta em sua câmera, enquanto as fotografa. Ele não encosta nem uma vez em seus temas. Não deseja seus corpos; quer a presença delas na forma de imagens em filme — as imagens que as mostram experimentando a própria morte —,
que ele projeta numa tela, em casa, para seu prazer solitário. O filme supõe uma ligação entre impotência e agressão, entre o olhar profissionalizado e a crueldade, que aponta para a fantasia central, ligada à câmera.

"Hooptober watch #23
Category: 1960s
This is a great movie all about psychosis, obsession and filmmaking. In some circles, this is regarded as the first “slasher” (have you seen Scream 4?!), predating even Hitchcock’s Psycho by a few months. I can see that, but it focuses more on the psychology than violence.
This movie was really well shot, smartly written with interesting characters, and some of the scenarios felt pretty intense for a British movie in 1960. Directed by Michael Powell, a revered classic British filmmaker, Peeping Tom almost ruined his career when it came out in 1960. British critics couldn’t get down with its unsavory subject matter. It’s really interesting to read about, especially since decades later critics pivoted to hailing it as one of the greatest British films of all time.
This really felt like a classic, probably the best of the Hooptober bunch so far! 8 more to go…",4.0
"Câmera Obscura
Caderno 11, 13 de agosto de 2021
―――――
O apartamento estava silencioso como poucas vezes desde que nos mudamos para cá. Depois de muito ponderar sobre o que assistiria naquele início de noite, optei por Os Pássaros [The Birds, 1963], de Alfred Hitchcock. Nessa revisão, um momento em particular me chamou bastante atenção. Ele acontece logo após o grande ataque dos pássaros, já perto do desfecho do filme. Melanie (Tippi Hedren) consegue ser resgatada por Mitch (Rod Taylor) e ele a carrega, nos braços, até o sofá da sala. Não havia mais luzes, o silêncio ensurdecedor dos pássaros se torna barulhento e as chamas do fogo queimando a madeira são as únicas coisas que podemos ouvir. Hitchcock fecha as lentes da câmera no rosto machucado de Melanie. Estamos tão próximos dela que a textura do filme quase torna-se semelhante a um toque na pele. Até que ela abre os olhos, olha diretamente para a câmera e a afasta com as mãos.
Esse simples movimento realizado por ela e, consequentemente, pela câmera, me fez lembrar da minha natureza como espectador de cinema. Gosto muito de algo que Jean Cocteau disse e foi lembrado por André Bazin em um de seus artigos: que a arte cinematográfica era como se estivéssemos olhando os acontecimentos pelo buraco da fechadura. Gosto ainda mais de quando ele escreve sobre a “impressão de violação de domicílio, a quase-obscenidade do ‘ver’.”. Era justamente essa descrição que havia me desconcertado completamente naquele instante em que Melanie nos expulsa da sala. Estávamos ali dentro, assistindo a uma brutal violência e sem nada a fazer, porque somos voyeurs, olhando prazerosamente e sem conseguir desviar o olhar até termos o desfecho que nos é entregue apenas quando o carro atravessa os pássaros. Coincidentemente, no dia anterior, havia assistido a um outro filme que me fez lembrar dessa natureza: A Tortura do Medo [Peeping Tom, 1960], de Michael Powell.
A matéria-prima, tanto do filme de Hitchcock, quanto de Powell, é o terror. Mas se no filme do “mestre do suspense” ele vai se instalando aos poucos, no final de cada cena, até chegar ao ápice na cena da escola, no projeto de Powell o medo está presente desde os primeiros minutos, na personificado no protagonista e naquilo que Melanie espantou com tanta voracidade na cena mencionada: a câmera. Uma das ideias que mais me fascina com relação à fotografia é aquela que diz que as lentes capturam a alma. Barthes, em seu ensaio A Câmara Clara, discorre sobre a tal “microexperiência da morte”, o momento em que o spectrum, isto é, a pessoa fotografada, não é nem sujeito nem objeto. Mas, dos estudos sobre a fotografia, um se destaca: a ideia de que a câmera é como uma arma e que o dedo do fotógrafo é o órgão mais assustador, porque se assemelha a um assassino apertando o gatilho.
Michael Powell abre seu filme com o olho de seu protagonista, nos fitando diretamente. Um corte, e vemos a vítima olhando a vitrine de uma loja. Logo, distante, observamos nosso protagonista caminhando em direção a essa mulher. Powell leva sua lente para a câmera que Mark (Karlheinz Böhm) carrega embaixo de seu sobretudo. Pouco a pouco, um objeto filmador se aproxima do outro, transformando nosso olho no olho do protagonista. Nos posicionamos, então, através da câmera subjetiva que se aproxima de sua vítima. As cruzes que cortam a tela parecem um alvo. A câmera que Mark carrega é uma Super 8 com 3 lentes, numa alusão direta aos revólveres com 6 balas. Acompanhamos o caminhar dessa mulher já sabendo o seu destino. Cada passo dela, registrado pela câmera, vai matando-a aos poucos. Quando trancados, a cruz do enquadramento vai se aproximando do rosto dela, e tudo o que vemos é medo, muito semelhante àquele vivenciado por Melanie.
Nos adiantemos para uma determinada cena já na segunda metade do filme. Mais um crime aconteceu e os policiais estão indo até o local. No carro, um deles diz que nunca viu ninguém com aquela expressão de terror. Ora, por que a fotografia do rosto de uma pessoa morta provocou tanto terror naquele que já viu diversas imagens semelhantes? Justamente porque a imagem fotográfica consegue capturar algo de estranho quando o corpo não posa, o que denomino aqui de eidolon — a imagem espiritual. Ver essa expressão no rosto de seus spectrums provoca em Mark um prazer imensurável. O que Mark registra com sua câmera nada mais é do que uma imagem erótica, completamente oposta às pornográficas que ele mesmo tira e que são vendidas na loja. Na imagem erótica, a sensualidade é apenas sugerida e o punctum, ou seja, aquele detalhe que nos chama atenção na imagem fotográfica, está no terror dos olhos das mulheres assassinadas.
Mas voltemos para o que acontece logo após o assassinato no início do filme. Mark está diante de uma tela assistindo ao crime que acabou de cometer, sentindo um gozo imensurável, representado pelo corpo dele levantando-se em êxtase e sentando logo depois. Uma nova dimensão se instala: a do cinema. Assim como Mark, estamos imersos na atmosfera de voyeurismo. Nós, que assistimos a filmes, somos escopofílicos, ou seja, sentimos prazer ao olhar as vulnerabilidades dos outros. Tanto o movimento de Melanie quanto o ato de Mark de assistir às mortes nos lembra que estamos constantemente invadindo espaços e, como bem lembra Bazin em outro artigo, profanando corpos. Laura Mulvey, diz que “o cinema oferece um número de prazeres possíveis” e vivenciamos todos eles sem hora para encerrar, porque o filme acaba, mas logo vem o próximo, para nos extasiar ainda mais com as vidas alheias.",0.0

"Had to watch something special for my 2,000th logged film. This infamous tale of voyeurism and perversion feels incredibly ahead of its time psychologically, exploring the deleterious and corrupting effects of obsession with one’s art form on their psyche. Hell, the concept of Mark’s father filming him every day of his life as an experiment feels frighteningly prescient in an age where family vloggers exploit their children’s lives for monetary gain. But Mark Lewis is a true believer, not doing what he’s doing for any purpose other than the art of it itself. Oftentimes the dialogue and style of acting seem less cutting edge than the thematic content, leaving the film feeling very dated at times, even if charmingly so. But every frame seems to be more gorgeous than the last, the composition, lighting, and use of color are so striking that you might forget this film came out so long ago. Very glad to have finally watched this. Powell was interrogating the idea of filmic obsession long before anyone else, and honestly its much more effective commentary because of it.",4.0

"Bricht man die Handlung aufs Wesentliche herunter, lässt sich Peeping Toms Rolle als Urgroßvater des Slasherfilms durchaus nachvollziehen: Ein sozial und psychisch abgekapselter Mann schleicht nachts herum und bringt freizügige, junge Frauen mittels eines selbstgebastelten Schlitzerwerkzeugs um, was sich - nunja - auf eine traumatisierende Kindheitserfahrung zurück führen lässt. Da grüßt nicht nur der im selben Jahr erschienene Psycho um die Ecke, sondern auch Halloween und Freitag der 13. 
Ganz so klar funktioniert die Slasher-Formel 1960 aber natürlich noch nicht, und so ist „Augen der Angst“ in erster Linie ein psychologischer Kriminalfilm. Schade, dass man sich nicht ganz und gar auf die für damalige Verhältnisse sicherlich schockierende Prämisse des meuchelnden Voyeurs verlassen und einen konsequenterweise auch ganz und gar „schockierenden“ Film gedreht hat. Stattdessen kredenzt Regisseur Michael Powell ein latent anstrengendes Liebes-Kammerspiel, das bisweilen wie ein in Schieflage geratener Hitchcock wirkt. 
Die merkwürdig bunt ausgeleuchteten Kulissen unterstreichen das theaterhafte Spiel noch, welches seine Spannung viel zu oft in überdramatisierten und uferlosen Dialogen sucht (und nicht findet). So bleibt Peeping Tom ein interessantes Kuriosum und gelegentlich beklemmendes Psychogramm, aber sechs Jahrzehnte nach Erscheinen auch recht steifes Relikt seiner Zeit.",3.0

It was tangible how influential this one has been on the Giallo movement, utterly some of Argento's movies. The beginning with a pong travelling was very creepy and reminiscent of Argento. All in all, i was very amused with this one., showing what a good and stylish filmmaker Powell is!",0.0
"Both this and Psycho came out the same year. When comparing the two and talking about the origins of horror the obvious answer is Psycho. Psycho had a wider release, was seen by more, and is the better movie. Why is it the better movie? For a number of reasons. Anthony Perkins makes a more convincing insane person than Karlheinz Böhm does. Alfred Hitchcock's camera work is more innovative than Michael Powell's camera work. Peeping Tom had trouble with its release meaning Psycho was seen by more people and on a wider scale all around the world whereas Peeping Tom was not. Psycho was shot in B&W which means Hitchcock was able to show blood when it matters most, during death. During the deaths of Peeping Tom, the audience is met with hard cuts that veil what happens from them. It's safe to assume that blood or not as much blood was allowed to be shown on screen in Britain at the time because it was shot in color and red blood is more explicit than black blood. The victims are also written as complete idiots to the point of poignant frustration, often times choosing to idly stand still screaming while being stabbed and not running away. The killer in Peeping Tom doesn't kill with a kitchen knife which is the most common motif of the slasher genre. In Psycho, the killer kills with a kitchen knife.
With all of this in mind it's easy to conclude Peeping Tom belongs more prominently in the serial killer genre. Sure, both the serial killer genre and the slasher genre share some common ground. In this instance it's safe to say Peeping Tom has more characteristics of a serial killer movie and does not share equal amounts of qualities of a serial killer and slasher movie. Therefore, the true origin of the slasher genre is Psycho.",2.5

3rd Film Inspiring Edgar Wright for LAST NIGHT IN SOHO
PEEPING TOM adalah contoh Thriller Psikologis sempurna dari film yang dipuja dan dicaci saat dirilis. Walaupun begitu, film ini telah mengumpulkan reputasi yang lebih sukses seiring berjalannya waktu, sehingga menjadikannya film ini sebagai film Cult-Classic. Film ini juga sangat mendahului waktu, memperkenalkan ide-ide baru dan beberapa adegan yang cukup mengejutkan.
PEEPING TOM bisa dikatakan adalah film berani, cerdas, dan yang terpenting mudah diingat. Film ini memang memiliki beberapa peregangan yang lambat dan banyak bicara...memang film ini di build secara slow pace sehingga membuat beberapa penonton dibuat bosan, tapi sebenarnya itulah tujuan film ini, dibuat slow pace agar hal-hal detail tidak dilewatkan agar mencapai klimaks ending yang mengejutkan. Film ini juga adalah film yang dibuat dengan brilian dengan kerja kamera yang inovatif, dan skoring musik yang begitu jazzy dan juga sedikit menghantui.
Michael Powell..sang sutradara membuat film ini diambil dengan bidikan yang indah, tentang kamera yang mengikuti kamera. Dulunya ini film banyak yang membencinya, dan sekarang dianggap cult-classic dan dijuluki sebagai ""British Psycho"" (yang anehnya mengingat justru Hitchcock sendiri adalah orang Inggris).
PEEPING TOM Ini adalah film thriller psikologis yang diceritakan dari sudut pandang si pembunuh yang berprofesi sebagai fotografer dan sinematografer sekaligus tukang mengintip dan memiliki fetish aneh terhadap hasil bidikan kamera, yang menempatkan kita pada posisi canggung menyaksikan pembunuhan (yang mengerikan) dilakukannya dan juga dibuat untuk mampu bersimpati sampai taraf tertentu dengan si pembunuh ini. Karena akan diperlihatkan bagaiman sedih dan suramnya melihat masa kecilnya dan bagaimana dia menjadi pria seperti sekarang ini yang ternyata memiliki trauma.
Overall, PEEPING TOM adalah film yang sebenarnya film thrill psikologis yang bagus, sayangnya untuk di era itu orang masih belum memahami tentang film slow pace. Dimana film ini sjuga sebenarnya mendapat arahan yang bagus dari Powell, sebuah cerita menarik yang berani, terutama dari suasana yang benar-benar menakutkan dan dialog yang cerdas.

"This film is so new and fresh to me. I liked it a lot. It's psychologically engaging and has mastered the subtlety required for such dark themes.
The characters were so well-written especially Mark and the blind woman.

Holy crap... This is a masterpiece. A film about voyeurism which actually makes the viewer feel the weight of the perversity of it... It's like Funny Games, except less heavy handed and more symbolic. And on top of that it was released the same year Psycho was, which is incredible to me.
The attention to detail paid to characters and small details that give you information about them is just perfect. The cinematography, the color red, the way that the push of the camera is used and the performances are just all around amazing and haunting. Honestly, this might go up to a 5 after a rewatch.

"HOOP-TOBER 8
8 Different Decades (1960s)
Often cited as ""the first slasher"", I don't know if I would necessarily put it in that same category as it is more like a serial killer film than a slasher. With that being said, this is quite a beautifully shot film. The color is gorgeous, but Michael Powell uses light and shadow so wonderfully, with characters moving in and out of light to build suspense or highlight expressions.
I mean, there are some interesting things that this film is trying to say between voyeurism and cinema. Whether or not Peeping Tom is trying to say that they are one and the same is probably debatable, but I do think that it's trying to speak to our enjoyment of watching characters die on film.
As a horror fan and a big fan of slashers, I often find myself smiling at the various clever ways in which a filmmaker will off their characters. Much like Mark, I find myself revisiting these films and relishing the craftsmanship that makes these kills so visceral and exciting (in this case, he's relishing in his own work rather than the work of another). So really, when you think of it, are we all that different?
The question then moves to, who are the true villains in a horror film? Is it the monster or the killer? Or are they simply just an appendage of the filmmaker themself that is inflicting this pain upon the cast of characters. Someone wrote these films that punish teenagers in brutal bloody ways, so how different really are they from the very killers that pursue them?
I guess this is just turning into random thoughts rather than a review, but excellent film. A true pioneer of a future age in horror.",4.0

"Weaselly, reclusive wannabe director dabbles in voyeuristic murder to satisfy psychological urges.
Really, it's not quite as lurid as the descriptor makes it sound. While there are pinups and suggestive dialogue, due to lost footage there's also nary a direct boob shot in sight, much less more than a drop of blood. The Hitchcock-styled narrative relies more on Bohm's flair for resemblances to Peter Lorre in his halting, accented desires. The symbolism of his tripod is so deliberately pointed as to be gratuitous. Several techniques can lay claim to this film as their progenitor, such as arguably the first slasher, and possibly found footage.
Predictable and straightforward, few of the tropes therein are remarkable today. Performances rely heavily on melodrama, especially near the end, such that it almost becomes soapy, save for the result. For some reason there's a fully fleshed-out dance number in the middle - not terrible, but just odd in its wholly choreographed extent. A subplot regarding a disfigured calendar girl near the beginning is never developed or explained, like the killer's German accent.
Steamy, suspenseful, and censored in its era, current audiences will find it tame. A middle-of-the-road thriller that's colorful and competent, but too familiar and rudimentary as more than an artifact.",3.0

"What the peeper saw.
10/10.
Since first seeing Gone To Earth (1950-also reviewed) years ago, I’ve been well aware of this title,but sadly kept missing the chance to reel in a viewing. Recently checking the listings at the HOME cinema in Manchester,I was excited to find that this was to be shown on the big screen,which led to me finally meeting Tom.
View on the film:
Opening the eyes of the audience with a superbly composed long first-person tracking shot following Dora going up a cramped staircase and becoming the next victim, directing auteur Michael Powell continues to expand on his disincentive use of primary colours bleeding on the screen.
Powell & We Joined the Navy (1962-also reviewed) cinematographer Otto Heller lock the audience in the sight of Lewis (played by a disturbingly meek Karlheinz Bohm) with masterfully performed, long complex POV tracking sequences pinning the audience to a seedy voyeurism atmosphere splashed against Lewis’s bright red glazed directed murder set-pieces.
The first of two times she edited Powell’s work (the other being on The Queen's Guards (1961-also reviewed) ) editor Noreen Ackland (who had been an assembly editor on earlier titles by the film maker) closely works with Powell to pour out ultra-stylised,razor-sharp match-cuts,which stamp an impression of gore dripping from Lewis’s reels of film, which cleverly makes the striking appearance of blood and flesh land with an incredible,off-guard shock.
Recording Lewis’s troubled cameo with a mischievous cameo by Powell, the screenplay by Cloudburst (1950-also reviewed) co-writer Leo Marks paints a detailed psychological killer study of Lewis, which never condones his art of killing, but dissects each layer to uncover the torture which led to the creation of this twisted figure.
Drilling into Horror Thriller anxiety from those close to him getting ever closer to getting an eyeful of Lewis’s home movie collection, Marks chillingly explores in the voyeurism a separation Lewis feels from seeing his killer reel via viewing them through a camera he is recording with,with Lewis placing all his focus on directing his next victims, and treating the killings he commits with a disconnection between the violence he gazes at on screen, and the murders that he commits,as Lewis takes a peak at his next victim.",5.0
"Elegant psychological horror that digs into a serial killer's mind and background, it was for sure a resource for the slasher genre-to-be.

"Great film, glad I got to check it out before it left Criterion Channel, left with a feeling so will be thinking about for awhile.",4.0
"I don't know why I didn't expect this to look like a full-on Archers production, but it does, and I think that goes a long way towards making it as unnerving as it is. When Hitchcock wanted to push the limits of fear with Psycho in the same year, he devised a black and white style that was gritty, minimal, and very modernist in comparison to his 50s color work. When Powell decides to do the same thing in the same year, he instead goes for a self-conscious design sense and an almost grotesquely heightened color palette. Interesting. Feels like it must have been a major influence on Italian horror of the next decade, moving into the giallo era.
Also you know I love a movie that's simultaneously extremely on the nose with its metaphors but still complicated and uncomfortable, and man, this is certainly that. Just a very, ahem, pointed examination of the male gaze in cinema.",0.0
"A budding filmmaker decides to make a documentary on fear, capturing the moment of death on camera, of his victims. The danger of the gaze. 
This is an excellent film premise and it makes for an unnerving watch. The last great film from Michael Powell partly because this film damaged his reputation beyond repair upon its release in 1960. 
It’s a Michael Powell film, of course it’s beautifully shot and well directed. Makes me proud to be British to see such artistry. 
The film can be a little hard to connect to, I’m sure most modern audiences won’t care for this British classic. It does have its fair share of suspenseful moments, especially the ending and a long scene on a soundstage when everyone’s gone home. 
Might not be for everyone, but I found many moments of this film great. Definitely one to watch.

"According to this movie, being behind the camera, as a viewer or as the person shooting the film, changes you. It pulls you away from other people, yes, but the mechanism for experiencing vicarious emotion through a camera lens warps you more profoundly than that. On one hand, you experience disconnection from what's being shown to you, because you know that it's probably all fake, made to make you feel something. On the other hand, you feel a hyper-empathetic identification that comes from seeing abject emotion being expressed right in front of you. There's a real threat that this will destroy your brain.
Considering that this movie came out in 1960, television had been ascendant for no more than 15 years, I think there's a lot prescient in here. Mass media was changing the world and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it, all you could do was watch.",4.5

This was not really what I expected, but definitely not in a bad way. I thought it was going to be far more horror/slasher and didn’t anticipate the slow burning psychological stuff, but I dug it. At first I wasn’t sure about it, but I think Carl Boehm really gives an interesting performance as someone always on the edge of socially normal/abnormal because he’d be really weird then totally normal acting a second later. His performance definitely added another level to the themes and structure.",4.0
"Must-See (Top 4-6 of the year quality)
In 1960, two renowned British directors delivered seminal meditations on voyeurism through the use of young, mentally disturbed, male killers with parental issues. The similarities between Peeping Tom and Psycho are striking, but given how close the two were released it would be tough arguing that one had a major impact on the other. It might be more fitting to say that Alfred Hitchcock's general style influenced Michael Powell's, since there are also traces of Vertigo and Rear Window present here.
Powell uses the film medium as the subject of Peeping Tom, and through an elaborate contraption it also becomes a murder weapon. Mark, the killer in question, hides a blade in the leg of his camera tripod. When advancing upon his prey, he sticks the blade out, gazes through the camera lens, and with an attached mirror reflects his victim's face back at them. There is so much to unpack just in this unique method of murder.
First of all, Mark only appears to be able kill when he is looking through a lens, distancing himself from his victims and examining them as subjects in an experiment, much like how his father used him. He takes on the role of both active participant and passive observer of these horrific actions, but he often chooses to identify as the latter to absolve him of his own guilt. After all, these are just sacrifices for a documentary which aims to examine the psychology of human fear. We are often positioned with him in POV shots to look through the lens, which is marked like crosshairs narrowing in on a target. This visual motif builds tension efficiently, usually foreshadowing a murder, but also teasing out scenes where the climax keeps being delayed for just a little bit longer.
The choice of the tripod leg as a weapon effectively turns the film medium into both a tool that both commits and records atrocities. It is an extension of his body, but also a vehicle through which he can substitute his own body parts - eyes, hands, and yes, an erect penis. He raises it from a lowered position, points it forward as he advances towards his female victims, and then penetrates them with the phallus-like object. He is even seen stroking it at times. I don't think this is an accident. The death of his mother at a young age and the abuse of his father through his childhood clearly affected the way he relates with other people, but his specific targeting of women indicates a misogynistic, sexually insecure streak in him.
Finally, the mirror. It's this late twist that provides even further context for his motives, as his subjection to his father's torturous psychological experiments also drove his own fascination with human fear. It isn't enough that he can see how people act in their final moments. He wants them to see it too. As he learns from watching the footage of his childhood torture, there is nothing more terrifying than fear itself. Though his father targeted children and he targets woman, they are bound by a common fascination - how innocence is corrupted by terror.
Mark is a man whose observations of the world are purely visual, and he himself presents as a handsome, put-together young man who no one would suspect of wrongdoing. This opens Mrs Stephens up to be a fascinating counterpoint, as she is blind and uses all her other senses to perceive the world. She can't see the façade he wears, but she can pick up on the disturbed air he projects, and as such she is the most perceptive of anyone in the film. She represents an alternative to Mark's own relationship with the world, taking part in it holistically rather than watching it through a filter.
I realise that you could make this remark about any film by the Archers, but it is worth repeating. Michael Powell's use of colour is unreal and revolutionary. It is perhaps a little more novel in their earlier movies when there were fewer colour films around, but even here in 1960 it still stands out among so many other technicolour movies of the era. In almost every frame he uses strikingly vivid lighting setups to contrast blocks of primary and secondary colours, and he often obscures his close-ups of Mark so we can only see his eyes, subjecting the world to his gaze. Peeping Tom may have ruined Powell's career, but what a technically gorgeous film to go out on.",4.5
"Holy shit this was released as the same year as Psycho?! Somehow Powell one-ups his fellow directing great in making something that feels even more perverse, unsettling, and brilliant. Powell's vibrant colors makes every second of this movie feel so unnerving like it's about to explode with violence. Powell destroyed his career making a picture that told his audience the truth about moviegoers. We are all sadistic, disgusting, perverse, and voyeuristic nutjobs who want to revel in the sins of cinema without admitting it. One of Powell's very best films.",5.0

This film gets at the universal truth that film boys are sickos and should never be trusted.,5.0
"This is a genuinely disturbing movie in the way any actually horrifying movie is: psychologically. Hower well done a gore scene might be, if there's no psychological terror, perversion or trauma corroborating it, it just remains a more or less impressive effects shot. On the other hand you can make the most disturbing movies without spilling a single drop of movie blood (see Fassbinder's Martha for an example).
Peeping Tom has blood but no gore in any modern sense, its terror is psychological. It is the perversion of the main character and his father that Powell transmits and tries to make the viewer complicit in through the very medium of film. The colors of the movie themselves are reflecting the perversion at display in their overbaring brightness and excess (a trick Verhoeven later tried to repeat with Showgirls). There's some seriously brilliant transitions that are as unsubtle but intelligent as the use of color. The acting too is surreal, unnatural and inauthentic, but therin lies the trick. To use a German actor with a slight German accent (and precisely a *slight* accent) was an inspired choice to stress this strangeness. Even the sound design has some smart, subjectivist and disorienting tricks up its sleaves. It all works together to create this sense of perversion, of something being disturbingly off. It puts the viewer within the internal theatre of Peeping Tom's mind, we are made to - forced really, hence the sharp rejection of some viewers - share his perception.
Although it flopped and almost destroyed Powell's career, the influence of this film can be seen all over the place (see Michael Mann's Manhunter and Kathryn Bigelow's Strange Days for excellent examples where the movie is powerfully influenced by Peeping Tom but still retains its own identity) and it still works in itself, even though its influence could have easily rendered it trite and cliched to the contemporary viewer.",5.0

"What a damn movie!
Directed by Michael Powell (of Powell and Pressburger fame), Peeping Tom follows Mark Lewis, a budding documentary filmmaker who is obsessed with the act of watching and observing. Lewis is a supremely creepy character, and this film's subject matter is dirty and grimy and disgusting. And yet, as you'd expect from Powell's history, it's also filmed in this beautiful, energetic, and most especially COLORFUL manner. Every second of the film just pops in a way that would feel just as fitting for a saccharine musical.
There are so many incredible shots that it's hard to pin down a favorite, but here's mine: In one scene, Lewis decides to share some of his unnerving home movies with Helen, his downstairs neighbor and love interest. As she watches, he pulls out his handheld camera to film her reaction to the footage. For a fleeting moment, the film has the audience watching a film of Mark Lewis filming Helen watching his film. That is the meta shit that works on me every time. Like that 20 second scene was just an instant shot of serotonin to my dumbass film studies minor brain. Love it.

This movie is so surreal. Like it's as old as Psycho yet it is extremely salacious.

"Classy British Maniac over twenty years before Maniac, Peeping Tom is an intricately directed and performed film about making films, a colorful meditation on our obsession with seeing without being seen. Being so involved with photography and power of the movie camera and all that made this just about as heady as something like Blow Up, a meditation on our drive to capture reality on film. Karlheinz Böhm as Mark is remarkable, gifting us with a brilliant performance as our protagonist/killer who has lived his whole life as a filmed experience and is ready to make one of his own.
There's just so much creativity and ambition here when it comes to the sets, their designs, and the theatricality of depicting someone living their life out as a film, casting everyone around him in a very particular role and directing them into specific scenes, usually without them knowing until it is too late. I was so in love with the shot of Mark hovering over the murder scene on the film set, shooting an investigation scene that he put together through his actions. Böhm sells the perfect combination of sexual and artistic satisfaction, and I was so impressed with the range he gives the character. To see his confidence build and build as his film gets nearer to completion, then to see it all crumble away whenever he gets close to something resembling an intimate human connection with Helen.
There was so much to take in with this movie, especially with the final reveal of how he has been shooting his murders and what his ultimate plan for himself in the film was. It's a quick and shocking ending to movie that had taken its time up to that point, a perfect ending to a film about capturing endings.",5.0

"October Horror Watch 2020 #20
There’s a lot to respect about a film so clearly ahead of its time and a true trendsetter of the genre. That said, I have a short rope for cinema’s endless fascination with itself (in which this film is decidedly not the first in any way) and while there is some fun to be had here along those lines, it’s also mired in it. Clearly basing your main character in filming his own murders makes a career at a studio sort of a no-brainer, but I liked Mark better when he was just some weirdo snapping dirty pictures above the newsagent’s.",3.0
"My fifth film by Michael Powell, if you count the four films I've seen that he co-directed with Emeric Pressburger. The first one I've seen, however, that's just him.
Peeping Tom is a psychological horror film about a serial killer obsessed with capturing the image of a terrified person as they die. Carl Boehm stars as the serial killer who constantly, every moment of his life, gives off the creepiest vibes imaginable and yet still manages to maintain multiple jobs, friends who are interested in spending time with him, and a cute neighbor girl determined to have a relationship with him. If you're going into the movie expecting something believable, that kind of thing might be tough to get over, but I think this is the kind of story that can only work that well with that sort of dynamic between its characters. What's really so interesting about it is Boehm's character's motivations and characterization, which have a lot of depth to them and would compare very well to another horror film villain from the same year, Psycho's Norman Bates. This film isn't presented nearly as dramatically by today's standards as Psycho, so I imagine many lovers of modern horror films with frenetic editing, explicit violence, and lots of jump scares, that sort of thing, would probably think this movie is very boring. I will say that I didn't ever feel very scared watching this movie, but I nonetheless felt like it had a really interesting story that makes a great companion to Psycho as well as other films about voyeurism, such as Funny Games or that sort of thing. It's really interesting to see just how effective this film is even without almost any onscreen violence whatsoever. I like this movie a lot! It's not the best thing I've ever seen by Powell but it's awesome to see how good he is outside of the normal wheelhouse of his romantic/period dramas.",4.5
"Weird movie!
The movie’s biggest weakness is its slightly cluttered psychology - Mark has such a crazy backstory, and it’s honestly a little hard to track why he’s doing what he’s doing. And it’s even harder to track exactly what’s going on with Helen and her mother. Hitchcock this is not! “Psycho” is astronomically more connected to its characters and has a much lighter touch.
But it’s fantastic seeing Powell apply his vibrant candy colored aesthetics to something this nasty. For some reason, I assumed this movie would be much more visually muted (a turn to a more “serious” aesthetic) but that’s not the case at all - you can tell from the first shot of the street, with its painted backdrop and pools of amber light. Even if the scene is about someone getting impaled through the throat, Powell is going to make it look like The Red Shoes! 
This dissonance - between romantic movie aesthetics and disturbing content - feels very tied to the central idea the movie is investigating; namely, that movies and images, with all their romance, are turning us into disturbed voyeurs. The movie argues that autocritique through its POV shots where the audience see through the killer’s eyes as he looks through the viewfinder - at a bunch of moments the film itself is so closely identified with Mark’s obsessions, e.g. Powell literally plays Mark’s father in the faux-documentary footage - but also it makes that argument through the dissonance of content and tone. What we’re watching is a beautiful romantic movie!! So much color!! But under the surface, at all moments, we know something horrible is brewing - and the movie forces us to live in that mental space.
Honestly, when thought about in terms of form and filmmaking, I love this. But I wish the character work was a little better or clearer.",0.0
"The opening shot truly sets up how beautiful this film is. Brilliantly shot & acted, PEEPING TOM is a must see & is rightfully called a classic.",3.5
"Perhaps this was a strange or unconventional entry into the world of one of the great British filmmakers, and I can see why Michael Powell's career essentially tanked at the hands of audiences in 1960. But I can also see why Martin Scorsese helped save this film from near obscurity to bring it into our homes.
As a loving fan of the darker side of cinema, of movies that aren't afraid to interrogate humanity, I'm confident in calling Peeping Tom nothing less than a masterpiece. From the incredible perspective shot of the opening sequence to the shocking finale, this is a film which takes ""genre"" to another level. It's a movie that doesn't settle for scaring the viewer for the sake of horror...it wants us to squirm as it explores the strange nature of making and viewing films themselves, ultimately lifting a mirror to is all, as if to say, ""we're all Mark Lewis"".
One thing that gets me, however, is the comparisons between Peeping Tom and Psycho. Don't get me wrong, I love Hitchcock, and Psycho still managed to get under my skin as a desensitized teenager in high school less than a decade ago. But to me, Pyscho remains a movie strongly entrenched in conventional horror/thriller filmmaking, whereas Peeping Tom seemed to have a wealth of depth I was not expecting. Obviously, there is the added artistic merit of Mr. Powell and his crew, who designed Peeping Tom so beautifully, from its bewitching colored lighting schemes to its wonderfully constructed film-within-a-film sets. But what really stuck out to me was the story so boldly told in this movie.
The protagonist of Peeping Tom is treated with humanity, despite the nature of the film's plot, and the dramatic, almost theatrical atmosphere of the movie's presentation does something special with a ""bad guy we can care about"". Watching the goings-on of the world of the film, commonly through the metafictional device of a camera within the story, the viewer is given the luxury of learning and watching through Mark Lewis's perspective. And rather than relying on a ""psycho killer"" premise, the psychological exploration of the main subject here is put on display in a vulnerable and natural way. We truly delve into what made a monster, decades before it became passé to do so.
All in all, for a 60-year-old film, I have to admit that Peeping Tom is an incredibly effective, creative, and unique horror/thriller/psychodrama
that absolutely succeeded in shocking and entertaining me. In fact, near the climax of the movie, I actually thought to myself, ""Oh, this is like a monster movie!"".
With that said, this movie also made me think a great deal, and I simply didn't expect this film (referred to as the ""first slasher movie"") to be so well-crafted or made with such a serious approach to storytelling. I was glued to the screen from start to finish, and utterly impressed by the film's intelligent, respectful, and genuinely ahead-of-its-time narrative. I've heard much about Powell & Pressburger, but if their films are really this high caliber, I seriously need to watch their work.",5.0
"When it comes to a film like this, the lead actor makes or breaks the whole movie. I find the lead actor here painfully mediocre. I always find old Hollywood style acting unbearably corny, which is why so many of the films of the 40s to me can just be unwatchable. Of course there are exceptions that are just so undeniably great, I always adore everything Betty Davis or Joan Crawford does, even if they’re in a more mediocre film they’re always great. There’s also people like Lawrence Olivier and Orson Welles. But beyond that, I can only think of a handful of people that really make the style of acting work. 
I never found myself once really caring what was going on inside the head of our main character, that’s really bad for a character study like this. I kept thinking of psycho, which came out the same year. No small part of the reason that film works is because Anthony Perkins is an amazing actor. His performance invites you to look into what’s going on in the characters head and the off the wall camerawork just draws you further into that madness. 
Here there is definitely some creative camerawork, but if you were to color shift it to black-and-white, I’m not so sure people would find it as intriguing as they do. 
There was some clever sexual and you window for sure, but I don’t know I’ve seen plenty of films from the same time or before that have done it in just as creative, if not more creative ways.",2.5

"He looks like Tab Hunter but sounds like Peter Lorre. The blind lady downstairs loves the drinky-drink. The girls at the NewsAgent are very naughty. And somewhere between The Red Shoes and this embarrassing spectacle, director Michael Powell lost his talent and his goddamn mind.
At first, I thought it would be a kind of Hitchcock-lite, an attempt at aping the master’s style of terror and suspense. And while I was intrigued for a little while, the main pervert Mark is all mannerisms and no real character. His backstory is promising, but Boehm is such a bad actor he can never manage to sell all the deep-seated fear and psychological damage he carries. All the actors are overwrought or look as if they just walked off a high school play stage. Nothing normal or naturalistic in any of the performances (that mother - Maxine Audley - is so broad and nutty, if she lived in Pittsburgh instead of Westminster, she would have starred in every John Waters movie), so the blame needs to go to the director. Not sure exactly what he was going for, but he failed.
That final scene was so god-awful stupid and horribly choreographed (there wasn’t even any blood on the end of the blade!) at that point I couldn’t even forgive any of the film’s earlier stylized nonsense.

"Truly one of the greats! Kicks off with a full-color first-person sequence prefiguring De Palma and then the credits sequence shows the main character watching the footage that was just shot, in black and white, in an image prefiguring R. Kelly’s Trapped In The Closet commentary track. Pretty sure the cuts from one scene to another, e.g. tea being poured into a cup into whiskey being poured into a cut, were an acknowledged influence on how Alan Moore would handle transitions circa Watchmen? (Might be wrong about this, I know he cited Nicolas Roeg as an influence.) This shit is foundational, the degree of self-consciousness of the subject matter crossed with the heightened technicolor artifice of Michael Powell’s classic style is so instructive, really this kind of thing is a clinic on filmmaking and visual storytelling. I learned so much from it the first time I saw it, but it seems like there’s more I could’ve learned if I’d been aware to look for it. Feel like there’s a lot to be learned from this weird acting the lead does, which is so transparently off, but how the women go along with it and overlook it, or how they’re able to act like normal people while still being able to exist on the same wavelength as him. Rewatching this I realize it’s more economical than I thought. I remembered the “home movies” of the killer as a kid but I forgot that one of the things included was him spying on a couple making out, and I also misremembered the lizard that gets thrown on him as he sleeps for snakes, but also I had no idea this was in the first half-hour! Really thought it was later. Also the first time I saw this, I hadn’t seen any other Michael Powell movies, so didn’t know who Moira Shearer was — I watched The Red Shoes thinking I’d see Anna Massey, who I consider the female lead here — so watching this again I’m way more aware of how great she is as a dance performer, how electrifying and full of life she is, when she’s just introduced to the narrative basically to be a victim, and, for the sake of economy, it’s that scene that also introduces the tripod/bayonet thing. That scene also goes a way towards explaining how different performance styles can coexist — Shearer is so physical, and bounds around the space, and then Boehm’s weird performance is all internal, and it can cut to medium shots of him in isolation. The follow-up sequences define the film studio’s sense of space and use it to all sorts of suspenseful effects — obviously it was territory Powell would’ve known well. Shearer also has a tape player with her, providing a soundtrack for her dance number, but also sets a precedent for setting up audio tape as existing in counterpoint to film reels. Obviously, Sisters starts off with its “Peeping Toms” game show but I don’t think Blow Out exists without this either. I wouldn’t have seen any of De Palma’s classics the first time I saw this.
Seems totally stupid for me to provide commentary on something that so effectively comments on itself, it feels more like an essay than a horror movie in a lot of ways, it develops its plot and themes more by a kind of mirroring than by following any outline of genre expectations. I just find it completely enveloping every step of the way. HIs last victim saying ““You’re a documentary and a half, you are.” That Massey’s mother is blind, and suspicious of Mark, both tracks as a contrast to the themes of voyeurism/movies as something suspect, and suggests it’s Boehm’s handsomeness (kinda looking like David Bowie at times?) that’s what’s able to get him past all these women’s defenses. But when he shakes hands with her and the sound mix cranks the sound of his heartbeat, as she’s experiencing it tactilely — that shit rules! Really don’t think I’ve heard that used in a movie since. Her saying “Pity, do like firsthand information” in that scene parallels Mark’s own morbid interests but in her case ends up referring to what she can tell by touch, as opposed to his voyeurism. Another awesome sound mixing detail is the scene where Mark starts a timer, and it gets going as diegetic sound, but that also starts a piano accompanying as nondiegetic sound that’s at the same tempo. This use of sound really marks it as an heir to Fritz Lang’s M. And then it ends on the tape reels, offering last words of commentary, recorded during the killer's childhood!",5.0

"(8.7/10)
Despite its horrifying reception in 1962 that effectively ended Michael Powell’s career, Peeping Tom is an absolutely stunning picture that, unlike films like Cinema Paradiso, conveys the horrors of filmmaking. 
It all starts with Karlheinz Böhm who honestly gives a legendary performance as Mark Lewis. This character was layered in every sense of the word. He was horrifying when he needed to be, but also sweet and dare I say adorable. Böhm does it with such subtlety and makes us want him to get better despite his many flaws. I was able to connect to him through his various human qualities like his filmmaking ambitions, psychological curiosities, desire to love, and his childhood traumas. There are so many motivating factors for his character that he becomes very unpredictable. You’re fearful of his unpredictability because, again, you just want him to succeed. 
The use of color was also something creative compared to most serial killer films. The lighting and production design came off as vibrant (like how characters perceive Lewis) in juxtaposition to Lewis’ actions. 
I loved how Powell’s direction kept focus on the the films message about filmmaking. He paints the picture in a negative light as we continually see how the camera can be a violating force. He does this through the first-person camera shots, the use of the boisterous score, and shot sequences that makes the atmosphere commonplace to the viewer.

"Still feels transgressive and ahead of its time a full 60 years on, certainly sticks a bit more than that other noteworthy 1960 film about a psychosexually conflicted serial killer (as if you couldn't already tell that Powell had the goods from his earlier, more innocuous work - seeing him twist his trademark grasp of Technicolor like this is its own kind of bravura).",4.0

"It's a cliche but this was an ahead-of-its-time compelling (if overlong and plot-thin) thriller that has a better grasp on childhood trauma and sexual deviancy than films made many years later. Proto-Hitchcock stuff from Michael Powell, who does well never to dip into outright exploitation as he very well could have given the content here. Naturally the film examines the treatment of women in the entertainment industry, particularly film and television. Notably, this is handled surprisingly well for the time, with the genuinely sophisticated script including a number of conscientiously written female characters. The most interesting aspects of 'Peeping Tom' to me were Karlheinz Böhm's performance and the astute cinematography. Böhm essentially sketches the blueprint for actors to draw from when playing a sociopathic and deeply bizarre character. He's so upright and disquieting and yet hits the right notes at the appropriate moments to elicit genuine understanding and sympathy (I won't spoil!). The cinematography is fantastic. The production design certainly helps in this area being full of colour and texture, but the camera movements and placements are sick for 1960 - truly radical for the time. Overall, very solid cult classic.",0.0

As I write this I am gazing into my neighbors backyard. Hoping that one evening they might actually find the switch labelled “off” to the light that shines in my room. However, I am in awe of the swirling, inflatable flamingos that stand still in the death of night. Haunting, yet beautiful.
Peeping Tom, directed by one of the all time greats, is haunting yet beautiful. A strange fixation upon the minds of the lonely and the power illness has over ones actions. It is a film for today, strangely. Maybe in its entire lifespan, Peeping Tom has found a home. 
Situated between the disturbing Eastman colour, entrancing piano score, and the great Karl Boehm, Peeping Tom, now sixties years on, is still unnerving. Where its American “counterpart” Psycho is still unwavering in its raw confrontation upon identity, Peeping Tom still never brings a challenging aspect. It lingers, fixating itself upon the mind. Images of Moira Shearer interpretatively dancing, the sounds of film projections, the coldness of Boehm’s Mark Lewis. Where Psycho still shocks, Peeping Tom still manages to perturbe any audience.

Nas horas vagas tem a predileção em registrar os trejeitos e reações de medo ao assassinar suas vítimas, mulheres. Após o feito, assiste tudo em casa, num estúdio montado em seu quarto. Muitas das vezes vemos Mark em plena experimentação do que vê, do quer criou, ainda sem o objetivo atingido. Falta mais, e falta menos também quando conhece Helen, sua inquilina, que viria a mudar toda sua estética rotineira de vida e patológica.  
Mark compartilha com Helen seus experimentos e a garota passa a experienciar suas afinidades fílmicas, horrorizada. Ela, atraída por ele, pensa serem apenas frutos de seu trabalho, com cunho artístico. Helen então, passa a provocar o contrário em Mark, felicidade, impedindo que esteja impresso em seu rosto situações conflituosas, que o satisfaria para que a assassinasse, por exemplo, explicitando enfim seu método de agir sempre de acordo com reações alheias amedrontadas. Evitadas, há imunidade. Mark retém esse sentimento até ebulir.

Watch a film MandelBroSet has rated 5 stars. 
For a film about a serial killer, this was a surprisingly quiet film. Slow and thoughtful. It feels very British. That’s not to say that there aren’t moments of lavish color and stylistic flourish. This is a Michael Powell film after all.
The entire film is a dissection of the killer’s psyche but leaves enough hidden that we get some revelations in the finale. And what a finale it is too! 
Karlheinz Böhm is good as the killer. He’s suitably quiet and off-putting. His German accent nevertheless feels out of place as he’s supposed to be English. Anna Massey is marvelous and marvelously cast. Between her naive/endearing demeanor and her plain, sweet face, it is completely believable that she could work her way into the heart of a shy, loner, serial murderer.

"A pretty big departure from Michael Powell's other famous films, this time working without Pressburger. Maybe most famous for being the first slasher, but I would ague that it's a proto-slasher at most. It's more similar to films like The Vanishing or American Psycho in that it tells its story from the killers point of view. The killer here is a fully fleshed out character that even comes of as sympathetic in Böhm brilliant performance with his Peter Lorre like accent. Something that is in stark contrast to the killers of 70's and 80's slasher films. The killer is even handsome and charming at times, depicted more realistically as in it could be anyone not just some gruesome figure who's as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside. And this actually tries to delve in to the psyche of the killer and explore such elements as his childhood. He's not just some monster that is born evil. And I think its impact on more realistic films about serial killers and such might be just as strong as it was on the slasher genre.
Comparing this to Psycho which came out the same year they feel a decade apart when it comes to how scandalizing it is for the time despite both having the same subject matter. And not even just the killer aspect but the nudity and and the slight glimpses at the city's seedy underworld. And it was clearly something the world wasn't ready for, at least according to censors that is, which is evident in the subsequent collapse of Powell's career.
The biggest similarity between this and his earlier films like The Red Shoes or Black Narcissus is definitely its use of colors. Beautiful vibrant mix of an array of colors in every scene thanks to the film stock they seemed to use as a standard. Not only in sets and costumes but also in its use of lighting. Something that's used to great effect with the framing and expressions. Some very intuitive camera work too, probably most in the use of POV shots. And while it's not the first time it's been used in this way or setting I do think this is where the influence on gialli comes from. A genre this might be closer to than the slasher, only seen from the point of the killer rather than the victim.",4.0

"Psycho gets all the credit for being the ""first slasher,"" but this is the real deal. Aside from the fact that this preceded Hitchcock's movie by three months, it's also much more in the vein of what would come to define the slasher: themes of voyeurism + the inherent violence of the camera, heavily stylized POV stalking sequences (John Carpenter lifted the opening tracking shot for Halloween), and a deranged protagonist killing off beautiful, occasionally nude women in lurid technicolor.

"Any knowledgeable cinephile knows about the controversy Peeping Tom aroused upon initial release: it was met with such vociferous outrage that it killed the career of director Michael Powell even though he was a titan of British cinema. Watching the film one can easily understand why this was the case: although it's not as bloody or violent as Psycho (1960), it does deal quite forthrightly with sexuality and sexual perversion. Although it's not as extreme in terms of content as later films, like Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965), it does deal with sexual topics in a manner that makes no effort to conceal what's really going on its scenes: the main character being aroused by a film of a frightened woman, the leg of a camera tripod serving as a phallic symbol. There's even a scene in which we see a herpes sore on a young woman's lip. Despite how far the envelope of sex and violence was pushed in '60's cinema, in early '60's Britain this must've been seen as not just shocking but downright scandalous. The film also has a perverse quality about it: although Hitchcock was fascinated by voyeurism and the macabre, as demonstrated in Rear Window (1954), this film's depiction of sex and violence probably would've been too much even for him. Indeed, the film is as morbidly lurid as the EC horror comics of the '50's. It serves as a forerunner to the disturbed and disturbing horror films that followed in the wake of Night of the Living Dead (1968); however, its content isn't as explicit as many of the films it paved the way for, like Sisters (1973) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974).",4.5

"The film that killed Michael Powell's career!
The directorial vision behind so many Powell&Pressburger classics, so many honest to goodness all time greats, Oscar noms, Cannes prizes, so many accolades...until he made this lurid, saturated technicolor psychosexual thriller that shone a light on seedy Soho, on pornography and perversion, on voyeurism and violence. Powell's film was ripped apart by critics and he never recovered.
Just a month or three later, Hitchcock refused to do critic screenings for his film Psycho, making them watch it at the same time as usual filmgoers. His film, similar in themes, went on to become an uber-classic, while Powell's film was, for many years, forgotten.
Peeping Tom is every bit Psycho's equal. Where it actually excels over the Hitchcock movie is in its portrayal of Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) - the film is a character study, and we come to feel not revulsion, but pity for Mark, whereas Norman Bates is written and played as...well, a psycho.
Peeping Tom is touching, terrific and technically perfect (as any Michael Powell film) and, thanks to reappraisal, is now rightly revered as a modern classic.",5.0

"قصه الفيلم: عن قاتل متسلسل يحب تصوير جرائمه اثناء ارتكابها لالتقاط تعابير الخوف والفزع على وجه الضحيه اثناء موتها
جاءت تسميه الفيلم بتوم المتلصص حيث انه تعبير مشهور بالانجليزى يطلق على الشخص الذى يجد متعه اثناء استراقه النظر لشخص يغير ملابسه او يقوم بنشاط جنسى , هذا المصطلح عائد لأواخر القرن الحادي عشر كان هناك سيدة نبيلة تدعى ليدي غوديفا امتطت حصان عارية وغطت بشعرها الطويل بعض أجزاء من جسمها وجابت شوارع كوفنتري من أجل الحصول على عفو عن الضرائب الجائرة المفروضة من قِبل زوجها على سكّانَ كوفنتري. وتقول الأسطورة أن غوديفيا ارسلت حراسها قبل نزولها بيوم ليطلبوا سراً من أهل المدينة التزام بيوتهم ذلك اليوم ولبّى الجميع مطلبها لما لها من شعبية كبيرة. إلا رجل واحد قام بالتلصص عليها وهو الخياط توم الذي لُقب بـ""توم المتلصص"" وقيلَ عنه أنه أصيبَ بالعمى لاحقاً كعقابٍ من السماءِ لتهوّره وشهوانيّته
جاء استخدام المعنى معاكس تماما عن ما يدل عليه , ان مارك بالفعل يتلصص على الناس ولكن ليس بهدف جنسى بالرغم انه يعمل مصور بورنوغراف كوظيفه جانبيه الى انه فى احد المشاهد عندما يطلب منه تصوير فتاه بوجه مشوه فانه يهمل كل من حوله منهم الفتاه بالغه الجمال التى كان يصورها ليركز فقط على تصوير عينين تلك الفتاه صاحبه الوجه المشوه كأنه رأى شيئا لا احد اخر يراه واراد الاحتفاظ به للابد من خلال كاميرته فتلصص مارك هنا هو للمشاعر , للاعين التى ينعكس عليها كل ما ترى سواء خارجيا او داخليا
,من جماليات الفيلم انه ركز بشكل كبير على تفاصيل تكوين شخصيه مارك واظهار بوضوح ما يعانيه من اضطراب , انطوائيه , رغبته فى التحرر من افعاله محاولته الجاهده فى ان يبدو شخصا طبيعيا لكن بسبب طفولته البائسه وما فعله والده به فكأنه يريد ان يفهم لماذا؟ ما المتتع فى تصوير فزع وخوف شخص اخر ما الذى كان يبحث عنه والده فى خوفه الى ان اصبح مثله بل اصبح مدمنا عليه لا يسنطيع ان يحيا بدونه اصبحت الكاميرا لا تفارقه , مثل الوحش الجائع يجوب طوال اليوم بحثا عن فريسه واول ما يحصل عليها يهرول مسرعا للاستمتاع بها فى عزلته
مشهد النهايه من اعظم مشاهد افلام الرعب حيث جاء غير متوقع , كئيب و انهاء عظيم لحبكه الفيلم
يجب ذكر ان سنه 1960 ظهر فيها 3 افلام من اقوى افلام رعب فى تاريخ سينما
( سايكو , عينان بلا وجه , توم المتلصص )

In the age of social media, where complete privacy is a luxury we can no longer afford, our lives laid bare for the world to see, Powell's Peeping Tom – undoubtedly his most daring project – establishes itself as more relevant and necessary than ever. One reason we are able to sympathize with our troubled anti-hero is because we can see ourselves in him: switch the antique camera for a cellphone and we, too, become voyeurs, framing the world around with the lenses of our devices, capturing every detail. Nothing goes unnoticed – and yet, in the obssessive need to eternize these moments, we forget that we might actually lose them.",0.0

An easy movie that you can watch quietly one day and after, you don't want to leave the house, because you expect to be one creep after the corner to steal and kill you (true story unfortunately) .
At first I thought the title refers to the character Tom who looks at women, but in fact the title is an expression, and the character is called Mark... Mark's pretty funny (no, I'm not the type of guy who loves serial killers and gets tattoos with them). I like the scene when he shows it, how it became so dubious (the scene with his father filming). Some traits we even inherit from parents, good and bad. It's interesting how he makes a documentary about fear, and the documentary is based on its victims... creep. When I think that there are these type of men and women... (yes, there are also female serial killers and I think it's a movie about a ""lady sleeping with more men"" not to say vulgar words and she is killing her clients... I do not know what her name is, but I know that the actress took an Oscar ?). The acting is not wow, but it is not the same as the one in L'Argent, but it really did it for me. Of course, the ladies make some funny surprised faces before they die, but I think everyone would do it... forget what I wrote. I have to praise the music because it is very good and I didn't think I would want to dance to the music of a movie in which one person kills another person, but there are also gloomy songs that create suspense.

An absolute marvel of a film, with a chilling lead performance with fantastic layers and depth to it, one of the most beautifully and incredibly shot low budget films i've ever seen, full of so much craft and ingenuity built into the sets and actions going on around the characters. There was muitiple moments in this film where i was absolutely stunned by how incredibly done this film was, whether it was the clever dialogue or incredible visual techniques, this film feels so incredibly ahead of it's time in every single way.
Michael Powell is a forgotten mastermind of directing, especially of 40s-60s cinema, from what i've seen so far of his work he is absoluetly revolutionary, from his use of colour and design, to layered dialogue to carry great story concepts, with surprisingly great uses of sharp comedic and seriously impactful dialogue, i adore every frame of what i've seen of his work. A true masterwork of early british cinema, amd a huge achievement in cinema in general.
Barrier pushing, disturbing but with a fascinating gloss to it which contrasts well with the design and character background.

"Inevitably compared to Psycho, which came out the same year, though Peeping Tom was released two months earlier, the two films are set in very different tones despite having very similar premises of shy, sympathetic young men who murder women, driven by childhood trauma. While Psycho is a more enjoyable and better film, it is also the safer and more stylized film, and thus a simpler and less disturbing film. Peeping Tom brings a rawness to the story and explores the theme of voyeurism in a more thorough way than Psycho.
It’s amazing that English critics reacted so negatively to this while American audiences raved about Psycho. Though we see several murders filmed unflinchingly straight on rather than through Hitchcock’s elaborate cuts, I don’t remember seeing any actual blood; death is still largely suggested. We know who the killer is from the start, and perhaps it’s staying with him and seeing him act out his obsessions that unnerved people. Or perhaps it’s the indictment of filmmakers and viewers alike (Mark films his murders and watches them at home; he works for a film studio; and he takes nude photos of women for the discreet pleasure of respectable gentlemen) that made people uncomfortable.
Fear itself is also a theme. Mark is damaged by his father’s experiments on him as a child, intentionally eliciting fear to understand it. Again, this seems to be a direct challenge to filmmakers who create fear (in their actors and audiences) and viewers (who crave and demand to witness others be frightened and to be frightened themselves). I’m not sure what he’s looking for in his murders, but he doesn’t only want to make his victims afraid; he forces them to look at their own fear as they die. Perhaps he hopes that if he can capture the right moment, he can understand and dispel his own fears. That Michael Powell played Mark’s father and his son plays young Mark only adds another layer of meta-commentary that I don’t even know what to do with.
There’s also a blind woman in Mrs. Stephens, the mother of Helen, a neighbor who strikes up a friendship with Mark. It’s interesting that the person who can’t see is on to Mark, at least that there’s something wrong with him and his obsession with film. While this fits the trope of wise blind person who sees what the sighted can’t, it does fit the theme of turning voyeurism on its head, how all that looking can obscure rather than reveal.
Screenwriter Leo Marks was a code breaker in WWII, and also interested in psychology. On the Criterion disc, there’s a great documentary called A Very British Psycho, and Marks said something akin to breaking code being a way to unlock a nation’s secrets, and psychology being a way to unlock the secrets of a human mind. The movie feels like a code, rich in symbols and psychological concepts.
And I can’t end without paying respect to the actors, especially Carl Boehm (Mark), Anna Massey (Helen), and Maxine Audley (Mrs. Stephens). Their performances feel so natural; I don’t think the film would work as well without them. Boehm puts as much sympathy and nuance into Mark as Anthony Perkins does to Norman Bates. Massey brings a genuine sense of naivety and charm to the trusting Helen, while Audley gives Mrs. Stephens a protective and bold world-weary grit. In a way they are just as great a trifecta as Norman, Marion, and Arbogast.
If you haven’t seen Peeping Tom and you’re interested in horror history or films that explore dark psychological themes or that turn a critical eye on the nature of film itself, do yourself a favor and seek it out.",4.5

"The slightly earlier born, British twin brother of Psycho.
Sleazy and repelling, but since it's a British movie from the early sixties, also very mannered and almost cute. In that way it reminds us of our protagonist Mark, who looks like a handsome dandy with the mad eyes of Klaus Kinski. Karlheinz Böhm is just magnetic in this role, making what could be a regular psychopath into something... human. Where in Psycho you only learn the truth about Norman Bates at the end of the movie, in this you get immediately confronted with the fact that our lead character is a serial killer, yet you can't stop yourself from caring about him and his doomed fate. From the very opening shot, director Michael Powell makes you complicit in these crimes and puts you in Mark's place (and in his disturbing mind).

"Having sat through this absolute tedium last night, my only salvation was watching this with someone who was equally inclined to roast the absolute shit out of it. This feels like a first draft of a sub-par crime film written by a recent film school grad who read way too much Freud and just learned about the existence of something called the ""male gaze."" A majority of the scenes go on for ages and never lead anywhere. (Wikipedia tells me that this film did have an ""editor,"" though I have my doubts.)
In absence of anything resembling an interesting plot or character study, Powell resorts to an onslaught of pseudointellectual psychobabble on voyeurism, castration anxiety, the camera eye, and the death image. If you have taken a freshman film course, or you have seen Rear Window or Blow-Up, you are already several steps ahead of this film.
Every single female character is dumber than the first topless blonde victim of every Friday the 13th sequel. Secondary characters pop in and out of the story with no rhyme or reason, many of whom have absolutely no purpose (looking at you, clueless downstairs neighbor).
Most damningly, our titular ""peeping tom"" is quite possibly the most uninteresting, incompetent serial killer I have ever seen. The film seems to believe that a socially impaired young white man with daddy issues and an affinity for film is a fascinating psychological specimen. He is, in fact, every second man you dated in college.
Because this was released in the same year as Psycho, I can't help making a comparison. Psycho falls off the wagon in its final scene with a diagnosing exposition dump; Peeping Tom blows its load in its opening minutes and never ceases to beat us over the head with regurgitated Freudian platitudes. I can only imagine that the brainstorming session for this film was someone writing ""phallus = eye = camera"" on a napkin.
I feel guilty about hauling Michael Powell over the coals, because I genuinely love many of his films. Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes are two of my all-time favorites. Admittedly, Peeping Tom does have elements of Powell's expressionistic style that makes those other superior films so excellent. The best I can say about it is that the scenes of candy-colored lighting may have inspired Argento, so there is a chance that this turd of a film had to be made for one of my favorites to exist.
In what is so far the greatest twist of 2019, I find myself agreeing with the conservative British film critics of 1960 who lambasted this film upon its release. I hope this is the first and last time. Just watch Blow-Up.",2.0
"An outstanding film about voyeurism and the need for corporate-supplied emotion, and one that is still both telling and resonant today. For our ironic age where self-absorption and self-introspection rarely go hand in hand, Powell's exploration of the supposed tyranny of the viewer, locked in their neuroses should be required viewing for the screen set.
A boy is exposed to all manner of terrors by a scientist father and grows up to be a cameraman who films women in various states of fear and undress before he slits their throats. All done in the name of ""documentary"", as he puts it. His day job is in a stifling, silly film studio. What's surprising here is his path to redemption which may very well surprise those out there who haven't felt a spoon-fed, corporate emotion in years!",4.0

"I don't know if anyone reading this pays attention to the meticulously organized tags I apply to each blog post. If you do, you probably notice that I throw the term “classic horror” around quite a bit. But “classic” is a mutable term. How does one define when the era of classic horror ends and the modern era begins?
That's an easy question for me to answer. 1960 is the year two horror masterpieces were released, completely shattering the conceptions of what the genre was capable of and moving it once and for all into the modern day. Those films were Alfred Hitchcock's “Psycho” and what is often thought of as its British counterpart: Michael Powell's “Peeping Tom.”
Mark Lewis did not have a happy childhood. His father was a renowned behavioral psychologist. What the public doesn't know is that Dr. Lewis used his own son as a guinea pig, gauging his reaction to fearful stimuli and recording all of it. This gave Mark an obsession with film, photographs, and the nature of fear. He works as a cameraman on a film set, with a side gig taking pictures of naked women. Late at night, he stalks the streets, picking up female victims, killing them and recording their deaths. Quite against his will, Mark begins to fall in love with Helen, the pretty redhead girl down stairs. Soon, his growing feelings for Helen and his desire to kill are warring against each other.
As the title indicates, “Peeping Tom” is a film about voyeurism. Unlike Hitchcock's “Psycho,” where the idea mostly floats under the surface, Powell's film is all about the act of watching and being watched. The film's opening scene is shown from Mark's perspective, as he picks up a prostitute and prepares to kill her. This directly aligns the audience's point-of-view with that of a serial killer. From the very beginning, “Peeping Tom” implements the audience in Mark's crime. Audiences have watched death, destruction, and all sorts of unspeakable acts carried out on-screen since the camera's invention. Few films before “Peeping Tom” so directly interrogated this act. Mark's obsession with watching is directly linked with his need to kill, tied up in a vicious childhood. What's the audience's excuse? For asking this question, “Peeping Tom” turned the entire horror genre on its head.
It's also an extremely pathological film. The film's sexual content is tame by modern standards but pushed mainstream decency in 1960. In his adventures, Mark encounters prostitutes and nude models, one of which has a deformed face. He works part-time in a porn shop. Yet bare flesh is not truly exciting for him. Instead, he has an erotic fixation with fear, specifically capturing it on camera. Powell is not subtle about this. Mark's weapon of choice is the sharpened tip of a tripod leg, which he extends upward when he's ready to kill. He caresses the leg as he lifts it, making the erection metaphor more obvious. Murder is how he has sex. Mark's sex/death drive reaches its peak with the film's climax, where he films himself committing suicide, stabbed with own penis-knife. It's fairly perverse by modern standards, so no wonder it was like a bombshell fifty-eight years ago.
“Peeping Tom” is a disturbing film. The sequence's devoted to Mark's murders – especially a drawn out scene where he lures a dancer into a false sense of security, before stabbing her – are deeply unnerving. Powell's mastery of the camera's movement generates some sickening suspense.
Yet the film's sexual subtext and intense terror were not what truly upset people in the sixties. Instead, it was “Peeping Tom's” decision to make its deeply disturbed, fetishtic serial killer sympathetic. (“Psycho” treads similar ground, though more through narrative trickery.) It's entirely clear that Mark is a deranged killer due to the mistreatment he suffered at his father's hands. Every one of his pathological obsessions links back to dad being a bastard. This is made abundantly clear in the scene where he shows Helen the recordings of his childhood. As perverted and deranged as his actions may be, you don't want to see Mark punished. You want to see him healed.
Powell's direction is more-or-less the star of “Peeping Tom.” However, the film also features an excellent cast. Carl Boehm plays Mark as a deeply clinical man. He's a ball of nerves, so scared of loosing control of his impulses. It becomes clear that he doesn't even really want to kill but is driven to do so. This complete commitment to verisimilitude makes Boehm both terrifying and deeply empathic.
Anna Massey is also the perfect girl next door as Helen, a sweet and innocent visage. You really understand why she would pull Mark away from his homicidal needs. As sweet as Helen is, her mother is equally jaded. The blind woman is rightfully suspicious of Mark and Maxine Audley is well utilized in the part. Lastly, I love Moira Shearer as Vivian, the beautiful and vivacious dancer. Her screen time is limited but Shearer makes the impact of her life, and death, felt.
In addition to being a groundbreaking horror film, “Peeping Tom” is also a prototypical example of a masterpiece that was misunderstood in its time. Powell previously made critically acclaimed and widely beloved comedies, musicals, and romances. A psychotically complex and deeply dark horror picture was not what people figured he'd do next. The film was rejected so violently at the time of release that Powell's career never recovered. Of course, now people realize the film is genius. You already know that. What you might not know is “Peeping Tom” is still a visceral and highly disturbing experience.",4.0

Interesting that the film treats the main character so sympathetically even after it's established that he murders women, but apart from that there's little of interest here.

Peeping Tom is about the strange and stealthy cameraman, Mark Lewis, who is making a documentary on fear, which involves recording the reactions of his female victims as he murders them.
It's very hard to assess a thriller when the technology of the times is not developed enough to depict gore and grotesque as it should. It's a subtle horror film that is much more about the psychology of Mark than his actual serial killings. But i would have loved to see some bloodied corpses in this one.
Interesting casting choice using Karlheinz Böhm who played the role perfectly. I found Mark to be very compelling to observe as a viewer. It may because i'm a cynic at heart but i actually felt sympathy for him. It wasn't really the tragic backstory, but rather the way the movie addresses voyeurism as a mental illness and how Mark is not in control of his actions. Mark never feels remorse and he takes pride in his works of murder but we can't help but feel like he is hostage to his illness.
Voyeurism is crucial to the plot. Mark remains an enigma to the audience as much as he is to his neighbor Helen. The audience has to constantly work to understand what motivates him and try to guess what fear actually is. Maybe in a film class i would have time to analyze how it affects the cinematography, but for now i think it's safe to assume that it most likely does, Michael Powell being a well known Auteur. Looking forward to rewatching and i will be dreaming in Eastman color from now on. 4.5/5",4.5

Good proto-slasher in the style of Psycho about a mentally ill cinephile. 
The main character is antagonist and protagonist at the same time, we follow him around and see the kills through his eyes and camera. Very creative for the time.
The pacing was a little off and too slow during the middle, but the great start and awesome ending make up for it.
The eastman colors in this are beautiful and I think Argento has taken some inspiration from this, seeing how the Suspiria and Inferno lighting techniques seem to be highly influenced by what we see in Marks apartment.
A good one, but it didn't do as much for me as for others, apparently.",3.5
"wow... this was one of the most perfect movies i've ever seen. it's so smart, and yet the audience can understand what's going on. the highlight for me was the set up for vivian's murder. the 3 minutes before she was killed was amazing. i highly recommend peeping tom. this shit was so off the charts good.",0.0
"It's easy to see why this film ended Powell's career as a director, as this must have seemed like such a huge betrayal to his audience. Hitchcock, always on the lurid side already, presents Psycho as a bit of a throwback roughie of an earlier era. He's slumming with the material, and everyone know it.
Powell moves his villain right into the heart of modern movie making, in gorgeous Technicolor, and makes the audience complicit as peeping toms themselves. Norman Bates is an obvious creeper right off the bat, but Böhm's Mark Lewis is an every-man who slips unnoticed right into the middle of everything. People like him.
This is a considerably bolder film than Psycho at every level, and Powell really paid a price for it.",4.5
"Very interesting movie, lots of vibrant colors and still shots gives it a surreal and eerie feeling, elevated by the plot of the film. I liked how the movie seemed to employ many different narrative techniques which it jumped between seamlessly and wherever appropriate. At one point we're viewing the story play out through the lens of a camera, the next from two people watching a film on screen, only to then follow different characters, watching the plot unfold as they see it. It's a very hard movie to describe, and while I'm still not quite sure what I watched I definitely liked it a lot. Suspenseful throughout and, while not blatantly showing it on the surface, also very horrifying in its depiction of psychological terror.
I knew close to nothing about this movie before seeing it, and I almost wish I didn't even go as far reading the IMDB description of it. Probably a movie that's best watched going into it blind so I won't say any more except that I recommend it.",4.0

"The use of color is as striking as its head first dive into the mind of a psychopath, who puts on a Peter Lorre impression for the ages! It’s use of POV kills is captivating, inviting us to glimpse fear first hand while asking us to understand its use.

While I ultimately wanted more of what critics at the time detested, and less of Mark’s ever growing relationship with Helen, Peeping Tom is a brilliant understudy of sympathetic madness.",5.0

"It’s certainly not often that the British (known for playing it fairly safe with their horror into the ‘60s) find themselves at the forefront of transgressive cinema. But Powell’s Peeping Tom is a glaring exception; eschewing the castles and crypts typical of UK macabre cinema in favor of an intimate and disturbing psychopathic character study. With its themes of voyeurism, trauma, and sexual fetishism, along with Powell’s then-unheard of use of POV, the influence of Peeping Tom on everything from Bava’s Blood and Black Lace to De Palma’s early work to Black Christmas, Halloween, Friday the 13th and their numerous imitators, is readily apparent. 
However, Peeping Tom is trumped by Psycho (the horror film to which it’s most often compared) in one major way: its madman. Mark Lewis, played by German actor Carl Boehm, is a little too infantilized (despite his obvious childhood trauma) and pulpy (Boehm’s performance evokes the great Udo Kier at times) to be taken seriously as a believable psychopath. And while Lewis may be a more well-drawn villain than Norman Bates, Bates is scarier because his motives aren’t so readily apparent.",4.5

"This column originally appeared in The Independent:
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger wrote, produced and directed some of the most beloved films in the history of British cinema. Pictures like The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, A Matter of Life and Death and The Red Shoes are established classics that influenced generations of filmmakers. In 1960, Powell’s Peeping Tom was released, a solo effort that all but destroyed his career. The movie’s violence and sexual imagery offended contemporary critics but history has been far kinder; Martin Scorsese has been a significant champion and Peeping Tom is now viewed as a British counterpart to Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, released in the same year.
Powell worked as a stills photographer on a couple of early Hitchcock films and the pair remained friends throughout their careers. The influence of the master is clearly discernible in this tale of a serial killer who captures the expressions of his female victims in their dying moments using a portable camera. There are clear nods to Vertigo and Rear Window while Hitchcock was sensible enough to view Powell’s film as a cautionary tale. The reaction to Peeping Tom was so overwhelmingly negative that, given the similarity between the two films, the director decided to release Psycho without a press screening.
Powell’s dark masterpiece is generally considered one of the first slasher films and one of the earliest horrors to show the action from the killer’s point of view, a convention that has become almost ubiquitous. Scripted by Leo Marks (a remarkable figure who was a leading cryptographer for Britain during The Second World War), the film was regarded as little more than pornography by the press and public upon release and it was pulled from British cinemas after just five days. Scorsese was approached by a New York distributor in 1978 and asked for $5,000 for a wider re-release. The Taxi Driver director was only too willing to oblige and the critical re-evaluation began in earnest.
It is not difficult to see why the film was so reviled at the time. Cinema, as Hitchcock understood only too well, is inherently voyeuristic in nature but Peeping Tom implicates us in the lurid voyeurism of its protagonist (Carl Boehm’s Mark). While audiences might have expected something macabre from Hitchcock, Powell had given no indication that he was capable of a film as nasty as this. It may have proved too much for some but Peeping Tom is one of the greatest British films and a horror with few equals.",0.0

"Comparisons are often drawn between Peeping Tom and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, released that same year. Both are daring masterpieces in their own right, but they diverge on important points.
Peeping Tom never tries to hide the fact that the main character is the man behind the killings shown, thus it doesn't rely at all on a plot twist, opting for layers of psychological and social depth thrown on top of each other as the plot naturally progresses.
From the first frame you know you're thrown in a dark room peeping into a psychopath's crimes and the causes of his mental condition. From the first frame you're dared not to empathize with him. After all, you, sick cinephile, are not so far removed from the main's characters morbid desensitized approach towards real life.",4.5

"This film that, so loathed by everyone in 1960 that it effectively ended the film career of a prestigious director, feels a good decade ahead of it's time. It seems a bit puzzling at first that ""Psycho"" could be released in the same year and be a success for Hitchcock, and that this film would ruin Powell, but it makes sense when you really look closely at the films. Hitchcock's film has shocking content, but the shocks have a somewhat safe and innocuous character to them. Hitchcock wouldn't really delve into the sort of perverse and unseemly violence you find in this film until ""Frenzy"", over a decade later. Powell's film delves into the mix of sex, voyeurism and violence that De Palma would delve into in the 70's and 80's, and while this is not simply ""a De Palma film made 20 years earlier"" (it's less slick, but also a bit more artful), the comparison shows why it took so long for anyone to appreciate this film.",5.0
"Ran this film for a while teaching an Intro to Film Studies class at university (cinematography week?). Always a pleasure to 'gaze' upon this creepy, quirky beast. Fun facts: destroyed the career of Michael Powell (The Red Shoes, 49th Parallel, Black Narcissus), who then headed Down Under to make 'wogspoilation' classic/precursor They're a Weird Mob. So, in a 'weird' way, the director of The Red Shoes is responsible for Fat Pizza, Acropolis Now, Nick Giannopoulos' tzatziki sauce stains on Australian film history...oh, also this is credited by many to be the first 'slasher' film.

Tutorial discussions always went overtime and ended with me physically ushering students out of the room, chanting ""just send me an email"" over and over.",4.0
"With Hitchcockian level thrills and a Kubrickian sense of directorial precision and craft, Peeping Tom is an underrated and darkly twisted classic that stands among the very best of the decade, and the genre. 
Bold, exuberant colours create a suspenseful canvas wherein music and characterization create a completely engaging and artistically expressive piece of cinematic art.  It balances out the typical cliches and sense of unbelievable with these subtly dark and disturbing themes that underpin the whole production. It is perhaps, one of the most quietly frightening and discomforting films I have ever seen. 
Move over 'Pulp Fiction', this film has an incredibly unique and agonizingly tense dance sequences that bombards the viewer with feelings of morbid playfulness. These moments are littered throughout the film and make it entirely worthwhile. 
Despite a slower second half and a narrative pace that struggles to regain its brilliant momentum previously established, the finale went places that I never thought it could. There's a sense of rebellion, confrontation and a pushing of boundaries that makes the film so respectable in what it is trying to do. 
It's a reminder of how cinema as an art form reacts to its societal contexts, and on a more personal level, the ideas of obsession, ambition, and the multiple dimensions through which our eyes document and record our lives, relationships and environments. 
It's a shame the film ruined Michael Powells reputation, and it aches me to consider what he could have made had this film been embraced. But part of me is also proud of its history, proud of the way we as an audience have shifted attitude, proud of the way art and film never stays the same, and always, always, manages to reveal the fragmented, dark, disturbed, 'Peeping Tom' in all of us.

"The opening shots of Peeping Tom guide us through the dim streets of a red light district, and the unseen protagonist focusing on their prey. Prey, because although we are yet to see the deadly encounter take place, the crosshairs of the camera's viewfinder frame the prostitute with a certain finality. And as the murder takes place, the movie cuts from its screaming victim not to a menacing reaction shot, but a projector silently whirring and replaying the crime. What Powell has done is implicate the viewer immediately, and point to the power of cinema to seduce us into the complicity of a murderer's gaze.
We don't see the perpetrator's face until the next morning, and it isn't what we expect - blonde, handsome, with those shockingly blue eyes that flickered the film into life. The next hour is spent acquainting us with Mark Lewis, portrayed in a curious performance by German actor Carl Boehm, who uses his boyish looks, shy glances and accented syllables to momentarily disarm our suspicions.
The director is Michael Powell, who is remembered most prominently for his collaborations with Emeric Pressburger through their production company The Archers, giving us several striking Technicolor masterpieces such as A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, and The Red Shoes. Peeping Tom, shot in Eastmancolor, takes this visual style to lurid heights, with the set design and costume painted in various garish hues, and cinematographer Otto Heller throwing lights on every surface to give the image a glittery sheen that verges on the unnatural and off-putting. Its extravagance is ironic, as seen when a well-dressed gentleman looks around the pristine store warily, eyes Mark's pin-up shots, and then, flustered, declares to buy the whole lot. Lorraine's 'blemish', which now more than ever resembles a poorly made prosthetic, fits snugly into this premise: even the disfigured prostitutes and their woes are fraudulent. The shy, blonde, blue-eyed focus puller has the most reason and motivation.
We learn of his upbringing at the hands of a cruel scientist and also father, who put his entire childhood under constant surveillance, prodding and poking his boy like a wounded animal. Mark has inherited this aggression into his own filmmaking, clutching his camera close like a newborn, and his mental scars compel an obsession to recapture the same fear he experienced. He obliterates privacy and comfort, and as his victims slowly sense his intent, the score, a mournful piano, lurches into a frenzy. Brian Easdale times his compositions to reflect the tenuous temperament of Mark. As he displays his collection of home videos to Helen, the tempo rises and falls, as if the music is as confused as Mark is, struggling to come to terms with the fact that one of his chosen victims, who he has cornered into his hellishly lit projection room, might actually care for him.
Critics reviled the film on release, declaring it nauseating, sick and filthy. It was an unfortunate example of the press taking the moral high ground, and down Peeping Tom went, along with Powell's career. The case is especially puzzling considering the fervour that Psycho caused not 12 months beforehand, the former being the much bloodier film. Critics were offended at being thrust into the sympathies of Mark Lewis, and having their gazes aligned with a murderer, but how many of them held their breaths as Marion Crane made her getaway, and how many switched their allegiance over to Norman Bates after her swift exit, quietly willing the car into the swamp?
Moral hypocrisies aside, Mark's vague, Freudian backstory doesn't afford him a whole lot of sympathy. Powell takes it too far, too seriously - he even plays Mark's father, as an example, and all that's left for him to do is burst through the screen and scold the audience. Compare this to the slow but sure seduction of Rear Window, where even Grace Kelly could not wrest us from our suspicions.
Although it shocked in the 60s, today Mark's self-inflicted demise seems more funny than tragic; dark, kitschy melodrama, and all the more disconcerting if you're coming from the Archer's romantic films. And yet, does this work in favour of the film? How unsettled would Powell be at the sight of today's cinema, where blood, gore and popcorn flow more freely than even in Mark's wildest dreams? Movies are more graphic than ever, but audiences are unmoved, and in their gaping stare, they may perhaps not even realise the mirror being pointed at them, or register the blade pricking at their skin.",4.0

Y luego evidentemente también el trabajo de cámara y la fotografía que deja algunas imágenes muy memorables e impactantes. Genial el contrapunto del personaje de la madre de la joven, que es ciega.",4.0
"Often overshadowed by and unfairly compared with Hitchcock’s PSYCHO, in large part due to its controversial (at least for 1960) subject matter, Michael Powell’s PEEPING TOM is a fine example of a British slasher film done right, if not a little rudimentarily.
Opening with a close-up of a woman’s eye, PEEPING TOM is, as its title suggests, a film all about gaze, whether it be the gaze of the director, the audience or the central character. For Powell, cinema and film are weapons which can be used to inflict terror on an audience - in this case, both the actual audience and the women who catch sight of themselves in the mirror moments before they are brutally despatched by Mark (Carl Boehm), through whom we see most of the action and with whom we are perversely asked to empathise with.
The influences on the slashers that followed are plain to see and while PEEPING TOM is a solid film in its own right, it is the use of those tricks that we later see put to such effective use in films such as HALLOWEEN and, in particular, EYES OF LAURA MARS that make it such an intriguing watch. Nonetheless, even on its own merits PEEPING TOM is a nifty little slasher that is efficient and often brutal, yet one which also possesses a deeper layer of subtext relating to violence towards women and the inherent violence of cinema. It’s far from Powell’s best film but it might well be one of his most interesting.",3.0
"6.5/10
Of the trifecta of revolutionary horror films in 1960, Peeping Tom feels the weakest. It doesn't quite have the shock value of Psycho or the ethereal grace of Eyes Without a Face, but it is still nonetheless a turning point in horror cinema. Whereas Psycho was the birth of the Slasher and Eyes Without a Face was the death of Gothic horro, Peeping Tom feels like the tentative origins of what would become Giallo. The bright and extravagant use of colour was clearly an influence on Argento, and the gliding camera and sleak editing likely evolved into what makes Martino one of the better directors of the movement. But sadly Peeping Tom lacks the shock power or the grit to make it truly exceptional, and I can put that down to the fact that I've never found anything by Powell that I really like. The performances he shoots all feel a little stilited, as Bohm could learn a lot from Perkins in how to create an unnerving yet normal character, and his way of shooting is relatively indistinct, even within the later Golden Age of Hollywood that Powell so clearly borrows from. But what annoys me most about Peeping Tom is it's strange lack of depth. Though some of Powell and Pressberger's works are very underwhelming (I Know Where I'm Going and 49th Parallel come to mind), their better works always seem to have a deeper undertone to them that makes me want to read into them in great depth. But Peeping Tom feels quite shallow and pulpy, which I appreciate is kind of the point, which makes me wish that it was as confident as the other major horror movies of the 60s, as it's nowhere near as deserving of the praise that it gets as the other two.",0.0

"""I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands.""
Once again, Michael Powell proves why he's one of the kings of cinema by pushing the boundaries and creating yet another stunning visual classic. Peeping Tom tells the story of Mark Lewis, a lonely and secluded cameraman who is obsessed with using his camera to photograph the fear he sees in women's eyes as he watches them realize that they are about to die. I mean come on, what a great concept for a thriller. When you give a director like Powell a unique idea like that to work with, it's almost a guarantee that the film is going to be awesome. And, it was. Watching Mark Lewis wander around London with his camera looking for his next victim. Watching the look on his face when he sees the fear in a woman's eyes. And, maybe most importantly, the way the audience has the chance to see through the lens of Mark's camera as he documents the fear of his kill. Powell uses Mark's camera to let the audience see what Mark sees, which creates an intensely personal and creepy atmosphere. Everything about this film was visual. And, while Peeping Tom is a far cry from the typical Powell film, he uses many of his traditional techniques like vivid coloring to please the fans who love his classic style. The acting from Karlheinz Bohm, who plays the fear loving Mark Lewis, was also impressive. He was very believable as the very British, very creepy, camera addicted psycho. I love the way he treats his camera like it's part of himself. I think I finally found a guy who loves his camera more than I do. While Peeping Tom may not be Powell's best film, it proves how daring and original he was. It also shows that he can conquer any genre, and it's just one more film to add to his immense list of classics. If you like your thrillers to have style and aren't concerned with how scary the film is, then Peeping Tom will be perfect for you. This film is all about Powell's ability and the visual style.

"It's really a travesty this killed Michael Powell's career. It's a landmark movie, along with Hitchcock's Psycho from the same year and Fritz Lang's M. I also think it's a little better than Psycho (though certainly less of a cultural icon).",4.5
"PEEPING TOM is an amazing psychological thriller that was way ahead of its time. While Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO was the major horror/thriller focus of 1960, PEEPING TOM was actually released first and did a lot of the things PSYCHO was praised for. And while recently there has been a debate as to which film was more influential and better to the horror/thriller genre, I think both films have a place since PEEPING TOM is just as great as PSYCHO, but in a different way.
PEEPING TOM is a film that didn't deserve the label placed on it for many years since there's nothing remotely controversial about it. It's well acted, well directed, and has a very deep and disturbing narrative running through it. If you're a fan of PSYCHO and haven't seen this movie, then don't hesitate to watch it. PEEPING TOM is definitely top notch and must be seen by every horror/thriller fan out there. This film truly is a classic.",5.0

"I've never had a more fruitful or eye-opening venture into the world of groundbreaking psychological thrillers than the kick I have been on in the last week. After being floored by both Robert Altman's ""3 Women"" and now Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"", I feel like the only way to correctly round out this adventure is with Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"". That will come before week's end.
There is a list for almost everything, so I assume someone has constructed one for essential films that were way ahead of their time. If one of these lists does indeed exist, then I would hope that ""Peeping Tom"" is placed somewhere high on it. There's so much going on underneath all the surfaces of this movie that if the viewer is not truly looking for it, it cannot be correctly experienced. Powell's film is a thriller in a non-traditional way, in that the chills are not given to the audience in a stylized, gruesome way, but in a philosophical way. It's a horror movie that we wish the modern day filmmakers of the genre would have used as a teacher, because if they had then American audiences could be a little more willing to give new horror a shot instead of immediately writing it off as garbage.
Karlheinz Bolm is so immersed as the main character that every moment he is on screen I felt unease. He is not portrayed as a crazed lunatic, but rather a troubled soul tortured from the inside, taking his insecurities behind the eye of a camera. The tension doesn't necessarily build, because the tension is already high from the onset. It's relentless in a way that not many thrillers ever have been.
Groundbreaking, indeed.",4.5
"The film follows Mark, a shy, socially awkward camera-obsessive on the surface, but underneath he’s a serial killer who films all his victims as he spears them with a sharpened tripod leg of his camera. I had heard a lot about this film and was lead to believe it was a horror, but in truth it’s more of a study of the psychology of a killer. A chance meeting with a neighbour leads to Mark discussing his past and slowly but surely from that point on, we can piece together what drives him to commit his crimes.
This is a film constantly billed as being ‘ahead of its time,’ and I’m glad it was, as it flows slowly, allowing you a glimpse into Mark’s normal working life and the blossoming romance between him and his neighbour and helps you to feel sympathetic towards him, particularly later on as he seeks help or a possible cure. Had this been filmed in the wake of Halloween, it could have been a totally different film. As it stands, this is one that everyone should watch, definitely deserving of the hype.",5.0

Completely unnerving and quite the response to Psycho.

As a fan of hitchcock and Argento, this film is an obvious influence on the giallo, thriller and slasher genres. Coming out in 1960, Powell crafted a film as effective in production and direction, not to mention tension, as any Hitch ever made and as horrifying as anything Argento put out, including a much better ending than Dario could usually muster. The music is great and the lead is so damn magnetic and creepy.

Aquí la cuestión no es quién es el homicida, sino porqué hace lo que hace y ahí la cinta se luce, dando a un sofisticado, frío e introvertido psicópata con una buena serie de traumas a su espalda. Si a eso le sumas una música que es un verdadero caos angustiante, y unas grandisimas actuaciones (Bohm está tremendo), te encuentras con una película asfixiante, tensa y que no te deja escapar desde el minuto 1.

"I wonder what portion of viewers of this film in 1960 only saw the opening 10 minutes, or even the opening 5. These are the most lurid part of the movie by some margin, almost like a marker laid down: ""It's the Sixties; movies will be like this sometimes now.""
For how pulpy and sordid the movie shows itself to be in the opening minutes, as a whole it was much better and more affecting than it needed to be. We are awash nowadays with films and shows that go out of their way to empathize, or at least sympathize, with the bad guys. The best do this with a clear sense of the social costs of the bad deeds, of the harm caused; the worst end up celebrating them, intentionally or not. This falls into the former category: Mark is a wounded little boy in many ways, and we want to root for him to overcome his murderous compulsion, but I'd hesitate to say the movie is rooting for his successful evasion of capture and continuation of his murders. It is interested in his behavior as a form of human evil.
Take the introduction of the cops. They show up all full of smarmy chumminess and jokes, and Mark can't stay away from their investigation. His most recent murder, the very definition of shitting where you eat, now has the potential to expose him, and he only wants to test himself against the cops, so he might get them in his documentary about fear and violence. When one of the cops wants to play around and check out his camera, Mark is practically crawling out of his skin with anxiety. ""Oh buddy, you'll get it back,"" I wanted to explain to this man, even as I hoped the cops would see his footage.
Mark's growing relationships with would-be girlfriend Helen and with her blind mother are surprisingly warm and well-drawn. We wouldn't care about his success in navigating social challenges if we didn't believe the scenes between these characters. There's a breathtaking moment when the camera pushes urgently in on Mrs. Stephens after she has confronted Mark with her understanding of things, when she means to feel his face and ""take his picture."" Even with what she knows, she wishes for his capacity to seek help and let the good parts in him shine without risk to her or her daughter. She's interrogating his appearance, but the vulnerability just then is all hers.",4.0

Nobody in the film except the blind lady realizes Mark is such a creep for some reason, even though he's a fucking weirdo in like every single scene.

Doesn't play very much into the unsettling voyeuristic horror or the strange psychological issues caused by Mark's father that it sets itself up for.",2.5

Parts of the magic of cinema is disguising the bigger picture with lesser parts of importance. You can very easily have a film about a guy who kills women and films it. It wouldn't be very good, but it would be something. Peeping Tom uses this as a veil to hide the staggering psychosexual trauma of a man who isn't completely at fault. No, I am not defending a killer, I am saying that the process and motivation of the film is so grand in execution and intention that it was almost impossible for me to dislike him. Mark is a character I know. Mark is a product of something long bugging me. I adore the portrayal of someone so afflicted by personal demons that it translates into art... a deadly art.

"My journey through Powell's and Pressburger's classics continue this time discovering one only directed by Michael Powell and ""Peeping Tom"" essentially got him cancelled. Just before I started watching I thought this came out in the 70s. That could be with all the 50th anniversary re-releases happening which are of course films from 74 at the moment but also a more interesting angle is that this feels on paper like a 70s film
It was actually released in 1960, the very same year as ""Psycho"". That's interesting as both films contributed greatly to defining the slasher genre, even if ""Psycho"" was far more celebrated on its release and to this day. It is the better film I must admit but that doesn't mean ""Peeping Tom"" deserved the inital backlash even if today it is far more appreciated and seen as a cult classic.
This follows Mark, who we know from the get-go is a guy not right in the head to put it lightly as he murders a prostitute and films said murder. He's obsessed with recording every little detail in his life but, like his late scientist father, is particularly interested in filming fear as he records the several murders he commits and then gives himself private screenings of them. In order words, he's a psychopath and a real nasty piece of work.
But what keeps you intrigued rather than simply appalled at him are a few details. He's a recluse which changes when he starts a relationship with the lady downstairs in his flat Helen which offers a chance at normality for him but also creates tension on if he will snap with her and his deranged habits will get the best of him. Plus he had a terrible childhood and so he's more than just a villain and could be painted as someone desperate to search for meaning in life but can only find it through a camera lenses allowing him to literally replay memories.
And so in Paul is a real challenging character. One who commits utterly heinous crimes but is fleshed out enough so you at least have an idea why he is doing this even if you cannot agree with it.
It's crazy that this film came out in 1960 only a few years after the abolishment of the Hayes Code. It's depiction of London does feel of the 50s but what it shows is a lot more edgy whether it be shops selling adult magazines, the inclusion of sex workers and the violence on display, even if it isn't graphic. A film in 1960 still being a 15 to this day is quite something and yes this film feels distributing.
Powell shows that he, like his partner in filmmaking, has an amazing eye for how to conduct a shot as this film looks beautiful contrasting bright colours with the grungy feel of the screening room.
The cast is also very impressive starring Carl Boehim in an unsettling performance as well as Moira Shearer (who was also in ""The Red Shoes"" as the lead) acting as a likeable foil.
A horror film that goes for being disturbing rather than having a jump scare every minute, this does its job effectively at depicting how dark filmmaking, especially when making documentaries, can be depending on who is behind the camera.",4.0

Il y a évidemment une mise en abyme puisque l'arme du tueur est sa caméra et j'aime beaucoup la distinction qui est faite (ou en tout cas que je vois) entre la réalité et la fiction. Mark cherche à capturer la peur sur le visage des gens et ça ne peut marcher que s'il les met véritablement dans une situation de danger, le cinéma est du théâtre, l'actrice ne joue jamais aussi bien que lorsqu'elle s'évanouit réellement et Helen est terrifié à la vue des images capturées par Mark avant même de découvrir qu'elle ne sont sont pas mises en scène et qu'il s'agit de vrais meurtres, elle le sait parce que ça se voit.
Aucun acteur, si bon soit-il, ne pourra jouer la peur aussi authentiquement qu'une personne sur le point de se faire tuer.

My first Michael Powell film, and if THIS is the film that sent him to director jail, I feel I’ve done myself a disservice not watching his other films that he and Emeric Pressburger made, cause “Peeping Tom” is a MASTERPIECE of a horror film that prioritizes ever-prescient dread over jump scares, whilst also being, in my opinion, a far stronger character study of a psychopath than “Psycho”, though I still love both films for what they do differently!

"Reason to watch: Michael Powell’s almost-career-ending choice to make this highly controversial serial killer movie gave us a perfect companion piece to Hitchcock’s Psycho from the same year. Peeping Tom is the sleazier version of the two. Sort of like “the European cut” in a way. It is much less subtle, far less coherent narratively, much less lean. But it is bathed in a glorious use of color (one of Powell’s many strengths), has good performances and while not quite as sophisticated as Hitch’s film, it is still a highly interesting and deeply terrifying exploration of the human psyche. Maybe too flawed to be a real master piece, but it certainly deserved a much better fate than the viscious reception it got. Deserves its growing cult status and should be on the watchlist for fans and scholars of the horror, slasher, serial killer genres.",4.0

he makes you wait for the inevitable and that’s what adds that layer of fear. the slow pace is something i feared going into this. a slow pace is very iffy with me. sometimes i like it, sometimes i love it, but sometimes it can drag the film. i loved the pace of this one. yeah some scenes could have been trimmed down but other than that, it was on the slower side but kept me interested, which is what a slow pace usually fails miserably at. 
unfortunately Shudder spoiled this movie for me with their 101 Scariest Horror Movie Moments of All Time series, but i guess i should have known better. still the twist works so damn well. it’s such a creepy yet simple as shit concept that works so fucking well. the twist is what really formed the film for me, it gave it its own unique quality on top of a unique enough movie. this one absolutely worked for me and will be a new favorite of mine.",4.0

The piano score is a bit... jaunty for the subject matter.  And Carl Boehm's performance just doesn't hold the movie together the way Tony Perkins' does in Hitchcock's black and white doppelgänger.   He plays the role appropriately weird and repressed, he's just not a great actor and the Austrian accent is distracting for a character born and raised in London.

"""Powell dared where no one else had before him, to show us how close movie-making could come to madness, how it could eat you up, he was telling an extremely uncomfortable truth, something no one really wanted to know."" - Martin Scorsese on Peeping Tom
Our Cinema Unbound season celebrating the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger comes to an end with Powell's Peeping Tom.
Released in the same year as Psycho, Peeping Tom may be thematically similar to Hitchcock's film but it suffered a very different fate commercially. Critically reviled by contemporary critics, Peeping Tom effectively ended Powell's illustrious career.
64 years on however the film has undergone a critical reappraisal, and is now considered a dark masterpiece.

- BLU-RAY -
Watched the 4K restoration on StudioCanal’s new Blu-ray, which looks terrific. Thelma Schoonmaker has said she doesn’t think Powell meant the film to be as deeply thought about, as automatic a masterpiece as it has become. He certainly put a lot into it, but he also just wanted to make an interesting, daring, but fun picture. This bears out when watching it, as it dances wildly in tone, from comic to suspense, high drama to seedy pulp, modern techniques rubbing against silent cinema aesthetics. The casting of Carl Boehm is truly striking, with his cherubic face like one of Caravaggio’s languorous, intense but sexually ambiguous boys. There are so many brilliant elements, it’s such a furious amalgamation and display of talent, it looks to me like a fully perfect film.",5.0
“West Coast Premiere of the 4K Restoration”,5.0
"Powell is in full creep mode - including an obsession with redheads - and the confines and 1960 backdrop make it all the more unsettling. It more than earns its stripes as a source code for the various darker, more violent offshoots in horror and thriller films years later. Karlheinz Böhm gives off young Peter Lorre vibes - his performance and the direction keep trying to equivocate and rationalize for him, despite his deeds. This psychological emphasis and the theatrics of the various scenes and the confined setting make me wonder why no one has ever delivered up a stage version - it would be great fun. And perhaps even the women could have a bit more footing.

"“Mark, are you crazy?”
“Yes. Do you think they’ll notice?”
I just got back from seeing the LA premiere of Rialto’s new 4k restoration at the Egyptian, this is my second time seeing Peeping Tom, the last was easily 15 years ago when I lived in Chicago. It’s really great, and quite a bit funnier than I remembered. There’s a whole book to be written about these groundbreaking horror movies from specifically 1960: Peeping Tom, Psycho, The Virgin Spring, & Eyes Without A Face, all 1960, and all feel like movies from a full decade later, none of them were really understood in their own era. Peeping Tom probably suffered the worst, since it destroyed Michael Powell’s career, and yet it really holds up as a very unique, blackly comic spin on the slasher genre, which of course had yet to be properly invented. This almost operates as if those 70s slashers do already exist, and this one is choosing to upend the formula by revealing the killer immediately and asking us to occasionally semi-sympathize with him. It plays for me now like a clever twist on a genre it is partly inventing, and that’s awfully notable. Michael Powell rocked.",4.0
"Saw the premiere of the 4K restoration at the newly renovated Egyptian Theater which I will talk about now instead of the movie. The movie looked fantastic!
Netflix bought the Egyptian and there’s a huge Netflix logo sitting outside. Ominous. The new lobby is completely sauceless. It’s literally and metaphorically empty and has some educational shit on the walls about the theater. Then concessions are tucked away to the far right. The old Egyptian had some great different kinds of weird snacks, sodas, coffee, etc. you get popcorn and soda now. The theater itself is nice with very good picture and audio but everything felt and looked very hollow. It looks like it was built only for premieres. And then there was a Netflix gift shop next door on your way out which has some stupid items like a Squid Game red light green light girl the size of my hand that costs literally $109.
Anyway Netflix is making money off showing classic movies on film which seems kind of counter intuitive but at least they remind you to watch Stranger Things and Wednesday on your way out.",4.5

"Michael Powell and co. take their decades of expertise in Technicolor spectacle and turn their eye towards that most generative of filmmaking topics—filmmaking itself. Nothing undoes someone more than to fall under a gaze, nothing grips a character more than the mania of looking into a camera. And it turns out that as a proto-slasher, Peeping Tom may be second among its contemporaries only to Psycho in terms of enduring influence on horror and thriller films.",4.0
"The camera and the very act of voyeurism replacing the eye with an evil eye, with a fascination built of lust and longing and petrification, a need to capture and re-play and edit, to control and observe and enact divine providence upon the world. One of the first and greatest films about cinema as voyeurism, the audience as dispassioned observers leeching pleasure from the lives of the figures who exist and suffer up there on the screen. Mark is complacent with observing and recording every action to the extent he can no longer live unseen - he must live and die before the gaze of another, he is so incapable of grappling with the real world it must be framed to be palatable. So much of latter-20th century film stems from here ideologically, visually - most of the horror genre, alongside folks like De Palma, Scorsese and (regrettably) Wright. It may have killed Powell's career, but his burning effigy lit so many fires before burning out himself.",5.0
não tenho nem palavras pra descrever tamanha obra de arte,5.0
"This is an absolute cinematic masterpiece of psychological horror.
Though all the actors are good (in a sort of 1960s melodramatic way) the star is of course is Karlheinz Böhm who plays the main protagonist. He is *deeply* creepy, the result of abuse from his father and in a sense though this is a horror its really a film about how this man desperately wants to escape his addiction (presumably a response to that trauma) but can’t as it’s just too powerful, and to open up to somebody would be to simultaneously admit guilt.. and also would mean he can’t finish his documentary.
The direction and especially the score are brilliant. Apparently when it was released the film was panned and censored but now quite rightly it can be seen as a precursor to the horror that would come after.
What is more disturbing in a way is that Böhm himself seems to have had an overpowering father—a conductor who was a Nazi sympathizer (though never officially a member of the party)—and may himself have passed on trauma by abusing his own child in the 1950s. It’s all quite horrible but maybe Böhm used that inner turmoil to create his character. And what a character: charming, childlike, ill-at-ease and wrestling with his urge to document the fear of his victims. He also has absolutely *dreamy* eyes that the camera seems to love.
Highly recommend this if you want to see some powerful British horror.

This movie is fantastic to look at but bizarre, almost stilted in its writing.

Peeping Tom > Psycho",5.0
"The first scene traverses from eye to mouth, from one consumptive organ to another, and ends, frozen upon that orifice, by cinematic cut in place of a bloody slash. The title sequence immediately recapitulates the violence, this time in the black and white perspective of Mark's camera, his victim frozen in perpetual fear, reliving her nightmare every time the reel spins round again. Less concerned with whether a viewer — a cinematic voyeur in the audience — is complicit than in asking why voyeurism, in all forms, is such a compellingly morbid fascination.
Tortured and abused by his father — a psychologist studying the nature of fear (whose German accent implies a Mengelian-figure and a harrowing Nazi childhood) — Mark Lewis is a fit and fashionable young man obsessed with the power of cameras. Peeping Tom is prescient in many ways, but one intriguing thread to pull on is its anticipation of the way small cameras would remake cinema in the New Hollywood era, ushering genres, including slashers made with comparatively minuscule budgets and buckets of blood, to silver screens across the world. Mark's formal innovation is the transformation of his camera's tripod into a bayonet and mirror so that he can stab, reflect, and film with a single phallic instrument. Forcing his victims to reckon with their own faces as they die shocks their visage into a death mask of perfect fear, simultaneous screen and subject.",0.0

Think I first saw this as a teenager on BBC’s Moviedrome and remember being blown away by how weird it was, my 2nd watch was this afternoon on the big screen as part of the GFT’s Powell and Pressburger season. It’s still a deeply weird, nasty and fucked up movie. I had a knot in my stomach through most of it, as the Technicolor director of high class movies like The Red Shoes and Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp shows you grubby, seedy London and a damaged err…psycho (this was released in the same year as Hitch’s masterpiece, and both set the stage for so many films that followed, it certainly feels like a big influence on one of my favourites, Manhunter). But having watched a bunch of P and P films in this last month as part of this season, they’ve always been very idiosyncratic.
And Powell is obviously a true artist, because something that comes out as odd as this isn’t just-a-gig. 

My only criticism is I’m pretty sure the main character says he lived in London all his life, which seems…unlikely.

"QFT was showing trailers for this one as it's part of a wider re-release so I was particularly excited for it. It had all the color of A Matter of Life and Death with a clearly darker story. I also invited friends to it which during the movie I thought was a mistake because of how creepy it is, but they all liked it too so yay!
Anyway, our screening was introduced by none other than my film professor Dr. Marshall. He also started explaining the main character's psyche and his whole backstory which to me was very much spoilers, but then you get all of this info about 15 minutes into the film. This extended sequence where he shows Helen his father's old tapes was a lot worse because i knew what it was trying to say about Mark but even without knowing it, it does feel very expositiony in a bad way. It had a major lack of subtlety so dulling these tapes out at later times would have avoided this. However, I kept watching, I liked how little the film was actually focussing on this aspect of Mark. Powell is going for what seems to be a meta commentary on how artists push others for their work and how they put themselves into it. He literally rushes the main character's development because what he wants you to focus on is Mark's dedication to art. The two are linked, but the latter seems to never be explored beyond the first part whereas the story is about him trying to separate his art from his life for a second. I don't see stories structured like that often so it was very refreshing, just got off to a wonky start.
More thematic stuff I loved is Helen's mother being the only one who can't see Mark's documentary. Then in general, the shots in this movie capture everything in such visually unique ways that it's easy to get engrossed in what mark is doing.

"Peeping Tom is the namesake for a certain relatively accessible Mike Patton music project. (I enjoy their cover of ""Across 110th Street"" a little too much, even though it's kind of cultural appropriation.) My interest in Peeping Tom is solely because I decided to watch and review all of the films whose titles bands appropriated for their names (other than bands whose names I've only seen in lists of bands that appropriated their names from film titles) and it's currently free on Tubi.
On its surface, Peeping Tom is a plodding slasher flick about an aspiring filmmaker who moonlights as a moderately successful serial killer. He developed his modus operandi from his biologist father who filmed him, as a child, reacting to traumatic situations. He kills so that he can film authentic fear because his father repeatedly filmed him in authentically traumatic situations, we're told. The obvious flaw in this story is that his father never killed him, let alone serially, while studying his fearful reaction to trauma, so why didn't he just frighten people and then film them, like his father did to him, instead of killing them?
Whatever I photograph I always lose.
If one can look past the forced, ham-fisted serial killer tale, though, the film reveals that it's really a (clumsy) expression of filmmakers' struggle to cause actors to emote (particularly fear), to capture that emotion on film, to show that emotional expression to viewers, to inspire that emotion among viewers. It's the paradox of manufacturing authenticity; fictional realism; vicarious experience. Filmmakers capture a fleeting moment on film (or bytes or whatever these days) and then they lose the moment in time, like tears in much better films about impermanence. Peeping Tom also is filmmakers exploring the dimensions of their own colons.
There are plenty of splashes of color throughout the film, but it feels rather haphazard. It's colorful for its own sake rather than having an intuitive reason for certain colors used meaningfully. Likewise, there are some interesting lighting choices throughout, but they're largely lighting because the filmmakers can. The leads, Karlheinz Boehm and Anna Massey, are cast well and their performances are adequate, but nothing here motivates me to go out of my way to watch anything else with any of the cast members.
To be fair, I noticed at least one conversation among at least two women about something other than a man—a doting daughter and her mother (whom the film takes a long time to establish is blind and not just a drunkard) discuss the availability of the latter's dinner. In general, though, women are largely victimized by men, either sexually or violently. So one bonus point for passing the Bechdel test.
Overall: this may appeal more to fans of self-indulgent filmmakers making self-indulgent films about other self-indulgent filmmakers, or fans of slashers that require a suspension of disbelief that strains plausibility, but I was not particularly impressed. C.",3.0

I was thinking about why this movie made me speechless.

"1000 log yeeeeeeee
Powell negli nel 1960 a dare uno sfondo e una profondità psicologica non indifferente ad un personaggio in una maniera che neanche odiernamente si riesce a dare.
La storia di Mark e sul come lui sia cresciuto è interessante da un punto di vista sociologico e traumatico, in quanto tutto torna, tutto quello che ha subito in infanzia ha una ripercussione realistica sul carattere e comportamento che adotta una volta cresciuto.
molte volte, quando Mark parla, in realtà sentiamo parlare il bambino che è in lui e che non si è riuscito a riprendere dagli abusi psicologici e dalle ossessioni del padre, tanto chè ancora succube di esse continua il suo lavoro però allo scopo della ricerca della paura, cosa che tanto gli è cara e vicina.
Helene, a cui Mark piace sin dalla prima volta che è salita da lui, cerca di avvicinarsi all'uomo, che però ne risente psicologicamente, visto che non ha mai conosciuto cosa sia l'amore materno e in generale cerca in loro solamente la paura, e tende ad allontanarla perchè si sente legato emotivamente a lei, e se la tiene vicina fino alla sua morte, coronamento dei suoi sforzi nella ricerca del vero terrore.
Il tema del voyeurismo, inoltre, è trattato nella maniera corretta: mentre al giorno d'oggi viene visto come una cosa solamente legata al sesso se non demonizzato in quanto non convenzionale, qui si trovano delle cause, si fanno vedere i motivi che hanno spinto Mark a diventare quello che è, un misto tra un voyeurista e un killer.",4.5

"Male Gaze: The Movie
Much has been said about the similarities to Hitchcock’s Psycho and whether one influenced the other or if they were simply drawing from the same Freudian well. Nevertheless, while I personally defer to Hitchcock’s noir stylings this is a very similar movie.
The concept of “man finds sexual gratification in the terror of women” is not a revolutionary one, I don’t know if I have ever seen it illustrated so clearly, both in a way that is blatant yet devilishly clever.
There is also a lesson here, I think, about the filmmaker who is far too enamored with his own work. The various levels of psychology here is brilliant.

"The Hitchcock-esque narrative of Peeping Tom synthesizes the sinister setting with the menacing scheme and the outcome is an intimidating body of work that should be seen as a one-of-a-kind crime film which embodies both upswings of mental issues from youthfulness and the hideous side of art at their purest form.

Hitchcock-y proto-slasher with some really funny lines and good characters,3.5
"Suspenseből jeles. Rögtön a nyitójelenet, ahogy beteszi Powell a nézőt a kamerába és szó szerint egy célkeresztet aggat elé, hogy nesze ez vár rád! A részese lettél. Beleillene Hitchcock életművébe is, noha az öreg sem panaszkodhat, ha már megcsinálta ugyanebben az évben az egyik legjobb thrillert/horrort. Jó aztán a giallo/slasher műfaj nagy általánosságban elkanyarodott egy sokkal igénytelenebb és butább (nem mindig baj ez) irányba.
Karlheinz Böhm úgy néz ki, mint a fiatal Kenneth Branagh, de amennyire Lockhart a külvilágnak van felfuvalkodva, addig Mark egy jóval szerényebb, érzékenyebb és udvariasabb alak (és elcseszettül creepy). A forgatásokon meg a mellékes munkáin sokszor mintha csak egy szellem állítgatná a kamerákat meg a centit, de amint a saját dokumentumfilmjéhez készít anyagokat, ott olyan változáson megy át ez a fickó csupán a testbeszédével, ott átjön minden szenvedély, az egyéni látásmód, az alkotni vágyás határátléptető ereje.
Mark ezekben a felvételekben, illetve a filmkészítő szentélyében és az állandóan hurcibált kézikamerájában darabkákat őriz meg, amik nagyon könnyen ""elveszhetnek"", kikerülhetnek a nagyvilágba, meg nyilván széttraumatizálták a gyerekkorát és keres valamit. Tökéletesíteni és pontosítani akarja, mégha ""eszközökre"" is van szüksége, ahogy tulajdonképpen őt is erre használták. Hihetetlen, hogy egy 1960-as alkotás ennyire megragadta a rögzítés és a ""nézés"" etikusságát, erejét, ennek a pusztító oldalát.
Nekem ez az, ami a sokszor sok másik filmnél emlegetett kontextust nézve nagyon nagyon érdekes, mert rengeteg dolog történt körülötte (kritikai megsemmisítés, amitől Powell karrierje is gyakorlatilag megsemmisült, saját magát és fiát belerakta az egyik felvételbe, ami a cselekményt ismerve elég érdekes, szinte dobozba került a film, stb), plusz sok alkotót inspirált (Scorsese, Romero), de maga a film is olyan szinten működik a mai napig, hogy ihaj. Figyelhetjük a pszichológia aspektusát vagy a szexuális vonulatát (erre jócskán van utalás), sőt még akár úgy is, hogy hol lehetnek a konkrét művészeti ág, a film korlátai és határai, meg ugye, hogy miért is vonz minket ennyire.
Az, hogy tökéletesen néz ki, a színhasználat és a díszletek fergetegesek meg tele van ilyen csodálatosan régi szalagos szerkezettel, az már csak a cseresznye a habostortán.",4.5

"Michael Powell's Peeping Tom had a quiet yet impactful cultural influence. What is unsettling about the movie is that it feels realistic, with no supernatural elements and no characters doing illogical things. It portrays a disturbed individual indulging in violent and perverted acts, which is as disturbing as it is relevant in the current day. There is no huge difference between our antagonist here in Peeping Tom to a YouTube vlogger. Both have a compulsive urge to capture and document their surroundings, regardless of the ethical implications. This makes Peeping Tom even more relevant today, as it highlights the importance of privacy and morality in the age of technology.",4.5
"Despite a passing interest in many of them I've been woefully unversed wrt Michael Powell's filmography up to now which was clearly a massive blind spot and mistake if this is any indicator. It's stunningly well shot and feels remarkably daring for its moment in time given the overzealous nature of English film censors. It may just be my favorite of all the proto-slasher stuff I've seen so far and almost certainly is when it comes to cinematography in particular.

As Ghostface taught us in Scream 4, Peeping Tom marks the movie that started the slasher craze, even proceeding Psycho. It's the first motion picture to put us into the killer's perspective. A technique many films of the genre, like Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980), would incorporate later as well. Despite that, Peeping Tom doesn't play out exactly like a horror movie, it rather functions as a thriller. It almost has the appeal of an Alfred Hitchcock film. This is not meant to be a critique whatsoever, as I admire the latter's work. Peeping Tom features a tense and captivating plot, only some moments didn't age particularly flawlessly.",3.0

A good friend of mine recommended Peeping Tom the other day so this was the perfect opportunity to watch it. I am the biggest slasher fan so this was also intriguing for that reason. 
I found Peeping Tom to be much better than expected  and more influential than credited. The character of Mark is layered and masterful and the other characters weren’t far off. The story was good but the film is more character driven than anything, which is so difficult to find in horror. Technically, the film provided beautiful light designs and some original POV kill shots that had clear influence on my favorite genre. Overall I’m more than pleased I watched this and I will now be another fan recommending it to others!",4.0
"Peeping Tom is one of those classic horror films that inspired the Slasher subgenre. The film has unique elements that explore the mind of a voyeur; in particular, the use of POV camera shots in filming the murder sequences must be praised for its originality, considering the time of its release. It has to be noted that POV slasher murder sequences was later popularised by John Carpenter’s Halloween, alongside countless B horror films. 
That being said, I was not particularly impressed by the mediocre acting and the clunky dialogue. The film was released the same year as Hitchcock’s masterpiece Psycho, so despite its value as a classic horror film, Peeping Tom does not get a pass from me on those grounds.",3.0

"From October 2023 Watchlist
Without doubt the greatest and flashiest English language crime thriller from the 60s, yes I will go there and state that it is the superior twin brother to Psycho (get stuffed, Hitchcock. Probably rolling around in his grave wishing he birthed this magnum opus instead minus the career termination aspect to it.) If you're familiar with the sleazy and barbaric Maniac (1980) then it's kind of a no brainer comparison that Powell's Peeping Tom is primarily the much dialed back and subdued predecessor. Maybe very much loved today but in its own time, much offense was present from the traditionist audiences and censorship as well as repulsion from non-international critics. Imagine if they somehow had admittance to Bergman's The Virgin Spring and Nakagawa's Jigoku both released the same following year, oh my god the outrage that'd spark. No one was ready for the very first slasher film (the filming was completed before Psycho so yes this is the first.) Also funny how it was considered so shocking to everyone that Karlheinz Böhm took the role of Mark, due to the whole charming heartthrob archetype he'd always been typecasted as before then.",5.0
"Peeping Tom er veldig stilling. Den setter oss i perspektivet til en kald-blodig morder men fremdeles greier å få fram litt sympati for karakteren. Skuespillet fra Karlheinz Böhm er veldig gjennomtenkt, og har så mye dype i seg. jeg greide ikke ta øyne mine vekk fra han, jeg var bare utrolig fascinert i hans figur og reise. Filmen ser også nydelig ut med masse fine fager, den ekte 60-talls technicolor følelsen er her. Men det var unikt å se så store fager i en så mørk og dyster film. Selvom denne var veldig før sin tid, og har senere inspirert så mange andre filmer, så følelses den fortsatt veldig selvstendig.",4.0

"History of the Slasher Film
List: boxd.it/osWd6
5/31
I don't trust a man who walks quietly.
Ever wondered what happened to Little Albert? Michael Powell provided a definitive answer. Carl Boehm and his wide eyes are equal parts terrifying and sympathetic - that sad sack gaze makes your skin crawl (shades of Peter Lorre).
So many great things to note about this film - Mark looking in the window at the party (""Why don't we make him a present of that window? He practically lives there.""), the crosshairs of the POV camera shots, Helen's private screening (""The first 21st birthday present I've ever given""), the dance scene and it's aftermath, and, of course, the sage Mrs Stephens. The film is a bit dated but also fairly prescient (I mean, Mark literally films a reaction video of Helen).
No doubt the voyeurism depicted was shocking to a generation of people accustomed to privacy, but to a modern audience - who can't expect to go in public without being filmed without permission - the fact that that privacy no longer exists should also be disturbing.",4.5
"Peeping Tom and Psycho get compared to each other a lot, for very valid reasons - they both came out in 1960, caused serious controversy, show intense violence from a voyeuristic perspective, and each one has a legitimate claim as the first prototypical slasher.
But Psycho has been elevated to a level of classic cinema that has permeated popular culture, whereas Peeping Tom - while very much appreciated - is not nearly as recognized or referenced in the mainstream. 
So, here's my hot take - Peeping Tom is a more dynamic, thoughtful film. As scary as Norman Bates and the shower scene are in Psycho, I think the whole movie is a bit easier to digest. There's a distance between the experiences and emotions of the characters in the film and the real world. Peeping Tom manages to bring you uncomfortably close, and you can't wriggle free. 
Mark is such an unsettling yet relatable character. He is terrifying because he is handsome, employed, charming (in a shy sort of way). He's the kind of guy you wouldn't suspect of doing these terrible things. You can understand why Helen falls for him. It's really difficult to separate yourself from that experience, which makes it all the more terrifying. 
Kudos to Michael Powell for going all in on Mark's documentary. I know it significantly damaged his career, but damn, what an artful move.",4.5

"Alexandre Astruc once said that the camera is a pen much like an author's pen, in his ""camera stylo"" theory. Here, the camera is a weapon.
It's very patiently paced, in that it doesn't even have a lot of shock value or even a drop of blood is spilled on-screen directly. Violence is there, a lot of it - but it's all implied or simply off-screen.
But, even in those little moments where we see our protagonist Max, in his studio - be it the time with Helen or the one with Helen's mother or the last scene, director Michael Powell is able to create some tense and quite thrilling moments. Most of all, more than the thrills - which are very clearly decidedly low, it talks about voyeurism, using the camera as a gaze to see things and even record things which one shouldn't but for the sake of art one does. Here, obviously, the man is mentally sick and has a phobia but don't forget that he mentions constantly that he's making a documentary.
We will never see that documentary, but we see a mildly disturbing, thrilling account of the creation of it. Something which i especially loved about the film is the cinematography - the use of the lighting, especially the scenes in Max's studio, are so spectacularly done, for instance, the red light on Max always impling some danger. It looks beautiful.
""Peeping Tom"" may faint in comparison to much more disturbing, thrilling films of its kind - Hitchcock's films such as ""Rear Window"" or ""Psycho"" - this works on its own merit and the way the film uses the first person perspective, with the camera's pov, clearly indicates its mark on films like ""Halloween"" by John Carpenter which released nearly two decades after this.

2023 CRITERION CHALLENGE 39/52 -- Danny Peary's ""Guide for the Film Fanatic""
Obviously the reputation precedes this one, the grotesquely disturbing career-ruining slasher-inventing shock fest, but once you tag on the qualifier of ""in Britain in the 60s"" it levels out your expectations to a more appropriate place. This has of course lost the petrifying power it had upon release but it's still tight and well-made and tense with a couple of striking kills (including one on a sound stage with some musical DNA but it’s dragged out so taut that even when someone is singing and dancing you're tightening up) and the movie also gets a lot of juice out of ""what about the bodies"" which is something that most slashers totally neglect. Böhm's performance is icy and creepy, and the camera motif is milked for all its worth, right down to the end they still find new angles and dimensions for it. 
One other noteworthy thing is that the women here feel eclectic and fleshed out. It's not like Portrait of a Lady on Fire or anything but two decades before the slasher genre actually took off and the victims become ""screaming hot girl"" this put a lot of effort into constructing a handful of women who feel like unique characters despite surface similarities that would make them consistent targets for the killer, and not all of them die which adds to the anxiety, there really is a sense of uncertainty about who's gonna make it and who's not. But re: the slasher thing the trade-off there is that this has less than five kills so it has the real estate to build characters, once we get into Jason 12 people are of course going to these movies for different things, but also of course traditional slashers kill their female characters in pretty lascivious, leering, salivating ways that this never really dips into, even when Lewis is photographing pin-up models the camera is pretty locked down, medium wide, observational but not even as voyeuristic as the title would suggest. It’s an interesting contrast considering the stuff this would go on to inspire.
Good flick! Great ending! Oh fuck I didn't even talk about design or cinematography which were maybe my favorite parts of the whole thing, this shit looks amazing, the sets and wardrobe and hair and the color palette, roaming camera moves to give you that delectable in-camera coverage or simple push-ins and lighting tricks, every location is decked out, peppered with detail and character, it's so dense visually, a really great movie to just look at if nothing else.",0.0

"Questo film è stato una sorpresa, per vari motivi.
Innanzitutto, non mi aspettavo questo tipo di film. Mi immaginavo un film giallo dei tempi, tranquillo e affascinante. Invece mi sono ritrovato un thriller psicologico con un protagonista mentalmente disturbato. Una cosa che per gli anni 60 è piuttosto particolare. Poi visivamente è meraviglioso, c'è un uso delle luci e dei colori fantastico che ti fa proprio entrare nella scena e ti perdi a guardare quelle bellissime inquadrature.
Il film però non è privo di difetti. Il protagonista è ben costruito e ben interpretato ed è affascinante come hanno reso tutti i suoi problemi, però quest'ultimi iniziano ad essere tanti e si finisce per trovare un misto di roba che in parte non è stata approfondita. Poi ci sono anche altri dettagli del film, come personaggi terziari che spuntano a caso in una scena per dare informazioni importanti e poi scompaiono oppure il secondo lavoro del protagonista che viene citato all'inizio, poi non se ne parla più e poi ritorna verso la fine. Però nonostante questo, è davvero un bel film e affascina lo spettatore con molta facilità. Anche il finale, stupendo e non me l'aspettavo, anche se probabilmente ci si poteva arrivare.
La cosa che mi è venuta in mente è che sarei molto curioso di vedere un remake di questo film, con la libertà che abbiamo adesso nell'horror psicologico, ne uscirebbe qualcosa forse di molto bello.",4.0

"Certainly not as lurid as it was received back in 1960. But there is a feeling of depravity that runs through this. It’s an amateur filmmaker who records his murder victims as he kills them so that he can get off later. There’s nothing explicit that occurs on-screen but I did feel a bit dirty after watching this. 
I think this is an expertly conceived horror film. It’s an interrogation of the male gaze and a critique of how the camera captures its subjects. It also has a beautiful color palette. It seduces you while also disgusting you.

"“I hope to be a director”
63 years has done little to dampen the shock factor of Michael Powell’s controversial classic. Indeed, this still intrigues and repels in equal measure, though this is not a case of cheap thrills. Rather, Powell and his cinematographer Otto Heller craft a pervy tale of voyeurism and violence which manages to implicate the viewer whilst also wowing them with a range of colours that seem to have been discovered for the very first time whenever they appear on screen, such is their vivacity. 
Böhm of course is the standout, the ultimate aspiring artist/creep with his directors chair and insatiable desire to film. His contraption which is revealed at the end is as vile as he is but Peeping Tom never feels overly dreary. Perhaps this is because Powell is so obviously taking a sick pleasure in depicting this pervert’s story. The match cuts between various liquids, the constant presence of stage lights which seem to magically switch on at the most dramatic of moments and that particularly heart-in-mouth pen falling shot all make for a sleazily thrilling flick.",4.0

"A masterpiece of a slasher made in 1960 that covers so many interesting subjects that make Peeping Tom so ahead of it’s time, and what makes me love this so much is the genuineness of this film and the technology used (I absolutely love projection). I can’t imagine watching this in 1960 and just getting to see such a shocking reaction from the audience. You’ll have to record the reaction of the audience for this to feel TRUE to its message of surveillance with fear and the nervous system. A disturbing murder thriller about a killer with voyeuristic tendencies who carries around a film camera with him everywhere he goes. He records so many things he shouldn’t to make a movie of his own.
The audience is invited to have sympathy towards Mark because of what his father did to him as a kid. This is psychologically so fucked up; Mark wants to break the cycle but his trauma created an unhealthy obsession of fear. Mark’s father filmed Mark as a kid and recorded his reactions to fear as his father would scare him with lizards, shine lights on him as he’s sleeping, etc. Down to posing him next to his dead mother. Extremely morbid and sad. 
The part that really got to me was when Mark kept rewatching his reels he filmed of people HE killed and he felt no remorse. He really only cared that his film wasn’t shot the way he wanted it to look, therefore, he had to continue to kill for the “perfect” shot. And that very last scene took an unexpected turn… very well done. The color and sounds of everything added to the experience that gives this a 5 star rating.
Peeping Tom has 16mm projectors, cool film cameras, and I love that Viv carried around a portable reel-to-reel to listen to music on. The best part… Mark’s tripod has a knife at the end of it to kill. There’s a mirror next to the camera so that the victim sees their own death happen right before their eyes is next level messed up.
Sadly… Powell’s career ended due to the rejection of the public… Right movie made at the wrong time",5.0

"Peeping Tom, one of the progenitors of the slasher subgenre, is a psychological examination of voyeurism where a young cinematographer's passion for filming reactions to fear stands in the way for his personal health and relationships. I loved that his psyche is fleshed out perfectly with his father's backstory and M. O., which becomes important to executing the internal conflicts that arise later on. The romantic plotline between Mark and Vivian is used pretty well to explore that aspect, with clearly defining Vivian's interest and taking time to develop their relationship. The murder sequences are surprisingly well thought out, in terms of the blocking, performances and building up the M. O. While I do think that there could've been more done with the side characters and Mark's 'documentary', the story is still written with much depth.
The cinematography, editing and direction was impressive, planning out progressions and reveals in a scene carefully. The production design and score were pretty good, with the latter being unique for its time period even. I loved the performances in this movie, especially from Carl Boehm and Anna Massey (the former doing a phenomenal job with the introverted character).
Overall, Peeping Tom was definitely one of the most unique psychological movies that I've seen from the 60s, with good character work, great performances and holding up well in its technical aspects. The movie was definitely way ahead of its time.",4.0

"Horror stories have always worked on film. It's where they work. That's where vampires and ghosts and UFOs are real. They're not particularly real in life, but they're real on the screen.

*This is a personal piece celebrating my 500th horror movie*
500 horror movies is a lot. But it's a milestone I set my sights on a little less than a year ago when I realized I was already in the 400+ range. The timing works out pretty cool too because 2023 marks a decade since I took the deep dive into the genre. There's a lot to say about my personal connection to horror and how it's become a staple for me over the past ten years, but for now I'm going to focus on Peeping Tom. I can't really think of a more perfect movie to talk about for this milestone.
What is so enticing about fear? Is it the raw vulnerability? Is it honest look glimpse we get into someone's psyche, or even our own? This is a concept our main character Mark Lewis is obsessed with. Yes, he's a pervert who loves to spy on women, but what drives him most is the thrill of witnessing those really vulnerable moments. The moments just before death, the moment where someone loses any grasp on their normal sense of safety in life. He's so obsessed with these glimpses into someones soul that he creates them himself so that he can capture them on film, forever immortalizing a person's most vulnerable moment. It floors me to think about how poignant and ahead of the times this film is, coming at the helm of the what would become the modern horror and slasher genres. Mark is us! Anyone who has ever watched someone die in a horror film or reveled in someone's fear and suffering. We are no better than Mark. At least in terms of our motivation (not so much the ACTUAL peeping and killing).
There's a reason these elements of terror are found pretty much everywhere. Whether it's films like Coco that are about our fear of passing on and being forgotten, or something like Jurassic Park which tackles many ideas such as the fear of creation and being consumed by the past. Maybe for you it's True Crime and it's many fictionalized counterparts (which is an insanely popular genre for a reason).
To me, horror is the honest approach to these themes and the trailblazer for emotion-driven narrative. Do I like being scared in real life? Would I want to be chased by a real serial killer or tormented by some unknown presence? Absolutely not! But viewing the experience from a safe distance makes me feel safer in my real life, somehow. It's my comfort genre.

"Shame on 1960 audiences for completely discrediting a brilliant film while simultaneously blackballing Michael Powell from the rest of his film career.
Peeping Tom is a fundamental and historical film when it comes to the thriller/slasher genre of filmmaking. It was supposedly the first slasher film of its kind, beating out Psycho by a few months. Personally, I enjoyed Peeping Tom much more than Psycho. 
This film had so many unprecedented aspects to its’ make up. The point of view camera work during killings, morbid themes, nudity, and a killer that begged for sympathy from the audience. Powell made all of that happen while also creating a uniquely shot film with an array of color utilization. I am blown away at the risks that Powell took with this film. While they may not have immediately garnered success, I am glad that this film is now appreciated for the horror masterpiece that it is. Individuals such as Martin Scorsese are somewhat to thank for this because he is a known backer of Powell and a fanatic of this picture.
I love the ingenuity of the killer’s weapon in Peeping Tom. I actually cannot stop thinking about it. The entire process of his killings are fascinating and I applaud Powell for unapologetically putting this content on a screen.",4.5
"#141: PEEPING TOM 👀 
Peeping Tom is one of the first slasher films ever in history. The violence, nudity and daring nature of the story saw it pulled from cinemas after just 5 days and ultimately ruined director Michael Powells’ (who also directed the exquisite Red Shoes) career. Which is really sad because this film really stands the test of time and pushed the boundaries of mainstream cinema in 1960.
Peeping Tom tells the tale of a lonely, voyeuristic murderer Mark who likes to film women as he kills them because he is fascinated by the effects of fear and how it registers on his victims’ faces in their final moment.
It’s then revealed that his fascination stems from the fact that his father used to film him constantly as a child and perform various horrific experiments on him to document his reactions to fear. Michael Powell filmed himself and his real life son for these home movies which he also received slack for. His son has since laughed at these disses.

"So I finally watched my first Michael Powell film, Peeping Tom. Well, what can I say but “mmmm.. yes, very nice, very nice indeed.” Peeping Tom seems to have virtually ended Powell’s film career, sadly because it is a wonderful film about a not-so wonderful chap. Mark Lewis is an awkward fellow, he is a mild-mannered, creepy and shy film crew member by day and a creepy and lethal photographer of racy images by night. He is well played by Carl Boehm, though it did take me a while to get used to him, the character came across as a bit too awkward at the beginning but then it started to work for me and I actually started to like the guy.
Mark goes nowhere without his camera, and he lets no one see the “documentary” that he is making. You see, he was raised as almost a test subject by his psychologist father (who studied fear in children) so he is himself fixated on recording (with film) peoples ultimate fear. Of course, to get his models to react correctly, there are some unsavory lines he must cross. It is an interesting film, not so much a slasher (no blood or gore to speak of, but then, it was 1960) as it is a mild-Hitchcockian thriller about obsession. Boehm could well be a prototype for a Hitchcock character and the storyline wouldn’t be too out of place there either.
It is a beautiful film, nicely shot, richly colored and the sets are pleasantly designed. The story is intriguing and “our hero” manages to seem innocent and sympathetic. Really just a great, fun and dramatic film.",4.0

Murder, sex work, PTSD, disability, chauvinism, child abuse, madness and mystery. Some movies are just begging to be re-made and no one knows it.

Unbelievable that this came out the same year as Psycho. Surely there are film studies theses written contrasting the two. 
As for movies it would influence, I see Zodiac in the scene where he shares his footage with the neighbor. Blow-Up obvi! The Master with the chemicals. Nearly any De Palma flick which is mind boggling because he is always aping on Hitch and Powell certainly made this in his own voice.

"people always talk about ‘non-hitchcock movies that feel like hitchcock’ but this is maybe the most apt case—so directly tapped in to his vertigo/rear window/psycho preoccupations which extend far beyond ‘voyeurism’ into grand revelations about the nature of a movie. and this may feel even more foreboding. when cameras enter everyday life, when a child is filmed, the lens becomes more real than the eye; emotion is actualized only when it is documented.

"Peeping Tom is a simply gorgeous movie that feels like it should come from a much younger director. Michael Powell, decades into an already successful career, still had so much to say about the nature of image-making. He lays it all on the table in Peeping Tom, undoubtedly one of his most important and influential works. You can really feel just how far-reaching the theoretical and aesthetic prowess of this movie was. From POV-horror to scopophilia film theory, Powell was firing on all cylinders. I think it can falter a tad in the middle, where the narrative tension drops out in favor of leering at Mark's own creepiness, but for the most part this is a really thrilling movie. I just love so many of the shots here - whenever Powell brings you close to Böhm's eyes, it's just electric. So many brilliant images that show filmmaking in a new light - the camera as a weapon, the image as a product of violence. It is a dark, depressing movie, but a damn good one, too.",0.0

"Perhaps no other movie has ever directly tackled “the Gaze” as effectively as Michael Powell’s  infamous horror movie. The killer’s camera acts as both his eyes and his penis, the instrument through which he views the world, penetrates his victims, and maintains his self identity (note the nervousness he displays as a detective excitedly fondles the camera!). A precursor to the slasher genre’s final girl is not Anna Massey’s likeable heroine but her blind mother, whose instinct and heightened observation make her the killer’s match, even granting her the ability to stealthily sneak into his apartment while brandishing a similar weapon. Massey, rather, becomes the horror audience surrogate, revolted by the violence she is presented with in the climax but unable to look away. 
Lest this feel like pure academic exercise, Powell fills the movie with plenty of welcome comedy that plays into the more serious themes. Miles Malleson is the old lech discreetly purchasing “views” from the nudie stand. Shirley Anne Field plays a terrible actress who is ordered to faint over and over again, as filmmakers have an innate obsession with women losing consciousness. The best combination of horror and humor is Moira Shearer’s murder scene, in which she blithely dances toward her death. We know what is in store for her, so her obliviousness comes off as comical but also quite sad. 
And while certainly nowhere near the visual smorgasbord as Powell’s films with Pressburger, Peeping Tom is nonetheless impeccably framed and designed. The opening shot seems to have come out of the dream ballet in The Red Shoes with its lurid reds that seep into the rest of the film. The aforementioned moment of the detective holding the camera is framed so that only the detective’s hands are visible while Karl Boehm watches. The film indeed looks nothing like a standard horror film of the time, but the style is perfect as a psychological portrait of a disturbed yet sympathetic figure.

and despite the fact that the oppressed has become the oppressor, there are still flashes of 'goodness' in the murderer who has been transformed by his own father figure – when he falls in love and genuinely cares for Helen, even giving in to old customs and needs (like the dependency of being with your camera all the time). at a certain point, when that same woman discovers her deadly side, he refuses to look her in the face and once again becomes hostage to his murderous counterpart who feeds on the purest expression of fear, even if that would spell his death. end. just as there is also evil in Lewis – the need not only to murder but to capture in horror the soul, through facial expressions, draining from his victim's body. however, one cannot say where Mark Lewis, the human, begins and where Peeping Tom, the creature, ends.
it is interesting how the film, far beyond voyeurism and child abuse, can also be seen as a metaphor for cinema. that is, like an eccentric director with his actors, Mark Lewis seeks to capture with his camera the elevation of his victims to the almost perfect expression of feeling, the greater import of fear and the cold essence of death.",5.0
