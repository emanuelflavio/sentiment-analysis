"Weep. Ugetsu is Mizoguchi's horror film, a nightmare across this life and the next. A man, dirtied and shirtless, wanders across a burnt landscape. Ugetsu draws on folklore and classic Japanese literature to produce quintessential jidaigeki cinema. It is a departure from Mizoguchi's earlier work, being more expansive and complete, beyond just the humiliation and pain of women. The Life of Oharu represented his previous style perfected. But this is beyond, travelling to the abstract.
Ugetsu is morally and socially complex, with a heart that blackens as it struggles to maintain righteousness. It is about the ethics of war, especially the way women suffer. It is filled with needless, pointless deaths, carried out by unnamed, ubiquitous soldiers. In many ways Ugetsu becomes itself a metaphor for a society that just went through World War Two, however it is also so much more. It is about becoming selfish, with war and money both responsible for changing people. A man obsessed with money will risk life for it. In the feudal capitalist world of Ugetsu, poverty and pain dominate. Kimonos become a materialist sign, used as a status symbol. Yet such joys are fleeting. Success for a poor man concurs with suffering for a poor wife. Life is always two sides at once. All that you have is taken from somebody else.
Mizoguchi's merges dreams into Ugetsu. It is not a film set in reality. It is haunted with a ghostly presence. It is an endless sea of fog and loneliness. A woman must die to save a man. Ugetsu is about nights spent with the spirits, men resting on the bones of those who suffered, of those worth nothing. For those who are dead are those we consider worthless. This film of wise women and foolish men is filled with deceit. These ignorant souls take advantage of those left behind, the widows and the survivors. They abandon love and family in search of wealth and beauty. A woman damns her husband, screaming pain into the sky. The past is not worth celebrating, for we are only its survivors.
Ugetsu tells one of cinema's greatest stories. It emerges like a tapestry, gazing slowly over different parts in a smooth movement. It is a transfer of emotion, taking us through horror, pain, and joy. Though all joy tastes bitter when we unfurl the full picture of Ugetsu. It is the perfect amalgamation of Mizoguchi's thematic tendencies and the best stylings of Japanese cinema's golden age. Ugetsu is constructed with the intelligent, entertaining, broad grace and energy that Kurosawa also imbued within his films. This was an exciting time for cinema, and the old master, Mizoguchi, was still on the forefront on all artistic horizons. The stunning elegance of Ugetsu's cinematography lasts lifetimes. It has sets and locations that have a fairytale quality, yet they are so darkly concocted and drip invisible blood. This is eternal art cinema, transcendent like the spirits.

This troubles me.
For as long as I've maintained a film log (""Since 1992""), I've made a point of noting theatrical screenings vs. any form of home video. That's because I don't fully trust the latter. The advent of first DVD and then Blu-ray has helped, to be sure, and I'm not one of those zealots who insists that you haven't seen the movie unless/until you've seen a good 35mm print. But I do often wonder, when underwhelmed by a classic that had previously made me swoon on celluloid, whether seeing it in a diminished condition is largely responsible for the shift.
Here's something I wrote on a private forum after watching Tsai Ming-liang's The River twice in quick succession—first on video, then on 35mm. The video version was VHS (this was back in 2001), so the difference was more extreme than it would be today, but my final observation remains relevant, I suspect.
I know I sound like a broken record on this subject, but the difference between seeing this movie on my TV set and seeing it projected was truly astonishing. On the most basic level, you simply can't see what's going on in the darker scenes on VHS; while Tsai's work is always ambiguous, you're meant to be asking yourself ""What's going on here?""—not ""What am I looking at?"" For example, in the shot where we first see the father at the sauna:WHAT I COULD SEE IN THE THEATER• The room's wood paneling.
• A small bed up against the wall.
• A roll of toilet paper sitting on the bed.
• The form of a middle-aged, overweight man with a yellow towel around his waist.
• Another, thinner middle-aged man attempting to caress him.
• The expressions that play on the thinner man's face throughout.WHAT I COULD SEE ON MY TV SET• The part of the yellow towel that's directly in a pool of light.
• The shadowy form of someone else in the room (and that person's hand when it enters the pool of light).But even more significant, ultimately, than the resolution issue is the psychological difference. Shots that seemed dull and static to me on TV came fully alive on the big screen; the entire movie seemed to have more energy thrumming through it. I suppose some of that may be attributable to the fact that I watched the tape late at night when somewhat tired and the print in the early morning following a three-mile walk, but in general I just don't think video's very hospitable to this kind of film. Even if you're trying to concentrate, it's easy just to sort of zone out.
And here's the thing: When I revisited The River nine years later, on video, it seemed less remarkable than it had on the big screen (even as I still thought it pretty terrific). I have no way of knowing whether and to what degree that's attributable to presentation factors. Unless I have an opportunity to see a print in future—much less likely now that I've left New York City—it's gonna remain an open question. ""Like a splinter in my mind,"" as Morpheus would say. [Commits seppuku.]
Anyway, Ugetsu. I vividly remember my overpowering response to this film the last time I saw it, in 35mm, way back in 1996. For whatever reason, it didn't have remotely that effect on me this time. There are still a few goosebump moments—the rowboat moving through the fog, light streaming through cracks in the wood as Miyagi sews—but the film as a whole seemed much less formally stunning than The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum (which, please note, I've only seen on 35mm, not yet having watched the Criterion Blu-ray sitting on my shelf). And its twin tales of destructive male idiocy seemed more simplistic and less wrenching than I'd dimly remembered. (Genjuro's story, in particular, suffered from its similarity to Kwaidan's ""The Black Hair,"" which pushes the scenario into outright horror.) Maybe that dampened enthusiasm simply reflects the evolution of my taste over the past two decades—I've changed my opinion about quite a few movies, in both directions. But it seems equally possible that Ugetsu's power resides chiefly in elements that just don't translate well to pixels. Removing it from my 1953 top ten list caused me psychic pain. Did it get a raw deal? I may never know.",3.5

"Ugetsu is based partially from a classic Japanese folklore literature ""Tales of Moonlight and Rain"" by author Ueda Akinari. Upon seeing the film again I really want to venture out and find this collection of stories. Mizoguchi's film brilliantly and flawlessly mixes Japanese folklore and morality tales of war, greed, and consequence into an unforgettable film experience.
Japanese folklore and culture have always been a huge fascination for me. Ever since I begun developing a love for cinema, I had noticed my draw was mostly towards Japanese films and films by Ingmar Bergman. There is just something about the films from Japan, either that or it's a stated fact that Japan is just simply a cinematic prosperous country. As evidence towards that statement, you could just name how many of the greatest directors to ever hold a camera were from Japan, and see what your total would be.
Ugetsu is no exception and it was originally my first film watched by Kenji Mizoguchi. On my first viewing I knew I really liked the film and technically could see how it was considered a masterwork, but ultimately I felt disappointed for the sheer fact that I alone could not agree with the statement. I assume my expectations were too high. Over time and many movies later I kept finding myself thinking back on Ugetsu (this is the mark of a great film). Slowly as it processed in my mind over months of time, I began to realize what a great film it was. Thus, here I am, ecstatic to give it a re-watch and see if the long contemplation on the film pays off, and it did. It only took two viewings almost a year or maybe more in between each other, before I finally considered this to be a absolute masterpiece.
The film's core is heartbreaking, the morality tale on display is simple and one could see the downward spiral that the actions of the main characters would take them. However, it was still difficult to watch and despite Genjuro and Tobei falling into the traps of greed and desire, there is still much sympathy for them. The end of the film, this second time around, really gripped me emotionally and I could not help but shed tears for Genjuro. It is that impact of a person who makes mistakes like we all do, but sometimes at their worst, they cause permanent consequences and having to deal with the decisions we made, and the regret we have to live with. The way Mizoguchi portrays this on screen is something of extreme power.
It seems either way, if a person likes or dislikes this film everyone agrees on one aspect and I wanted to add that in here too, that the cinematography is some of the best black and white in display on film that ever existed. I can sincerely guarantee you on that. Ugetsu is one of my favorite films of all time and it receives the top score from me.",5.0
"feels like there's no one more misandrist filmmaker than mizoguchi, all the men in his films that i've seen are such pathetic bastards, consumed by their own cowardice and idiocy, meanwhile the woman bear all the consequences of those sins AND the responsibility of forgiving them. of course there's an immense melancholy at the end of ugetsu, but it's only obtained after an immense series of follies and mishaps... perhaps mizoguchi is being optimistic here, though. there can be learning through suffering, if we're open to hearing the lessons we need to hear.",5.0
"Ugetsu is more impressive for its directorial prowess than the actual script. It's a glorious testament to director Kenji Mizoguchi's mastery of cinema language and his ability to extract the maximum entertainment values out of a story, even when the narrative is far from impressive itself.
Based on traditional Japanese folklores, Ugetsu is a resounding cautionary tale on the danger of human greed, against the cruel backdrop of a society amid civil war. Chronicling two couples' surreal experiences of survival and fortune-hunting during social unrest, Ugetsu is simply masterful in its stylish, patient presentation of intertwined character studies, even though almost all ""twists"" are visible from miles away, but it doesn't take away anything from the viewing experience, thanks to both Mizoguchi's commanding of the score, camera, and light, as well as outstanding performances from the foursome ensemble.
Despite the rather unsubtle source material, Mizoguchi's created in his lens a timeless classic that ultimately feels much grander and more underhandedly feminist than its original text suggests, and a rather friendly and ravishing entry into his criminally underrated filmography. Highly recommended.",3.5
"""War certainly changes people.""
""Without you, my success means nothing.""
A national fable of a ghost story wherein Japan is haunted by its own principles. Ambition turned overzealous transforms into greed; what used to push the country forward as a collective community now holds it back as citizens withdraw into their own microcosmic fantasies of individual success. Genjuro does it for the wealth and Tobei does it for the glory, but one is hiding from his nation's crimes and the other is re-entrenching them.
They're only trying to enrich their own lives, but as their ambition grows and they lose track of the reasonable boundaries of their pursuits, they likewise lose track of the world around them. This forgotten, betrayed Other is here specifically embodied in the heroes' respective romantic interests, but the parable is applicable on a much wider scale as tale about how Japan's core values needed to be exorcised during this period of civil war, like an aristocratic ghost feeding on poor farmers and samurai, seeking release from its decimated mansion.
Ugetsu is a great film to show anyone skeptical that old / black and white / foreign movies can be ""fun"" because it has an incredibly modern pace. It's relatively short, but there's tons going on in it from the perspective of plot, character, and theme (plus some fun genre stuff, although it's really kept to a minimum and plays out almost entirely as a straight drama). It's so fast that when it slows down at a crucial point toward the end, it really comes down like a hammer.

"Where do you even begin with a film like this? Every element of Mizoguchi’s masterpiece Ugetsu is baked in a staggering combination of both pain and beauty, never failing to outline the moral disparities between good and evil. It’s almost like Miyazaki meets Tarkovsky, peasants and workmen going about their daily tasks in the far away background as the camera flows in a swift, fluid (albeit eerie) motion across the eye-popping landscapes. Fog has never looked better. Trees have never looked better. 16th century Japan has never looked better, and yes, I’ve seen Seven Samurai. This is a tale as old as time, focused largely on the primal temptations which lead the best of men to a fixed state of greed. It’s karma incarnate, the tragedy and justice of it all told through a fable which at first glance is a heartbreaking commentary on poverty, but look closer and you’ll find another world, a world in which demonic spirits both dead and living call the shots. Sumptuous as this may be, make no mistake, the lessons to be learnt here are absolutely terrifying, but they’re more than worth paying attention to.",5.0
"Fog of greed. Like watching a curve become a straight line through the cruelest of moral lessons: only the material exists, dreams are purely devoted to idealism. This film feels like a fever dream one cannot wake up from until it’s too late, depicting a world of delirious harshness, of raving temptation and sinful desire, a tale of morality, the moon and the rain and the spirit and all the violence in the world. Life is work, humility and pain, dreams of ambition are vicarious veils of deception. The most unsettling thing is how Mizoguchi’s materialism and objectivity mesh with such a maddening matter. A film so deeply haunted that even reality seems to end up irredeemably cursed by its destructive spell.",5.0
"🇺🇲Lack of responsibility and ambition lead two men to succumb in a world dominated by a civil war where the desire for riches, pleasure and greatness blinds them because they think, they're poor and incomplete, but they don't see that they're already rich and complete, because they have love reciprocal, comfort, peace, home, family and child. Blind is the man who sells his soul for worldly pleasures and misses the opportunity to receive genuine love that asks for nothing in return other than reciprocity. Desire for greatness always blinds men when they think they are poor because they do not have material goods or pleasures, the search for this ambition blinds them to the greatest riches in life, which is the family, something that is eternal, material goods and greatness are glories so fleeting and easy to be forgotten, that only eternal love is valid for man instead of the worldly desire for pleasure and glory, and only when the maturity of this conception reaches the soul of these men has the inevitable already happened, the eternal has become the past, and the pleasure turned to pain and remorse.

🇧🇷Falta de responsabilidade e ambição levam dois homens a sucumbirem em um mundo dominado por uma guerra civil onde o desejo por riquezas, prazer e grandeza os cega por se acharem pobres e incompletos, mas que não enxergam que já são ricos e completos, por possuírem amor recíproco, conforto, paz, casa, família e filho. Cego é o homem que vende a sua alma por prazeres mundanos e perde a oportunidade de receber o amor genuíno que nada pede em troca além de reciprocidade. Desejo por grandeza sempre cega os homens ao se acharem pobres por não terem bens materiais ou prazeres, a busca por essa ambição os cega para as maiores riquezas da vida, que é a família, algo que é eterno, bens materiais e grandeza são glórias tão passageiras e fáceis de serem esquecidas, que apenas vale para o homem o amor eterno no lugar do desejo mundano por prazer e glória, e apenas quando a maturidade dessa concepção atinge a alma desses homens o inevitável já aconteceu, o eterno virou passado, e o prazer virou dor e remorso.",4.0
"It’s hard to think of a more instantaneous moment of dread in a film than the twisted scowl on Lady Wakasa’s face when she realizes her lover plans to betray her. 
The glowering happens in the corner of director Kenji Mizoguchi‘s frame. It passes after less than a second, and he wisely chooses not to linger in it for melodrama. But the expression ranks among iconic moments in classic horror cinema for the sheer amount of terror it instills. 
That - is the essence of “Ugetsu.”
I find it difficult oftentimes to write on pre-1980s Asian cinema, due to a professed great lacking of knowledge on the culture. But what I walked away feeling from “Ugetsu” - with its score that is at turns assaulting and hypnotic, and its imagery that lives in an uncomfortable realm between nightmare and grave reality - was extreme unease. 
Reading more about Mizoguchi’s intent for the film afterwards, I learned that he had hoped to convey his disgust with the imperialism and combat-lust of the Japanese people in the post-WWII era. Intention achieved. 
Mizoguchi’s mixed use of Japanese folk tales and politics gives “Ugetsu” a tone that is full of horrific fantasy that touches uncomfortably close to reality. The viewer watches as a provincial farmer is enchanted by glory and wealth; knowing full well the ends and moral of these types of stories. 
And although the tales are familiar, Mizoguchi is so successful in concocting his aura of dread; “Ugetsu” puts the audience back as children... forced to learn these terrifying and macabre lessons all over again.",4.5
"The most distinct, illusory visual style blended with refined greed and economic scrutiny—not afraid to criticise materialism, and having truly significant female roles that offer more than simply a supporting role to a male lead's story. Making us experience the sorrow of the central female-oriented tragedy, which was unusual for films of this nature at the time. I think the first and third acts were far stronger as opposed to the wandering second, but it's obvious that this had been sitting in my watch list for too long. May need another watch in the future, though. There’s a lot here!",3.5

"***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***
Kenji Mizoguchi's quiet, yet hauntingly inspiring introduction to his epic tales of gigantically epic proportions set in ancient times begins with Ugetsu Monogatari, a film unanimously hailed as one of the greatest cinematic masterworks in the history of the motion picture and a landmark in Japanese cinema, becoming Mizoguchi's most extraordinary achievement. Resorting to a high dose of humanism, euphoric nostalgia, imaged illusions and blind ambitions, Ugetsu Monogatari is the classic cinematic ghost tale of Japan, a story of unparalleled power and underlying shocking messages aimed towards worldwide masses. Introducing a filmmaking style that would just happen to be completely perfected in a future cinematic project called Sanshô Dayû (1954), which is his most powerful and redeeming odyssey of unequaled existentialist and dramatic proportions, Ugetsu Monogatari, a film which title was widely popularized as ""Tales of a Pale and Mysterious Moon After the Rain"" with the possible purpose of enhancing the natural and implied mysticism of this prime opera, constitutes a true homage and a poetic reminder of the ancient Japanese society and the most human factors that weaken our condition and increase our tendency to perdition, confusion, non-prioritized personal wishes and to walk through the paths of inevitable consequences. Beauty, once again, falls in love with a predominant hell.
Opening in a small village set in times of the civil wars of 16th-century Japan, two peasants, Genjuro and his brother-in-law Tobei, ambition to build their own fortunes despite the constant warnings of their respective wives. Whereas Genjuro dedicates his life to the business of pottery, Tobei wants to become a world class samurai. After their village is attacked by plundering armies and the kiln of Genjuro is unbelievably left undestroyed, they decide to escape from their home and try to make fortunes in the big city, which is already a risky decision. While Tobei decides to accompany Genjuro so he can buy a spear and a samurai suit for himself, Genjuro leaves Miyagi and his son in the middle of their journey, sending then home and promising to come back. Later on, Tobei abandons his wife, splitting the family business plan and starting to slowly unfold catastrophic consequences. It is here when Lady Kasaka, a wealthy and certainly creepy noblewoman, becomes interested in Genjuro's pottery and asks him to visit the Katsuki mansion. The movie received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White in 1956 and Kenji Mizoguchi won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1953.
Perhaps this film being the 78th piece of filmmaking by Japanese master Kenji Mizoguchi implies experience. It certainly is a towering achievement, which ultimately would be surpassed the next year. The direction, as simple as it may seem, starts to evolve through quietness and hypnotic visual cinematography with prolonged sequences of silence, songs, dancing, nature, drama and water, thanks to its classic and haunting plot. Kazuo Miyagawa, talented cinematographer of films by Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu such as Rashômon (1950), Ukigusa (1959) and Yojimbo (1961), shows the first sign of poetic brilliance through the construction of beautifully captured frames and wide shots, providing an aesthetically balanced feeling of tranquility and increasing tension, culminating in nostalgia. Mizoguchi seemingly felt necessary to portray a very Japanese atmosphere adapting, with the screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda, two ghost stories from the eighteenth century by Akinari Ueda called ""Tales of Moonlight"" and ""Rain"", adding personal elements of his own. This is the point where the screenplay becomes an inspirational piece of writing which perfectly fitted into the film and where the direction of Mizoguchi is split into two visionary styles. On one hand, we can fully appreciate the classic Japanese society at its fullest expression with a predominant feeling of homage towards the beauty of ancient times, thus exalting the sympathy towards the characters. On the other hand, we have various camera angles depicting the otherworldly, the supernatural concept applied by Eastern culture to the term and definition of ghost, relating it to an evil and malicious entity since it does not belong to earthly life anymore, as well as the consequences of submitting our conscience to false illusions.
This is where the haunting introductory soundtrack, which is used in ghastly sequences throughout the film later on, prepares the viewer for a supernatural experience dominated by beauty. It is true that Ugetsu Monogatari depicts characters whose false decisions become the very foundations of their respective epiphanies and culminating personal dooms, not to mention the ignorance towards the truth and the rejection of past errors. However, the story and main purpose of the film ends up focusing on Genjuro, the man who witnesses a supernatural event. Illusions, being these material or imaginary, are the ones that tend to blind and seduce our own consciousness, separating the soul and the mind from what should be important and prioritized, from a pottery business to the unconditional love of a good wife.
Irony is present all the way through, especially at the end. The typical ambition that complicates the successful and honorable achievement of personal goals was a vital aspect for the plot's development, particularly for enlightening the precarious decisions made from beginning to end that would result in tragedy. Even if we put an imaginary shield in front of us in order to avoid being attacked by strong and unbearable consequences, the effects of our actions will never go away if we are not willing to reject evil once and for all. Although unfaithfulness pushed the limits of Genjuro so he could fall in love with a gorgeous and seductive ghost, he decided to write a sacred text tattoo all over his body so he could push the whost away despite being warned about his situation and him having a wife. This decision does not make any sense at all, and it is not far away from believability since we consider that the ambition for richness was a principal motor that moved the wheels of the vehicle of destruction.
The movie itself is timeless and uses fantasy as a false image of the mind, a reality of a society set in any time in history. Mizoguchi understands this concept and applies it to cinema in a feast for the senses, relying on the beauty of every frame the film contains instead on a dose of terror. Family bonds and the supposed relevance of family union aren't excluded as key elements of the plot, but Ugetsu Monogatari, deservingly referred to as one of the best films ever made, is cinematic brilliance turned into gold for the soul, a cathartic experience of powerful influence.

"Ugetsu is a masterpiece in the telling of atmospheric ghost stories which helped introduce Japanese cinema to mainstream Western audience, the same as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. Based on Ugetsu Monogatari collection of nine supernatural tales by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari, first published in 1776. It is a tale of ambition, love and deceit that took place in the 16th century during the Japanese Civil War. The film is so well made that you feel as if you're entering the world of mystery that you can feel that bleak and misty atmosphere as you're cruising into another world that you have to risk everything behind and make your fortune just like the characters in this movie.
Tell the story of two ambitious peasants, Genjuro and Tobei, who wish to make their fortunes. Genjuro, a potter who intends to sell his wares in the city for his wife and his kids, Tobei, a man who wishes to be a samurai. Their village got offended by marauding armies, so they decided to head to the city, but then they heard that there was a pirate on the way they were going, so Genjuro decided to leave his wife and kids behind. Once they arrived, the city Genjuro starts to sell his wares and Tobei spends his money on samurai armors and weapons, then sneak into the samurai clan. Then there's a noblewoman Lady Wakasa who is interested in Genjuro's wares and asks him to visit her place. When he arrives there, she said that she admires his work and wants to marry him and at the same time his wife was stabbed by several soldiers who searched for her for food. Genjuro was soon overwhelmed by lust and greed and completely forgot about his wife and child.
As far as I can see, in Mizoguchi films he always reflects the hardship of being a woman in his film since his sister was sold into the geisha profession - an event which profoundly affected Mizoguchi's outlook on life. He maintained a fierce resistance against his father throughout his life and compensated his sister's pain and disgraceful by putting the hardship of being a woman in most of his movies, in which she always dedicated herself and worked hard for her brother to live well and. and the point of this movie is basically a life lesson about when you seek for rank and might and when you are overwhelmed by greed, you must realise that it's not the best thing in your life but your family and people around you, which might seem basic and normal for you, but you must appreciate them as long as you and them are still alive. Which Genjuro and Tobei both of them were overwhelmed by greed, rank and might to the point where they forgot about their wife and child. Thus film also presents an anti-war idea just like other Japanese New Wave films.",4.5

"99% of films we attribute an aching nostalgia or an aspiration to the future. One of the many reasons we enjoy cinema is because it invokes visceral sensation, that we can bask in the lingering euphoria of what was or what is to come.
Yosujiro Ozu, Alfred Hitchcock, and Theodoros Angelopoulos are examples of masterful directors that take this natural inclination (usually via a historical lens) and revert its gaze. Take any one of their films and you can see how their characters intermingle with the trappings of time, some not as obvious as others. Kenji Mizoguchi is another director who fits into this category. Ugetsu embellishes a near-objective sense of time; a full encapsulation of what it means to be “present”. As it should be noted, this is not a reckless sense of living in the moment, but in fact an emphasis on awareness. 
The very first moments of the film are a sweeping, circular shot of the agricultural landscape. The very nature of a circle suggests something eternal. It is no coincidence then the shot ends upon a family working hard to support their livelihood. This is the timeless lesson Mizoguch wants us to see and it sets the tone for the rest of the film to follow. 
Ugetsu becomes a story of two families who break apart due to a vast array of blind perspective. Tobei is an aspiring samurai and Genjuro is a sculptor who makes pottery. The former encapsulates the aching nostalgia of Japan’s past and the latter portrays the country’s new post-war trajectory as a potential booming economy. The characters are universal symbols for the people, families, governments, and countries that continually look to the Past or always look to the Future. No one is aware of their present state, leaving their livelihood abandoned. 
Approximately 25 minutes into the film, the two families try to escape the troops that attack their village. They hop onto a boat and drift along into a heavy fog. They come across a dying man who claims to have been raided by pirates, dies, and then the families eagerly head to shore. This is ultimately the second tone setter of Ugetsu. Both symbols, the dying man and the vessel, embellish something “eternal”, just as the circular camera motion suggests in the beginning. It is a shocking moment that completely stops the progression of their journey. They cannot go back home due to the raid, and they cannot press forward due to fear.
Mizoguch riddles his film with symbols of the Past and the Future to ultimately end on the simple, understated idea we only know what is immediately before us. It’s almost a complete renouncement of time, by using the very thing itself - the ultimate paradox. Tobei is so taken over by his aspirations of becoming a samurai he loses sight of his wife. Genjuro is seduced by the ghostly woman who is impressed with his modern wares. When Genjuro is sidetracked by the maiden of the manor, they hear sounds from her late father glorifying her impending marriage. The examples are endless. 
The two stories develop a further paradox regarding time however. Tobei achieves his samurai status and then pursues future conquests. Genjuro is successful selling his modern pottery to fall in love with an apparition-like woman. It's interesting to see how the Past and Future intertwine as the stories move on.
Mizoguch then ends the film with a somewhat jarring piece of exposition from Genjuro’s wife. The camera is close to Genjuro as her ghost says she will always be with him and that she is glad he is home. The camera pans outward, slowly, to reveal their child in the same frame; finally, at peace with the present.
The exposition ends and the two families prepare for dinner. The young boy takes a bowl of food and brings it over to his mother’s grave. He yearns for her presence. Children are a typical symbol of the future so this image becomes the final punctuation of the Past-Future motif. Mizoguch raises the camera upward above the current scene to see the rural landscape the film began with. Altogether a huge statement for post-war Japan as well as something entirely universal. Time will continue on and humanity will not live in the present without misfortune.",5.0
"The men obsess over material things. After all, it's the things we own that are the most clear and obvious signifiers of our wealth and status. Genjuro obsesses over his pottery. He's driven to make his fortune by capitalizing on the instability of war, selling his wares to surrounding armies. Tobei desperately desires enough money to purchase the armor of a samurai, so that he can one day be feared, treated as a man of honor and strength and bravery by other men. Poisoned by greed, driven mad by ambition, they want more and more. And so we watch as the two men (and their innocent families) pay the price for their insatiable appetites. Early in the film, we witness Genjuro and Tobei put their families at risk as they hunt for their fortune, floating down a river in what's basically a dangerous war zone, toward a large castle with a wealthy lord to sell their wares. The two men dream of the things they will one day be able to buy with their riches. As they greedily chatter, ignoring the peril they're in, Tobei's wife Ohama sings in the background: ""the world is a temporary abode."" Nowhere else in the film is the message so loud and clear. Material things can be great and all, sure. But you can't take them with you.",0.0
"Fantasy and reality comes together in a story of love and politics.
Once again Kenji Mizoguchi proves his talent behind the camera. The way it sweeps through each character, every scene. The staging is also awe inspiring. You can very well see there was a planning behind many of it. The performances are really good, especially by Mori and Kyo.
The script had his moments, and just like in Sansho, the ending is brutally emotional. Unfortunately here's where the weakest part of the film lies, in comparison to Sansho, the story here wasn't as compelling nor as interesting. Also, something more of a personal level, but Machiko's eyebrow here (and in Kurosawa movie, I think it was Ran or Throne of Blood) was distracting af.
All in all, while I would recommend to introduce yourself to Kenji's filmography with Sansho The Bailiff this still is a good one.",3.5
"I could talk about how much I loved Mizoguchi's restrained, free-flowing compositions. I could talk about how haunting and epic the film's wonderful score is. I could talk about the elegantly rendered tragedy at the centre of this. I could talk about how once again, Mizoguchi makes us feel the pain of a woman's struggle.
I could talk about many things, but no words could explain the indescribable feeling I had during Ugetsu's stunning final shot, where Mizoguchi's camera pans up from the heart-wrenching tragedy we've just witnessed and overlooks the vastness of our past, and inevitability of our present. It's the kind of feeling that films were made for.

"The thing about UGETSU is that Lady Wakasa's spell never wears off. Long after the credits have rolled, you're still thinking about her painted, ghost-like face, that chilling astral beauty, and what her presence might mean in a story haunted by the psychology and suffering of women. The scariest realization about Wakasa is also the most human: the dead not only have feelings, they echo the desperation of the living through a timeless feedback loop. This suggests a parallel world of spirits stuck in limbo, where the dead foreshadow the fate of the living, and the living end up being destroyed by the fate of the dead. Applied to the story, this simply means there's a never-ending cycle of dead Japanese women forever haunting the living ambitions and restless dreams of their misguided, often selfish husbands. Because we're in a Mizoguchi picture, we know women will endure harsh struggles and needless suffering at the hands of vain, stupid, and venal men. Something new, however, not attempted in previous work, is we now get to experience these thematic obsessions in the context of a spiritual horror film, and boy does it come together as the chilling, aching masterstoke I've been waiting for.
The ghosts in this sublimely sad story are strange and intense but not exactly scary. Sato rightly calls them ""more pitiful than terrifying."" They're female victims to the ambitions of men and the cruelty of a 16th century civil war, and each of them has their own story of wartime suffering that keeps them stuck between worlds real and unreal. Part of the grace and eeriness of the film is how seamless the transitions are between the real world of violence and the ghostly world of ephemeral pleasures. There's an escapist element where characters flee reality into fantasy, deserting the brutality of feudalism while hoping to rebuild anew, similar to those children who used their imagination to escape the horrors of war in IVAN'S CHILDHOOD, PAN'S LABYRINTH or FANNY AND ALEXANDER. The troubling aspect here is that while men escape into dreamy fairytale worlds of fame and profiteering, it is the women who are unspared by the horrific realities of war, and who ultimately get sacrificed on the altar of men's appetites. 
In the context of a spiritual horror film, Mizoguchi's life-long passion for depicting women in oppressive social relations, and the worthless, humiliated men who vie after them, takes on its most beguiling form. Equal parts lyrical and narrative, UGETSU uses a Noh-inspired framing device to create a world filled with terror, pathos and aching beauty. Scenes melt into one another with dream-like elegance. Mystical forces cast an aura on every shot, leveraging the fog and its theatrical form to release its ghosts. In Noh theater, ghosts are often used as an omen for predicting the fate of the living. Ghosts will return to the earth with grudges, passions or simply a desire to protect the living. Here we get a subtle mixture of the three. 
In Mizoguchi's ethereal world, it is important to note that all ghosts are female. Some are lonely and loveless and never lived long enough to experience romance. Others move with tragic unrest, returning only to care for and protect the people they love. Other more malevolent spirits press upon the earthen banks with a nervous chill, sounding like distant screams against a foreboding backdrop of weird and creepy noises (that biwa music inside the Kuchiki mansion totally haaaaaauuunts). There's a harrowing exorcism sequence —the best in the entire film—in which a perceived demon turns out to be a crushed victim of male violence. When this prayer is uttered, both on the tattooed skin of a man, and through the confession of a pale woman, we suddenly understand the tragic, eternal force behind the ghost story we've been watching. Women have been endlessly murdered for the errors of men, reduced to invisible night creatures who come back to haunt, disturb and hopefully quell the greed of men into paths of reform. 
Uryu Tadao says, ""One cannot exorcise the demon within a woman without showing how a suffering man develops as a human being."" Applied to UGETSU, one man's idiotic desire for fame and samurai glory causes his wife to be gang-raped by a group of soldiers. His dreamy elevation means her earthly desecration. When he ""comes home"" (like the wayward, returning prodigal he is) and realizes the whore she's become, he's crushed with regret and humiliation, causing the spirit of reform to lead him back to a simple peasant life. Another man adds his own lust for wealth and fortune to the mix. He abandons his wife in the pursuit of capitalism, and as a result unknowingly feeds her to a pack of murderous clansman. Different from the other fool, what triggers this man ""coming home” and leaving the realm of fantasy is based not on an earthen female touch, but a ghostly one. His reform is a matter of being frightened by a dead woman. Through her, he sees the stupidity of his actions as having real, devastating consequences. In both cases, a woman's demons have led to ""a suffering man develop[ing] as a human being.""
Can UGETSU ultimately be classified as a feminist film given all this female grief, death, and ghostly transference? I think it comes back to how you interpret Lady Wakasa's seductive spell. Her presence sets in motion a pattern of women returning to the world despite the evils and violence of men. Women don't actually die in this film. Men can't kill them. These women resurrect. They reappear. They possibly even reform shitty men who are doomed by their own choices, and who are powerless to resist their charms. 
The sexual rapture Wakasa excites in Genjurō, for example, could be seen as an attack against machismo, since shortly after their uncanny tryst he gives up on his whole jocky thirst for capitalism and returns home to be with his wife and son, where he should've been all along. 
In Wakasa we see another ghost, Miyagi. Despite her husband's stupidity and menace to their son, Miyagi assumes the masculine role of guardian and protector, at the same time the feminine role of a gentle, loving mother. She's more of a man than her husband ever was in life, but she tarries behind to wait for him while he works to reform and exorcise his demons. Mercy, not justice, is her response to his folly. Her absence, paradoxically, will feel like fierce karmic justice when he learns of her fate. In a climax for the ages, the camera quite literally becomes Miyagi's lingering presence that protectively watches over her son and husband. It's a profoundly moving image of the dead caring for their own. A gesture so loving yet tragic to the husband who awakes in a ruined home, bereft of her presence. There's a small moment when Genjurō imagines he's escaped the idiocy of his money-lusting mischief, but when reality kicks in, it comes with the force of having been haunted all over again, just like he was with Wakasa. 
Wakasa's spell never wears off perhaps because she reminds the viewer that male fantasies are impossible to sustain, especially when women everywhere are at risk, at peril, marginalized, vandalized, beaten, raped and murdered, and routinely subjugated to masculine stories where men take the driver's seat and women simply get ghosted in the rearer view mirror. That's a spell that's hard to shake. A wake up call that feels about as gloomy as a deserted home without a woman's faithful touch. Women may appear as nothing but apparitions in this stunningly morose tale, but they're visual absence lingers in the mind far longer than the presence of the men. They might appear to be treated lesser because of the exquisite suffering they have to bear, but like Oharu, their suffering crowns them with a level of endurance and god-like resilience that makes them sacred. 
UGESTU is ultimately a story about sacred ghosts, and I don't think I'll ever shake the power or simplicity of that mysterious image.

"""Don't go chasing waterfalls"" - TLC (nif),
A striking story about the dangers of militarism and greed, Ugetsu is a special film with a lot to offer. I love movies that feel like they are from the distant past but have messages that feel like they were written yesterday. Mizoguchi takes a thoughtful script and supports it with beautiful landscapes, great set pieces, and wonderful costuming. The black and white looks so full and vibrant. The last 20 minutes is haunting.

"(...) Aquiescência, reconciliação: tudo na obra de Mizoguchi, e especialmente neste filme-soma que são os Contos da Lua Vaga, nos fala da unidade. Sim, o acúmulo das aventuras das personagens nos faz adquirir outro interesse nelas além da compaixão. E se há conto, mesmo que profuso, não é em direção à repetição absurda do movimento perpétuo que ele orienta nossos pensamentos. O movimento tende à sua própria extinção, organizando-se em torno da ideia de um equilíbrio que pode escapar do movimento ao invés de se basear nele: anexar-se àquilo que resta é também deixar o inferno dialético. E, certamente, é tentador discernir o reflexo dos filósofos gregos naquilo que manifestamente carrega a marca do pensamento budista; seria Parmênides encenado ou, melhor, o sermão de Varanasi? O que importa se a mise en scène toma de um e do outro um novo brilho: o pensamento nutre o artista, mas ele o restitui bem. Se os filmes de Bergman são acima de tudo meditação sobre o homem e os de Preminger acima de tudo meditação sobre a mise en scène, os filmes de Mizoguchi são meditação sobre o homem, colocada em termos de mise en scène. O que é o homem? Mas também, o que é a mise en scène? Aqui, as duas questões nos parecem tão indissoluvelmente ligadas que responder uma é também responder à outra. Não há um plano dos Contos da Lua Vaga que desminta a beleza da abertura, não há um que seja inferior à ambição que se lê nela: conseguir, pelos movimentos mais concertados, apagar o artifício pelo esplendor da verdadeiro. Pois esta arte refinada nunca refina seu próprio prestígio, evitando assim as armadilhas da preciosidade. Ao número ele opõe a qualidade, ao ritmo a harmonia. Apenas um propósito define a sua busca; tornar uma nota tão pura e constante que a menor variação se torna expressiva. Uma arte, disse Jacques Rivette, da modulação.


(...) Um dos mais belos filmes do mundo foi realizado por um velho metteur en scène japonês, autor de quase uma centena de filmes, feitos sem dúvida com nenhum outro desejo senão o de exercer bem o seu trabalho. Após cinco minutos de projeção, os Contos da Lua Vaga fazem compreender claramente o que é a mise en scène - ao menos para alguns: um meio de prolongar os elãs da alma nos movimentos dos corpos. Ela é um canto, um ritmo, uma dança. Mizoguchi sabe que aquilo que se exprime pela violência corporal é algo com o qual não se pode mentir: não o caráter, não a compreensão de si, mas este irresistível movimento adiante que prossegue sempre nos mesmos caminhos em busca da plenitude - ou da destruição. Imagino que o interesse dele - após tantos filmes - já não está nesse espetáculo, mas no fato de não conseguir desviar os olhos do mesmo: um autor escreve talvez para libertar-se; para um cineasta, nunca é assim. Na ternura ou no horror do universo que ele explora, ele deverá encontrar aquilo a que chama-se uma certa complacência ou uma cumplicidade, mas que para o artista não é nada senão a fonte da grandeza que o obceca e que ele acredita poder revelar.

"Day #9 of Japanuary!
Continuing with the theme of watching Japanese films throughout January, I decided to watch a film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi today.
Ugetsu is a ghost story and a tale of greed. Two men are willing to risk losing the most important people in their life in order to be in grand economic standing. They are as self-interested and materialistic as they come. Their wives and neighbors pleaded with them to stop trying to make quick and easy money during a time of conflict, warned them of the potential danger of raids, and these two men refused to listen. One of them even had a young child! The two men's wishes ultimately came true, at least briefly, but not without a cost.
Mizoguchi's films continue to impress me. His name often gets thrown into all the conversations about the most influential or best Japanese filmmakers of all time, and it is easy to see why. The shot composition, framing, and transitions are all phenomenal. It is evident that he was always in total control of his craft. There is some seriously beautiful and chilling sequences in not just this film, but every single one that I have seen from him.
Some people prefer his films over the legendary Akira Kurosawa's films because they feel like his films have less of a western influence, but what really makes me consider him as one of the all time best is the fact that the themes in his films are universal and the characters are easy to get emotionally invested in. Every film I have seen from him feels ahead of its time in terms of messaging and execution. Japanese culture, folktales, and symbolism are at the forefront of many of his films, but the people he depicts are relatable and easy to care about regardless of the time period or where they are from. Every film I have seen from him has been an emotional experience, but never over-sentimental or melodramatic. Everything he is trying to communicate to the viewer comes off as genuine and well thought out. I know that there are many people who actively avoid older films and international films, but I feel like Mizoguchi's humanistic touch and mastery could draw anybody in, hold their attention, and emotionally impact them.
I cannot say enough good things about Ugetsu. It is so good on so many levels. The two men go through a lot of character development and their lives drastically change more than once in a short runtime, but it never feels rushed. The film is perfectly paced with a ton of striking imagery, all backed by a chilling score. Mizoguchi really gets a lot from the whole cast too, as they display a lot of different emotions incredibly well. I can definitely understand why this film is regarded as a masterpiece, and I think it would only benefit from a rewatch. If you have struggled to get into older films or haven't seen a lot of older Japanese films, consider giving Ugetsu or any of Mizoguchi's other films a chance. They are seriously special.",4.5

"After watching Sansho The Bailiff it was clear to me that Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi has a very precise understanding of human emotion, more specifically temptation, sorrow, and regret. Ugetsu, while I didn’t enjoy it quite as much as Sansho The Bailiff, followed this observation of mine perfectly. It was an admonitory story of moral corruption, told with a precision that is distinctly distant from the characters. During the first two acts, nothing was really happening and I was getting worried that this film’s nuance would be lost on me, however in the final 30-40 minutes everything comes to fruition perfectly, and the film proves to be well worth the watch. Ugetsu has the atmosphere and tone of a fable, a story you’d tell around a fireplace to warn others about the dangers of greed and lust, and looking at it through that lens makes me appreciate it so much more. I wish I had a stronger emotional reaction to the ending, and I still think there are some pacing issues throughout, but this film is still great.

"The ambition and arrogance of two men radically change the fate of their families in a period of transition and conflict in Japan. Genjūrō is a farmer who also produces pottery to earn more money; Tōbei, on the other hand, dreams of becoming a samurai. Recklessly, and driven by that great desire to acquire wealth and power, they leave their families behind to follow their futile and selfish dreams. Ugetsu Monogatari combines spirituality, fantastic elements, melodrama and social criticism in a masterful way; another great work of Kenji Mizoguchi who displays all his talent with an impeccable mise in scène. This is a story about the paths we take in search of happiness and the consequences of our actions and decisions on the lives of others; it's a great tragedy about utopian happiness, flagrant guilt and regret.",4.0
"One of classical Japanese cinema’s treasures, Kenji Mizoguchi’s breathtaking fairytale Ugetsu is a ravishing piece of work that extends its folkloric roots into universal notes of human behavior. Morally and socially complex, Mizoguchi tells a story of a town ravaged by the ills of civil war. The individuals here in the story are driven to the extremes of greed, ambition and lust. And the film follows the end result of such selfish acts. Ugetsu is epic in scope, but it’s presented in such intimate and almost minimalist gaze possible. The fantastical elements never feel out of place with the realism surrounding it. Every frame is sleek, articulate, elegant, purposeful with no scene wasted.
In wars, women and children suffer mostly, and Ugetsu paints a beautiful and intelligent portraiture of what women go through in the extreme aspects of war. There’s care for female characters. Mizoguchi never sentimentalizes, but he gazes them with such dignity and respect. He puts forth genuine emotion out of their misery, and allow them to fully express themselves. The arcs of his characters are well-written and quite absorbing. The whole cast led by Machiko Kyo, Kinuyo Tanaka and Masayuki Mori are all wonderful in their performances. Tanaka is probably my favorite, transcending her long-suffering wife character into an unforgettable presence of self-sacrifice and goodwill.
Ugetsu is something to behold. There’s an unusual magic whenever I see a classic Japanese film and this certainly gave me that kind of feeling. Rich and emotionally expansive, I can’t wait to revisit this again!",4.0

"This was my introduction to Criterion 24/7. To clarify, the Criterion Channel just created on their platform a streaming channel of their movies. Like the three channels in the Shudder app, the viewer doesn’t know what films will be playing next. Unlike the Shudder app, the channel does not identify the movie playing—instead you have to literally visit an incredibly basic website which tells you the movie. Utterly baffling, not to mention counter-productive for a number of reasons. Regardless, yesterday evening I saw that they played Parker Posey’s Party Girl and the movie before this was Cronos, so there’s variety. I left the channel on as Cronos was deep in the final act. After the credits ended and this film began, it made sense for me to finally see this highly-regarded picture.
The film: in 16th century Japan, two dumb men prove how foolish they are. Both have wives and one, a child in addition. In the turmoil of civil war, one goes to the city due to greed & wanting to sell his pottery while the other wishes to be a samurai despite possessing no qualities or talents for such a role. Both men find success (at least at first) while bad things happen to the women, including yes, sexual assault; as this was a parable, there are lessons for them to learn.
Before last night I did not know much of Kenji Mizoguchi; via research, I now realize he was seen by an elder statesman in Japanese cinema (including by Kurosawa)--he did a swell job with Ugetsu between the sweeping camera movements and the long takes. Credit should go to cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa… and also the musical contributions of Fumio Hayasaka. Mr. Hayasaka created a sometimes haunting and sometimes peculiar but always quality score that fit the footage.
Why the score possesses haunting moments won’t be revealed here. The movie is a parable which may seem simple on the surface but there’s plenty of depth if you ponder the events in your mind. Not only was I happen to talk of a new feature on one of the streaming services I consistently have subscribed to for a few years now, but talk about great World Cinema. As I've noticed they have also played The Color of Pomegranates & Pandora and the Flying Dutchman, the channel will have strong variety... which makes me happy.",4.5
"Lady Wakasa is a young, beautiful woman. Her beauty and appearance have great influence on those who lay eyes on her. Her beauty is a powerful tool that can be used to seduce those unfortunate enough to cross her path. But Lady Wakasa would have nothing to gain from bewitching peasants and commoners with her beauty, she comes from a wealthy and distinguished family of glorious times. Certainly she is not that evil to do it for sport; no, she can't be. She is young, and yet to feel the touch of love. She probably would've had that chance, a chance at a happy life, a chance that anyone deserves, had it not been savagely taken away by Nobunaga and his soldiers. All that's left for her to do is walk between the world of the living and that of the dead, in hopes of a second chance that will never come. Her presence is a tragic reminder of the past, a deep wound that knows no healing.
16th century Japan, the end of the Sengoku period. A time marked by chaos, a country scarred by war.
Genjuro and Tobei are good, humble, hard-working peasants. When the opportunity to make some good, hard-earned money arrives, they don't hesitate; and why should they? Their lives next to their wives Miyagi and Ohama are peaceful and quiet; but they are poor and they could be better. With all the death and despair war brings, why wouldn't it bring some silver coins too, for food and a kimono? As they soon learn on their own skin, profiting from war is a fool's errand; it leads to suffering, by various ways. Here, it's by way of greed, in various forms. They pay the price for their misguided actions, and the price is great enough to include their families.
1953, post World War II Japan. A time marked by unrest and despair, a country scarred by war.
If only ghosts were real, maybe that way we wouldn't be able to forget, and we would be able to learn from our mistakes. Ghosts are those horrors from the past that bleed into the present. But while the ghosts in Ugetsu are frightening, they're not threatening or harmful (they're the effect rather than the cause) because Mizoguchi follows with a glimmer of hope. Hope for a change. He uses the next best substitute for real ghosts powerful enough to remind us of our mistakes and to show us that there's still hope. And that substitute is cinema.",5.0
"Ugetsu is a supernatural tale about the dangers of greed, lust and ambition for money and power. Set during a period of upheaval in 16th century Japan, two men from the farming village of Nakanogō—each with their own disparate aspirations for success—set out for the nearby town of Ōmizo to peddle their wears in hopes of enriching themselves and their families before they are inevitably sent off to fight in the war for Nagashima. Genjūrō, a potter, just wants a better and more prosperous life for his family, while Tōbei has dreams of becoming an esteemed samurai. Together they begin their quest for riches and fame, only to each fall victim to their own greed by way of bad luck and a malevolent spirit.
There’s something about this film that just screams “classic”. I don’t know if it’s the lore based narrative, the incredible cinematography or the terrific performances (or a mix of all 3), but Ugetsu feels essential in every sense of the word. While it may be slightly dated in terms of some of it’s cinematic techniques, for the most part it holds up very well and explores themes such as wartime ethics, spirituality and family values in a way that feels authentic and fresh. Machiko Kyō gives a spectacular, spine-chilling performance as Lady Wakasa. She brings a haunting and mysterious energy to her character that succeeded in both seducing me and creeping me out. Japanese cinema was forever changed in terms of its reach and filmic landscape following the release of this movie. Both in terms of the influence it would go on to have on later Japanese filmmaking and the popularization of films from Japan in the west, it’s safe to say Ugetsu made an impact that can’t be understated.
Recommended for fans of a good ghost story, as well as those looking to ease their way into Japanese films or expand their knowledge thereof. You cannot go wrong with legendary auteur Kenji Mizoguchi’s exemplary 1953 work of avarice, paranormality and loss.",3.5
"The Tales of the Pale Moon
('Les Contes de la Lune Vague' by Luc Moullet, Cahiers du Cinema 95, May 1959)
Excerpt about Ugetsu from issue 80 (January 1954) of the Japanese magazine Kinema Jumpo, in which Mizoguchi comments on his entire filmography. Translated into French by Tsutomu Iwasaki and reproduced in this issue of Cahiers.
""This film, too, I wanted to make it for a long time, but I am not happy with the result. In my opinion, the true 'Ugetsu' is something harsher. For example, the character played by Ozawa should not have a change of heart at the end but continue his ambitious social ascent. However, Daiei did not want this ending and imposed a change on me. I don't like this kind of commercialism. When I went to Europe, I was told that 'The Life of Oharu' is better than 'Ugetsu' in terms of depicting human nature and that 'Ugetsu' is too 'manufactured'.""
Les Contes de la Lune Vague
Describing Ugetsu in the most faithful manner would involve numerous exclamations, superlatives, and metaphors, emphasizing its clarity akin to crystal and the purity of water. However, to avoid creating a dissonance between the work and the critique, we must delve deeper. The purpose of criticism, unless it exceeds its boundaries, is not to strive for absolute judgment of the work. While there may be evidence in cinema, there can be no definitive evidence in the realm of criticism. It is the realm of gratuitousness, complete relativity, that judges our seriousness and competence. The only way to approach genius is through a narrow perspective.
Apart from using everyday words and poetic references, I am tempted by another inclination: to perceive Ugetsu not merely as a Japanese film by Mizoguchi but rather as a film by Mizoguchi, with the nationality of being Japanese. Masterpieces are characterized by their ability to transcend collective civilizations' boundaries. Apologies for the juxtaposition of such barbarous and paradoxical words, which consider as fact what is only virtual, from which they nonetheless originate. While acknowledging origins, we must also acknowledge that they do not fully explain the work. It should not be assumed that only the Japanese can achieve such heights; what a joke! With Ugetsu, they have matched some of the greatest works of the West. Armed with our quantitative superiority in matters of quality, we tend to extend our benevolence too far—perhaps out of snobbery, but mostly because it costs us so little. We apply this generosity to the exceptional and the indisputable. And through entirely different means, we achieve almost comparable results. Mentioning Ray's ""On Dangerous Ground,"" Murnau's ""Tabu"" for their shot and scene structures, and Preminger's ""Bonjour Tristesse"" for directing actors, rather than Hiroshige and Hokusai, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, Noh and Kabuki, which are evoked without discrimination, rightly or wrongly, knowingly or unknowingly, in relation to any ""Japonaiserie."" Strictly speaking, one could say, although I don't fully endorse it, that it presents a Noh vision of Kabuki in the first part and a Kabuki vision of Noh in the second.
What we, as Westerners, fail to comprehend—the local symbolism—is of no significant importance. Deciphering it through a lexicon holds no artistic interest. In fact, it can be fascinating to watch a Mizoguchi film without subtitles, much like observing rushes—the most captivating spectacle in the world. The crucial point is to acknowledge that there is something to be understood and that we do not understand it, rather than claiming to fully comprehend it. The means itself become the end, as the end itself may appear banal. Knowing that a bean symbolizes death or similar details is of little consequence. What is more profound is that certain subtle connections elude us, arising from the reciprocal confrontation of symbols or symbols with our own understanding. I pose the question: Can the Japanese grasp the meaning of Miyaghi's astonishing death scene better than us? We often explain it based on movement, similar to our modern cinema, rather than the idea behind it. Is there any Westerner who can assert they have grasped the meaning of ""The Man from the West,"" ""Ordet,"" or ""Elena"" better than that of Ugetsu?
UGETSU: STRONGER THAN MIZOGUCHI
However, I ponder whether Ugetsu truly possesses the crystal-clear clarity and pure jewel-like quality that I hastily mentioned during our initial discussion. Can we categorize it alongside Chikamatsu or Yōkihi, those monotonous monogataris that embody a more literal Japanese essence? Ugetsu is not a film born solely from pure sensitivity, effortlessly captured within an artisanal framework; it is a result of labor and meticulous research. My thesis asserts that Ugetsu is more powerful than Mizoguchi himself. It is the most complex film in the world and at the same time the simplest, because Mizoguchi considers the complexity of what he shows us with a consistent detachment, an unwavering objectivity. It is both the pinnacle of art and the critical assessment of the mastery within that art.. The perfection of imperfection and the imperfection of perfection. Perfect balance, in short. The sublimity of Ugetsu comes from the fact that it competes on equal terms with other films, and yet it reigns above them from the very beginning. The field is full of effects, but it is up to the spectator to seek them out, not for the director to serve them to us on a platter through some expressionist solicitation. Ugetsu, I repeat, is a film completely on the margins of the other eighty-five that make up Mizoguchi's work, turning endlessly to arrive somewhere on the side of Yōkihi. It is undoubtedly through the interplay of chance and constraint that Ugetsu achieves its remarkable transcendence. Similar to other significant works of an artist's mature years, it is a synthesis of various elements. As artists grow older, they often reflect on the futility of constantly accumulating inventions and begin to seek something meaningful beyond that. However, it is important to note that this elusive search does not lead them to distant lands like Kamchatka or the clouds, where it could be superficially discovered. In such cases, it would risk becoming a mere product of pure imagination, lacking any tangible connection to the physical world, except through retrospection. I prefer Ugetsu to the second part of Ivan the Terrible, which is more accomplished than the first, because the strength of juvenile cinema goes hand in hand with the nobility of adult cinema. If it is difficult to talk about Ugetsu, it is because it is a film, not a book, and a film that could never have been a book. The meaning of Ugetsu is resolutely cinematographic, therefore monistic, in contrast to the fallacious atomism of literary creation. What is it about, after all? It is about the unity of all things, their continuity, their confusion. Ugetsu's perspective lies at the level of imagination, in the primary sense of the term, and that is why idea and perception are so closely linked. The present and the past, life and death, flesh beings and ghosts, failure and success, what difference does it ultimately make? None, although we know that only the present has physical reality, that ghosts do not exist. Yet we imagine both, and everything we imagine is true, precisely because we imagine it. Only what we imagine is true, by the very fact, and sovereignly so, that we imagine it: unless, overnight, with scientific progress, we discover another form of knowledge. And we have no right to sort through this fact, for to refuse even a part of it would be to admit that the physical world can be denied, that everything can be refused, since in everything that can compose the image, whether its origin is direct or indirect, there is no priority. And it is this monism, in which intelligence can see only contradictions, that constitutes the entire being of the film, since in this film, more than any other, form and substance cannot be distinguished.
AKINARI BETRAYED
Well then, let's talk about substance. The film is based on two tales from the collection Ugetsu Monogatari (1776) by Akinari Ueda (1734-1809), the Mérimée of Osaka. In fact, unlike the old expressionistic film by Thomas Kurihara, of which it is partly a remake, Ugetsu owes little to Ueda. Judge for yourself: In The House in the Reeds, a peasant leaves his wife alone at home to go sell textiles in the city. War breaks out; on the way back, he is robbed, falls ill, gives in, and after seven years, he returns home and finds his wife again. But the next morning, he realizes that it was the ghost of his deceased wife who had welcomed him the previous night to encourage him to continue his task.
In The Lust of the Serpent, a young intellectual is tempted by a serpent that has taken the form of a woman. From the solitary house of the enchantress, he brings back a valuable sword, which his family asks him a lot of questions about. He ends up being arrested for stealing the Treasure of God since obviously the enchantress is unknown to everyone, and so is her house. He is only sentenced to a few months in prison, having managed to prove that he was a victim of a demonic spirit. But the Thing becomes even more furious, takes the form of our hero's wife, kills her, then regains her serpentine appearance and is thus put in a cage. Mizoguchi has abandoned all that grand guignol aspect and added much of his own: Ghenjyro, a peasant attracted by the profits of pottery, and his brother-in-law Tobei, who dreams of becoming a samurai, go to the city market to sell pots, vases, and cutlery due to the threat of the Shibata clan that pillages villages and forcibly enlists farmers. They are accompanied by their respective wives, Miyaghi and O'Hama. In the middle of the journey, Miyaghi and her son turn back to avoid the danger of pirate-rapists, but she is killed along the way. After the sale, Tobei becomes a samurai and finds O'Hama, whom he had abandoned, in a brothel; they start over. On the other hand, Ghenjyro, now wealthy, becomes the lover of Princess Wakasa, who is nothing but the ghost of a young girl who could not experience love in her lifetime. A priest reveals to him the mortal danger he faces and immunizes him against the spirit, with whom he abruptly breaks. Deprived of money, he returns home, finds Miyaghi again. But the next morning, he unpleasantly discovers that it was the ghost of Miyaghi who had received him the previous night to encourage him to accept his fate, continue his work, and raise his son with the help of his sister and brother-in-law. There are, therefore, significant differences between the film and Akinari's text. Ghenjyro's son, his profession as a potter, the human nature rather than the animal nature of Wakasa, the secondary couple Tobei-O'Hama, these are what Mizoguchi added, after much sorting of the chaff.
WAKASA AND MIYAGHI JOIN HANDS
With this conclusion in mind, we must not perceive Ugetsu as an endorsement of resignation and of certain bourgeois values. Mizoguchi never proposes such a notion. His art lies in revealing the beauty of an exquisitely simple world, a beauty that must be renounced in order to be grasped. Otherwise, it would go unnoticed. Just as without the existence of evil, God would remain a mere myth, without Wakasa, daily life would lose all meaning. It is essential for individuals to abandon the monotonous routine of existence, which is Mizoguchi's original sin. This often comes at the cost of their lives, as they seek to experience the splendors and perils that allure them. Only then can they truly appreciate the value of the simple life bestowed upon them. Thus, the curve becomes a straight line. Beauty always carries a moral significance, either through its consequences or in its essence. Ugetsu Monogatari, if you allow me a playful remark, is a successful ""Run of the Arrow."" It encompasses both the journey and the return, addition and subtraction.
This recurring pattern shapes the construction of the film, which tells the story of two couples: one triumphs, albeit with the scars of profound wounds, while the other perishes (in the original script, Tobei and O'Hama were meant to take their own lives). The imposed happy ending distorts the balance of the film, neither optimistic nor pessimistic. It is long known that Mizoguchi's universe is one of indifference, and the cruel fate of Tobei and his wife establishes a connection with his other films.
Each scene corresponds to another scene, similar in subject matter but distinct in execution: two spear killings, two ghostly apparitions, two trips to the city. Ghenjyro spinning his mold occurs twice, and so on. Every movement is met with an opposing movement, such as the introduction and the epilogue, or the arrival at the marketplace. Each gesture, each command given by the creator, is the formulation of a prejudice, an assertion of authority over the existence of the universe. The instinctive reaction would be to cross one's arms and do nothing. Yet, Mizoguchi confronts and rectifies the error upon returning. Through this movement between nothingness and existence, he substitutes what can be considered, at the very least, the presence of nothingness.
THE ARTIST'S MOVEMENT
Like all synthetic works, Ugetsu Monogatari bears the mark of dominance, the dominance of its material by the filmmaker and the dominance of the filmmaker over himself (hence the abundance of wide shots in portraying psychology). It is a form of self-justification. Great works by exceptional individuals often advocate for a way of life that aligns with that of ordinary people. Ugetsu, however, establishes a connection between the artist and his work. It emphasizes humility and the necessity of creation. Ghenjyro is an artist, and the craft of pottery bears the closest resemblance to that of a director. This, I believe, is not a delusion of interpretation. The aesthetic conversations between Ghenjyro and Wakasa regarding the secret of beauty carry a profound message. There is no doubt that Mizoguchi applies these principles to his own work. The creation process, be it that of an artist or a peasant, is depicted as a temptation, but also as the only salvific temptation in a world where everything is but temptation, for it is the noblest of them all. Initially, every artist is a rebel, a dissenter. Yet, the very fact of being an artist leads one to discover beauty. Gradually, the thirst for glory and wealth, which can only be satisfied through spiritual growth validated by success, transforms into a quest for beauty and morality. By nature, the artist is an impure being. Through the attainment of intelligence, which surpasses outdated theories and principles, and the fulfillment and futility of temptations, the artist becomes the purest of all. While everyone, in ""Les Amants crucifiés"" and ""Le Destin de Madame Yuki"", is subject to the irreparable, in Ugetsu Monogatari, which can be considered Mizoguchi's ""Under Capricorn,"" a unique gem among his eighty-six films, Ghenjyro triumphs over the irreparable by accepting it. Through his evolution, we perceive the evolution of Mizoguchi. It is often forgotten that filmmakers are filmmakers, and their most significant problem is not a racial or social one, simply because they currently have nothing to fear from racism, and almost all of them are assured of finding a job that will prevent them from starving, regardless of what happens. The most crucial issue is their existence and role in society: are they outcasts or ordinary beings? Is there a rupture between the characters they portray, mostly individuals lost in the crowd, and themselves? No, the answer is simple: they must be creators. Yet, only a few films provide us with this answer, and it is even rarer for the lives of artists to closely align with the elements that yielded this answer. After numerous experiences of the sublime through the conventional, here comes the thunderbolt. Then, a return to the norm. After reaching such a pinnacle, Mizoguchi will continue to make films as he had done before, in a style that is not ""a new style."" And what he sings here is the perpetual movement of the artist that justifies it all, the futile and ceaseless labor. Ugetsu is Ugetsu and the critique of Ugetsu. Genius and humility are forever united in a perpetual oscillation.
IN FOURTH GEAR
Among all Japanese films, and indeed all films in general, Ugetsu is undeniably the fastest, brutally fast at that. With a runtime of only ninety-three minutes, it condenses a remarkably rich screenplay that would have easily spanned three hours in any other Japanese or non-Japanese film. Each scene, often consisting of a single shot, presents the action in a ""kiss me deadly"" fashion, with minimal editing. Even the Americans, despite their considerable efforts, have never achieved such conciseness. Mizoguchi, both before and after Ugetsu, drew much of his strength from an extremely slow tempo.
Why this change? It was because of Masaichi Nagata, who, witnessing the growing commercial success of Mizoguchi's films in Europe and the reservations that led to only a Silver Lion for the overly slow Oharu in Venice, following Kurosawa's Golden Lion, made this decision.
If Ugetsu is a masterpiece, it is largely due to Western influences, not always the noblest ones. Personally, I see no issue with that. I won't follow those purists who are only satisfied when they can no longer comprehend a film due to excessive local esotericism. If we, Europeans, seek renewal through contact with the East, why shouldn't the Japanese draw from the curious Latin and Anglo-Saxon exoticisms? It is certainly not the first time a masterpiece has emerged from the convergence of two vastly different civilizations. This compelled evolution was already present, albeit involuntarily, in Mizoguchi's previous works, driven by a precise rhythm, whether slow or fast, leaving no room for the superfluousness of conventional transitions and edits.
It would be quite absurd to consider this constraint a disadvantage, especially since Mizoguchi, who is not a fool—and by the way, I should mention that Mizoguchi is pronounced ""Mizogoutchi""—completely nullified it by pushing the principle to the extreme and applying it to all aspects of filmmaking. But he wouldn't have come up with it on his own.
Is it meant to tell us that we are among peasants? And boom! A shot of fields appears, immediately interrupted by another, snap! Barely a glimpse of a lake, and in Japanese, ""lac"" means Lake Biwa. A single, slightly mobile shot introduces us to the heroes and all the potentialities of the drama. Thirty seconds after the opening credits, we know everything, thanks to a conversation that is expertly concise and elliptical, with characters referring to each other as ""my wife,"" ""my brother,"" and so on, accompanied by an epithet describing each one's character traits. And Mizoguchi continues to rush full steam ahead towards his final sky. The speed is enough to disconcert both the Japanese and the Europeans. All great films claim to show us the perspective of God—yes, we knew that, I'm not inventing anything—but what Ugetsu Monogatari has just taught me is that they are made for an ideal viewer who is more than just an ""image of"" God, but is God. It moves ten times too fast for us, and it would take ten viewings to fully engage with the film, since, unfortunately, the rushes have already been discarded. The effects are designed to impact the artist or those who put themselves in their place, not the spectator.

"This feels like a hazy shade of grey that possesses a primitive, numbing effect that obscures the truth - the same effect that blurs our perceptions of time and space. It is a parable of humanistic yearning for an accumulation of wealth and fame, which views the great lengths that men are willing to go to by the sound of their egocentric calling while the women have to suffer for their actions as a result. Mizoguchi’s aesthetic achievement is unparalleled. His shot compositions are immaculate, with each scene perfectly framed, as the cameras move sensually from landscape to landscape, body to body, shadow to shadow in spite of any disturbance; in parallel to a free-floating, slinking motion resembling that of a ghost wandering through the troubled earth.
Ugetsu is both elegant and destructive in its presentation of war and what it means to men and women. Mizoguchi had sung a lullaby for these women, whose lives were pilfered at the hands of war boys and ambitious men who had been consumed by greed, by reconciling both the spectrums of atrocity and beauty with an earnest, compassionate voice. A fool’s dream where one cannot wake up, does not want to wake up. It is better to stay asleep because that is the only good thing the fools are good at. To maintain the veil of illusion at all costs - Call it the eternal pursuit of happiness.",4.0
"Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu is an epic tragedy turned intimate. The forces of war and society combine to split two couples apart to devastating effect. And yet for all the brutality of civil war in a feudal system, it is male ambition and greed that does the most damage. One man dreams of becoming a famous and powerful samurai, while the other wishes to profit from the trading opportunities the war offers. Neither are bad men, just vain and greedy, but this renders them deaf to the wise counsel of their wives. The men think they can beat the social and economic system and lead their families to a better life, but the women realise it is they who will suffer first and hardest, and yet they are powerless to intervene.
As effective as this simple morality tale is, what lifts Ugetsu towards the extraordinary is the way it transcends the realism of suffering to enter into a nether world of eternal grief. Mizoguchi draws dramatic details around the living, with the busy industry of their trade, and the brutal invasion of their wars, and then contrasts it with the eerie stillness of death. The ghost world turns inward under the veil of mist or the trance of music to become displaced and treacherous. The simple rules of survival - fight or flight - buy and sell - dissolve before the ethereal gravity of the supernatural afterlife. 
Yet the existence of ghosts brings more to bear than the grief of loss for those who have passed away - or even the fear of the harm they might cause - it brings ecstasy too. The very real and earthy plight of one of the families draws the husband into a web of seduction where the axes tilt and life and death entwine. And in death, as ghosts, it seems that women are able to reach the men, to seduce them and bend them to their ways, or at least to an understanding, that while they were living they could not do. 
Mizoguchi achieves this transition from life to death through a remarkable fusion of subtle pacing and gliding camera, and notably through the application of a hypnotic and mournful score. At times a simple drum controls the film’s slowed down heart beat. At others it is joined by swirling patterns and shimmering percussion, with gentle dissonances and chiming bells that act like an aural painting of eerie mystery and danger, but also of beauty trapped within a trance-like state, as if caught inside a spell. The music calls out to the dead, and in one memorable scene they answer back with an intensely melancholic song that is spine tingling in its otherness. 
The tragedy of Ugetsu reveals the way love is relegated by aspiration. The men desire to enter a higher social strata, and while they wish no harm on their wives, their relative agency gives them opportunities, while their wives are left scrambling for scraps. Mizoguchi shows us an unequal society within a zero sum game. As the men begin to enjoy success the women inevitably suffer. The men suffer too in the end, but that is the moral of the story ... care for your women - for all of life’s wealth and fame is worth nothing without their love.

"I have to admit, the first time I watched Ugetsu I think it went over my head, maybe I was in the wrong headspace or maybe I just wasn't ready. But this time I get it. It's so fantastical and surreal, it completely threw away the rule book for how to make movies and did something new. Especially for the early 50s, this is completely revolutionary.
I feel like Mizoguchi isn't as talked about nearly as much as his contemporaries, Ozu and Kurosawa, but he had a huge influence on Japanese cinema, probably nearly just as much as those two. I have a newfound respect for him, and will probably be rewatching some of his other movies to see how I feel about them now.",4.5
"When Jean-Luc Godard said of Kenji Mizoguchi that he was ""the greatest of Japanese filmmakers, or quite simply one of the greatest of filmmakers,"" it's easy to see why he would make such a declaration from watching this movie.
From watching Mizoguchi's films, it's easy to tell that they're very well-rooted in Japanese folklore, but they always have an urgency that resonates so far beyond Japanese culture. Yet it's hard to tell where Ugestu would be going from one viewing, but the ethereal quality that it presents, being a ghost story, would only result in a nightmarish quality that seemed characteristic only of him. You can't expect a film like this to be made by Akira Kurosawa or Yasujiro Ozu, but just like them, you could already see Mizoguchi as being one amongst those heights from watching this movie alone.",5.0
"“The mood of Kenji Mizoguchi's 1953 masterpiece is evoked by the English translation most often given to its title, Tales of the Pale and Silvery Moon After the Rain. Based on two 16th-century ghost stories, the film is less a study of the supernatural than a sublime embodiment of Mizoguchi's eternal theme, the generosity of women and the selfishness of men.” —Dave Kehr
“Kenji Mizoguchi's staggering Ugetsu is a film of many riddles and paradoxes that unfolds with the illusory simplicity of a fable. Its initial straightforwardness, as a parable against the pitfalls of human greed, is a misdirection that leads the audience into a void in which objectivity and subjectivity intermingle, hopelessly and invigoratingly clouding rationality.” —Chuck Bowen

"Ugetsu is a quintessential folklore japanese movie that combines social realism & spiritual fantasy. It brilliantly showcase the depiction of poverty & war from the medieval period, offering a poignant exploration of greed & betrayal
Tells about two peasants, genjuro & tobei. Genjuro is a potter, & tobei is a farmer. Genjuro was consumed by envy. He was invited to the castle by a beautiful noblewoman named Lady Wakasa, who admires his craftsmanship. He was seduced by lady wakasa to become his wife while he already has a wife & a child. On the other hand, tobei was consumed by greed. He wants to become a great samurai. When he finally killed a samurai, he was praised by the samurai lord and given a horse, a house and men to follow him. Filled with pride, he brings his men for the night to a lounge, only to find that his wife, raped by soldiers after he abandoned her, has become a hooker. So both characters here had to faced with some tough situations & in the end they were forced to do what is right
Ugetsu succeeded in telling the valuable lessons of how we should deals with greed & how we should be thankful for our own relationships instead of material items. Kenji Misoguchi direction is nothing short of exceptional. His meticulous attention to details is evident throughout the movie, capturing the accurate & rich period settings with great world building & amazing costumes. The casts also gave such remarkable performance portraying the beggars real life behaviors. The soundtrack is chilling capturing the haunting atmospheres
Overall, ugetsu succeed in raising several social critiques, leaving the viewers to reflect even on society nowadays. If there's probably a similar movie to this, it has to be seven samurai. While it's not on the same level as seven samurai, but both imo has similarity in terms of themes & settings. So if you like a movie like seven samurai, then i highly recommend you to check out ugetsu

"a sacred painting set into motion. phantoms arise from beyond to curse our stream of time. the sands of war blind us of normality and sanity. the sands of war set us on a downward spiral dressed as an uphill quest for power. ambition may be necessary to go far, but too far morphs it to an overtaking lust for power.
in ugetsu, mizoguchi shows us a family of potters as humble, but then drifts away the husbands from the wives by hypnotizing the men into reaping the status and glory war can produce, while in actuality their real human souls turn into the shallow husks that the world views as objects, which leaves the women in a state of danger.
folklore driven narratives and compositions fill ugetsu. compositions mystifying and sorrowful. vignettes in which fantastical hallucinations trap the men in deceitfully pleasuring places that close to reveal storms of darkness. the darkness scar the men, filling them with regret that will stay in their souls for eternity.
the wives and husbands experience pain of unbearable amounts, but they both experience the pain quite differently. the women with emptiness and no protection and the husbands with sinful fantasies and heightened self views.
the mystical, dramatic, tragic surface is home to critiques of war-driven impulses and gender roles. the women are left behind by the men as they believe that the women aren't strong enough to handle dangers that they will experience, what they're foolishly blinded of is that, that leads them to more danger. the men's way of thinking devalues the power and integrity of women, and is also very underthought of. this rushed decision returns back to them as mistakes, and hence they face dire consequences and guilt.
ugetsu is an ancient legend that after years, still remains relevant to our modern world and beliefs. fantasies expose our deepest emotions and could hijack our minds of our own control. the film at every turn possible, earns for a hopeful happy ending, and even when that satisfactory conclusion is achieved, a looming mist of loss haunts it.",5.0

"Well, hi there.
Our little trip during modern horror was fun and all that but I really needed a classic today.
In this period piece set in the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568 - 1600), a potter leaves his wife and son behind to make more money - he ends up being seduced by a spirit that makes him forget about his family. It also follows the man's brother-in-law who dreams of becoming a samurai, no matter the cost.
Sounds pretty good to me. Okay, first of all: cinematography absolutely stunning. Miyagawa Kazuo is an iconic cinematographer and I have a few of the films that he shot on my watchlist, such as Irezumi and The Crucified Lovers and I'm excited to check them out soon.
This is a pretty slow and sad film that reflects on the past pro-war propaganda leading up to World War II. No longer is war something great or desirable and the film calls out the greed, the arrogance and militarism of it. Actually, the subplot even reflects on Comfort Women, a truly heinous part of the history and the director Mizoguchi Kenji struggled with the studio giving the character a worse ending to make it more realistic. I'm not sure if I preferred that as some of them are still alive to this day and I've seen some documentaries here and there. It's just so incredibly infuriating and sad and we still don't know the exact numbers of girls and women who were forced into his absolutely heinous 'fate' but numbers range from around 50,000 to 200,000 which is an insane gap.
It's just so terrible and while not the main but a sub plot that stuck with me the most.
Well, since it's so depressing I guess let's move on to the main theme of the film which seems to be 'men ain't shit', one sees a pretty ghost and forgotten are his wife and kiddo, the other one is so obsessed with becoming a samurai that he doesn't really seem to think about his wife *at all* until he finds her in a brothel?? And the fact that that's the couple that gets a happy end is beyond me. I think both men should've been punished, lol, not just Genjuro who receives a similar fate as the dude in the first segment of Kwaidan. As TLC have sang it so perfectly in their iconic song released mid-90s - don't go chasing waterfalls!!
Actually, the score by Hayasaka Fumio was really great but I wouldn't say no to a special edition that features Waterfalls on the soundtrack, jk. It's amazing how well it fits, haha. But I guess people don't change and given that the song was released over 40 years after this film *and* how it's still relevant - which speaks for the film as well. To this day, people think the grass is greener on the other side but dude: just appreciate what you have.
It's a good ghost film that is so wonderfully bleak. And I can't stressed enough how gorgeous it looks.
A great start into the week!

"El cine de Mizoguchi es el más rico en matices de todos los maestros del cine japonés clásico (Ozu, Shimizu, Gosho, Naruse), porque si en aquellos vemos claro lo que tienen de especial, porque es evidente su intervención sobre lo real, en Mizoguchi es un proceso mucho más elaborado y difícil de notar. Por eso las dos veces anteriores que había visto Ugetsu había sentido cierta decepción al no haber encontrado nada que me pareciese especialmente relevante.
Pero ese ""nada"" es precisamente lo que hace grande al film. Que no se revele su grandeza de forma abierta, que muchos espectadores no lleguemos a entender su complejidad y que debido a eso parezca un film ""convencional"". Porque muchos planos secuencia y movimientos de cámara de Mizoguchi no se notan especialmente. Algunos sí, aunque siempre sin caer en el exhibicionismo ni en la parafernalia de un Masaki Kobayashi o un Akira Kurosawa. La adecuación de Mizoguchi a las formas que muestra, a las necesidades de las emociones que retrata, es sobrehumana, algo casi divino. Y sus formas, o su estilo, parece un equivalente al de un Raoul Walsh. No se nota y sólo mediante una observación meditada se puede encontrar su grandeza. De hecho, en ocasiones dan ganas de volver atrás para entender cómo ha resuelto Mizoguchi ese plano, porque su acercamiento es tan natural y al mismo tiempo parece todo tan pensado que no se sabe muy bien cómo interpretarlo.
Ciertamente, el primer tramo de la película, hasta que abandonan a una de las mujeres, el film no parece gran cosa. Gran cosa al nivel Mizoguchi, claro. Es decir, inalcanzable para el 90% de la historia del cine. Pero se podría decir que un Mizoguchi, ""menor"". Dominado por la acción y por el planteamiento argumental, el film avanza más bien plano... o eso parece. Como dije antes, lo que importa siempre en Mizoguchi es la adecuación, por encima de todo. Buscar la solución necesaria para cada momento. Y en ese momento, quizás la historia necesita esa introducción, como si Mizoguchi nos llevara tranquilamente de la mano. Pero es en el segundo tercio cuando todo se concentra, cuando la cámara empieza su propia caligrafía y el maestro empieza a guardar una distancia, a dibujar sus propias lineas mientras los actores siguen interpretando la historia. Esto va paralelo al progresivo abandono de la realidad. Un filme sobre las condiciones de vida durante el período Sengoku se transforma poco a poco en un film de fantasmas. El alejamiento de lo material (el barro, la sangre, el bosque, el río) en favor de lo mental o lo sobrenatural: esa mansión tradicional imaginada por el pobre diablo de Genjuro, creada a medias por sus deseos de grandeza y por una maldición, donde Mizoguchi va trazando desplazamientos cada vez más evidentes con su cámara, como significando esa locura.
El más mizoguchiano de los cineastas (tras el propio Mizoguchi) fue Paulo Rocha. En la prodigiosa A ilha dos amores siguió un poco el mismo proceso que Mizoguchi en este film. En el mítico film de Rocha, el abandono del desencanto político portugués y el lento pero imparable refugio en el mundo interior, desembocaba en un alejamiento cada vez más fuerte de la realidad, donde el mundo de lo aparente dejaba paso al mundo de los signos. En Mizoguchi, el mundo de las materias se significa. Lo material se acaba transformando en ideas. Las formas del mundo encuentran su acomodo en las formas del cine. Es difícil hacerlo de forma tan rotunda.
Ugetsu es de esas películas a las que podemos llamar ""la mejor de la historia"" sin sonrojarnos. Quizás hacen falta dos o tres visionados. O más. Pero hay que seguir pensando que la culpa es nuestra, y perseverar. Descubrir la grandeza de un film como este es como revelar un secreto muy escondido que sólo el cine puede hacer visible",5.0
"Grade: HALL OF FAME
There are scarier films out there, but none more haunting than Ugetsu. The impact of the film lingers in the viewer's mind like a fragrance long after other films' jump scares have been forgotten.",4.5
"Ugetsu can be considered director’s Kenji Mizoguchi personal apology for his works of propaganda during the Second World War (for example The 47 Ronin).
A movie full of themes and subtexts on the vacuity of war, on fake honor and value, on women’s dignity and forced prostitution, on honesty and family, which are unpacked and explored in mere 96 minutes.
I liked how the supernatural element was slowly introduced in the story, and how it was often accompanied by the fog, which serves perfectly to create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere.









SPOILER SECTION/RAMBLINGS
The movie plays with its characters’ arcs in a very intelligent way: we have two couples Genjuro and Miyagi, Tobei and Ohama. At first it seems that the men are destined to greatness, Genjuro starts leading an idyllic life with Lady Wakasa, while Tobei becomes a samurai, as he has always dreamed. But things soon start to fall apart: Tobei is not a real samurai, he became that only by chance, he symbolizes the foolishness that characterized soldiers during the war, who hoped to get a better life, only to be devastated by it, just like Tobei, who loses the woman he loved. The other male character is Genjuro, he is the traitor of family duties, he falls in love with Lady Wakana and then discovers she was a ghost. The punishment for his betrayal is to lose his money and his loving wife, Miyagi. Similar to the Divine Comedy’s retaliation, both the characters lose sight of what’s important, seeking more than they should, even when they are warned not to do so, and then are punished.
If the men are the “criminals”, the two women are the victims. They represent the helplessness of women during war, unheard and used as mere objects, and if the fate for the men is well deserved, the one the Ohama and Miyagi meet represents injustice. They didn’t choose their paths, it was chosen for them against their will, and it's not right for them to suffer, but it was nonetheless their destiny.",4.5
"Unsure what I expected, but certainly not this, a film as compositionally adept as what Mizoguchi puts forward - this is certainly humanistic cinema (which is not always something that I find is necessitated), but this humanity is grounded in the scope of inescapable landscapes. I am not a fan of Kurosawa's bombast in Seven Samurai (a film with many artificial similarities) but I am a fan of the complex and challenging restraint of every setpiece in Ugetsu: people live burdened by the prison of their culture in a free land - if 50s Japan was focal on humans living and connecting within spaces, then these were the kinds of films that paved the way for the 60s: films focal on spaces living and connecting with humans. Mizoguchi's camera is very rarely static, constantly servicing the storyline (mise-en-scene is impressive in that even the tracking shots remain compositionally necessary) but not even the film itself prepares you for its final minutes: shadowed bodies, open eyes, open ears, totally open to experiencing the proper weight of tragedy. None of us learn until it is too late.",5.0
"Kenji Mizoguchi's widespread placement as one of the greatest film directors of mid-20th Century Japan—bested only by the king himself, Akira Kurosawa—is an understanding that, for lack of a better term, just sort of confuses me. Granted, Ugetsu is only the second Mizoguchi film I've seen, after The Crucified Lovers, but both films feel like the sort of movies I generally abstain from reviewing for lack of anything interesting to say. But I decided before watching this that I'd review it, so I'll give it my best shot.
Of course, Ugetsu gets far more right than it does wrong. In particular, the long takes for which Mizoguchi is so renowned work beautifully with the director's keen eye for production design. Whether using built sets or natural locations, Mizoguchi finds stimulating backgrounds in which to place his characters, which is magnified by his strong tendency to let his camera and actors really explore the space around them. It gives the film a real sense of scope.
Story-wise, I find Ugetsu to be pretty good, but nothing about this screams ""masterpiece."" The supernatural element is decent, and the film uses it to end one of the two male characters' stories well enough. (Not such a big fan of the stupid samurai-wannabe who disappears for 15 minutes, only to come back for 30 seconds so he and his wife could literally spell out his character arc.) But the two men who anchor this story are pretty... I don't want to go so far as to say ""unlikeable,"" but I didn't exactly find myself latching onto anyone.
My level of engagement with Ugetsu more or less started hovering around a 7 and stayed there, unflinching, for the entire runtime. Mizoguchi just strikes me as a director whose work is very well-made, but that I'll also wind up forgetting about a week or two after it's experienced. His thematic grasp of war and imperialist Japanese ideals is admirable, but he seems to work in this grey zone without the subtlety of Naruse or the bluntness of Kobayashi to really drive it home. The love for Ugetsu is pretty unanimous, so take this opinion with even more hesitation than you normally would. Alls I'm saying is that ranking Mizoguchi above Kobayashi and Ozu is... dubious, to say the least.",3.5
"#25 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors Challenge
Based upon two fictional stories from the 1776 anthology Ugetsu Monogatari (""Tales of Moonlight and Rain"") by Ueda Akinari, this film is a wonderful example of 時代劇 or Jidaigeki (period drama). It is set during the Momoyama Period (1573-1615), when three powerful warlords -- Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu -- waged a civil war for control of all Japan. But unlike most dramas covering that period, director Kenji Mizoguchi's does not focus on the feuds, battles and nobility but instead upon the lives of two ambitious peasants, seeking to make their fortunes off the period of unrest.
Masayuki Mori plays the farmer Genjûrô, who produces pottery as a side business and discovers that his ceramic goods are in high demand amid widespread shortages. He has a wife named Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) who wants nothing more than a quiet life in the country, raising their young son Genichi (Ikio Sawamura). But Genjûrô is ambitious and has visions of getting rich by selling his pots, tea bowls, sake chalices and clay vases in the city.
The potter also has a sister Ohama (Mitsuko Mito) living in his village of Nakanogō, who is married to a simple working man named Tôbee (Eitarô Ozawa). This brother-in-law has dreams of becoming a mighty samurai swordsman, even though he has no military training and despite Ohama's pleas to accept his station in life. When Genjûrô heads off to town to sell his wares, Tôbee accompanies him, intent upon finding a mentor to guide him in the warrior's way, only to be rejected for his lack of armor and a spear.
When the civil war reaches Nakanogō, all the villagers flee except Genjûrô, who stubbornly stays by his kiln, tending the fire, lest his pottery inside be ruined. After a narrow escape, the five principle characters leave by boat across expansive Lake Biwa to take the ceramics to market. But when news of pirates on the lake frightens them, they separate, with Miyagi and Genichi heading off along the lakeshore on foot.
From here, the story branches in two directions, as Tôbee, dreaming of grandeur, buys weaponry and leaves Ohama to follow his ambition, and Genjûrô, dreaming of money and all it can buy, is seduced by a wealthy noblewoman called Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyō). Before there is resolution and a reunion occurs in Nakanogō, several twists will occur, including a rape, encounters with ghosts, a beheading and some spiritual intervention.
This masterful film impressed me in so many ways. Especially skillful is the application of emotions, from the anxieties of the wives contrasted with their deep love for the men to the blind ambition of the men balanced by their tenacity and sheer will power. The episode with Lady Wakasa is both exotic and eerie, supported perfectly by the use of ancient wind instruments in the soundtrack to create an otherworldly effect.
This film has been identified as one of the main contributors to the post-War rise in awareness of Japanese cinema outside the island nation, winning the Silver Lion and the Pasinetti Award at Venice and receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White. Of the seven excellent Mizoguchi productions I've seen to date, this is my new favorite.",4.5

____________________________________________________________
This is a classic tale of tragedy, told with clarity and simplicity, tenderly focusing the audience's sympathies upon the guileless characters depicted in this film.
They are humble rural folk, tending their crops during a period of civil war in 16th century feudal Japan. There is a family, Genjuro,  his wife Miyagi and their young son, and living next door is Tobei and his wife Ohama.
When Genjuro is not tending his fields, he  dreams of being a master craftsmen of fine pottery, wealthy and admired for his artisanship. On the other hand, Tobei longs for status and a reputation as a formidable Samurai warrior with an entourage trailing in his wake. The encroaching war provides new avenues for acting on these desires.
But these ambitions drive them to the point where they loose sight of their most cherished values, the love and welfare of their wives and children. Unfortunately, their insight into the consequences of their actions comes much too late and they experience substantial loss and shame.
Despite the selfishness and avarice that these men succumb to, it is hard to dislike them, as their mistakes are universal human follies that a great many of us are subject to at some time or another in our lives. It is a stark warning to not be indulgent in your avarice and instead stay grounded and keep your eye on what is important. Wanting more than what is good for you is a certain path to despair.
However, it the fate of the wives that is truly confronting and breaks our hearts. They understand the husbands that they love in ways that those men do not, but their warnings fall on deaf ears. And so they are left to fend for themselves as soldiers close in, raping and pillaging everything that they can get their hands on.
From the few Japanese films I have seen from this period that have been directed by the canonical masters, they are graced with a lyrical and delicate touch that imbues these films with a beauty and an honesty that affects me deeply. I look forward to tapping this rich vein of unearthed cinema in the future.",5.0
"Deeply unsettling and tragic fable with a perfect score and a very mysterious atmosphere. Ugetsu brilliantly juggles greed, obsession, lust, violence, war, masculinity, imperialism, and more in under 100 minutes to form a cohesive morality tale. Not entirely sure why horror isn't at least one of the genre tags here on Letterboxd, because the climactic scene was pretty damn horrifying.

"“War’s good for business.”
Tales of moonlight, rain and man’s vanity, featuring a samurai dreamer, a pot trader, and the women suffering to love them. While inspired by the “mysterious fantasies” of Ueda Akinari’s yomihon, I found this much more grounded than expected (director Masahiro Shinoda calls Mizoguchi a ""supreme realist while also being a supreme fantasist”). 
Like Onibaba, this is another Japanese civil war tale, taking place in the 16th century as opposed to the 14th. But things don’t seem to have changed much: samurai still roam the land, the countryside is on fire, and the poor folks are starving. As far as recent watches of Japanese ghost horror classics go, it’s more supernatural than Onibaba, but less than Kuroneko. Some of the indeterminate time jumps were a little jarring, but overall, this is fairly unassailable within the canon.

"For men who have left home, lost their way, and wandered the lands of momentary, intense pleasure, their bodies lie horizontally in a boat that sails aimlessly along the illusory calm of a deadly river current during a moonlit night, their visions are altered by the descending fog until it grips the waters, rocks their undernourished spirits. But as much as “Ugetsu” traces the lines of the erotic, it’s also deliriously transfixed by a lissome apparition of ideals. 
In civil war-afflicted sixteenth century Japan, two families toil to scrape by in the ravaged rural wilderness. The husbands are tradesmen in their own right, selling ceramic wares in wealthier towns. But honour and reputation, wedged in social upheaval, eventually separate them to their families, the men are tempted, circling the teases of class ambition. Genjuro, the more sensible of the two men, wants to provide more for his family. But behind it lies his need (and greed) to climb the social ladder. He dresses his wife, Miyagi, up in a new kimono, imagines gifting her with several beautiful, expensive ones. The other man, Tobei, is stupid if not slightly submissive to his wife. Wanting an easy way out of his situation, perhaps even to prove himself capable of a stronger role and control, he’s determined to become a samurai. Coy seduction pulls Genjuro in, lulling him into a haunting dream of graspable, higher social status. Opportunity’s hem brushes carefully along his fragile ceramics resting on a tray. His creations are elevated from mere kitchenware to an art worthy of admiration. “Ugetsu” here briefly reveals the complicated relationship of art with class while also interposing social hierarchal boundaries and the morality of aspirations. With Tobei, it may seem understated, but exposed there is women’s lack of choice and freedom. Women don’t have the privilege to want as men want, they are frequently busy trying to survive. The film is fundamentally a proverbial work: people are deftly deceived by the guaranteed grandiosity of tangible, superficial matters, when these are nothing without a hold of reality. But it is also a romantic fable in some parts, told and performed in spirit of Japanese theatrical forms. Real love lets people be themselves, not see themselves for what they’re not. And dying only seems finalised in knowing one had loved and was loved, in finally returning home.",4.0
"Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering.
Love and family at a time when they would seem like what you want the least, but in reality are when they are needed most. While entries in the subgenre can certainly vary in quality, in terms of a consistent visual aesthetic almost always being guaranteed to wow, I think there are few constantly gorgeous types of movies more arresting than samurai films. The magic with it often is that for it seemingly being something that should be linear, it almost always isn't. The swords and the armor can be background flair for things like the supernatural and deeply buried functions of the human subconscious. Here we see greed, temptation, and frustration come to the surface. The very small bits of violence have weight to them, but Ugetsu shines in its emotional intensity, all of its main actors giving believable performances. Some moments of drama could be stronger or more cohesive, but otherwise, this is a movie where even if I would mainly say that I just like it, it doesn't have many flaws you could point out. The Criterion Challenge has been a fun and varied way to begin film viewings this year, I can also say that much.
7/10",3.5
"This film is shot very beautifully. Unfortunately that’s the only thing I like about it.
The performances are much too over the top for me to engage with this. None of these characters feel real.
Also, women being raped and murdered for the sake of a plot that’s not even about them is really yucky to me. And if this is supposed to be a cautionary tale about delusions of grandeur than the men with the delusions who were irresponsible should have been the ones to suffer in the end, not their wives. Secondhand punishment isn’t terribly effective, at least not as a narrative device.",0.0
"Vibes akin to The Witch and The Wailing.
This one truly got better as it went along and by the 3rd act I was witnessing a truly unique and powerful work of art.
It is atmospheric, narratively dense and elegantly directed.
Compositions are calculated with such a delicate finesse, that you can't help but be pulled into this strange new world. The story escalates to a breathtaking climax and the themes hit ferociously hard. Even though it started off a bit slow and it caused me to be skeptical, I can say all the hype about this film is warranted.
A haunting Japanese fable that touches upon greed, pride, and the downfall of ambition. It feels incredibly ahead of its time for the way it portrays these dark ideas in a haunting, poetic and yet violent way.
I love the parallel narratives here. Both characters are put through trials that will serve as explorations and parables of the bigger themes.
Imagine going to a brothel to cheat on your wife and you see your wife is working there. Oof.",4.5
"Forgot to log this a little while ago, but it was solid. Technically phenomenal. It's really just a story about greed and how you should be grateful for the relationships in your life instead of material items, and its done very well by incorporating supernatural elements into an otherwise grounded narrative. The main characters are very likable, and their conflicts as peasants in a civil-war-torn 16th century Japan are even more impactful because of this. The Sengoku period surely didn't seem like a barrel of fun. Despite the bittersweet conclusion this is mostly a tragedy, and more power to Mizoguchi for highlighting the importance of relationships in a time where power and greed thrived over basic human decency. This was a good one.",4.0
"Mizoguchi presents a singular alternative to what we understand to be cinema. And for all the masters and masterpieces the following decades have given us since we lost him, the medium has yet to fulfill the potential of the art form as reached towards here. The way the camera thinks and reacts to every given moment, the distanced and formal relationship to narrative, the shifts in light, the control of mood, the way such wretched humanity is expressed only through beauty.",5.0
"I sometimes think of watching films as a journey through a beautiful, endless forest. The films are the trees, and our path, whichever way we choose, takes us down and around various vistas (no two the same). Some are worth our time, some not, and others are so glorious we mark them down on our map to return to and marvel at a later date. Ugetsu and Mizoguchi fall into this final category.
Furthermore, film watching resembles the realities depicted in Ugestsu, where we wander from one ghost world to another. We deceive ourselves; let ourselves be deceived. And what a marvelous cinematic poem is Mizoguchi's Ugetsu, a film about twofold, juxtaposed ambition: fame and wealth (greed, by extension); and art creation. Inherently, art lends itself to risking everything and persevering against all odds when facing the highest stakes. As such, the film is a treasure trove of creativity, passion, and genius.
The ghost story is central, too, but less extensively than the film's reputation suggests. It is more the matter through which Mizoguchi channels his meditations on art, death, and lust. The fact that Ugestsu is not strictly tied into the ghost story tradition is something that actually benefits the first viewings of the film (or at the very least, it is worth keeping in mind that this is a mélange of three short stories, two from Ueda Akinari and one from Guy de Maupassant). Not to say Ugestsu is not a powerful predecessor to Onibaba, Kwaidan, and Kuroneko, it is simply advisable to avoid generic categorization so as not to be led astray or to see a film that does not exist.
As for the ghost story aspect, the Criterion DVD provides prints of the stories on which Ugestu is based (listed above). However, I would instead direct viewers to a remarkable collection of Chinese ghost stories similar in spirit, Pu Songling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. These stories also help unwrap the depth of the narrative at play in Ugetsu and how the supernatural is linked to Lake Biwa, through which the group travels in the spectral mist. It would be fascinating to know whether Mizoguchi saw Dreyer's Vampyr since the iconic Lake Biwa scene is so similar in atmosphere to a specific location in Dreyer's phantasmagoria.
Thrillingly, the true haunting is in the visuals. Cinematographer Miyagawa Kazuo stated in 1992 (as recorded by Phillip Lopate) that they utilized a crane for their shots in roughly 70 percent of the film. The camera, then, functions as a ghost of its own, one who sees everything and moves without corporeal limits, joining the worlds together seamlessly as it hovers through the air with such grace and beauty that one wonders what superhuman skill it must have taken to make such unearthly magic out of machinery. Lopate's eloquent expression states, ""it is the movie's supreme balancing act to be able to move seamlessly between the realistic and the otherworldly."" The final homecoming, one of the most heart-rending of them all, is where the worlds intertwine and become transparent planes atop each other.
The staggering amount of quality cinema that emerged from Japan during the fifties is beyond belief. Kurosawa took the world by storm, but in a quiet corner, Ozu, Naruse, and Mizoguchi were making the films of their lives; rightfully, Ugetsu is now recognized near the top of that unique class of masterpieces.",5.0
"Ugetsu Monogatari - My first Mizoguchi experience proved to be one of immeasurable enchantment. The tale, whilst simple is thematically layered and made even more resonant by the haunting and dramatic score and bewitching photography. Much like Kobayashi's 'Kwaidan' and Shindo's 'Onibaba' there is a element of the supernatural that seems to be infused in Japanese culture of the time.
The tale of two couples who strive to earn a living in a harsh civil war climate, that with the sniff of greater fortune make two different but equally damaging trajectories into a higher social standing. The more humble of the two is a father that is initially tested with good fortune in pottery sales but is seduced by something and someone that he would have not suspected. The other is more foolish of nature and craves the power and social standing of a warrior and with some luck and dishonesty manages to get more than he bargained for. With both husbands making unwise and unbalanced decisions their female counterparts fare poorly with some tragic outcomes that steer the moral compass of the film.
The exquisite photography and framing throughout captures both the harsh realism of the time and the supernatural elements that form the fabric of the film. The most famous scenes are the stills that are portrayed on the DVD artwork, and in motion are simply intoxicating and seductive. The score is propelled with a sense of doom as wailing vocals float over a marching drum rhythm. The performances are honest and nuanced and every character is memorable in their delivery.
This film is of Masterpiece distinction, a captivating and multifaceted tale that sees me eager to fall under it's spell again and again, but also seek out more of Master Mizoguchi's work. A must see!",5.0
"Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari should never be forgotten, as it’s a powerful cautionary tale against temptation. Through its multiple narratives, the film demonstrates how human impulsion and coveting leads to underappreciating the elements of our lives necessary for perennial happiness, such as the people who genuinely care for you, and can end up in tragedy. Thematically, the film can be thought of in the same alley as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and, like Au hasard Balthazar, it strives no less than to capture the entire human condition in just about 90 minutes.
The film is set in a virtually anarchic era filled with violently warring clans. This provides the backdrop to the story, which is about two peasants who have larger aspirations in their lives. One of them is a pottery maker who, in his desire to achieve great wealth after an exceptionally lucrative day at the market, obsessively creates as much pottery and neglects his family, even during moments where clans would place them all in jeopardy. The other peasant dreams of becoming a respected and noble samurai who similarly neglects his wife’s pleas, orders, and eventually much more in his myopic quest.
When both men travel to a town from their distant village, the tale begins where the two not only lose themselves in their own fantasies but also unintentionally harm their loved ones through embarking on their own selfish quests. The pottery maker’s journey in particular is one that's especially surreal, dreamy, and sometimes terrifying as his human impulsion of lust overcomes him. As for the wannabee-samurai, his tale will be a rise and fall, both caused by unconventional moments that demonstrate how uncaring and sporadic fate can be.
Simultaneously, the film shows how women in society also suffer with extremely limited positions, few chances to climb a social latter, and stereotypical roles that they are expected to fulfill in the dark juxtaposition with the leading males of the film arrogantly pursuing their personal adventures. As much as this film tortures the men in the end, it also takes a huge bite at the women. Everybody loses in a sense; however, there's still a message of optimism as the film makes a plea for compassion, compromise, and appreciation of life, again, similar to Sierra Madre for comparison.
Besides the film having potent thematic material to work with, it’s beautiful to look at. Mizoguchi is a master of framing and of organizing complex shots. He plays with nature and places the human characters of the story in the landscape much like how a painter would; some scenes, aided by smoke effects and menacing surreal lighting, are as tranquil in their beauty as they are devastating for what the characters are or will go through. However, perhaps above all else the cinematography and visuals also bring a supernatural element to the film, which is appropriate as the film’s universe is one where the human emotions and cries of agony are integral to the supernatural world fluidly permeating about. This is all perfect as the film also toys with such supernatural elements and superstitions, seamlessly turning the world into a fantastical dream or a terrifying premonition to further delve into the psyche of the characters.
Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu Monogatari should remain relevant for as long as we are alive. It's one of the many films that should aid in an understanding of the human condition and, crucially, steps that should be taken in preventing the existential suffering that can take over in such an experience. The film may be as Japanese as it can get, all the way down to its traditional-sounding score, but at its core it’s a film that should speak to everybody. Completely worthy of checking out for much of the similar reasons detailed here is Mizoguchi’s Sansho the Bailiff, a film he made a year later in 1954. Like Ugetsu, Sansho's also as deliciously devastating as it is prophetic and otherworldly.",4.5

This is my first film by Kenji Mizoguchi, and I am absolutely enthralled. The majority of the film is pretty good, but it is towards the end that it becomes a masterclass of foreign cinema and of cinema in general. With excellent direction, great performances, and stunning cinematography, it is definitely one of the best films to come out of the Japanese Golden Age. Though the first two acts are a bit slow, the build-up is completely worth it, as the final act is brilliantly powerful and unsettling in equal measures. It is an interesting look into the rise and fall in each of a group of four villagers, and offers compelling insight into the world of greed and corruption, as well as that of magical realism and fantasy. Overall, it is a stunning film, and I highly anticipate experiencing more of what Mizoguchi has to offer.",5.0

Ugetsu is highly regarded as a masterpiece by both critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I’m inclined to agree. This film touches on many topics. War, greed, regret, how men and women were supposed to live their lives during the feudal Japan era. But the thing that resonated with me the most was both husband’s inability to be happy and content with their already blessed lives. Tobei had dreams and aspirations to become a samurai. Genjuro was not content with the live he had with his wife and child, so sought to make more money by making and selling pottery. Both men would do anything to achieve their dreams and make them a reality. But they ended up doing so at the cost of their wives. Even after all the warnings and signs. The movie is a slow burn for the first 2/3s and does an excellent job at building things up for the finale. Machiko Kyo as Lady Wakasa was out of this world, literally and figuratively. She played the part with such a haunting grace. Her speech and slow movements totally had me in a trance. The story of her and the fall of her clan is heartbreaking and further pushes the themes of societal pressures (especially towards women) during that era. The cinematography in the movie is nothing short of astonishing. The camera movements, the lighting techniques, the framing/staging. It’s all masterfully handled and sets the atmosphere beautifully. The third act of Ugetsu is practically flawless, it’s insane. Tobei was seeking to become a samurai to be able to provide for his wife and give her protection, but ultimately loved the status and fame more. Genjuro wanted to make more money and provide for his wife and child, but ended up being swayed by the false promises of royalty and lust. Ultimately, what these men were really fighting for got pushed to the side and by the time they realized it, it was too late. Ugetsu is a harrowing and sorrowful cautionary tale and is a straight up classic in cinema. Count your blessings, people.",5.0

a cautionary tale of the greed, folly and pride of men, amidst the spoils of war, that's still relevant today, even though it takes place so many years ago. told in such a poetic and magical way, ugetsu leaves a lasting impression of its name: tales of moonlight and rain. i haven't seen many jidaigeki stories yet, but i think i'm partial to the ghost ones, as they hold some kind of beauty that i cannot forget.

"So, nach fast zwei Wochen, vollgepackt mit 6 Klausuren, einem Norovirus, der sich durch mein Haus zog und Fieber, bin ich wieder hier auf Letterboxd mit 'ner Review unterwegs.
Ende der Durchsage, jetzt geht's ans Eingemachte!
———————————————————————————
""Ohne Geld ist das Leben hoffnungslos und mühsam"", sagte ein erwachsener Hersteller für Töpferwaren, kurz bevor er für Geld reist, um die Familie zu versorgen und vom Reichtum in der sonstigen Armut leben zu können.
Er verfolgt einen nahezu unmöglichen Traum.
Ein Landarbeiter, ein kindlicher und egoistischer Nachbar, will ein Samurai werden und als Held des gerade bevorstehenden Krieges von allen Seiten gefeiert werden, um in Saus und Braus sich suhlen zu können.
Auch er verfolgt einen Traum, der für manch anderer sagenhaft, aber von ihm ad absurdum geführt wird.
Träume...
""Ugetsu"" (Deutsch: ""Unter dem Regenmond""), inszeniert von Kenji Mizoguchi, ist neben Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" der filmisch endgültige Durchbruch Japans auf die internationale Spur des Erfolgs folgender Jahre in den 1950ern, die auch als ""Goldenes Zeitalter des japanischen Kinos"" bezeichnet werden. Doch bereits 1956 verstarb der Regisseur aufgrund von Leukämie, welche damals noch unheilbar war.
Zu schade, denn wer weiß, was er noch aus seinem Regie-Ärmel hätte zaubern können.
Dieser Film ist in vielerlei Hinsicht progressiv bzw. seiner Zeit meilenweit voraus. Zwar mag man wieder die gängige Theatermethode im Schauspiel zu verspüren (was mich selbst nie gestört hat), doch in der Inszenierung steht der Film über all dem, was damals im selben Raum so geboten wurden.
Ein herrliches Kontrastprogramm aus reudigen und vom Ehrgeiz zerrissenen Männern im Auge des Sturmes, welcher vom Krieg einherzieht, die umschleiert werden von einer eleganten Kameraführung, einer runden Erzählweise und einer mystischen Atmosphäre.
Themen wie Vergewaltigung, Tod, Krieg, Wahrheit, Illusion und die Liebe werden allesamt nie aufgedrängt erzählt, sondern fügen sich ein als ein sehr interessantes Porträt des Japans im 16. Jahrhundert ab, wo Leid und Liebe in Zeiten langer kleinerer und größerer Kriege ungewollt Hand in Hand gingen.
Aber nicht falsch verstehen! Es handelt sich hier nicht um eine epochale Odyssee zweier Männer, die in einem Bürgerkrieg Geld, Reichtum und Ruhm erlangen wollen. Man bleibt bei den Figuren und ihren Ambitionen, die vermehrt in Lust und Triebe sich formen.
Und egal wie ""typisch männlich"" die Grundprämisse ist, so sanft wie die Hände einer Frau ist die Erzählweise und das führt zu einer großartigen Kombo.
Ich will schließlich nicht zu viel verraten, denn selbst nach 21:00 Uhr war ich ohne geschlossene Lider tüftig an der Geschichte und war fasziniert, wie viel man darin findet, was im Nachhinein die Welt des Films der nächsten Dekaden prägte.
Ich habe so gut wie nichts daran auszusetzen.
""Ugetsu"" ist ein kurzweiliger und unfassbar facettenreicher Meilenstein der Filmgeschichte, ein Gedicht von Mizoguchi, wo Liebe und Leid miteinander verschmelzen und man muss ihn auf jeden Fall mal gesehen werden, egal ob das Theaterschauspiel östlicherseits einem zuspricht oder nicht.
Eine Empfehlung an Fans des asiatischen Kinos einer Zeit, die bis heute aufzublühen scheint.
Ihr habt jetzt noch die Möglichkeit am liebsten selbst ein Bild machen, denn bis zum Januar 2022 ist dieses Stück Filmkunst in der ARTE-Mediathek kostenlos verfügbar.",4.5
"O QUE É A MISE EN SCÈNE?, por Alexandre Astruc.
Não é necessário ter feito muitos filmes para dar-se conta de que a mise en scène não existe, que os atores se dirigem muito bem sozinhos, que qualquer operador de câmera sabe onde colocá-la para obter um enquadramento conveniente, que o acordo entre os planos faz-se sozinho, etc. Mizoguchi e Ophüls devem ter compreendido isso muito rápido para passar logo ao que lhes interessava. Observar as pessoas agirem? Não exatamente. Apresentá-las, observá-las tanto ao agir como ao mesmo tempo serem levadas à ação.
A diferença do cinema para não importa o quê, incluso o romance, é primeiramente a impossibilidade da mentira; em segundo, a absoluta certeza, partilhada por espectador e autor, que na tela tudo se arranjará com o tempo. Se o metteur en scène, o realizador, intervém em qualquer coisa na realização de um filme, ele intervém nisto, antes de tudo. Ele se aventura entre estas duas evidências: a da imagem por onde ele espreita e a da duração pela qual ele a conclui.
Com isto, todavia, ele não destrói: a lenta erosão da verdade, que é a arte de um Proust, ou a explosão desta como em Faulkner, pressupõe que o romance seja escrito com palavras, fragmentos de eternidade. Se ele fixa o real, é à custa de um constante esforço de decomposição, destruição de formas, marcha de encontro a um vocabulário cujos detritos serão levados pelo rio.
A câmera fixa não transcende, observa: é preciso ser ingênuo para crer que o uso sistemático de lentes 18,5 mudará o rumo das coisas. Em troca disso, ela não mente. O que é surpreendido pela objetiva é o movimento dos corpos, imediatamente revelador, como tudo o que é físico, a dança, um olhar feminino, uma alteração de ritmo nos passos, a beleza, a verdade etc.
O cinema supõe uma certa confiança feita ao mundo tal como ele é. Mesmo em meio à feiúra, mesmo em meio à miséria. Ele revela esta estranha e cruel ternura, a doçura terrível de Hiroshima, onde, após a evocação de tantos horrores, são suficientes alguns travellings rápidos no coração de uma cidade e uma voz de mulher para que muito naturalmente as linhas de uma paisagem se organizem segundo uma perspectiva humana, como se muito naturalmente e por qual estranha armadilha tudo aquilo que aqui era ansiado fosse um dia resolvido.
Um dos mais belos filmes do mundo foi realizado por um velho metteur en scène japonês, autor de quase uma centena de filmes, feitos sem dúvida com nenhum outro desejo senão o de exercer bem o seu trabalho. Após cinco minutos de projeção, Contos da Lua Vaga fazem compreender claramente o que é a mise en scène - ao menos para alguns: um meio de prolongar os elãs da alma nos movimentos dos corpos. Ela é um canto, um ritmo, uma dança. Mizoguchi sabe que aquilo que se exprime pela violência corporal é algo com o qual não se pode mentir: não o caráter, não a compreensão de si, mas este irresistível movimento adiante que prossegue sempre nos mesmos caminhos em busca da plenitude - ou da destruição. Imagino que o interesse dele - após tantos filmes - já não está nesse espetáculo, mas no fato de não conseguir desviar os olhos do mesmo: um autor escreve talvez para libertar-se; para um cineasta, nunca é assim. Na ternura ou no horror do universo que ele explora, ele deverá encontrar aquilo a que chama-se uma certa complacência ou uma cumplicidade, mas que para o artista não é nada senão a fonte da grandeza que o obceca e que ele acredita poder revelar.
O que acontece então à técnica? Ela deixa de ser uma forma de mostrar - ou de esconder. Estilo não é uma maneira de deixar belo o que inicialmente é feio e vice-versa: nenhum cineasta no mundo fará confiança à fotografia, se sua ambição não for concorrer com Yvon. Ela não será sequer uma tomada de consciência: travellings não são notas, nem referências no rodapé da página. Parece-me que a técnica só tem por função fazer nascer esta distância misteriosa entre o autor e seus personagens, cujas oscilações e deambulações pela floresta parecem acompanhadas muito fielmente pelos movimentos de câmera.
Parecem: pois a força e a grandeza deste universo que reaparece de obras em obras advém do autor dominar constantemente seus elementos. Ele os curva, talvez não à sua visão própria - Mizoguchi é um cineasta, não um romancista -, mas a uma certa necessidade de assumir um recuo em relação a eles: sabedoria, ou vontade de sabedoria. Assim o poema trágico adquire sua força na insensibilidade ou frieza aparente do artista, que parece instalado em sua posição, câmera à mão, na curva do rio, vigiando a planície de onde despontarão os atores do drama.
A requintada e tocante doçura dos Contos da Lua Vaga consiste, como em alguns westerns, desta lentidão irremediável que carrega, seja através da violência ou da cólera, um punhado de indivíduos cujos destinos são insignificantes.
No entanto, Mizoguchi bem sabe que importa pouco se esses filmes terminam bem, não mais que o cuidado em saber se, entre ele e seus personagens, os laços mais fortes serão de ternura ou de desprezo. Ele é como o voyeur que busca o lampejo de prazer no rosto daqueles que ele espreita, ainda que não seja somente esse o lampejo que ele procura: talvez seja tão simplesmente a confirmação reconfortante de algo que ele conhecia desde sempre, mas que ele não pode se impedir de verificar.
Desse modo, eu imagino a mise en scène como um meio de dar a si mesmo o espetáculo - embora todo artista saiba, instintivamente, que o que é visto importa menos, nem tanto do que a forma como é visto, mas que de uma necessidade de ver e mostrar.
Entre a tela e as coisas que o obcecam, a mão do pintor adiciona não uma maneira diferente de vê-las, mas uma nova dimensão. Um quadro de Manet não é a “natureza vista por um temperamento”; é a zona de passagem de uma vontade estética, irredutível tanto aos temas quanto às motivações secretas do artista, dos quais ela talvez se alimente, mas que jamais a esgotam. A mise en scène não é necessariamente a vontade de conferir um sentido novo ao mundo, mas, nove a cada dez vezes, ela se organiza em torno da secreta certeza de deter uma parcela de verdade, primeiro sobre o homem, em seguida sobre a obra de arte - indissoluvelmente ligados. Mizoguchi usa da violência, da ganância ou do desejo sexual para colocar na tela tudo aquilo que ele não pode exprimir sem o reencontro com esses elementos. Mas seria absurdo dizer que a violência seja o tema dos seus filmes: se ele precisa dela, é como o alcoólatra precisa beber: para alimentar sua embriaguez, não para saciá-la. Nele, como nos outros grandes mestres do cinema, o que importa nunca é a intriga, a forma ou o efeito, nem ainda a possibilidade de colocar personagens loucos em situações extremas: Mizoguchi, como todos os orientais, caçoa da psicologia e da verossimilhança. Ele precisou da violência como uma alavanca para adentrar outro universo. Mas como na pintura barroca, a tempestade que cai sobre esses rostos conturbados e esses corpos desmantelados anuncia o apaziguamento. Além do desejo e da violência, o mundo do diretor japonês, como aquele de Murnau, deixa recair o véu da “indiferença” pelo qual, num cinema que poderia ser descrito como “exótico”, a metafísica faz uma súbita intrusão.
Há alguma diferença entre um realizador japonês suficientemente hábil no seu trabalho para que lhe seja oferecido por Hollywood um contrato de sete anos, e que mais assemelha-se a um engenheiro pago por mês, e um poeta “maldito” do fim do século XIX? O ópio de Baudelaire e o trabalho de Mizoguchi têm definitivamente a mesma função: servem de pretexto, como a asma e a homossexualidade de Proust, como o amarelo que intoxicava Van Gogh - mas quem dirá que o amarelo foi alguma vez o tema da obra de Van Gogh, seu propósito? O artista procura, lá onde ele pensa poder achá-las, as condições de sua criação; o realizador, no estúdio, no bordel ou no museu...
O universo do artista não é aquele que o condiciona, mas aquele do qual ele tem necessidade para criar e transformar-se perpetuamente em alguma coisa que o obceca mais ainda do que aquilo pelo qual ele já é obcecado.
A obsessão do artista é a criação artística.

"When it's opening credits finish it's title cards read (translated from japanese)
Akinari Ueda's Tales of Moonlight and Rain continues to enchant modern readers with its mysterious fantasies. This film is a new refashoning of those fantasies.
The Citerion Collection edition of Kenji Mizoguchi’s Ugestu Monogatari actually includes a book that features three of the short stories adapted for this film. Two of these stories called 'The House in the Thicket, and 'A Serpent's Lust' come from the above mentioned 'Tales of Moonlight and Rain' by Akinari Ueda.
Ugetsu is a jidaigeki (period drama) set somewhere between c. 1573 - 1600 during the Sengoku Jidai, right before the start of the Edo Period. It's story centers around a peasant family who during the civil war tries to make a living by making and selling pottery. When their village is raided by an army, they gather the pottery and along with another family get on a abandoned boat and head towards a city. There they plan to sell their newly made pottery in the hopes of making lots of money.
Mizoguchi manages to make Ugetau into what might be considered the greatest folklore/ghost story to ever come out of Japan. With common themes like War, Poverty and Greed all the way to more ancient japanese themes such as forbidden relationships with the spirit world, and neglect of family duty. Ugetsu features a lot of iconic and cinematic scenes, for example the boat on the foggy lake, the selling of pottery in the crowded city and the Kutsuki Manor scenes. These being just a few of the examples which help give Ugetsu it's unique atmosphere and feel. Mizoguch has made a a briliant romantic jidaigeki but one with a real sense of danger and urgency.
I'm so excited to have finally watched my first Kenji Mizoguchi film. I honestly can't wait to explore his filmography further.",4.0
"“Ugetsu”, my first Kenji Mizoguchi film, is rightfully praised for both its unique and mesmerizing visual style and its great thematical depth. It´s a period piece that masterfully combines harsh realism with supernatural elements and thoroughly explores themes such as greed, ambition, power, lust, war, poverty, status, family, responsibility, consequences, loss, guilt, regret, and redemption.
Framing, shot composition, camera movement, and lighting are all excellent and create several visually stunning and memorable scenes and sequences, my favorite being the boat sequence. Other highlights include the intense and captivating performances, enchanting atmosphere, and emotionally resonating story.
“Ugetsu” is a masterfully crafted, aesthetically pleasing, thought-provoking, and impactful work of art and a true classic of Japanese cinema.",4.0
"Overflowing with culture, this tragic tale would not have worked as well in the hands of Ozu or Kurosawa. This was Mizoguchi's story, and he proved why with this film.
There's a constant emphasis on music, which off-sets scenes of despair, largely. The music sets a creepy vibe that reminded me a bit of a later work by Masaki Kobayashi, Kwaidan. It's one of my favorite elements of the film, it's incredibly varietal, with different instruments and vibes throughout. It matches the story incredibly.
The visuals are wonderful, but they aren't as distinct in stills, as they are in movement. The camera glides around at just the right times, making every moment feel natural. Most may not notice it, as unlike the films of Ophuls or Welles, these visuals aren't as obvious or ambitious. But they are just as fitting, and out of the three, I felt Mizoguchi (in this film, at least) had the most restraint, and could stop a camera movement at the most perfect time. The film's lighting is also impressive, the use of shadows being especially important in the harsher scenes.
Brutal character conflicts, the writing shows no bias towards these people, and lets the viewer decide how to feel. The film's quality isn't dependent on whether or not you like the characters. Nevertheless, a somber tone is always apparent, no matter what side you're on.
Mizoguchi has a larger presence than most filmmakers I've seen from this era. Despite some having written him off as boring, Mizoguchi makes a film that flows so naturally, that never feels ""wrong"" at any point in how it delivers anything, and yet still manages to develop his own style that distinguishes him from his peers, he does feel appropriate among the greatest Japanese filmmakers of all time, even if he doesn't share the same popularity.
One reviewer on this site equated the film to watching a dream unfold, and I totally see it. Mizoguchi hits all of those sweetspots that is hard to explain, but you can't stop thinking about. It might not be as surreal as a dream, but it still leaves a lasting impact.",5.0
"The last movie I expected to think of while watching Kenji Mizoguchi's 1953 masterpiece Ugetsu again recently (first time on a big screen in 35mm) was…Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. But there's something about the machismo underlying the behavior of its male characters in Mizoguchi's film—Genjuro (Masayuki Mori), so bent on fulfilling his role as the family provider that he's willing to risk his wife and kid's lives for the sake of his pottery wares; and Tobei (Sakae Ozawa), who dreams of samurai glory without any discernible physical talents to back up his ambitions—that fleetingly reminded me of the more outwardly outsize behavior of Jordan Belfort, Donnie Azoff and company. To my mind, there's not that much of a difference between Genjuro secretly returning to his village in order to try to retrieve his precious pots, and Belfort defiantly keeping his firm going—both characters daring others to catch them simply in order to satisfy their macho pride. Naturally, of course, Genjuro is much more covert about it than the showboating Belfort is—but then, that's in keeping with the wildly contrasting tenor of the respective films they are both in.
Oh, and Ugetsu is still as much a harsh, beautiful and profound masterpiece as it ever was.",5.0
"Like other slow-burning artsy Japanese films, it boasts beautiful cinematography and nice costume design, which was nominated for an Oscar. However, it wasn't quite my taste. While it could have been worse, the runtime was thankfully not too long.",2.5
"A cogent critique of the collateral effects of war on society, that cleverly echoes recent cultural history (at the time) by focusing on the distant past.
Also an effective morality tale in its own right, tinged with a spine tingling ghost story that fits perfectly inside this otherwise realist tale. This is a terrific film full of potent symbols that explores the pyrrhic effects of pursuing militarism and how traditions can be warped by war.",5.0
"10/10
Shoutout to @josiahgermer for the request.
Kenji Mizoguchi is a goddamn genius for doing the genre switcheroo years before Psycho. A simple tale of medieval Japanese peasantry turns into something horrific. A man abandons his wife and kid for ghost pussy, while his buddy desperately wants to be a samurai. Ugetsu is dark, atmospheric, and something you should watch.",5.0
"Watched during my Summer of J-Horror II.
I did enjoy this; it's beautifully shot and well acted throughout, but I also feel a bit bamboozled as I was led to believe this was a more overt horror film (I didn't really read into it after having it suggested to me). It's not that at all; there is a supernatural element, and of course some horrors of war elements, but it just wasn't really what I was expecting or looking for.
So, I dunno that I have a lot to say for this one, it's a good drama and piece of film history. I did take a bit of issue in the way that the wives did most of the suffering for the husbands to learn lessons. I guess the times were what they were, but still. The husbands are pretty stupid throughout, and a lot of the dialogue is very forceful about getting the point across. So I wasn't quite blown away by this one, though it has some very memorable moments (the boat scene is killer). I can only dock it so much, it's clearly well made, but I guess it's on the lower end of great haha.
Edit: I kinda stewed on this one throughout the day and think I am actually gonna take it down half a point. Good movie, respect the legacy, but it just didn't totally sit right with me.",3.5
"100/100
""Ugetsu"" tells us the story of two men, one is devoured by greed, lust and other one is consumed by his rich dreams, ambitions and enviness. It's actually a historical war drama film. It offcourse has a horror angle..but all together one cannot say this a true sacry horror film. Rather than that It uses the supernatural part just as Kurosawa did use horror portion in ""Rashomon"" and Kaneto Shindõ did in ""Onibaba""..as an element of storytelling or getting an end product of the action of one of the main protagonist of the film.
Film starts with an amazing ""Scroll shot"" scene showing a japanese painting like image of a landscape over a small village and that BGM with it..overall a great cinematic experience and a little hints of what actually we are going to watch. Very next scene shows In a small farming village Nakanogō, on the shore of large Lake Biwa at Ōmi Province in the Sengoku period, two happy families lived with peace.. Genjūrō, a potter with his son and wife. And Tōbei, an aspired Samurai lived with his wife. But soon greed for money, lust for gaining prosperity seduced two heads of these two families. After getting a wide profits from his works, Genjūrō works long hours to finish his pottery without much thinking about the rumours of upcoming war. And Tôbei also helps Genjūrō to get a share from his profit. But all of a sudden chaos arrives in the village, soldiers loot everyone. Genjūrō, Tôbei and his wife manages to escape through the lake with their belongings for selling them in town putting behind Genjūrô's family in a safe place of the village. The famous lake scene is the most beautiful in the film. Shot partly on a tank, it creates a surreal world of fog and mist, out of which emerges a lone boatman who warns them of pirates. Genjuro returns to leave his wife and child on the shore, and continues with Tobei and Ohama. In the town Tobei escapes with his share of profit for fulfilling his dream to be a Samurai..on the other hand Genjūrō is subdued by the beauty of a spirit of a woman. Delusions of Genjūrō and Tobei Carrie's the myseries for their wives..such as Tobei's wife was raped by some soldiers after he leaves her all alone in city, and Genjūrō's wife was stabbed by soldiers while they stealing foods from her. And at the end when finally the delusions of Tobei and Genjūrō were over, then they finally realise about their faults.
Kenji Mizoguchi was a Japanese film director and screenwriter. His all works are very different and unique approach of his every films make his audiences fully invested with the plotline..According to famous writer Mark Le Fanu, ""His films have an extraordinary force and purity. They shake and move the viewer by the power, refinement and compassion with which they confront human suffering."" His film ""ugetsu"" first gave him actual international attentions..it's too clear that this film has lots of themes and details to talk about. Mizoguchi's style of showing different human emotions, feelings and delusions is too unique. There are a lots of films which sets up themes regarding greed, lust, passionate love but here it's presented in so well manner that u can connect with the film so ezily. In the film two main characters are heads of the two families, Genjūrō, Tobei and two side characters are their respective wives, Myagi, Ohama. Genjuro and Tobei are introduced as two over ambitious characters who risk their families and their lives also to only chase after a prosper life. These two characters can be defined the basic human nature. We all are inclined to pursue our dreams so blindly so that we cannot even see the terrible risk infront of us. This film is set in sixteenth century at the time of war as usual as like other japanese film of that time here also Mizoguchi adds the history, war tragedy, status of japanese feudal system, class conflict, brutality n ruthlessness of soldiers and helplessness of common women quite effectively. Not only that but also film shows two male characters leave their family in danger only for their dreams..vanity of men, helplessness of women(Notonly the dredful conclusion of Myagi and Ohama but also lady Wakasa, she was also neglected by Genjiro) somehow reflects the patriarchal feudal society of japan on that time. Tobei's subplot is kind of interesting for me even sometime more than Genjūrō's story, where common people are desperate to save themselves from effect of the war on the other hand Tobei is intentionally tries to involve himself with war. Something funny but tragic. Tobei was attracted to honour ful, prideful lives of Samirai but Tobei is not really brutal like other Samurai or soldiers, some humanities are still present in him..he is actually a simple person with a heavy delusional dream. And when he saw his lovable wife working as a whore, then he realized his fault and finally tries to live a peaceful life as a farmer in his small village.
Lastly it's again a Japanese film with rich execution and flawless period details. Every scene, every characters, every emotions, every expressions look exactly true..and the end of Ugetsu was with showing bittersweet lives of these two families. And the voice of Myagi's spirit gives me goosebumps and I realised on that moment characters, incidents all are real..and I witnessed the terrible fates of those people in form of a film.

"Ugetsu se puede considerar la película de Mizoguchi que mejor aúna todo lo que buscó y logró a lo largo de su obra. Es posible que algunas, como Genroku Chushingura, Sansho Dayu, Yokihi o Akasen chitai, por decir algunas, nos parezcan mejores, pero Ugetsu creo que permanece como la más completa, quizás porque es más coral, porque se introduce en el terreno del kaidan, del manifiesto feminista, del melodrama desolador, del cuento alegórico y de muchos otros intereses que tuvo Mizoguchi como cineasta, encontrando un equilibrio en todos ellos. Tanto la anterior (Saikaku Ichidai onna) como la posterior (Sansho Dayu) con películas mucho más demoledoras en lo emocional, donde se lleva al límite el sufrimiento de sus personajes... y aún así, en ninguna eso parece lo fundamental. No creo que Mizoguchi sea un cronista del sufrimiento humano, por mucho de que pocos expongan tragedias tan grandes. El estoicismo y la violencia en Mizoguchi es como un estado del ser, algo que está ahí, como el aire, los árboles, el sol y la luna. El cineasta se limita a filmarlos, con el mayor rigor posible, la conciencia necesaria. El mundo ante sus ojos. Hay un encuentro muy bello entre los movimientos de la naturaleza y los movimientos mecánicos de la cámara de Mizoguchi, que a veces se despega de la acción directa, para tomar un sentido divergente. ¿Qué significa eso? ¿Busca Mizoguchi significar a través de la cámara? ¿Buscar algo a mayores que no aparece en el propio drama? Al final del film, cuando Genichi reza a la tumba de su madre, la cámara se eleva y filma todo el campo del pueblo, con los campesinos trabajando. ¿Pretende Mizoguchi decirnos que el sufrimiento de ese niño, su debate interior, su gesto cariñoso, se extiende hacia todos los hombres y mujeres? Desde siempre se ha considerado a Mizoguchi como un gran humanista, pero tampoco creo que fuese un demiurgo que buscase de una manera tan directa utilizar el drama y las pasiones de sus protagonistas como imagen de toda la humanidad. Más bien, en sus movimientos que están más allá de la acción dramática encuentro un intento de convertir lo que sucede en algo abstracto, en alejar al espectador del sentido directo y decirle: esto es una película, no la realidad. En cada desplazamiento de cámara de Mizoguchi hay un desplazamiento del pensamiento, una forma de llevarnos a otro lugar, para ver de otra manera. Para que el drama desconsolado no nos trastorne ni nos secuestre. El estilo Mizoguchi encuentra un equilibrio perfecto sin caer en el miserabilismo ni en el distanciamiento absoluto. Su cine es convulso e inaprensible, incatalogable. En ocasiones resuelve una escena en un único y glorioso plano secuencia y en otras corta a un contraplano tan rápido como puede. No existe método ni fórmula, solo un cineasta en el absoluto control del arte, de su arte.",5.0

"Japanuary 2024: Kenji Mizoguchi
spectral greed—folklore and culture predominate the profound symbolism in a hollowed-out ghost story that’s more a navigation of intrinsic human and emotional experience amidst wartime economics and insatiable opportunity than horror effort, and very much rightfully so. wildly impressive how much character and development are ex/implored in such short runtime with the protagonists—it runs a tough bargain with the accessorized/rendered-consequence women who aren’t necessarily complete trinkets or absent of presence, as they form both bookends and dominate the central deviation/allure, but it’s granted a valuable weight in wake of internal conflict among tattered fabrics and scorches of past. most certainly needs a rewatch.",0.0
"A lovely story of two men, a farmer who dreams of making pottery for the richest in the land and his neighbour who dreams of becoming the bravest and most acclaimed samurai, and their down-to-earth wives who suffer most when their husbands' dreams turn to nightmares.
Set at the time of civil war, the film manages to seamlessly interweave the brutal realities of civil war with fables of men being lured by evil temptresses to fulfill their dreams of power and riches. The beautiful photography expresses both realms without the use of the typical tricks of the trade to transition between them. The music is haunting and even jarring at times. This film is not meant to make you feel comfortable.
One thing I couldn't help noticing is the prominence of the wives. This is the first film I've seen set in 16th Century Japan and quite possibly 16th Century anywhere, where the women are given such a strong voice. The men get more screen time, but the women are the heroes of the story. Some might say that the film condemns hope, ambition and dreams of glory, but it does nothing of the kind. It condemns hope, ambition and dreams of glory when they are detrimental to loved ones, which is a completely different thing.

a tragic and thoughtful film. it’s a morality tale about the folly of men and the suffering their women had to endure. this film by Kenji Mizoguchi definitely has more on its mind than it seems to, thanks to its unique story and the striking direction.
a beautiful Japanese production, set in feudal Japan and filmed in long dreamily lit shots, this film never feels anything but authentic. it quite strikingly and cinematically tells about the importance of family and your loved ones, and condemns avarice and love of money, especially in the time of man-made catastrophes and general suffering.
at times, it's hard to know which direction this film is going in (i mean that in a good way). the interlocking narratives conclude perfectly and the visuals are stunning. its magical scenes are very haunting and mesmerizing. the surreal, ghost story portions are not distracting, but add a horrifying tone to this masterpiece.

38. Kelly Reichardt's Top 10
In seinem Meisterwerk Ugetsu Monogatari (Erzählungen unter dem Regenmond) erzählt Kenji Mizoguchi die Geschichte des Töpfers Genjuro und seines Schwagers Tobei, die irgendwann Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts mit ihren Frauen in einem kleinen Dorf in einem von Bürgerkriegen gebeutelten Gebiet leben. Trotz der unmittelbaren Gefahr aufgrund der Kriegswirren haben sie berufliche Ambitionen. Genjuro will mit seinen Keramiken in der Stadt viel Geld verdienen, Tobei als Samurai Ruhm und Ehre erlangen. Beide riskieren für ihre Träume alles – und verlieren dabei das, was ihnen eigentlich am wichtigsten ist...
Die beiden Männer stehen zwar im Vordergrund der Geschichte, insbesondere Genjuros, die eigentlichen Hauptfiguren sind aber die Frauen. Mizoguchi zeigt schonungslos die Unterdrückung von und die Gewalt gegen Frauen in der japanischen Gesellschaft auf. Ein fast schon feministischer Film, gerade weil er auch in Gestalt der Dämonin Wakasa Macht über Männer ausüben lässt.
Faszinierend auch die langen Einstellungen mit bewegter Kamera und Überblendungen in denen Traum und Wirklichkeit, Vergangenheit und Gegenwart miteinander verschmelzen. Für die damaligen technischen Möglichkeiten geradezu herausragend umgesetzt. Ohnehin ist ""Ugetsu"" ein in jeglicher Hinsicht visionärer Film, der seiner Zeit meilenweit voraus war.",4.5

A true masterpiece about greed and it’s consequences and a film that really isn’t afraid to condemn its two male protagonists.

"Elegiac Parable

The supernatural as director Mizoguchi’s instrument for the profound anatomy of real life—familial responsibility, earthly desires, women suffering, and the gravity of war exposure. Ugetsu weaves realism with the phantom so well about two husbands blinded by two otherworldly beauties, one of which is the samurai title, and the other is of a lady spirit. In search of something mortal, they instead suffered an immortal dolor: their wives’ honour and lives were abused and seized by patriarchal rule in a war-torn land.
Never would have guessed a no-ordinary ghost story would transform from being foggy and eerie to grimly poignant. Finally, Ugetsu Monogatari (1953) is something of a masterwork that is haunting yet so beautiful at the same time.",5.0

I tried soooo many times to get into the story and I just couldn’t have cared less about this guy’s pottery or anything else this pitiful story had to offer. Sure it looks fine, but so does every other popular 50’s samurai film so that doesn’t really impress me.

I really didn't suspected this to went such a supernatural Way, but it did and chiseld it's Message so hard into my Head, that Kenji really got me thinking now!
Genjuro and Tobei are two very poor Farmer-Folks in the 16'th Century of War-battered Japan, who're both having exact Visions of their Future!
Genjuro wants to earn enough Money, to live wealthy with his Family, while Tobei's dreaming about getting a famous, honorable Samurai!
However, both of them distance themselves so far from their Wifes and Family for those Dreams of them, that they plunge them and themselves into dreadful Misfortune... partly VERY scary, umearthly Misfortune!
The symbolic Strength of ""Ugetsu"" took my Breath away and like I said before, I really had no Clue, that this partly turns into the most shocking Horror-Experience of my young Movie-Life!
Close to Start, both of our Heroes were warned by Death in Person on a misty River, to rather overthink the Path they chose, but none of them wants to hear and Misfortune takes it's Course...
Tobei's Story went pretty straight-forward and was told in a more realistic Way, focusing at the ""Morally reprehensible""-Way.
Being a Samurai during War isn't that honorable and the Things he did for getting that Title, just to impresse a Person, who already loves him, were pretty rough and ended in a frustrated Dissapointment.
Genjuro's Story on the other Hand... sweet Jesus, what the Hell!
Everything happening on that old, strange Nobility-Estate scared the living Shit out of me, both of these weird Women were suspect to me from Minute 1 and I had no Idea, how far Genjuro would go for a worthy Life... especislly cause I thought, Family would always come first in his Head!
- Beware, Spoiler ahead -
And the Ending... Man, there's literally no Happy-End for any of our Charakters!
Everyone just sufferd through Hell, because Genjuro&Tobei weren't satisfied with their simple Lifestyle and especially their Wifes got the full Bill for that... oh well, Genjuro's deffenitely forever connected with his Sweetheart, that's for sure!
- Out of Danger, Spoiler End -
""Ugetsu"" is a breathtaking Masterpiece out of the perfect, cinematic Roots of classic Japan, with a still irrevocable Message!
And Sensai Mizoguchi also created a timeless scary Example for still working, oldschool Horror with a perfect understanding of slow and realistic Presentation!

I discovered this film while watching a Cinefix Top 10 Cinematographers video today with Kazuo Miyagawa's (Big fan of Rashomon and Yojimbo from what I've watched in his works) cinematography on Ugetsu mentioned at a place and I watched it straight away with coincidentally today being the birth anniversary of its Director Kenji Mizoguchi.
By employing long takes never letting go of the chaos and the drama unfolding in actors' lives with a neat blend of real and surreal, hope and despair, love and lust, war and anti-war, remorse and redemption, Ugetsu is quite literally a bewitching ceramic (cinema) with its glaze (craft) gleaming like a crystal as a testament to why only a ""master craftsman"" like Genjuro (Mizoguchi) can create such beauty of pottery (cinema)! What started off as a tale of money inflaming men's greed through two men respectively obsessed with ""money is everything"" and vassal/samurai status, turned into a tale of three women with each of them longing for something and the respective wives' fates ensued as a result of the war. The way it builds on ancient folklore and then takes us through a wide spectrum of emotions by being a part rom-com film, part supernatural film, part war film and a part tragicomedy, all within an hour and a half is really some feat!⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Fumio Hayasaka's solemn score enhances the already poignant moments and the subtle drums accompany Ohama's song while rowing the boat across the lake in the moonlight that is one of the most haunting audio-visual marriages I've ever seen in a film! Kazuo Miyagawa once again plays with light and shadow at will alongside the trademark asymmetry present in his work and Ugetsu proves his mastery over tracking shots.⁣⁣⁣

"A hauntingly beautiful tale of two men whose greedy ambitions become the downfall for the ones they love. A tale told many times before, but few have had such a fearful blend of the supernatural and of the harrowing plight of the living. Every scene with Lady Wakasa and Genjuro seems to flow like a dream. They are two people that have lost so much, but neither one realizes until it is too late.
Everything is held together with an eerie minimalist soundtrack that I wish more directors would take note of. Just the slow ringing of a bell or the rustling of the wind is more disconcerting than almost anything that could be shown on screen. I felt a sort of discomfort in every scene, because the slow and steady sounds always seem to build to a horror that never comes. It left me on edge for sure.
Although this is not a horror film, per se, it is what I look for in a legitimately scary movie. The minimal approach taken to everything within Ugetsu is going to leave a lasting effect for years to come. It cannot be said enough, this movie is the definition of the word haunting.",4.0
"I could gush all day about this film. I could talk of the aerial shots of Kutsuki manor, the gnarled branches in the foreground reflecting the ensnaring presence that haunts the castle. I could talk of the lakeside fog, at once eerie, at once evocative of its travelers' myopia and misgivings. I could talk of the fluidity with which Mizoguchi inserts the preternatural into his world, done so adeptly that even the viewer is uncertain of what is real and what is illusive. And I could talk of his envisioning of war as corrosion -- a venomous agent that pits love, simplicity, and family against the rapacity for wealth and glory. Beautiful, singular, incisive filmmaking.",5.0
"Success always comes with a price in suffering.
Mizoguchi Kenji may be known for his ""flowing scroll"" long takes, but the shot from Ugetsu that lingers with me relies on a different cinematographic technique showcased in the film: a parallelism between character and camera. Repeatedly throughout Ugetsu, Mizoguchi-san's camera tracks so fluidly with the motions of his actors that it becomes almost a spectral force tethered to them from beyond. In the example haunting me, the camera cranes upward, mirroring Lady Wakasa as she stands to loom over Genjurô. Since the camera rises with her, the high angle and Lady Wakasa's billowing kimono fully obstructs Genjurô within the frame. Considering that the gateway to this sequence involved Genjurô fantasizing about purchasing a wardrobe's worth of luxury kimonos for his wife, Miyagi, this shot becomes a sort of climax to that flight of fancy, the moment when the delusion of grandeur fully overtakes him. While Ugetsu's tightly orchestrated fable houses a plethora of moral lessons, the notion that wading too far into the waters of fantasy drowns you and your loved ones resonated with me.
Having only read about other films from Mizoguchi-san, I cannot be certain, but his narratives seem to empathize with the plights of women in a way uncharacteristic to this era of Japanese filmmaking. The foolish dreams of wealth and power chased by the two male leads of Ugetsu are scorned by the camera, while the collateral damage that befalls their wives elicits somber compassion. Wealth, status, and the rewards of hard labor are all shown to be ephemeral here, easily stolen or erased (an infamous solider's reputation is pilfered by Tôbei, ransacking hordes loot villages, and the once-illustrious Kutsuki Manor becomes a pile of splintered lumber). In the film's final moments, Genjurô hears Miyagi's heavenly voice assuaging his past actions:
You've become the man I had hoped for.
But is this another of Genjurô's fantasies? Is he masquerading his own thoughts in Miyagi's voice to excuse what he caused?
Where he may be able to accept her absence, Mizoguchi-san's camera cannot. In Ugetsu's closing moments, we are given an insert of the pottery wheel lever that Miyagi used to operate, now sitting idle, then another rising crane shot, this time from Miyagi's grave to a wideshot of a neighboring couple tilling their field together. In that contrast, Mizoguchi-san gives us the reality (Miyagi is dead) and what-could-have-been (a unified marriage) had fantasies of success not interceded.",4.0
"O filme mais famoso de Mizoguchi é também um dos mais palatáveis, cuja trama se entende sem dificuldade (apesar dos fantasmas) e o mais decupado - estamos distantes do ""one scene, one shot"" que marcou seu cinema no período 1939-1942, com reflexos ainda em A Vida de Oharu (1952), o longa anterior.",5.0

Film #118 in Summer of the Red Sun- Celebrating 125 Years of Japanese Cinema
Its depressing and yet not miserable, only in the final few scenes does it all come crashing down as a story of lost souls, literally and figuratively.
Its no bed of roses throughout, but lulls us and narratively the male leads, into a sense of ambitious longing and brief happiness. The rampaging soldiers of the war immediately disturb in their wild and uncaring roving through villages, but they are not the only people who will frustrate and sadden the viewer.
It doesn’t feel cloying or melodramatic as the sense of ugliness in the choices and actions is felt not just for those it impacts and hurts, but the men themselves seeking success and only finding absolution and the frayed despair they always had.
I do find the characterization of the wives both deeply interesting and also annoyingly regressive. Which doesn’t make sense as it was the 50s but I still found some of the final scenes a tad too forgiving in a film that wasn’t seemingly concerned with being comfy in its consequences. That doesn’t mean it keeps things light or expected, as the second half goes in directions both dark and mysterious, that I wasn’t prepared for.
This leads to an ending that possibly has me recontextualising the whole thing, and the haunting score (which was excellent throughout) that punctuates these moments makes it all a deeply-affecting coda.

Damn. Ugetsu is a testament to how damn powerful of a film you can make in 90 minutes. It has the weight of a three and a half hour Tarkovsky film, but pulls off a similar emotional impact in half the runtime. Not that one is better than the other.
But this movie. Fucks. I see where Kobayashi got the inspiration for Kwaidan from. And Ugetsu clearly inspired a lot of Kurosawa. I said this about Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence but I'll say it again about Ugetsu. What a god damn ethereal experience.

An easy five bagger. I love Tōbei's Don Quixote energy. I love that both Ueda Akinari and Guy de Maupassant stories inspired the narrative. I love Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography. I love that Mizoguchi stayed in his hotel room at the Venice Film Festival and prayed that his film would win an award, so he wouldn't return to Japan with shame. I love this film, and I am starting to truly love Japanese cinema.

هذا فيلم من مدرسة الأخلاق والقيم ينبري لعدة قضايا في قالب واحد.. فيلم عن الحب، العمل، العائلة، الحرب والفضيلة.",4.5
"Mizoguchi updates Akinari Ueda's Tales of Moonlight and Rain for post-war Japan and maintains the traditional morals that dominated 18th century Japan—filial piety, women's sacrifice, asceticism—but what emerges is an indictment of greed and wanton military excesses, both coded male, in which the victims are primarily women. The Japanese left of the postwar era was critical of how the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki allowed Japan to play victim and ignore their own wrongdoings, and Ugetsu seems to me to be critical of precisely the ideas that made Japan an aggressor in the first place. It's also worth noting that Ueda's book is based on Chinese tales of the Ming dynasty (which ended more than a century prior), and such an internationalist spirit is also opposed to Japan's wartime mission.
There is a great deal of pushing against the status quo in this apparently conservative narrative, in other words. A better analysis would require more attention to the film's style (especially given how readily style interacts with politics in Mizoguchi). Perhaps one starting point of investigation is to follow through on an observation by Robin Wood: Genjūrō initially involves himself in pottery purely to make money; when with Lady Wakasa he is focused purely on aesthetics; by the end, pottery is a method of inquiry into life itself.",4.0
"Kenji Mizoguchi is one of the three greatest Japanese directors of his generation and, like Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, his work is stylistically rich and thematically complex. With Ugetsu Monogatari, he explores very basic human traits, but in a way that says a great deal about them.
Ugetsu Monogatari is a gripping, magic-tinged story of greed, lust and lust for power. Set during the civil war of the 16th century, it explores the lives of two friends who desire to leave their village and seek their fortunes, one by selling the pottery he makes, the other by becoming a samurai. They take their wives along, but are tempted away from them, one by the seductive and ethereal Lady Wakasa, the other by his obsession with military prestige. The ensuing torment experienced by everyone involved doesn't deter the two heroes until too late.
Mizoguchi has a fondness for long takes which, when you watch them, seem to take you by surprise at how invested in the story they make you. The black-and-white photography also lends a great deal of intrigue, enhancing the feeling that we are watching a ghost story. However, style isn't everything. For me, the best films are those that manage to combine stylistic inventiveness with believable human emotion, and Ugetsu Monogatari is one such film. It is a barbed, slightly pessimistic look at the consequences of folly and temptation, presenting them as having undesirable consequences at the best of times. The film calls bullshit on following one's dreams, perhaps, but only in cases where such dreams are pursued with a complete lack of thought for the results it may have.
Ugetsu Monogatari's message is simple, but it's a story (or pair of stories, more accurately) that unfolds engrossingly, carrying the audience along on the journeys of its protagonists.

"Sort of transformative.
This takes a while to warm up. It starts out about a couple of villager families in Japan. Both are farmers out of necessity, but both have dreams of bigger things. One dreams of being a great samurai. The other makes clay pots as a side job, and dreams of making it rich selling his wares. Both are blinded by their desires for fame and fortune. Both abandon their families, wives and children, to pursue their passions.
The wannabe samurai dumb lucks his way into a position of power. He stumbles upon a great general that has been wounded in battle. The generals assistant beheads the general as a dying wish. The farmer then attacks the assistant from behind, kills him, and steal the head of the general. He claims that he took it in battle; he is rewarded with treasures and unearned respect.
While all this was happening, his wife has been raped by savages and she is now resigned to being a prostitute. When the newly appointed samurai rides into town, along with his entourage, they stop at the brothel where unbeknownst to him, his wife is now working. It is only now that he realized the folly of his thinking. He lost what he cared about most by trying to acquire a position of higher status.
The pottery maker is taking advantage of the war going on and makes a good deal of money selling his pots. He then becomes greedy and risks all of their lives when the army comes to his village. He is so blinded by money that he insists on keeping his kiln burning, even though if he is caught by the army he will be captured and forced into slavery.
They narrowly escape the army, and he travels across the river to sell his pots for an even higher price. It is here that his meets a glowingly attractive woman who buys a good deal of his wares. When he delivers them to her luxurious residence, she seduces him and purposes marriage to him. In his greed and lust he accepts. It is only later that he finds out that she is a spirit from the after life, and that she has been manipulating him like a siren.
He leaves her palace, now clearly seen as a ruin, and returns home. He finds his son in a healthy way, but his wife has been killed by bandits.
The stories are cautionary tales much like children's stories, but with more mature themes. The film making is gorgeous and truly haunting. The scenes with the spirit woman cast a vision of tranquility and menace. This would make an amazing entry point to Japanese cinema.",4.0
"Patriarchy and poverty as equally cruel and self-fulfilling systems, devouring anyone they touch.

Equal parts alluring and draining film.
Not sure why I watch anyone but Ford or Mizoguchi at this point. Pretty much the only filmmakers that feel like they have truly mastered the art of formal filmmaking past the silent era. The blocking/framing/lighting in this film could put most of your and my goats to shame. Masterclass.

"An outstanding exploration of duty, guilt, greed, and love, with some sumptuous cinematography and real neat camera tricks for the transitions. There’s hardly another movie like it, operating almost simultaneously as a parable, family drama, and ghost story all in one.

"Persistência da retina
Portanto – e isso precisa ficar bem claro – a preocupação do cineasta moderno não é fornecer mensagens mas revelar alguma coisa. Não se trata de impor, através de truques, o que ele já tinha na cabeça mas de tentar descobrir o mundo com a câmera, revelá-lo durante o ato de filmagem. Flagrar as coisas como elas são. Os verdadeiros cineastas, dos quais depende o futuro do cinema, não têm visões. Não elaboram ou expressam seus mundos exclusivos. Arriscam-se a ver as coisas como elas são, de frente: olham, captam, filmam as coisas em contínua evolução e na terceira pessoa do presente do indicativo – correndo risco. E pensam diretamente em ângulos, panorâmicas, plano-sequências. Esta é também a política de Griffith, Stroheim, Hawks, Lang, Walsh, Welles, Losey, Allan Dwan, Murnau, Mizoguchi, Tomu Uchida, Godard. Para eles, como para um cinegrafista de atualidade, a revelação pode surgir de um minuto para outro, pois a verdade não tem hora. Importante é o sentido de risco e sua iminência.
Para alguns realizadores a verdade do cinema nasce com o ator – com a sua presença diante da câmera: seja a ilusão do espetáculo (Lang), a inteira verdade do ator (Godard), o mistério do ator (Losey). Ator é matéria cinematográfica, mas isso não se trata, veja-se bem, de uma volta ao intimismo estrelista ou ao macaquismo de auditório do passado. Há os que buscam o momento especial, o instante privilegiado da liberdade ou ascese através da câmera (como Welles em Cidadão Kane) ou da literatura (conforme Fellini) ou do personagem – típico do cinema romanesco de Antonioni (toda sua mise-en-scène dirige-se à revelação da fragilidade do sentimento), Bergman (a engrenagem de Noite de Circo conduz à humilhação total do empresário), Visconti (O Leopardo também é uma pomposa eloquente cerimônia que materializa a consciência de um nobre, com seus desejos impossíveis e a antevisão da decadência).
Novamente o homem e sua câmera deve se portar como uma sentinela alerta a 24 fotogramas por segundo, atenta 24 horas por dia, sem separar a realidade e a imaginação, o mundo e a arte, a vida e o cinema. O cinema é uma arte anacrônica, daí sua modernidade.
O filme é feito da ação de uma emulsão, objetiva e obturador para captar (registrar e reviver) ao decompor – e falsear o movimento com o tempo falseando – partindo da ilusão como princípio principal (ponto de partida e de chegada, avançados); porque se baseia no princípio físico da persistência da retina, que é a impressão de realidade ou ilusão de movimento que o olho sofre em “movimento” de registros inanimados de seres objetos, aparentemente “móveis”, mentira erigida como ciência (a reprodução do movimento é a própria “mentira”) e a arte – que como o pensamento é e conduz ao mistério; ou ao supremo. Cinema “arte da ilusão” baseia-se no falso. Devido à ilusão mesma da visão humana, nasceu a câmera e antecessores do cinema, arte temporal pois a matéria-prima da câmera é o tempo, e no cinema a duração. Baseia-se no falso, nada mais – como a vida mesma – na ilusão, matéria, nada mais.
Nesse universo em representação, a arte ocorre a seu duplo e o autor em busca do “outro”. O que é o duplo e o outro?
Não existe duração contínua, estável e linear como se oferece a tela; o movimento não é apreendido, mas decomposto: a câmera de filmagem é semelhante a uma câmera de fotografar, nada mais é do que uma câmera fotográfica em movimento constante. As imagens separadas são projetadas como (se fosse) uma coisa só graças a um mecanismo de relojoaria. O instante não é captado mas secionado, dividido, falseado, pois o princípio ocular da persistência da retina – como o pensamento – tende a associar movimentos separados no tempo, confundindo ilusoriamente por uma “ilusão da mente”. Da associação (projeção, relação) à ilusão, há um passo. Aparência ilusória.
Mais do que ninguém, em Godard todos são livres: autor, ator(es) e espectador(es). Valorizando a aparência das coisas, rompe com a convenção e a tradição do artista que procura a essência do mundo através de recursos espúrios de associação; simplesmente não trai nem submete as aparências a apriorismos estetizantes, obrigando-as (através de símbolos e acúmulos literários) a dizer aquilo que não podem dizer. Um objeto não diz isto nem aquilo; diz-se a si próprio; ele é. Em 1951, Jean-Luc Godard observava que o “verdadeiro cinema consiste somente em colocar coisas diante da câmera”. Adotando a política do cinema mudo, os realizadores contemporâneos recusam a comparação daquilo que as coisas são com aquilo que deveria ser. Henry Agel: “Uma imagem é uma imagem. Uma descrição visual permanece sendo uma descrição… A imagem esconde uma opacidade, que impede o espectador de ir mais adiante do que vê”.
Assim, nesse cinema, desde que o mundo é mundo, “uma mentira é uma mentira” (Mizoguchi), “um policial é um policial” (Fuller), “uma árvore é uma árvore” (King Vidor), “um parto é um prato, uma mensagem é uma mensagem, os homens são os homens e a vida… é a vida” (Godard), o mundo é o mundo e o cinema é… cinema. Que tende o cinema-verdade, à documentação progressivamente mais bruta e mais sóbria da realidade.
As aparências são o material fundamental: sabemos que elas são enganosas; daí o drama de Agora ou nunca (de Michel Deville), Pierrot le fou à Dama de Shangai, onde seres enganam-se, erram, mentem e finalmente sofrem – porque vivem sua vida à base de ilusões – isto é, ainda não imersos e/ou submersos no princípio uno, e para onde vai esse cinema, valendo-se de uma técnica do real – seja o plano-sequência, o som direto e a profundidade de campo.
Filmes desenvolvem-se em eterno presente, que é o tempo da consciência (do espetáculo cinematográfico). Por isso, nada nos emociona; o tratamento, a duração e a pontuação constantemente lembram-nos que tudo não passa de um filme. A “mensagem” é essa: situar o espectador, consequentemente o ator e o ator, no seu lugar, consciente de sua condição.
Além de filosofar sobre arte, público e liberdade, Godard e o cinema moderno faz filosofia assim em torno de seu método – a câmera cínica.
Seres do cinema moderno agem, sofrem, vivem teatralmente. Num certo momento de Uma mulher é uma mulher, de Godard, se diz que “nas comédias, como nas tragédias, no fim do terceiro ato a heroína hesita”, e a heroína… hesita. O ator-personagem de Godard tenta não se transformar em objeto; é um ser livre que precisa improvisar uma moral ou uma política para preservar sua liberdade. Pode ser cinismo, imitação ou referência filmológica (nostalgia pelo silêncio reflete-se na conversa do filósofo de Viver a vida: “Falar é inútil, seria agradável vivermos sem falar” – Ça serait beau: Seulement, c’est pas possible). É uma solução provisória e instantânea, do momento presente. Nota-se que o distanciamento não é só problema do autor mas dos personagens, que afirmam sua liberdade através do universo de representação teatral, exprimindo a consciência do trabalho, de que estão participando de um filme e nada mais: eis um distanciamento dentro do distanciamento.

The atmosphere in Ugetsu Monogatari is nothing short of suffocating. Life in Japan in the 16th century was probably tough enough, but there’s a certain nerve given to these everyday chores due to the constant looming war. It’s a pleasantly slow pace — only cut off by an unnecessary song number — and Kenji Mizoguchi frames the film with ghastly shadows and a fitting black-and-white tone to fit the looming mood and silent landscapes where the screams of victims cut through everything.
Even with all this, it’s not to be forgotten that this is a love-story at heart. Admittedly the film doesn’t always focus evenly on everything, but the love here is still portrayed with just enough level of melodrama, soothing music and a passionate acting. Ugetsu Monogatari is a tragic example of the fact that war may be started by the ruling men, but fought by the everyday people in a brutal intimacy.

The distinction between reality and fantasy is similarly fluid, with both spaces allowed to occupy the same shot, often moving from one to the other between pans. When Genjūrō finally returns home, the camera takes a lateral survey of the whole space. In that moment, the success of his return and the failure of his wife's death, the fantasy of emotional resolution and the reality of a broken family, and his role as a father and a potter all converge into one reality. Nothing is more bittersweet, and nothing is a higher fulfillment of cinematic realism.

"Just absolutely stunning. Beautiful haunting image after haunting image, a real sense both of the otherworldly and of showing us the past and managing to get across a very coherent and consistent but never heavy handed message about 1953 or indeed human nature while staying true to the genre material. It deals with the super natural and the overreaching ideas supremely but never ever moves away from the idea of fragile, vulnerable humanity in danger of being extinguished by other people. Again and again men are idiots and women pay the price and the scenes that get this across are as movingly down to earth and real as some of the other stuff is sublime and haunting. It's an absolute masterwork.
The early scenes of village life, precarious in amongst war, small scale ambitions and triumphs are presented incredibly well. Getting you inside the different personalities and their needs and ambitions that will either drive the story or horribly be snuffed out by other people. The scenes of the soldiers coming and arbitarily destroying everyone's lives are actually less horrific than later scenes of armed men thrashing wildly around the countryside but get across the idea of a country in chaos and turning on itself beautifully.
When the film moves on into different areas, making allegorical points and handling both the supernatural and human cruelty as well as I've ever seen it handled, definitely shot as evocatively as i've ever seen things shot it's these establishing scenes that buy it it's emotional currency.
It would almost be pointless to list specific shots and scenes, or even performances, it all fits together seamlessly and is pretty much all stunning.",5.0
"The film which - more than any other - brought Kenji Mizoguchi to international attention is an ethereal ghost story of astounding quality and one of the finest achievements in world cinema.
The visuals alone - courtesy of the great cameraman Kazuo Miyagawa - astonish with their allure and elegance but when they are allied to an emotionally engrossing story and performances which stand the test of time, we are truly in the realms of greatness.

"Good Lord. I considered waiting to review this film, let my thoughts sink in so I can type something coherent and interesting, but sometimes I think it is better to just express a genuine emotional response to something beautiful.
Ugetsu is astonishingly beautiful, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. The story of two men both unfortunately driven by greed, albeit different types, with Genjuro obsessed with gold and fortune and Tobei warped by the potential glory of the status and stature of becoming a samurai. These choices lead them down selfish paths, destroying the lives of their wives as a result.
The landscapes are strikingly beautiful in black and white, often filled with darkness and shadows and a dense ominous fog. The performances were incredible, drawing a real emotional response from me as I absorbed everything I saw.
Sadly, this film was never even on my radar, only recently seeking it out on Hulu due to positive word of mouth. This will not be my only viewing of Ugetsu, I already can't wait to come back for more.",5.0
"I tend to call myself a big fan of Japanese cinema, but I'll be the first to admit that I haven't seen anywhere near enough of the work of their most prominent filmmakers from the Golden Era. The overwhelming majority of my knowledge is from the late sixties and onwards-- prior to that, it gets increasingly spotty with every passing year (which is also true for American filmmaking as well, to be completely fair).
While I obviously know of the big three directors of the forties, fifties, and sixties (Akira Kurosawa, Yasujirō Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi), I've really only explored the work of one-- Kurosawa. There are certainly a ton of films on my watchlist from the other two (as well as several of their contemporaries), but I just haven't ever made the time to give them the attention they deserve. In fact, prior to tonight I had only ever seen one film from either of them-- Sansho the Bailiff, which I watched a little over two years ago for the first time.
Ugetsu is now the second of Kenji Mizoguchi's films that I have made time for, and it is just further confirmation of why he has his reputation of one of the greatest filmmakers Japan has ever produced. I decided to pick up a copy on bluray as one of my last-minute purchases from November's Criterion Collection sale, and I'm glad that I did-- and now that I've seen it, I think I'm going to have to prioritize picking up the last couple of Mizoguchi films to have made it to bluray during the next sale in July, too.
And as for the film itself? What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said before?
This is essentially just another version of the classic warning about the power money has to corrupt even the most honorable of men. In this particular instance, a potter and his neighbor capitalize on an impending war in order to quickly unload merchandise despite the warnings of their village elder. After getting a taste of the luxury that comes with easy wealth, they succumb to the desire for even more-- and in doing so, sentence everyone that they love to horrific fates.
If this and Sansho the Bailiff are any indication of Mizoguchi's typical tone, then he is easily one of the most nihilistic filmmakers Japan had ever produced in his era. He's willing to explore very grim topics, and he isn't afraid to subject his characters to terrible circumstances in order to tell his stories. The families of our two greedy protagonists endure constant tragedies due to their actions, and in turn they also are forced to suffer the consequences alongside them. It's very powerful to witness, and easily among the most grim cinema I have ever seen from this time period.
Something that was very interesting to see in this film in particular was the way in which Mizoguchi chose to explore the more supernatural elements of the plot. They're often conveyed in a more hallucinatory manner, and they seem to be designed to keep the viewer questioning exactly what to believe in every passing moment in which those elements are present. I'll probably need to see this at least one more time to fully process exactly what was going on during those scenes, since the revelation of their actual nature comes fairly late in the film.
Ugetsu is another absolute masterpiece from Kenji Mizoguchi, and I see now why so many people tend to cite it as one of the greatest films in Japan's Golden Era of cinema. It has certainly reminded me of why I intended to seek out more of Mizoguchi's work following my first viewing of Sansho the Bailiff, too, and I definitely plan to finally do so the next time I have that opportunity. He's clearly a genius, and I have delayed exploring his films for far too long already.",0.0
"More drama then ghost story Ugetsu has always been one of those highly regarded films I can’t help but admire more than I love it. There’s no denying, that this is a beautifully shot, very well acted and more than competently directed film. But on an emotional level, I fail to really connect with the characters and their plights. And when that’s the case, I do have a tendency to get (slightly) bored.
Interestingly enough though, despite that emotional detachment, I do feel the urge every couple of years to revisit the movie. If for no other reason but to see if my perception has changed. Well, maybe next time.",3.5
"Film #32 of Japanuary 2021.
Watch a film by Kenji Mizoguchi
The ghost story is one of the most important forms of storytelling. Often, these stories can reflect socio-political and psychological aspects of a culture or society's current climate. Ghostly apparitions and restless spirits used as a vehicle to tell tales about family neglect and a reflection on Japan's postwar attitudes.
Ugetsu is Mizoguchi's way of expressing regret for making a film that he deemed to be 'war propaganda', The 47 Ronin. The subplot deconstructs the meaninglessness and mistake of war whilst also taking shots at the military and critiquing the high-regarded title of samurai in feudal Japan.
Rich in atmosphere, Ugetsu plays its cards fairly close to the chest, as the supernatural elements only really come to fruition in the later half of the film. Works well both as a ghost story (or Kaidan/怪談) and as a cautionary tale; sort of a dark reflective fable.
Check out my Japanuary list here.",4.0
"before the movie ended I was thinking of writing something along the lines of ‘harta tahta wanita’ as a stupid joke but then that ending came and let me tell u right now: I am on the verge of tears as Boris’ Part II is playing in the background in my room.
there is beauty and magic in the simplicity of Ugetsu that hits far deeper than any Kurosawa movie I’ve seen. I don’t care if you’re rich, I don’t care if you’re poor, I don’t care if you’re young or old, it doesn’t matter. Anyone can learn a valuable lesson from this film. That is why it will always be remembered as a timeless classic.",4.5

"a corporeal and elusive ghost story disguised as a feudal tragedy. shares some thematic overlaps with achebe's things fall apart (squint and you'll see it) for which i wasn't prepared—both show the fatality of man's conformity to cultural stoicism and how vain adherence to societal tradition not only leads to the destruction of man's family but man himself. don't chase ghosts, i guess. still, that doesn't excuse the one dimensionality of the characters of mizoguchi's fable at all, in truth, it makes the story so much less compelling because the characters themselves are so uninteresting and uncompelling. this would be one of my favorite movies if i had anything or anyone to latch on to, but for now i'm quite content to admire from a distance.",3.0
"even on this surface level, ugetsu is a deeply meaningful and challenging morality fable, but it also incorporates a supernatural element that, once seeded, grows into a paradigm shift providing new insights and revelations.
kenji mizoguchi unique establishment of atmosphere by means of long shot, long takes, sublimely graceful and unobtrusive camera movement, is everywhere evident in his treatment of the legend of a potter who leaves his family to market his wares during the ravages of a civil war, and is taken in and seduced by a ghost princess.
ultimately, i think ugetsu is one of the films everyone ought to catch up with, especially now that it has been so carefully restored.",5.0
"Oozing with class, atmosphere, authenticity, sophistication, and intelligence, Kenji Mizoguchi's flawless spectral masterpiece ""Ugetsu"", is one of the great films of the mid 20th century.
A great work of cinema, a great morality parable, Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu deserves the praises which have been heaped on it by virtually every film critic, historian and gutsy audience member who chose to seek it out. Usually i describe the movie's plot minimally, in most reviews, i wanted to do it here too, but i wont. I went in blind, not knowing anything, and boy what a story. All i'll say is that it's a story of 2 ambitious men and their wives, during the Japanese Civil War.
The film is a tragic story of humanity, and it's setup like a classic folk-tale. (in fact, it is based on a couple by Ueda Akinari) Mizoguchi uses this simple folk-tale like story as the vehicle for an unforgettable, subtle, and complex study in ambition, delusion, tragedy, and bitter, partial redemption. Director Kenji Mizoguchi intended for the film to have an anti-war message, showing the horrible impact violence has on people. This theme of the film is often not talked about because it is overshadowed by other brilliant pieces in this puzzle, but the way he employs it is utterly powerful, no normal World War II flick could. This is just as effective as The Best Years of Our Lives, All Quiet on the Western Front, and other masterpieces of this sort.
Mizoguchi's cinematography is very striking at certain scenes, but the parts that stand out the most are the foggy lake segment with its marvelous mixture of light and shadows. This famous sequence was shot partly on a tank with studio backdrops, but it regardless creates a world of fog and mist, out of which a lone, dying boatman appears. The music is certainly memorable too. The use of traditional instruments is very prominent in almost every scene and further attenuates the interesting atmosphere.

The film is aesthetically breathtakingly beautiful and it's full of poetic imagery: like the scene at the lake i already talked about, the breakfast on the lawn and the final shot where the camera raises above the entire village. Through these scenes a strong contrast between fantasy and reality can be seen: fantasy gets power of reality and depth for tragedy. The film is an allegory for postwar Japan but the film achieves to break out of limitations of time; it's a timeless classic about beauty, art and life. Ugetsu is both realistic and allegorical it's an astonishing experience which is quite impossible to forget. The synthesis of picture and sound, the reconstruction of the epoch and the poetic imagery are perfectly created. The film is for its perfect style, intelligent content and insightful themes one of the most beautiful films ever made. It leaves you speechless and makes me want to see more Mizoguchi.
Now #41 on my top 185",5.0
"A classically executed tale of how ambition can lead to corruption and despair. It’s no wonder that both Scorsese and Ari Aster love this movie so much. Scorsese because of how most of films are morality tales about people falling in a spiral of corruption and Aster due to the  formal choices like the eerie music and perfectionist competitions. Mizoguchi specifically is using the ambitious behavior here that leads to the inevitable downfall of the 2 main characters and relates it directly to Japan militant past. He goes deep too. The magnificent supernatural turn (which I always find a little trite so far into the film, see: Aster,  but not here) reveals the false happiness of “success” and how it’s immaterial and translucent to the modestly true happiness of being with people one loves. The spirits of wealth seduce and deceive us with hollow promises.
It’s admittedly less accomplished than Sansho, but I might have enjoyed Ugetsu slightly more if only because it felt little less nihilistic and mopey. Regardless of his mopeyness, Mizoguchi still is probably one of the greatest formalists of his time.",4.0
"My first Mizoguchi experience was one of bewitching beauty and thought-provoking themes.
The story of two unfortunate couples where the husbands run off to chase their dreams unwittingly squandering the lives of their wives and eventually themselves falling prey to the fantasies they aspired to, it unfolds at a dreamy pace on a canvas of remarkable magnificence which comes from its lovely cinematography.
The camera movements which suggest an unravelling Japanese scroll painting through Mizoguchi's delectable and fluent frames add a unique flavor to his storytelling. This was seriously some of the best camerawork I've seen in a black and white film.
From the infinitely alluring lake scene to the seamlessly fluid bathing scene, the film was littered with enchanting and inventive shots.

Matching the technical wizardry is the bleak story which graduates from a tale of misguided ambition to a haunting nightmare that leaves you spooked and satisfied at the same time. While the ghostly figure of Lady Wakasa was an obvious and irresistible apparition that became the highlight of the story, what came after was a purely unexpected and mystifying twist that had me delightfully exhilarated.
This is a timeless Japanese fable which can never cease to amaze its audience. Mizoguchi's simple magic and profound art are beyond all magnificence and above all modesty.",5.0
"Mizoguchi magic. Outrageously good cinematography and use of lighting to match a beautiful piece of storytelling.
One of those great films that slowly sinks into your skin for weeks and months after first viewing. The perfect blend of the natural and the supernatural. And somehow all in 97 minutes. The sign of a man completely in command of his own craft.",4.5
"The more I watch this film, the more I realize that only the central story with Lady Wakasa's ghost really touches me. The visualization of this story is a gem in itself.
I do understand that the moral of these tales is essentially about the evils of vanity and greed, which are the main theme of the story of the Samurai and the pottery merchant, but they didn't excite me as much.
""Ugetsu"" was the first Kenji Mizoguchi film I ever saw, at my middle-school film club, and it naturally occupies a special place in my imagination, which is why I enjoy seeing it again from time to time.

"Such an astonishing and consummately executed work of art that I’m going to have trouble finding the words to talk about it. This is quite simply one of the most astoundingly made films I’ve ever seen. The camerawork and blocking are incredibly dynamic, investing even uneventful scenes with an absorbing atmosphere of drama and intrigue. There’s a constant sense of motion, of events and feelings and sudden, startling shifts occurring at a fantastically rapid rate, that conjures up with incredible skill the chaotic historical moment during which the film is set (and, additionally, the one in which it was made). And when it slows down its pace for more subdued sequences—most famously the otherworldly boat ride across Lake Biwa, but also the first visit to Lady Wakasa’s house and the scene at the brothel and too many others to name—the effect can be absolutely transcendent, even sublime. All this craft applied to a marvelously unsettling and tragic kaidan that aligns perfectly with Mizoguchi’s recurring indictments of greed, war, and patriarchy. The social message comes through strong, but more than anything it’s the consuming sensation of wonder and phantasmagoria that lingers on the imagination. Can’t really add much personally to the volumes that have already been written about this: I loved it, it’s a masterpiece, and I’ll watch it again and again, that’s the long and short of it. Double bill it with Kuroneko for an extra eerie evening.",5.0
"Wow. Just wow. I don’t think a film has really humbled me like this one. The themes of pride and greed and the human desire and how it can ultimately cost you everything. Turning you blind against life’s essentials and what’s close to you for a more eccentric and luscious life.
The cinematography in certain moments is fantastic and while in some ways the film does seem quite dated I just love the writing. In the beginning the constant repetition about how money can blind a man, but at the same time gives people reason to live and gives them a drive. And that mirroring Genjuro’s character arc is incredible, while in some moments it seemed quite predictable, it complemented the story so well. That ending really hit close to home and rounded out the story so well. I loved how concise the film was as well, it carried a very heavy message with a lot to interpret in only an hour and a half which I wasn’t expecting.
Meanwhile Tobei’s story carried out a similar arc however I see his drive stemming from honour and pride. A desire to be loved by the majority and the fame of being a samurai. When in reality the samurai are depicted vile and treat others disgracefully. Especially with the treatment of his wife.
I do love all this film has to say about desire and the human condition. It’s definitely a film that anyone can learn a lot about themselves from.

"Short:
Very well made and shot for sure, and Mizoguchi is great at integrating his themes of greed and how it can ruin lives and how war amounts to nothing, but I can't help but feel this film is not Mizoguchi's best. Maybe my expectations were too high and maybe because I was fresh off my 5/5 viewing of Mommy that I had just watched earlier in the morning, but Ugetsu feels fairly standard for the story it's trying to tell - it isn't overtly experimental or out there, yet it isn't bad either.

But after finally seeing Sansho the Bailiff last week and Ugetsu today, all I want to do is watch more Mizoguchi films. Like Sansho, this is a surprisingly dark but beautiful and humanistic film that lived up to its reputation. Some astonishing imagery and craftsmanship throughout, and Masters of Cinema's blu-ray is again immaculate. There's a scene where two boats meet early on in this film on a foggy river that is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.",4.5

MIZOGUCHI FOI O MAIOR CINEASTA JAPONÊS*
por Jean-Luc Godard
Tradução de Cláudio Marcondes

No dia 24 de agosto de 1956 morreu em Kyoto o maior cineasta japonês. Ou, simplesmente, um dos maiores cineastas. Prova disso é a retrospectiva que a Cinemateca Francesa dedicou à sua obra. Kenji Mizoguchi estava à altura de Murnau ou Rosselini. Sua obra é das mais extensas: diz-se que chega a duzentos filmes. Sem dúvida, há nisto muito de lenda e, nos próximos séculos, certamente não faltarão oportunidades de vermos sofríveis Mizoguchi monogatari; contudo, não resta também a menor dúvida quanto a Kenji ser, de fato, o mais hábil, pois é capaz de rodar em três meses os filmes para os quais um Bresson precisaria de dois anos. E Mizoguchi os realiza com perfeição.

MAIS DISTANTE QUE O OCIDENTE
Desde o aparecimento dos filmes japoneses em nossas telas do pós-guerra, uma querela estética vem opondo os adeptos de Kurosawa (Rashomon, Os sete samurais, o Idiota) aos de Mizoguchi. Querela que se tornou ainda mais exaltada pelo fato de os dois terem sido várias vezes premiados em festivais. Agradeçamos a Jean-José Richer por haver decidido o debate com autoridade: “Esta dupla premiação, feita em termos de estrita equivalência (Os sete samurais e O intendente Sansho, no Festival de Veneza de 1954), é excessiva. Não por causa da imobilização de dois Leões de Prata, mas pela confusão de valores que engendra. Não é improvável que o confronto Mizoguchi-Kurosawa resulte na vantagem incontestável do primeiro. Dentre os cineastas japoneses que conhecemos, ele é o único que soube superar definitivamente a fase atraente, porém menos importante, do exotismo, alcançando um plano mais profundo, no qual não mais precisamos temer prestígios falaciosos”. (Cahiers du Cinéma, nº 40).

GALANTEIO E METAFÍSICA
Se a poesia surge a cada instante em todos os planos filmados por Mizoguchi, trata-se, como em Murnau, do reflexo instintivo da nobreza inventiva do autor. Assim como o diretor de Aurora, o de Contos da lua vaga depois da chuva sabe descrever uma aventura que é ao mesmo tempo uma cosmogonia.
As heroínas são sempre uma mesma, estranhamente semelhantes a Tess d'Urberville, de Thomas Hardy. Uma após a outra, as piores desventuras caem sobre elas. E, embora Mizoguchi demonstre especial afeição pelos bordéis — ao contrário de Kurosawa, que não passa de um Ralph Habib mais bem arrumado —, não se deixa envolver pelos falsos encantos do pitoresco. Ao recriar o Japão antigo, supera o anedótico e o falso brilho para nos proporcionar a verdade bruta, com uma maestria que só se encontra, por exemplo, nas Fioretti. Nunca nossos olhos haviam visto uma recriação tão intensa da atmosfera medieval.

UMA TÉCNICA REVOLUCIONÁRIA DA SIMPLICIDADE
A eficácia e a sobriedade são atributos dos grandes cineastas. Kenji Mizoguchi não é exceção à regra. Como observou Philippe Demonsablon em pertinente estudo de Oharu — A vida de uma cortesā, a arte de Mizoguchi está em recusar qualquer solicitação externa ao objeto, em deixar que as coisas se apresentem por si mesmas, sem que o pensamento intervenha a não ser para apagar suas próprias pegadas, conferindo assim uma eficácia mil vezes maior aos objetos que submete a nossa admiração. Trata-se, portanto, de uma arte realista, e realista será a encenação.
Tal simplicidade não deixa de ser paradoxal, pois torna-se despojada mediante a acumulação de matéria. Primeiro, os enquadramentos se submetem às leis do movimento. Porém nada de excesso barroco, nenhuma intenção além daquela de nos pôr em contato com a própria substância. Nenhuma imagem propriamente cômica, triste, fantástica ou erótica e, no entanto, tudo isso junto. A arte de Mizoguchi é a mais complexa por ser a mais simples. Poucos efeitos de câmera, poucos travellings; mas, de repente, quando irrompem durante um plano, eles têm uma beleza fulgurante. Cada movimento de grua (neste aspecto, deixando Preminger muito atrás) tem o traçado claro e límpido do lápis de Hokusai.
Admirado por ocasião do Festival de Veneza, Contos da lua vaga depois da chuva, extraído de uma lenda de Ugetsu, é a obra-prima de Kenji Mizoguchi, aquela que o coloca em pé de igualdade com Griffith, Eisenstein e Renoir. A ação se desenrola no final do século XVI, na época das guerras civis. Mostra-nos as peripécias de Genjuro — um modesto oleiro da província, enfeitiçado pela bela Machiko —, e as de seu amigo, um grosseirão ignaro que sonha em vestir uma armadura. Depois de muitos dissabores e desilusões na cidade grande, ambos voltam a viver para sempre no campo.
Tudo o que constituía a força e o esplendor de Os amantes crucificados, a cruel vivacidade de O destino de madame Yuki, a jovial canalhice de Rua da vergonha, a ternura de Elegia de Osaka, encontra-se ali reunido e elevado. É, ao mesmo tempo, Dom Quixote, A odisséia e Judas, o Obscuro. Uma hora e meia de projeção que parece durar uma eternidade. O refinamento da encenação é levado neste filme ao grau máximo. Mizoguchi talvez seja o único cineasta no mundo que ousa empregar sistematicamente a técnica de campo/contracampo em 180°. Mas o que em outros seria uma fanfarronada nele é apenas um movimento natural, proveniente do que havia colocado no cenário e do lugar que nele ocupam os atores.
Vejamos dois exemplos de passe de mágica técnica que são o apogeu da arte. Genjuro banha-se com a sedutora fatal que o prendeu em sua teia; a câmera deixa a piscina nos rochedos onde se divertem, faz uma panorâmica ao longo do lago, que transborda formando um riacho, o qual se perde nos campos; neste momento, há uma brevíssima fusão na qual surgem os sulcos no terreno, outros sulcos parecem perder o relevo, a câmera continua a avançar harmoniosamente, volta a subir e descobre um jardim no qual reencontramos os amantes alguns meses depois, no instante em que fazem uma refeição. Somente os mestres do cinema sabem aproveitar um raccord para evocar um sentimento, aqui, o sentimento, muito proustiano, do prazer e do correr dos dias.
Outro exemplo. Genjuro, após matar a fada, volta para casa. Não sabe que Ohama, a terna esposa, está morta, violentada pelos saqueadores. Entra em casa e percorre todos os aposentos. A câmera o acompanha em panorâmica. Ele passa de um aposento a outro, sempre seguido pela câmera. Ele se afasta, a câmera o perde de vista, retorna ao aposento e enquadra Ohama, em carne e osso, no exato instante em que Genjuro também entra ali e a percebe (assim como nós), imaginando que não viu direito e que a doce esposa está sã e salva.
Com sua arte, Mizoguchi comprova, ao mesmo tempo, que “a verdadeira vida está em outra parte” e, no entanto, também está aqui, com estranha e radiante beleza.

Chances are, you won’t truly and fully appreciate the mastery and ingenuity of the craft here, unless you’ve ever made a film yourself, or tried making one. Unless you’ve seen how difficult it can be to convey even a basic narrative effectively through straightforward mise en scene and elementary decoupage.
Mizoguchi’s camera, though not as showy or grand as Ophlus or Welles’, moves more organically, transforming the mise en scene with each subtle gestrure. Just look at the camera placement in the last shot of the scene in which the main characters encounter another boat on the lake. The poor victim of the pirates falls to his death after warning our characters about the perils of the lake. The camera appears to be on the roof of the dead man’s boat, simultaneously (and forebodingly) framing him and the two couples from above. But as his boat is pushed away by one of the men, the camera doesn’t move with the boat. Rather, it descends and gets closer to the first boat, framing the couples more tightly, as they make a decision that informs their troubles for the remainder of the film. Astruc wrote: “It takes only five minutes for Ugetsu monogatari to demonstrate clearly the meaning of mise en scene – for some at any rate: a certain way of extending states of mind into movements of the body.” And indeed, as this five-minute-long scene ends with the boat disappearing in the mist, the dreamscape has extended from one inside the minds of the characters to a fully materialized nightmarescape which will haunt them for the rest of the film.",4.5

The two men, a farmer-cum-potter and his brother-in-law with dreams of samurai success, are not bad, they don't even act badly given the situation. But each one makes a critical error in judgement. And in most fables with morals, not only do they pay for it, but so do those they love.
There are many movies that came from Japan during the post-war decades that used medieval fables to tell their stories. My wife asked me while I was watching this if any movies made in 50s Japan were set in 50s Japan. She was being flippant -- she has seen Tokyo Story -- but it isn't such a ridiculous question. There are so period movies from this era that are still held in such high esteem that when asked to think of movies set in the modern day... well Tokyo Story pops up. But it takes a moment before Ikiru and When a Woman Ascends the Stairs and others follow. However, period movies... well Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Yojimbo and other Kurosawa, Sansho the Bailiff, HaraKiri, and Onibaba. And that's just some of what's in the Criterion Collection.
So having seen a good variety of these films, and coming relatively late to Ugetsu, I don't know whether I can add much to it. I found it beautiful and touching and gut-wrenching. But unlike some of these fables, I found the ending surprisingly uplifting. Sad, yes, but there is a sense of hope to it, that the characters are better off than when the story started and they have learned from their experience. It is a powerful ending. It is full of pathos, but it is not heavy handed. Sometimes I find fables knock you unconscious with their message and then wake you up so they can hit you again. No so with Ugetsu. Here instead there is comfort. Yes the characters made mistakes, but there is forgiveness here and the message that we can learn from our errors, and even become better people for them. A simple moral, beautifully told.",5.0
"Chaque fois que je revois Ugetsu, le film commence, tout se passe bien, c’est d’une maîtrise formelle si grande que t’as pas grand-chose à redire et que t’embarques sans te poser de questions, puis ça passe, puis tu vois le gros mélodrame se construire, puis ça s’empile, tragédie sur tragédie, avec un acharnement qui t’épaissit la vision jusqu’à te faire te demander pourquoi Mizoguchi a filmé autant de vies tragiques (nommez-moi un réalisateur qui ait filmé autant de vies tragiques), puis là, juste au bord du désespoir (autrement dit, le moment où je me dirais: « C’est un beau film, mais je suis tanné d’avoir mal alors je vais prendre un break de Mizoguchi »), viennent les dix dernières minutes.
Et quelles dix dernières minutes.
Dans son livre sur Mizo, Tadao Sato explique à quelques reprises à quel point il aimait s’appuyer sur la grue pendant les tournages, et qu’il ressentait si vivement la souffrance de ses personnages qu’il en vibrait au point de la faire vibrer, provocant un léger tremblement dans l’image. Rappelez-vous en la prochaine fois que vous verrez une caméra s’approcher en flottant, pour venir consoler un fantôme après l’avoir écouter pleurer pendant de longues minutes en plan fixe, et qu’effectivement, l’image qui s’approche est une image qui sanglote à son tour.",5.0

"Post-WW2 Japanese cinema attempting to reflect on how they got there is always fascinating to me and has a pretty high floor. For me, this one is relatively middle-of-the-road for that genre, as I find it to be a tad telegraphed, simple, and disjointed even if it hits on the themes I came for.",3.5
"87/100






No amount of writing can convey the richness and impact of the images and the overall flow of the film, which is why this commentary will be brief. Suffice it to say that I recommend this film wholeheartedly to anyone looking for cinematic poetry, This film is hard to watch. There are so many things working on so many levels. It's about a people who are happy with their circumstances, who are uprooted by raping, pillaging invaders. It is about greed and irresponsibility and betrayal. It is a ghost story. It is a love story. It is full of angst and disappointment. The characters are self-destructive, but they have at the center, good hearts and good intentions. The potter wants to do for his family, to become rich and provide for them, but like so many classic stories, the curse that goes with riches, in the Ecclesiastical sense, brings everyone down. Even the hated invaders seem to be starving and looting to survive; unfortunately, however, they say yes to their most base and evil side. Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is the camera-work; on a first viewing one is scarcely aware of it much of the time, but the camera is in constant motion, emblematic of the restlessness which pervades not only the era and the central characters but, by implication, all of human life (in this regard, it's a very Buddhist film). This movement is never gratuitous; when the scene demands little or no movement the camera stays still. Notice, though, how often the camera's movement enhances the emotional impact of the scene, especially in the famous panning shot of the reunion near the end. Along with this is Mizoguchi's penchant for long takes, which seduce the viewer into the rhythm of the film without calling attention to themselves or to his cleverness as a director. It is truly beautiful, and powerful in the unexpected way of great poetry. Technique and emotion, simplicity of means and complexity of effects, walk hand-in-hand here, and the result is remarkable in a way which film rarely attains. Ugetsu is a film full of tragedy, morals and a blend of the supernatural and reality. At the core, the narrative is a pair of simple fables working parallel to each other. Two brothers strive for a selfish goal while neglecting loved ones and suffer misfortune as a consequence, mostly at the expense of their wive's fate. It's an involving concept, and the simplicity of the stories makes it easy to follow although they do spend too long explaining emotions rather than portraying them. Intelligent storytelling and filmmaking.",4.0
"Ugestsu Monogatori is a creative hybrid of a film. It is both a period piece and otherworldly fantasy. Kenji Mizoguchi directed this masterpiece which centers on two couples who live in rural Japan. The families are torn apart when the two husbands, who are brothers, decide to take advantage of the unstable situation caused by Civil War to either make a lot of money, in the case of the one husband, or to become a famous Samurai, in the case of the other husband. What take place as a result is completely unpredictable, especially with the introduction of supernatural elements. The movie is beautifully shot and expertly directed. It proves why Mizoguchi is one of the greatest Japanese directors of all time.",5.0
"The Criterion Challenge 2021
(25/52) - A film in Martin Scorsese's Top 10
This is my first film by director Kenji Mizoguchi, and I think I didn't really give it the attention it deserved. I've been feeling a little light-headed, so my attention span is not the best; I will need to rewatch Ugetsu in the future.
This is a harrowing and deeply humanistic drama, a portrait of a feudal Japan in crisis, filled with uncertainty, war, greed, and a need for survival. It's the perfect representation of a divided society, as we see these characters slowly drift away, each of them following a different path; some of mystery, of triumph, of pain, of agony, of illusions that rarely come true. It's a society where families divide, where power and money seem to matter most, and it's a heartbreaking but contemplative film on human nature. Sadly, something was missing for me, and even tho the ideas are great, it failed to connect with me emotionally for most of the time.
2021 first time watches",3.5
"Ugetsu is an intimate and gentle film that explores the consequences of greed, pride, and envy in a manner that's mature and grounded.
Although all of the film was well composed, both the story and atmosphere particularly stood out; and rather than appearing ridiculous and awkward, the supernatural elements smoothly reinforced the film's themes and contributed to its already striking atmosphere.
If I hadn't been so damn tired I probably would be giving this 4 stars, but Ugetsu is definitely not something to watch if you're sleepy.",3.5
"Greed is a fucker.
There is a reason why Mizoguchi is so heralded and this film is a prime example. Raw as fuck and still maintains beauty alongside.
I’d have to say to (and agree) that this is a horror film. I always say that monsters and witches don’t scare me, people do. To see what delusion does to a person can be very sad. Especially when they ditch everything to embrace something that was never theirs.
Everything about this is right. The lighting, the script, the acting, all of it. One thing I really did appreciate is realism they created for doing this in 1953. Sharp as hell.

"This was such a great film, and I knew nothing about it going into it. It’s almost like a gothic, supernatural romance set in wartime Japan during the 16th century. It’s mostly a film about love and greed, and how our ambitions can get the better of us sometimes.
I really enjoyed the tone and atmosphere that Kenji Mizoguchi pulled off here, it feels quite slow and methodical whilst still being entertaining and frightening at times. I wouldn’t say it’s scary, but it’s that good gothic atmosphere that you might recognize if you’re a fan of the Universal Monster films of the 1930’s for example.
Ugetsu is such a great film that i’m sure i’ll revisit many times in the future.",4.0
"Mizoguchi Marathon #26
""The world is a temporary abode where we weep until the dawn comes.""
As the '50s push forward, we see Mizoguchi's major works push boundaries. They dive headfirst into ungrounded abstraction, an ethereal contemplation that just wasn't there before. It makes for a fascinating wrinkle, and some would say a logical conclusion of Mizoguchi's ardent prayers. After decades of shouting the world's torments into the Ether of existence, Ugetsu is an attempt to articulate Ether's response.
Delusions of grandeur. They absorb us, whether we're cognizant of them or not. In Ugetsu, these delusions fracture families, leave women destitute in the fallout of their pursuit. The world is full of deception and deceit, with perhaps the most heinous one of them all the ""triumph"" of status and material wealth. As the saying goes, money cannot buy happiness. In fact, these men, in pursuit of cash and stardom, experience both tangible and spiritual decay. Women wither when men exploit, and men only learn the truth of their misdeeds through misfortune, almost always when it is far too late. Ohama is sexually ravaged in the wake of Tobei's pursuit of glory. Miyagi is killed by bandits when Genjuro's pursuit of the almighty dollar leads him to a nefarious enchantress. There's a dereliction of duty, as fathers, as husbands, that points towards Mizoguchi's philosophy of priorities: those immediate and intimate always come before the state, the spiritual, the material.
Much of these ideas have been repeated incessantly by Mizoguchi's films for most of his career. What makes Ugetsu different is how it tries to answer for the suffering experienced on the physical plane through a connection to the other world. The results of this new attempt to reconcile the horrors of a hellish reality are mixed, in my opinion, which is why I'm not quite sure what to make of them. After Miyagi is slaughtered and Genjuro is reunited with his son, her spirit seems to be liberated. She speaks to him soothingly, saying she is there, not to worry, keep up the hard work. It's as if her death confirmed Enlightenment, the Buddhist idea of transcendence from the material to the painless ethereal. However, Lady Wakasa has a completely different experience in the other world. She leaves the Earth disappointed, having never felt love, and thus is returned to our plane as a seductress, a means of self-gratifying temptation for Genjuro and his craft. ""I wanted her to feel the love she never got to feel as a woman while she was alive,"" explains her nurse in justifying the ghastly trickery at hand. What leaves me confused about all this is that, for all intents and purposes, both women had suffered similarly in the physical world. Both were slaughtered by unnecessary conflict. Lady Wakasa's death was a byproduct of war, as was Miyagi's. The only two differences between them are class and Genjuro. But, is Genjuro's ""love"" enough for Miyagi's soul to transcend? Is all you need for spiritual achievement a loose, unprioritized love from a man in pursuit of the material? It seems to me that Miyagi and Lady Wakasa's experience with love was not all that different. That leaves the issue of class. I'm not sure that her position as the daughter of a Lord would guarantee her spot in a troubled afterlife. In fact, throughout much of Mizoguchi's filmography, we've seen him be sympathetic to the bourgeois, especially towards the female members of that class. Because of all of this, I'm not entirely sure how satisfied I am with the film thematically, as a piece in Mizoguchi's canon. At best, I'm missing or misinterpreting something. At worst, the film is ethereal for the sake of telling a ""spooky"" story, and that is something I refuse to believe.
There is something to be said of a film being difficult to analyze. I struggled with this review mightily, and my score above, because it is such an enjoyable experience, a technical marvel, stunningly, hauntingly gorgeous. And yet, because I perceive it as something perhaps too big for its britches, I can't quite buy-in to it being an all-timer. There are moments in the minutia, and perhaps I'm being picky here, that don't mesh well with Mizoguchi's philosophy or are inconsistent with the film's message and my interpretation of it as a whole. I'd love to have a discussion below about what exactly all the spiritual mumbo jumbo means in relation to Mizoguchi's ethos and, in a more condensed sense, the film as a singular work. Is there something I'm missing? Am I thinking too hard? Is the result you see in the afterlife completely random? Or is Mizoguchi actually a proletariat communist and I've totally missed that throughout his filmography? What damns Lady Wakasa and absolves Miyagi? Why are their experiences after death so different? Is it because Wakasa was a dream, an illusion, and Miyagi is tangible, real? Let me know what you think.
In any case, the film's given me a ton to think about.",4.0
"The inner Demons that haunt us

Kazuo Miyagawa truly was a god behind the camera. How he can be so versatile in such a difficult field (especially in the early days), can adapt like a chameleon on the fly and inventing some new techniques along the way.
Such tracking shots with such a sublime lighting and perfect framing of every single picture, that they're ready to be printed for eternity to plaster my walls with sorrow and madness in the most beautiful way you can capture it. Magic, I tell ya'll!
Every set, every actor shines in front of him and Kenji Mizoguchi gives the gut punches with direction for everyone involved, being precise like a razor blade, by arranging a sheer mass of people and stapling them into a 4:3 frame that has as much depth as any Ozu Movie I've seen so far. The editing with exact cuts and seamless branching is a marvel as well, that was as rare around the fifties as dignity in the 16th Century around Japan.",4.5
"There are several classic filmmakers that I've yet to discover, or at the very least, explore more of their filmography. When focusing on all eras and genres of film, there's bound to be blind spots, and Kenji Mizoguchi was one of them. Despite my adoration for Japanese cinema, I haven't seen many of its classics. Ugetsu is another reminder as to why I value Japanese cinema highly. While it is another Japanese folktale film set in Japan's Sengoku period, Mizoguchi adds his spin on the genre in terms of narrative and filmmaking. The drama that unfolds in Ugetsu might not be new for the era, but the way it gets told is a whole different experience.
The best aspect of Ugetsu is easily its cinematography. Not only is this my first for Mizoguchi, but the first for legendary cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. His reputation is well-deserved from Ugetsu alone, as every shot is like an ancient Japanese ink-painting in cinematic form. The framing brings a quiet allure to the horrific backdrop of war, complete with masterful use of fog. Long takes get scattered throughout the running time, and the hypnotic visuals and expertly crafted uses of silence never call attention to them. When it comes to the framing and lighting, Ugetsu is flawless.
All other technical aspects are on point. While the score gets sparingly used, it's a wonderfully eerie rendition of traditional Japenese music whenever it plays. All of the performances are fantastic, especially from the female leads. Considering this is a war film, brutal conflicts arise left and right, and all of the actors excel in this despair. Like many films from Japan's Golden Age, this film easily captures the look of the Sengoku era without any inconsistencies. When it comes to all of the technical aspects, Ugetsu thrives in its realism. Even with the supernatural elements at play, the mundane and the horrific get told through a nuanced perspective and thoughtful patience.
While Ugetsu isn't the most complex when it comes to its allegorical narrative, it succeeds at providing an emotional story. The flaws of the characters are obvious, and the inevitable consequences are easy to predict. However, the execution of this fable remains a lyrical exploration of the human condition. Admittedly, I wish that the moral of Ugestu wasn't spelled out for me as often as it was, but that's the only issue I have with its writing. As a whole, Ugetsu is another testament to Japanese cinema. Whether someone views it as a cautionary tale or a dreamlike experience, there's plenty to fall in love with on a narrative and visual level.",4.5
"I try to write at least a little something about every movie I watch but this one has me speechless. It's a gripping ghost-y family drama that lets you feel your way into the ghost story elements — and you're damn sure something spooky and mystical is going on — before it's even clear that there's anything like that going on. In love with the score, it sets such a creepy mood right from the opening credits. Great film.",5.0

"A insatisfação humana com o estado presente das coisas, que retém um sentimento de ambição por vezes desmedido, acaba por expor o egoísmo da natureza humana. O poteiro abandona a esposa e o filho para lucrar em um mercado mais atrativo, ao mesmo tempo em que o vizinho camponês faz o mesmo para perseguir notoriedade sendo um samurai em uma sociedade dominada pela guerra e pela violência.
Esse egoísmo, claro, acaba por cegar e Mizoguchi traz esse simbolismo para o campo da ação. O filme assume um viés transcendental, em que fantasmas são introduzidos para reafirmar a incapacidade humana de discernimento entre o real e o imaginário frente à possibilidade de alcançar seus desejos mais profundos. E por ser Mizoguchi, a religiosidade é bastante presente: o desprendimento das coisas materiais para o alcance da plenitude que, aqui, só se torna possível naquela cena final que parece restabelecer a normalidade diante da compreensão do protagonista.",5.0

"92/100
Absolutely brilliant. Combines multiple genres with breathless ease into a cohesive and absolutely powerful final product. We follow two peasant couples as they struggle with being uprooted from their village. Genjurō wants to use the situation as a means of making money by selling his pottery, while Miyagi (which such child like glee) wants to become a Samurai and fight in the war.
The stories told are timeless and very easy to relate to in one way or another. This film takes you in directions you may not expect. Maybe it's because I didn't really read the synopsis...but there is a major shift in this story about two thirds of the way through that really changes the impact and themes of the film. This shift also is what makes Ugetsu special and gives it that gut punch of a final third. Just in case anyone is like me and doesn't know what this is, I'm not gonna spoil it. Needless to say though...when it happened I was sitting there enthralled, and any complains of a somewhat slow middle act suddenly were kicked in the ass.
The final ten minutes or so of this film knocked me out cold. It's haunting, sad, and teaches a valuable lesson. So far, Ugetsu is one of those films that is living on in my mind and will probably grow in my affection as I think more about it. Easily towards the top of the heap for classic Japanese cinema. A must see.",4.5
"English:
Much of what I said to Sansho the Bailiff could be repeated here. Ugetsu is another very sad and brutal film by Misoguchi, it is a film that portrays very well the brutality of the urban world and war, bringing a very complex approach through the social context.
The male characters fall into a world of temptations, thus leaving their family (wifes) at the mercy of all the evils of an extremely violent world, where they are forced to enter paths, often with no return.
The feature knows very well how to use suggestion, Misoguchi does not need to use many images to make you feel what is happening. The camera work is excellent and presents its own particularities from the context of each scene, approaching or moving away from the characters, the use of light and shadow is also great and creates some mind-blowing scenes.
Ugetsu is a film that explores a lot of society and ethics, in addition to perfectly capturing sentimental variations, it is a film that left me afraid, relieved, happy, to later leave me sad, but with some splatters of hope, a brutal story, but worth every second of a cinema that is very powerful in terms of form and content.

Boa parte do que eu falei para Sansho the Bailiff poderia repetir aqui. Ugetsu é mais um filme muito triste e brutal do Misoguchi, é um filme que retrata muito bem essa brutalidade do mundo urbano e da guerra, trazendo uma abordagem bem complexa através do contexto social.
Os personagens homens caem em um mundo de tentações, assim deixando a sua família(esposas) a mercer de todos os males de um mundo extremamente violento, onde elas se veem obrigadas a entrar em caminhos, muitas vezes sem volta.
O longa sabe muito bem utilizar a sugestão, Misoguchi não precisa usar muitas imagens para que você sinta o que está acontecendo. O trabalho de câmera é excelente e apresneta particularidades muito próprias a partir do contexto de cada cena, se aproximando ou afastando dos personagens, o uso de luz e sombra também é ótimo e cria algumas cenas alucinantes.
Ugetsu é um filme que explora muito sociedade e ética, além de captar com perfeição variações sentimentais, é um filme que me deixou com medo, aliviado, feliz, para depois me deixar triste, mas com alguns respingos de esperança, uma história brutal, mas que vale cada segundo de um cinema muito poderoso em forma e conteúdo.",4.5

"Kenji Mizoguchi’s Oscar-nominated fantasy drama is a story of motivation, family, affection, and conflict set in the core of the Japanese Civil Wars of the 16th century. In Japanese with English subtitles.
Set in 16th century Japan, peasants Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) and Tobei (Sakae Ozawa) vend their earthenware pots to a gang of soldiers in a village not too far away, in rebelliousness of a local sage’s caution against pursuing to profit from conflict.
Genjuro’s chase of both riches and the enigmatic Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyō), as well as Tobei's longing to become a samurai, run the possibility of damaging both themselves and their wives, Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) and Ohama (Mitsuko Mito).
Masayuki Mori and Sakae Ozawa both give good performances in their respective parts as the two peasants who both have to be careful with themselves while on dangerous territory.
Elsewhere, there are fine performances to be had from Kinuyo Tanaka and Mitsuko Mito in their respective parts as Genjuro and Tobei’s respective wives who are concerned by what their husbands are up to, while Machiko Kyō is decent as the mysterious woman involved who Genjuro likes.
The direction from Mizoguchi is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a mixed atmosphere happening as well and the script is written to a decent standard by Matsutarô Kawaguchi and Yoshikata Yoda as he makes the movie good to follow.
The camera and costume stand out best in terms of the technical aspects, because the camera makes good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status; the costumes are excellently designed, with Tadaoto Kainoshô getting an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.
The only criticism I have is that the pace is a little slow at times.
Overall, despite the pacing, Ugetsu is a very decent Japanese drama, due to the good performances, direction, script, mixed atmosphere, tense moments and costumes.",4.0
"How the director tackles the effects of war really plays a part in the overall story like a character study of people going through their sins while making it a sad ghost story at the same time. Genjūrō (Masayuki Mori) goes through greed and lust by focusing more on his money and pottery than his whole family, while Tōbei (Eitaro Ozawa) plays a part in pride and envy when focusing on wanting to get a samurai outfit, get famous, and get well-liked by everybody around him. What people go through in times of crisis like that really pays a toll on them that’s going to affect them on such a higher level when dealing with samurais that showed them no mercy.

"Ugetsu is a beautifully constructed visual tale. The director's excellent use of long gliding takes is a good example of that and how it brings about a sort of mystical charm. It is a very meditative sort of viewing experience that really helps accentuate the drama during the more quiet moments of the film. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a masterpiece or at least borderline to being one. This black & white film is quite colorful and really draws you in to its strange world. It is quite great. More particularly it is Genjuro's tale that provides the most drama and intrigue but the other stories are also very engaging as well. Overall Ugetsu is a film that does not get too far ahead of itself with its themes of happiness and patriarchal society and instead goes at a pace that allow the viewers to soak in the beauty of this viewing experience.
It is a wonderful immersion of both the real world and the mystical world that makes it hard for one to distinguish and separate the two by the end of the movie. The fluidity between these two worlds makes for an excellent allegorical vibe that few other films can match. The idea of what a man should be and act like (in accordance with their wives/significant others) is also heavily analyzed in this. With that in mind it makes one think that this is going to be one dark and bleak tale but instead we get an odd sense of wonderment and hope for the characters at the end. I am pretty close to putting this on my top 10 list because it really is that good. Ugetsu has a lot going for itself from its historical drama, its views on social and family themes, and finally to the ghost story where most of that mystical charm comes from.
This film has lots of range that is proven so in its actors and its camera work. It is rich in tone and subtleties. It is dense when it comes to plot but it is the emotions that make Ugetsu subtle and powerful. It is lyrical and enchanting and I would recommend this to just about everyone I know.",5.0
"This is Kenji Mizogychi's masterpiece. His magnum opus if you will
Ugetsu has layers that even if you take the simplest one you would enjoy the movie. But if you take into consideration the whole film and everything involved, Ugetsu is a cinematic triumph on every level
The story is revolves around 2 men that leave their hard lives for greener pastures. The results for everyone involved is brutal, even the men. One wants to be a samurai so bad he leaves his wife and son in search glory. The wife and son suffers bleakly with his absence and fall to very bad men which filled Japan at the time. The other man is so lost in the sorrow of his day to day he is seduced by ghosts that promise him seductively promise more attractive options than his current situation can offer. But men finally realize they've messed up but ultimately too late
The grand scope of this time in feudal Japan and the way woman are treated is staggering. The brutality of this film is shocking. Lots of death and vagrant mistreatment of women and children is eye opening although accurate for this time in history. The music need to absolutely be mentioned. Such a huge surge of the overall creepiness of the movie. It carries the movie through some well times pauses. Mizoguchi is at his best here, clearly consumed on making this brillant film click on all levels. I actually saw a review online of this film giving it bad remarks because of the sad, bleak vibe of the movie. Which I obviously disagree with the remarks very much
Tremendous film

"A very simple moral tale told with grace. So simple I honestly have no idea how to write about it. But, this is for a club* so....(don't read this)
It's a parable essentially about the buddhist teaching ""Life (meaning modern life/attachment) is suffering."" About two men who have their minds perverted by greed and envy. The story is tragic, but hopeful. The lesson is harsh, but one learns that if know what is really of value it can never be lost.
Love the way the camera calmly and unobtrusively glides around, almost always moving. And when it is static, there is usually some movement in the frame. Harmony! I've never seen a Mizoguchi film before but will watch more! Particularly like his rare, purposeful cuts. keeps the pace steady!
This is the first film watched for the newly formed 'Club Friendship*' and the theme of the month was ""academy award nominated costumes."" So I guess I should talk about the costumes.
They seemed legit. Period appropriate, perhaps made of silk? Reminds me of a fun Cary Grant anecdote. Ryan O'Neal once asked him for advice on how to act in a comedy and all Grant had to say on the matter was ""Make sure you wear silk underpants."" Odd duck that Cary Grant.",3.5

"Why is there a ghost story in the middle of Ugetsu?
I know that sounds like a weird question. Ugetsu is known as a ghost story. It's an adaptation of a classic Japanese ghost story collection, the Ugestsu monogatari. All its most famous scenes are of ghosts.
And yet. Most of the movie has nothing supernatural in it. There's some haunted Gagaku music and Noh imagery and mist on Lake Biwa to set a creepy mood early on, but we don't meet up with the spectral Lady Wakasa until pretty late into the movie, when the movie's shape and themes have already been established. The ghost story feels, to me, to be at best incidental to and at worst a detraction from that shape and those themes. The ghost floats in, messes with the unity of the movie, then floats out having wreaked havoc.
Ugetsu is two parallel stories of men trying to profit off of war—one for fame and one for wealth—and in each case, their ambition brings their wives to calamity. These stories are fully told without Lady Wakasa's intrusion. Tōbei's plot doesn't intersect with hers at all, and Genjuro has already betrayed and lost Miyagi by the time he meets his phantom paramour. Genjuro's ambition, the destruction of his wife, his success at selling pottery, and even his loss of money are barely related to the ghost story.
I have run through a bunch of reviews and papers on this movie and not many link the film's war concerns to Lady Wakasa. Writers focus on either one or the other. It's clear that the story of war and ambition is is the movie's primary focus and purpose. Mizoguchi himself says so:
Whether war originates in the ruler’s personal motives, or in some public concern, how violence, disguised as war, oppresses and torments the populace, both physically and spiritually! . . . I want to emphasize this as the main theme of the film.
So why the ghost? Either Lady Mukasa deepens the theme or she works against it and complicates it in some way. I can't really read her as working against it, but I can think of three things that she might add.
First, war created this ghost. She's a victim of a man who drags her into a world of violence, just as Miyagi and Ohama are. (In this case the man is her father, not her husband.) Maybe we should read her not for her effect on Genjuro's storyline, but for her own story, as a third female protagonist brought low by warring men who splinter families.
Second. There's a scene where Genjuro stops at a kimono stand, and the shopkeeper scoffs at him for thinking he can afford his goods. But Genjuro has hit it big by war profiteering, and he assures the man that he can pay to clothe his wife in the finest silk. As he imagines her wearing a fancy kimono, Miyagi is on the road to doom. He cares more about what she looks like than he cares about ensuring her actual bodily safety. Falling for a fancy-lady ghost is the ultimate endpoint on this trajectory: he succumbs to an image of class without any corporeal reality behind it.
Third, Lady Mukasa praises his excellence at pottery. Don't hide your talents in a rural village! she tells him. She's an incarnation of the big-city pride and ambition that ultimately dooms his family.
While these might be legitimate reads and value-adds, I think something is lost by having Genjuro become ensorcelled. At Lady Mukasa's mansion, he is clearly out of his wits and in a hypnotized quasi-stupor. The two reads above where Lady Mukasa represents or brings out some negative feature of Genjuro are compromised by his being magically cursed. And while I like the other read, where Lady Mukasa represents another story of destruction and loss, she nonetheless does some damage to Genjuro's story by supernaturally robbing him of some agency.
Ugetsu is partly an adaptation of two of the nine ghost stories from Akinari's Ugestsu monogatari: ""A Reed-Choked House"" forms the basis for the end scene with Miyagi, and ""A Serpent's Lust"" forms the basis for the Lady Mukasa story. (""A Serpent's Lust"" retells a Ming Chinese parable called ""Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder-Peak Pagoda"" that has been itself adapted into a bunch of movies, such as Tsui Hark's Green Snake.) It is a little strange to me that so little of the collection is adapted, and that so little of the movie is based on the adaptation. Most of the movie is, instead, adapted from a short story by Guy de Maupassant called ""Decoré"", in which a man obsessed with attaining the Legion of Honor neglects his wife. Tōbei's storyline is a clear reflection of this story, but it's also the source of Genjuro's ambition. It's obvious that Mizoguchi cared about this story much more than the Ugestsu monogatari: refer again to what he says about the movie's main theme. That's all Maupassant, not Akinari.
As I was considering whether the movie is disunified, I came across an article on the Ugestsu monogatari claiming that some of the stories were forged in a literary and historical tradition very different from a Western one, and they violate Western and modern aesthetic criteria such as ""unity."" I wonder if that's how I should think of the movie too.
Two final points:
📌 I loved the look of insipid pride on Tōbei's face as he rode through town with his retinue. Such a funny expression. He looked like a Reddit meme.
📌 I'm very much into cat_vs_kirk's musings on the logic of ghost bigamy.

"Japanuary 2022: Kenji Mizoguchi (4/31)
What would it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?
Parables are some of the most fascinating ways to teach moral lessons, as well as being compelling stories in their own right. When me and my mate watched Sansho The Bailiff, we both noted its parallels with the biblical story of Joseph, which parable or not, represents a story with heaps of proverbial value. I love the way Mizoguchi uses symbolism and fantasy to elevate his storytelling just beyond reality in both this and Sansho. The destructiveness that a desire for power and pleasure born out of war can have on the heart of formerly good men is a universal truth that tragically can’t be overstated. This cautionary tale heartbreakingly and beautifully retells that truth in a way that also reminds us that no matter how much is beyond repair, people always ought to seek to right their paths by righting their wrongs.",4.5
"I wish I watched this before watching Kwaidan. Because most of the folk tales of Japan has this twist which is very common (Which I'm not going to spoil).
The overall theme of the movie is okay, but I'm gonna be honest, this type of folk tales doesn't really interest me. That's why I really like Sansho the Bailiff, because it tackles the real world. In this movie, it also tackles real world issues, that's why I appreciate it, but other aspect, which is somehow plays a large portion in the movie is a bit weak to me.

Overall, I find it predictable. It is great filmmaking by the way, It's just these types doesn't really take me away.

"Stunning in every way. Mizoguchi’s direction is masterful, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the ending is wonderful. I felt like I was waking up from a dream afterwards. The themes of money and greed are explored in such a unique way as the film weaves seamlessly from fantasy to reality. Mizoguchi directs the dream scenes perfectly. An extremely well crafted film and I can see why so many consider it one of the best. I’m eager to see more of Mizoguchi’s work.

"Mizoguchi and the great stage of life: Cinema in the form of theater
Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains
Set in the 16th century, in a Japan marked by one of its most chaotic periods, the Sengoku period (the era of states at war), Mizoguchi manages to build a plot based on war, family conflicts, greed, fighting for money at any cost and fantasy. Within this period, it can be said that it was the golden age of the samurai, due to the intense war conflicts present at that time, the sword being the great law of the time and that would define the direction of Japan. Therefore, Mizoguchi manages to represent, in the first minutes and scenes of the fillme, the fabulous and fantastical tone it would have, as if we were watching a theatrical film. Each scene has a short duration, with abrupt cuts, as if the characters were actors staging on a stage and were preparing and changing for the next act. The director's mise en scène wastes no time in bringing this characteristic to the fore, with rustic scenarios and apparently all done by hand, with traces of a great stage. Each scene seems choreographed by its actors, who follow the steps of a great performance. This might sound forced, since the characters could appear to lose elasticity or their own personality, but the director's universe makes everything seem to make sense, in his cosmology. We are watching a great staged poetry, with a lyricism flirting with the cinema in its maximum purity. This is quite clear in the face of a scene in which a character seems to be more concerned with his material goods in the midst of a war that could take his own life and the life of his family. The strionism here and the extreme arrogance of the character gives the fabulous and storytelling tone that the film wants us to present, all within a stylistic unity developed to be a great Aristotelian tragedy.
Such a film also affects the conventions of the saga of ordinary men, mere pottery sellers, but who are surrounded by swords, samurai, castles, wars and Japanese legends. They are mere pawns within a grand universe of Homeric conflicts. The disparity in social positions means that ordinary men aim to grow up, earn a lot of money, transform themselves into powerful warriors and have a high quality life by the standards of that period. (with armor I could be a samurai. Sword. Spear. Armor.)
Even though the film presents a character's desire to become a samurai or a great warrior, here permeates a criticism made by Mizoguchi: In one scene, he places the characters on a plane below the imperial warriors, as if they were superior beings and with great powers. It is all a debauchery and one of the ideas that the film permeates: Right after this scene, several of these soldiers go after a woman, in an attempt to cowardly rape her. It is the world of appearances prevailing over the bare reality. They are illusions and false daydreams. Showing a post-rape scene, we can again see the theatrical characteristics in the work of the director, with noh chorus gradually appearing as background music, representing the indigination and hatred of the violated character. film is largely responsible for the rape of his wife).
In another act, we see a metaphor for where arrogance and social ascension in the face of a universe overtaken by wars and hierarchies can become, with the film entering an almost dreamlike universe, with the tones of a classical opera and the mere artisan of pottery entering and inhabiting your deepest desires. The film does this with mastery, as if we were inside a strong and pulsating desire of someone with their outlines covered by dream costumes. Everything on the screen starts to be clean, with an atmosphere of calm music, light and heavenly tones, contrasting with the period of hunger and war in which Japan was, with its dark, opaque, oppressive and depressive tone. It is an allegory of ambition and desires at any cost (false reality) that goes agains the true reality.",4.0
"the fear I had with Ugetsu came to fruition: the overall theme of greed does hit hard, but not as hard as it must’ve back then. that’s not to say it wasn’t effective for me, the penultimate scene in which Genjuro realizes Miyagi has actually died (despite seemingly reuniting with her the night before) had me choked up. it’s a well-executed (maybe a poor choice of words there) and appropriately sad moment that wraps up his descent brought on by his rampant greed, and dalliance with Lady Wakasa. yet his story before that didn’t always land with me, for it greatly tested my suspension of disbelief given the whole romance-with-a-ghost aspect. really, it was the story of Tobei and Ohama that clicked with me, and I wish more screen time was dedicated to that pair rather than Genjuro and Wakasa. still, Ugetsu is great because while the overall theme didn’t quite carry the impact I was hoping for, it still does hit in more ways than not. greed, sexual desire, the ways in which men equate violence and conquest with success and power, these are all still relevant lenses to view the state of the world through. kinda sad to know how accurate the film displays the dark side of humanity when reflecting on the fact that Tobei and Genjuro saw the evils of war, of violence, first-hand and instead of deciding to be different, to advocate for a better world, they saw fit to join in on the chaos. a dog-eat-dog world, another way this one will always be relevant.
still very much looking forward to more Mizoguchi films.",4.0
"Not as engaging as Sansho the Bailiff but it has the political and other themes in common. I love how Mizoguchi deals with obsession, greed and the relationship between husband and wife. The middle part feels a little stretched out, it's not as strong as the opening and ending. The ending particularly elevated the movie for me, I didn't expect that to happen and it took me by surprise. It took my hope and crushed it.",3.5
"My second drama film from one of the giant filmmakers in cinema history, kenji Mizoguchi, Ugetsu (1953) is an extraordinarily essential brilliant cinematic piece of art that its right place, undoubtedly, is among the greatest films ever made; Ugetsu is also belongs to those films which called: too-ahead-of-its-time. Japanese cinema have made undeniable foundational films that left its impact goes as an endless inspiration for those films that came after, and which presented within so many films as an eternal references that provide the modren films with the real meaning of classic art, and left its influence spreading over all its backgrounds.
Ugetsu opens up with genuinely fundamental scene that becomes a honest material to the next events that came after, and became as a reminder to us when we watching the way that the story that showing us the obstacles and important problems on the main characters who spreaded throughout the film to demonstrates the substance of the story, and how their lives will become when each one of them facing a different problems that will made them learning a bunch of things, which are most important and more value than their desires, vanity, and arrogance towards each other. Ugetsu is a drama/fantasy/war film that follows a tale of ambition, family, Love, and war set in the midst of the japanese Civil Wars of the sixteenth century.
The film showcases a several pictures of the consequences of the pride, the wrong path to reach to your ambition, and the humanism and its importance towards the main characters, where each one of the them is developed slowly, and which made the film outcome is brilliance all around the sophisticated cinema thoroughly. The result of each character is also profoundly telling us a huge details of the impact that the events left on them, and how their thoughts towards their lives are changed influentially. The essence of Ugetsu is tremendously built through the masterfully thoughtful direction, brilliantly insightful screenplay, and the massively heartfelt performances from the main characters in particular.
There are some elements that I can not deny it for sure: the concept and its development that appeared the war and its ugliness on the humans and their ideology towards life and its temptations, the groundbreaking storytelling and its immense perspective that became inherently realistic, where the realism is jaw-dropping relentlessly. Ugetsu is geniusly depicted the human and its unforgiven intentions in fictional style that transformed the film to be more depth in its surface as well as that each cadre of the whole production is remarkably accomplished. The conclusion of Ugetsu is deeply letting us observe its majestic greatness, where its entire demonstration is imaginatively made it as an astounding exercise of meditation towards life and humanity.
Ugetsu is a picture of perfection!

"Again I find Mizoguchi's style suffocating and overly theatrical. Where Ozu fills his deliberate and still mis-en-scene with complex humanity - packing his interiors as densely as possible - Mizoguchi lets these characters explode out of the frame in caricature and bludgeoning social commentary. I just can't find it in me to care about these blatantly ridiculous portrayals of male ego because no person in this story feels remotely tied to reality. These are puppets, wielded for maximum action with no soul behind them. Some pretty imagery in here - especially that shot of the boat disappearing into the fog - doesn't make up for a lack of emotional insight.",2.0

"I'm currently (supposed to be) working on something related to folk tales, mythology and the wider significance of storytelling, so it was quite fortuitous that this was chosen as the inaugural film of *cough* 'Club Friendship' because it would have probably taken me forever to actually pull the trigger on watching it. And Ugestu is one of the most widely acclaimed examples of cine-folktale, if not filmmaking in general. I've also found myself urgently wanting to watch dozens of Japanese films over the last month. And yet, despite ticking those three boxes, I was left as cold and unengaged as could be, while still acknowledging the craft at hand.
It's an incredibly subdued and functional film, which on the one hand leans into the nature of folktale storytelling as a barebones structure, from which generations of orators will develop and deviate. This is quite literally the bones, a parable shot with such remove that cutting is minimal, and events happen at a measured distance. The historical context is similarly loaded with purpose, but only insofar as telling this specific version of the parable—it's very much translatable, and had it been made in the late 90s we'd no doubt have had a early 00s American remake starring a young blonde ex-TV favourite.
For all it's technical power and visual delight, Ugetsu is definitely a film which forces attention to the moral(ity) of its tale. And unfortunately here, it's both a victim and perpetuator of an unpleasant morality tale lineage, where reluctant female archetypes get dicked over because of the choices of stupid, shortsighted, foolhardy, arrogant, narcissistic, vainglorious men. The film deigned to only follow the men on their (relatively uneventful) adventures, to later return to find the women had endured far more significant hardships and death.",0.0

Lyrical and haunting, Mizoguchi never loses sight and purpose, while still grounding his story in its human element, even when his looming phantasmagorical angle, breathes its wicked afterlife deceptions solidly into it, almost representative of its once known movie title ""Tales of the pale and silvery moon after the rain"" - get a load of that!

It is beautifully framed in the classisist style, and some set-pieces are so striking visually, that they feel timeless in expression now, as we witness delusional dreams, finally come home to rest, as master Kenji Mizoguchi patiently pans, closes out, and fades to black once more, while putting his name-mark in the West for World Cinema forever back in the day, with a now classic work.",0.0

"L'umanità. Un Mizoguchi che entra a contatto con il fantastico, con il meraviglioso, designando un mondo profondamente viscerale e veritiero, grazie ad una straordinaria sensibilità con cui si racconta una storia di spettri, di ""fantasmi"" che sono quelli dettati senza dubbio dalla catastrofe nucleare di Hiroshima e Nagasaki, ancora alla ricerca di una propria coordinata per collocarsi all'interno di quel bellissimo posto chiamato mondo. ""Ugetsu"" è un racconto morale dolorosissimo ma infinitamente bello, che condanna a spada tratta l'avidità dell'uomo e la sua brama di possesso, in quanto queste ultime sono le cause principali della distruzione della persona.
Mizoguchi svilisce il desiderio e soprattutto crea una netta scissione tra uomo e donna. Il primo è completamente accecato dalla possibilità di guadagno e di monetizzare. La seconda pone sempre in primo piano l'integrità familiare rispetto al possibile successo economico. Questo, in qualche modo, dice che Mizoguchi consegna le chiavi del futuro nelle mani della donna, in quanto l'uomo è destinato a cavalcare i suoi illusori (e menzogneri) sogni di gloria e a nutrirsi della sua stessa avidità (che il giapponese identifica perfettamente nella figura di un fascinoso fantasma dalle fattezze di una principessa, simbolo di una felicità solamente apparente).
Dunque, accontentarsi di quello che si ha è la vera chiave per essere felici. Lo scarto definitivo, però, il regista giapponese lo segna in cabina di regia.
Assoluto, infatti, il ruolo che il regista regala alla sua macchina da presa. Quest'ultima, infatti, grazie ad una rara compostezza formale e a delle riprese piene di suggestioni visive, che le garantiscono un'eleganza e una leggerezza con pochi eguali, si trasforma. Non è più un semplice ""mezzo"" per riprendere la vita, ma diventa un luogo di accesso alla vita ricreata sullo schermo. Non è più una macchina/occhio, dunque, ma una macchina/soglia, uno strumento che permette il passaggio ""dall'altro lato"", che dona la possibilità allo spettatore di entrare, ""sfondare"" lo schermo e non solo di guardare semplicemente. Dunque a quel punto lo spettatore diventa attivo, in un cinema che è pressoché identificabile con la verità (basti vedere le due panoramiche che aprono e chiudono il film per capire) e che serve soprattutto per captare una realtà fantasmatica, perennemente rarefatta, suggestiva e minacciosa, ma quanto di più umano e profondo possa capitare.

"Ugetsu is an enchanting folk tale, crafted with cinematic deftness, and punctuated with a bone-chilling score.
And yet, despite the film's magical construction, I struggled to feel invested in the story it was telling. Ugetsu's premise is straightforward, relaying a simple tale of morality: beware the allure of success.
Witnessing a character's tragic downfall is typically enthralling; however, it helps to know the character who is set to suffer. The only descriptors for Ugetsu's characters are their vices. It would have been more effective if we could see their lives before their obsessions take hold. Then, perhaps, we could get a better sense of their devolution. As it stands though, it feels overly direct: ""bad men make bad choices, then bad things happen.""

"Really think that just the Genjuro/Miyagi plot, if separated from the rest of the film, would be top 15 of all time. The samurai story is too goofy to be tonally consistent with the visceral terror of the film’s greatest moments, but it also makes explicit what is already implicit in Genjuro’s storyline — sapping that of some of it’s power. The three actors who make up this story are pitch perfect, especially the sublime Kyo, while the lead actor who plays the samurai seems to be mugging for the camera. Not to mention the samurai’s story tapers out and moralizes near the end, while Genjuro’s comes to a twisty, horrifying, and ethereal finish. That’s the danger with anthologies! Still, I’d recommend this over a fair amount of my 9/10s thanks to its great moments being some of the great moments.",4.0
"First Mizoguchi film. The first 20 minutes are excellent in regards to establishing character and the main themes of greed and the dissolution of family life, but beyond that it really shifts into another gear. Every movement inside of Kutsuki Mansion left me in a trance, and on every level the film finds a way to unearth spiritual realities from tangible environments effortlessly. Hayasaka’s score feels like multiple elements on multiple planes, flowering in succession until they slowly coalesce into a shape of their own. It takes an already transcendent visual experience to another level, especially at that climactic moment when Lady Wakasa ""rises up"" in Kutsuki. You’ve gotta check out the bonus conversations with Masahiro Shinoda (Pale Flower) and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa in regards to this film. They both more or less speak to the power of cinema to turn a simple morality tale such as this into a spiritual experience through the use of perspective. Definitely need more Mizoguchi in my life.

"Kenji Mizoguchi is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers, and Ugetsu is probably duking it out with Sansho the Bailiff for my favorite of his films that I've seen so far. I think I might give the edge to that one, but Ugetsu is really a tremendous piece of humanism from an absolute master of humanist storytelling. His other films that I've seen have been an absolutely brutal display of heartbreaking tragedy, and there's plenty of that to go around here as well. In this one, however, most of the suffering isn't caused from outside influences. A lot of the horrific acts in Ugetsu are the result of some of our main characters. More specifically, this is really a movie about the greed and selfishness of men, and how their narcissism destroys the women who devote their lives to these men.
The women in Ugetsu are, as is customary during this period and in this culture, really beholden to their husbands, and those men think of themselves and nothing else, to the destruction of these women. It's a brutal display of a gender dichotomy that unfortunately translates plenty to today. It's also a story of the lenghts that humans will go in a time of war, the atrocities that human beings are capable of, and surprisingly, the resilience of the human spirit. Unlike some of his other work that I've seen, Mizoguchi even works in some ghostly developments here, a common occurrence in Japanese cinema at the time, and one that feels deeply unsettling nestled within the confines of a Mizoguchi movie, especially given that my history with him led me to believe that he was a filmmaker totally uninterested in that kind of subject matter. There's so many things going on here, and at its core is a heartbreaking duo of relationship arcs that teaches us one truth that lasts the test of time: men ain't shit.",4.5
"Beware of slow-moving, pale women with strange forehead splotches.
I believe the word most apt to describe this supernatural fable about 16th-century Japanese peasants is ""haunting."" The moral here is clear and simple, warning us away from the temptations of avarice, lest bad things happen to those we love after we abandon them. Hardly ground-breaking storytelling. But the filmmaking is of a higher level. The movie is a wonderful example of how music, even just sound -- persistently mysterious and ethereal -- can establish and then maintain a mood.

"My Personal Criterion Task: Film 21/100
Criterion Spine: #309
Oh man, indigestion is killing me right now. It's been a thing I've been dealing with off and on all summer, to the point that I've nixed spicy things like jalapenos from my diet and have to keep Gaviscon around (which only works about half the time, but that's a higher success rate than anything else I've tried). Frankly, this has nothing to do with Ugetsu, but I did want y'all to know that if this review sucks, it's because I'm thinking a whole lot more about pain and belching than I am the 97 haunting minutes that passed by my eyes.
Ugetsu follows two men as they attempt to eke out a living in a poor village. Despite the protests of their wives, they decided to go to a city to peddle their homemade pottery--a decision that affects all of them when one chases a dream and the other chases a ghost.
Summaries for this film focus pretty heavily on the supernatural aspect, but there's a lot going on here. The early tensions are dictated by war and soldiers using small towns as their own personal snot rag. Then we have the two wives and how they're constantly ignored by their husbands. Throw in some delightfully ominous filming and things get tense long before ghosts show up.",4.0
"An entrancing meditation on from rags to riches, romance and supernatural beings (it being based on a Japanese folktale), Mizoguchi takes on supernatural romance by blending bleak realism of 16th century war with eerie supernatural visuals of the beautiful, enchanting Lady Wasaka. He does it so naturally, that the thin line between reality and dream or metaphysics is torn asunder, creating a feverish masterpiece.
The plot entails of two poor men; Genjūrō and Tōbei who live in a communal village, during a war, with wives and (in Genjūrō's case) a kid. Both men leave their wives in hopes of seeking their desires; Genjūrō desires wealth whereas Tōbei wishes to serve his land as samurai, much to their beloveds' dismay, despite many obstacles. They go and sell pottery where Genjūrō is attracted by the eerie and ghostlike charm of Lady Wasaka.
The visuals and the sound design really help with the surroundings of the film, creating subtle atmospheres, we first see Lady Wasaka be silent and with white robes until luring Genjūrō to the palace. And hear a ghostly orchestral soundtrack, and see a detail on candlelights, her eyebrowless face, and a harsh difference between light and dark. She, being wealthy, creates another desire for Genjūrō. The transitions with long takes make the film flow so beautifully, with careful camerawork and attention to mist and water. The boat scenes and the exterior scenes with Genjūrō and Wasaka are particularly scenes that left me with an everlasting impression.
With a few possible exceptions (if even that), I have never felt so mesmerised by a supernatural film, especially one where reality and unreality are key figures within a film, Mizoguchi understood how it was done, sign of a master. Ugetsu is often paired as a trio (if that's the right word) of acclaimed Japanese films within 1953 and 1954 Seven Samurai and Tokyo Story, made by Kurosawa and Ozu, and this is my favourite and Mizoguchi is, to me, the most captivating director of the retrospective country and era so far. Anyone interested in delving into that part of world cinema will be greatly rewarded. As I have bought it on a duo Masters of Cinema set with Oyū Sama, I highly look forward to seeing more of Mizoguchi.",5.0
Genichi deserves better,4.5
"After being blown away by Sansho the Bailiff, I was expecting great things from Ugetsu. Kenji Mizoguchi is a filmmaker I had never heard of but watching films films now is only making me realize more and more how impressive classic Japanese cinema is.
I could definitely see the film was building up to be a cautionary tale about the lures of war and the cost of excessive greed but I certainly didn't think I would get a ghost story. I've seen a few great period drama films from Japan and I've loved the approach to ghost stories for the time but I haven't seen that blended so well with feudal Japan. All the signs were there really. The cinematography helped to get this across as well as creating a mood that made me feel as though the story I was seeing wasn't quite real. It had an eerie and otherworldly presence to it. Add on to that the score and the transition from a war film to a ghost story was incredibly smooth.
One of the things that stood out to me in regards to the story was how different the approach to telling a cautionary tale is with a lot of films. Usually characters' egos, pride, selfishness or their inability to make the right choice at key moments end up costing them far too much. In Ugetsu, the two main men are given ample chances to reevaluate what is most precious to them. Each warning from their wives ignored, it felt as though they tempted fate.
The film doesn't feel like it's critiquing just how damaging war is to the innocents, it seems as though Mizoguchi is also critical of the priorities of men who should be against war. As a character says in the film, the profits made during war do not generally last. It's been said for centuries that war changes men but greed does the same. The combination of both will rarely end in anything but disaster.
It's difficult to watch women suffer and be punished simply for looking out for their husbands and that is made all the more frustrating when the men are anything but committed to their roles.
Ugetsu is a damn fine film. The gradual change in the tone and mood of the film is very effective. The way people are used and discarded feels painfully real. The performances enhance the story with Machiko Kyo delivering a stand out, hypnotic and terrifying in equal performance as Lady Wakasa. It's surprisingly how much the film accomplishes in just over 90 minutes. Another stellar production from Japan.",4.5

"Added to: Sight and Sound Greatest Films
Added to: Kenji Mizoguchi, Ranked
Ugetsu has been praised as the masterpiece of Japanese cinema ever since it was released and won the Silver Lion Award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival, and alongside with Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950), it's the film accounted for drawing the international spotlight to the post-WWII Japanese cinema. As highly regarded as it has always been, regrettably to say, it's not my favorite film by Mizoguchi. I do hugely admire the film's mystical ambiance, the fable-structured ghost story, the abiding theme of women's sacrifice for the success (or non-success) of the ineffectual men, and above all, the flowing camera work and the impeccable art direction. However, it does not strike me as poignant and competent as The Life of Oharu (1952) or Sansho the Bailiff (1954) with the latter as my favourite. Still Ugetsu elegantly blends the lyricism of ghost story and the realism of world cruelty, and Mizoguchi filmed it exquisitely as a scroll painting and read it like a poetry.
The film itself is inspired or loosely adapted from three short stories, two from the ""Tales of Moonlight and Rain"", a Japanese collection of nine mystery stories written by by Akinari Ueda in 1776, while the last one originated from the Guy de Maupassant's ""How He Got the Legion of Honour"". The western idea is transposed seamlessly into the eastern mythology, yet Ugetsu is still discernible as its two separate narrative threads. The story takes place in Omi Province during the civil war in the 16th century Japan. Two families are immediately introduced after a panning shot of the provincial field with firing gun shot barely audible in the background. Potter Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) is preparing to leave his wife Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) and their young son for selling his pottery works in the city, an attempt to gain profits during wartime. Tobei (Sakae Ozawa), Genjuro's neighbour and his brother-in-law, rashes out from the house and, against his wife Ohama's (Mitsuko Mito) desperate objection, request to go along into the city in contemplation of being a samurai. Genjuro shortly returns with an alluring sum of money whereas Tobei reemerges like a beggar after failed to be a samurai since he has no amour nor spear.
Ugetsu foregrounds the obsessive desire of human, mainly men, for success and prosperity, thereby their behaviour be driven by their own pride. Tobei, a comical and almost pitiful character, has been living in his own dream of fantasy. The war's brutality exacting on the villagers (men are seized, women are raped, house is ransacked) and, most importantly, the existence of his own wife are overshadowed by his aspiration to fame. Indeed with a twist of fate and dumb luck, he grasps the opportunity and eventually accomplishes his goal, yet upon reuniting with Ohama unexpectedly in a brothel, he realises the cost Ohama paid in exchange for his success. The origin of Tobei is developed from the protagonist in Guy de Maupassant's novel who has longed for a medal, yet the story followed is completely different. Mizoguchi and screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda had to adopt a happier ending for Tobei's story as demanded by the studio, indeed the poignancy is hugely reduced after a sort of reconciliation at the very end.
In contrary, Genjuro's story is more heart-rending in the form of tragedy, and it's this part of story that features ghostly appearance which superlatively render the realistic tone with an additional sense of mythical. Genjuro, after tasting the wealth brought by selling his pottery, immediately engrosses himself in the handiwork even under the threat of the incoming Shibata's army. Genjuro's works are miraculously undamaged in the kiln on the night of the army's attack. Thereafter, together with all the goods and his own and Tobei's family, they resort to a boat for transportation across the Lake Biwa into the city. The foggy scene of the rowing boat in the Lake, meticulously staged and structured with a sense of eeriness, is the superb example of utilising the artificiality in studio shooting to create the out of the world ambiance. In fact it subtly foreshadows the succeeding appearance of the ghost of Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo), who subdues Genjuro with her appearance and flattery on his pottery.
Arguably Lady Wakasa is the ""antagonist"" of the film, she offers prosperity and pleasure which Genjuro irresistibly falls for, and easily we can categorie her as the ""bad/evil"" ghost. But paradoxically, she's also the victim of war invoked by men's greediness for power. Her clan, alongside with the Kutsuki mansion where Genjuro spending the time with her (or as he thinks he is), are killed and destroyed before she knew what love is. She, like Miyagi and Ohama, are women sacrifice. The appearance of Lady Wakasa, including the costumes, her make-up and facial expression, recalls the traditional noh play. As a matter of fact, the Kutsuki mansion is staged, lighted and shot like a noh stage. Fumio Hayasaka's music interweaves the noh flute and percussive sound to underscore the scenes. Magnificently and intimidatingly portrayed by Machiko Kyo, Lady Wakasa is simultaneously daunting and sympathetic. But the spectators' compassion is undeniably clung to the dedicated mother Miyagi who, after being robbed by the soldiers for food, would only reappear in the ending when the prodigal husband returns home.
The scene starts with Genjuro entering the unilluminated, abandoned house searching for his wife and son, the camera continues to follow him going out the back door and going back to the entrance in one shot with only slight panning, and suddenly we realise Miyagi is sitting inside the house, which is empty a few seconds ago, and preparing food for her husban. Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is without a doubt superlative in motion and framing. With the utilisation of the camera movement and staging, we immediately understand the nature of Miyagi's appearance. Being the opposite of Lady Wakasa, she is the ""good"" ghost as she remains to protect her family. Miyagi's voice, audible as a soliloquy, would be lastly heard over the images of the reformed, honestly working husband and the Tobei's family, as well as her own grave, in which she expresses happiness as well as regret on the final outcome. Ugetsu is mesmerizing in its poetic illustration by the craftsmanship of Mizoguchi, one may find the art of Genjuro's pottery alludes to the filmmaking, perhaps it's an intentional metaphor as women sacrificing for men's pursuit of arts, you know Mizoguchi understands deeply of women ever after he was stabbed by one in the back, literally.",4.5
Like Ghost but with even more pottery.,0.0
"Antes de mais nada é preciso ser evidenciado que a narrativa não pode ser confudida com a historinha de um fime, pois a narrativa é pautada no ""como contar"".
Nesse sentido, nos deparamos com a narrtiva do Mizoguchi, a qual é marcada por uma profunda exploração das emoções humanas, e no caso específico de Ugetsu nos deparamos com uma pespectiva feminista na medida em que é exposto a resiliência, a ação e a luta feminina pela autonomia dentro de uma sociedade patriarcal, nesse caso de uma sociedade Japonesa do século XVII, haja vista quando em determinado momento dessa película uma das personagens femininas diz com muita revolta: ""Sua esposa pode estar na sarjeta, mas seu sucesso compensa tudo""; isso faz com que o homem se compadeça e mude de comportamento.
Ademais, é fascinante como o Mizoguchi torna essa obra carregada de uma poesia de saltar os olhos, muito devido a quadros meticulosamente compostos, aliada a uma atenção à iluminação e à sombra, e tudo isso envolto da combinação entre o realismo e elementos sobrenaturais, apresentando sequências oníricas para explorar temas metafísicos profundos, em específico aqui o tema de uma sociedade patriarcal a qual não possibilita ou possibilitou as mulheres receberem um amor verdadeiro por parte do homem.

"Spooky season viewings #10
Decided to start watching my favorite films of all time from the top of my list and Ugetsu was first although there are many films that I could rightfully call my favorite of all time. Recently on a bar night, I got asked about my favorite film by a stranger and drunkenly I started to explain about Ugetsu which turned out to be quite a difficult task. For me, the essence is in the film's depiction of war and greed, how they are intertwined, and how people try to do anything to get out of their misery which might also contain their great happiness. This is not to say that poor people or people with bigger problems than themselves are in any way in a good position or that poverty sanctifies them. It's just that trying to find happiness through material gain will always lead only to short, passing happiness.
As Ugetsu demonstrates, life is more than our achievements and it's longer, there are no shortcuts and bliss never lasts. The symmetrical opening and beginning shots frame the whole story as a brief episode because they indicate that life continues beyond this story, just like Mizoguchi's action often extends beyond the frame itself (brilliantly illustrated by Robin Wood in his essay ""Mizoguchi: The Ghost Princess and the Seaweed Gatherer""). This is a film about human limitations and weaknesses but it's also made by a filmmaker who clearly sees the relationship between cinema and life, thus also understanding that a director must take advantage of the human limitations of cinema (viewer's experience of time and space) to express the holistic experience of human life truthfully.
This is one of the greatest examples of film in which mise-en-scène makes visible within its gestures more ontological truths about human existence. It's filled with shots and compositions that are aware of themselves and what kind of ideas about the world and existence they communicate. For example, the powerful scene in which Genjurô visits a shop and dreams about his wife in a kimono. Is there a more heartbreaking shot than the one that at first immerses us in a dream as if dreams moved the world only to reveal that it's a pov shot from Genjurô's perspective? These shots always return to the naked truth eventually. Cinema can show us the dream but it must never sway from the truth.",5.0
"Unsettling depiction of war, greed, lust and obsession. Ugetsu Monogatari is more than just a supernatural tales, it's a bleak Japanese Civil War drama with some realistic heartbreaking moments. Ugetsu really feels like a time machine, sometime I forget that I'm watching a movie. The score and sound design was wicked too, that's shit really creepy!",4.0
"Fantastic is what you see but you don’t understand. Or, better, what you see and, even noticing there’s something strange going on, you still are not sure if it needs to be explained or it’s all perfectly natural. This factory of images named Ugetsu is a haunting circumspection of this concept.
When Genjuro comes back to his village, at the end of the movie, the camera pans to the left from the main door of the empty shack, following Genjuro that’s searching for Miyagi. When the camera pans again on the main door, back right, Miyagi is there, the location has changed, the scene has been transformed. This single intuition could be enough to make Ugetsu one of the greatest earthquakes in history of Cinema. The space revolting to its own normal law, trading place with the impossible. To see the impossible, and can’t even notice that. Something that other authors would have made with a similar consciousness just decades later.
Ugetsu is a perennial challenge to the impossible. The use of music, combined with cross fading pans to step into other sides of the plot, is the expression of that absolute balance Mizoguchi reached out in the 50s. A balance that has not forgotten the invisible rules of the ‘distant mélo’, but likes to play with the Occidental stuff from Yuki and Oyu. So, lightshadowing, contextual shots and so on. But, and this is the greatest effort of this movie  (the property that gives it all its magical texture), the usual mizoguchian decentralization of the drama is obtained right with those very tools.
Take for example the sing scene performed by Lady Wakasa. The entire sequence is a combination of close ups, camera movements, depth of field. But where is the center of the drama here? It’s a trance, the action has not vectors, has not direction. This center could be the dancing and singing, as a contemplation of pure beauty, but we know from the beginning that the situation is strange and not relaxing: Genjuro looks like he forgot everything of his past life, and he’s ready to get lost in the mysterious beauty of Lady Wakasa. So, maybe the dancing and the singing are their own antithesis: we should be afraid of those. It could be, it’s very difficult to be honestly - Machiko Kyo is astounding, the camera work is over perfection - but the point is not that. The ghost music of something else breaks in the singing - other instruments pop up - in the dancing - Wakasa’s movements become doubtful - in the camera work itself. All the magical mutual delusion that moves the scene, in which Wakasa makes Genjuro watch her in a strange aura of power (nearly sure of his love) and Genjuro enjoys the scene in a distracted way (he’s eating and drinking as he was in a geisha local), blew up when the even more uncanny sound comes in. Machiko Kyo stops. She’s still in the center of the scene, but she’s totally turned towards left, she’s just listening, the sight is lost. Genjuro is out of field, so we really don’t know where he is watching. So we assist to the failure of a character which was in a delusional control on her own, and which was the less suitable one for the viewer’s identification. The uncanny increases. We don’t know the reason of these things, we don’t know the source of the drama. We were lost before, between the two delusional characters, but now we are doubly lost. The scene has blown up, for some second. After that, the camera pans. It avoids to take Genjuro, that stays out of field. The scene becomes the close up of a samurai helmet. We are lost, definitively. What’s happening?
We could go on. All the movie is about this kind of decentralization, of actual addition of layers to make the scene the less intuitive as it can get. This is the uncanny but first of all this is the fantastic. Seeing a movie where we don’t know what we should see.
The way these things happen all along the movie, also in its most unsuspected moments, is really magic. Even the realistic escape by boat, which hasn’t - at least apparently - nothing fantastic, is totally subjected to that texture. Even when Genjuro and Miyagi say goodbye, with that dollying shot/countershot caused by the movement of the boat, and the Miyagi’s attempt to follow that rhythm, is a technical artifice (Miyagi’s subjective is still in its place, it’s not walking at all, it’s a pan on the place) which is absolutely mesmerizing for the way it explains the power of a lie, and the uncanny of an unexplainable reality.",5.0
"Is there any actress in film history as beautiful and enchanting as Machiko Kyo?

"Much like “the misty moon after rainfall”, the lines between the dead and the living are blurred amidst the chaos of war. Memories and dreams are inhabited by ghosts of the deceased. The abrupt transition from dreams to reality is followed by feelings of regret and longing for the warmth of loved ones who have departed. In spite of these intoxicating delusions, Mizoguchi ultimately echoes the age-old adage that the individual must persevere. Regardless of the surrounding mayhem during which it is easy to be engulfed by the spectres of the past, true salvation is found in reality. As Jay-Z raps “If through our travels we get separated, never forget, In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets.” It is only when the characters muster the willpower to snap out of the hauntingly beautiful dream sequences, that they find relief. 
Mizoguchi does a magnificent job when it comes to the geography of this film. The city of Nagahama can be perceived as the “zone” from Tarkovsky’s (who cites this as being among his top 10 favourite movies) Stalker. A place where reality is bent and people travel to fulfill their innermost desires. Whereas in Tarkovsky’s more industrial world, the zone is reached by railcar, the city of Nagahama in Ugetsu requires crossing the treacherous Lake Biwa by boat. The journey across the fog covered lake is perhaps the most gorgeous scene in a film that has no shortage of them.  
The film effectively comes full circle by ending where it started. And yet the way this location is depicted is not the same. The village which at the beginning was hounded by the sounds of distant battle, signalling impending doom, is now serene. Our characters are not the same either after their realization that avarice and destructive ambition must be discarded in order for the soul to truly be at peace.",4.5

"There is not much I can say about this film. I think it is near perfect in every aspect. It tells a great story, both captivating emotionally and thrilling. It is also a rather beautiful film, especially showing it's prowess towards the end of the film. It tells a classically influenced tale and it does so marvelously. With pacing that reminds me somewhat of that of Claire's Knee in almost separate episodes that build on each other. In this way we are told about greed and selfishness as implications of war on the human psyche and spirit. It is a relentless and timeless tale. The film seems to meet the criteria for a Japanese Golden age jidaigeki classic, but what really elevates it above and beyond is the sound design. It is so impressionistic and so visceral in a way that could not have been matched by Golden Age classics elsewhere. But of course, as my rating suggests, there is something keeping me from giving it 5 stars and that is the script. I obviously have to be careful here (something might have been lost in translation), but I believe the writing, especially in the beginning, is kind of sloppy. I mean it's nowhere near delicate and just really clumsy and awkward. This isn't enough for me to demote this to anything less than a classic though. Definitely worth a watch or two.",4.5
"Yes, it's my first-ever Mizoguichi--let the incredulity rain down, I can take it--and sure not to be my last. I still struggle with the acting style I associate with several Kurosawa films, in which characters repeatedly are physically staggered by horrible events; clearly it's something cultural, and maybe a taste I'll acquire. But otherwise it's a truly gorgeous morality play, practically a Greatest Hits montage of succumbing to the Seven Deadly Sins. And I'm getting chills just thinking about the way Mizoguchi shifts the look and pace of the story when supernatural or near-supernatural elements are at play: the encounter on the lake; Lady Wakasa's dance; Miyagi's mending as the light begins to filter through the cracks. Maybe the 1953 audience would have seen it more obviously and simply as directed at Japan's recent history, and the foolish notion that one can profit from a time of war without consequences. But it feels like something that applies much more broadly to the worldly ambitions that pull us, tragically and maybe inevitably, from the happiness right in front of us.",4.5

"Poucos filmes conseguem trabalhar o sobrenatural dessa forma. A exuberância e o realismo mágico do Mizoguchi impõem o fantástico com naturalidade em meio a esse Japão medieval desolado pela guerra. A passagem do real ao fantástico acontece com a maior naturalidade do mundo. Toda a magia se entranha quase que por imposição e com grande simplicidade.
O trabalho de câmera do Mizoguchi cria um excepcional trabalho de sugestão em que mais de 2 mundos podem coexistir em uma mesma cena(O mundo material e o fantasmagórico). A cinematografia cristalina e transparente faz o filme atingir um ápice transcendental fazendo esses 2 mundos se complementarem. É como se eles se refletissem em um espelho.
A Machiko kiyō como lady wasaka entrega uma das maia marcantes atuações do cinema japonês e também serve pra reforçar toda essa força cosmológica do filme. A sultileza de seus movimentos e a forma devagar como a mesma abaixa e se levanta acabam hipnotizando o espectador e dão a personagem um tom fantasmagórico que é impossível de desviar o olhar(A cena da possessão me assustou mais que qualquer filme de terror moderno).
O filme também acaba exaltando a noção budista de desapego. A partir desta perspectiva, os problemas que encontramos neste mundo são devidos aos apegos que desenvolvemos em relação às coisas e seres que encontramos no mundo. A maneira budista, como eu a entendo, é evitar tais apegos. Isso não significa que a pessoa deva se desvencilhar; significa que devemos evitar um sentimento pessoal de ganância em relação a tudo o que encontramos no mundo. Isso pode levar a uma sensação ainda mais rica de envolvimento total. Genjuro e Tobei partiram para realizar seus sonhos de glória, riqueza e honra. Neste sentido procuram atingir os mais elevados estados de satisfação estética. Mas, no final, eles descobrem que seu melhor curso de ação teria sido aderir a atividades mais humildes e morais (ou seja, levando em consideração as necessidades e sentimentos dos outros).",4.5
"TALES OF THE PALE MOON
(from Cahiers No. 81, Mars 1958, Mizoguchi retrospective)
Drawn from two 16th-century Japanese folk tales. War exposes a family of villagers to the temptation of adventure. While his brother-in-law wishes to try his hand at the profession of arms, Genjuro, who came to the city to sell his pottery, is seduced by the ghost of Princess Wasaka. In the end, once the enchantment is dispelled, he will return to his home. There he will only find the ghost of his wife, killed by soldiers during his absence, who exhorts him to continue his daily task. His sister and brother-in-law, having become, one a prostitute, the other a samurai, have also understood that happiness lies in their homeland, not in vain illusions.
From the outset, it adopts the tone of a masterpiece. Mizoguchi's masterpiece, a masterpiece of Japanese cinema, one of the most beautiful films in the history of cinema. It is a sum where the most opposing trends of art, its most diverse sources of inspiration converge and add up. It is only possible to speak of it by enumeration: from any point of view, it is simultaneously this and that, and something more still: their reconciliation. It is at once the Greek myth of the Odyssey and the Celtic legend of Lancelot, one of the most beautiful poems of adventure and mad love, one of the most fervent songs ever composed in honor of renunciation and fidelity, a hymn to Unity, as well as to the diversity of appearances. It is a fairy tale, treated with such meticulous realism that it can be said that the Middle Ages had never been properly evoked on screen before. In it, the taste for hieraticism, inherent to the arts of the East, and this thirst for novelty, this disrespect for all imposed form, which may be considered as a privilege of the West, are reconciled. Conceived as a Kammerspiel, it leaves no room for the staff, in both the literal and figurative sense of the term. The camera, sensitive to the slightest granulations of matter, lingers on waters and reeds, female hair or ornaments, with a lazy pleasure that in no way hinders the decision of brief camera movements through which man and nature see their fate continually linked. The gestures are free, lively; the pace provides the basic tempo. The gazes, themselves, do not shy away here, with the ordinary modesty of Japanese films... And so on. As soon as the names of the Dawn and the Fioretti have been mentioned, this double approximation pushes us to inventory endless beauties.
Even more than on its intrinsic value among the work of a very great filmmaker, let us therefore insist on the significance that this film holds for us Westerners. It is the point of coincidence of two universes, two moralities, two aesthetics, two esotericisms, which, through the intermediary of a form of art fond of universality, are revealed to us at their highest point of culmination, infinitely closer than we thought, even since Van Gogh.
This film, the most Japanese of Japanese films, is at the same time the one that requires the least effort of adaptation from the European viewer: by the time the word 'end' appears, it is hard to believe that an hour and a half has passed. No Parisian theater has yet deigned to include it in its program.

"A parable championing a quiet life of family and honest work, warning against the blinding power of unchecked ambition, Genjuro and Tobei drawn to the riches and 'glory' to be found in the spoils of war, like carrion birds to a battlefield, in the process forsaking what really matters and turning the silver and armor and spear into ash and rubble like their once-idyllic home.
Humans are pitiable things, though, and these characters are very human.
Has a great spooky supernatural element/ ghost story and a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere that grows and grows. A gorgeous tragedy with haunting music and lovely, impressive cinematography. Seriously the music is off the fuckin chain.

"One of my favorite movies, perhaps my single favorite Japanese film.
This was my first rewatch since probably 2016. And my first time ever seeing it in HD. The Criterion Blu-ray (I just upgraded from the DVD) is divine. 
I vividly remember seeing this movie for the first time on VHS when I was a teenager, I think my first year of undergrad, for a Japanese literature and cinema class. It was unlike anything I had ever seen, and remains so 20+ years later. A brutally bleak portrait of war, greed, and ambition, and a strange, foreboding, unsettlingly beautiful ghost tale. Ugetsu has no peer. 
Exquisite vibes. One of the best scores in the history of cinema (full disclosure: nearly all of my favorite film scores are from Japanese films from the 50s and 60s). The ominous music perfectly intertwined with spectral imagery. An unholy midpoint between Gothic and Noh aesthetics. The crumbling buildings, the barren trees, the drifting walls of fog. The scene on the boat is a masterpiece, truly one of my favorite pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid.
It's hard not to see this as a film about Japan and World War II, yet it also seems to be a much broader vision of human folly, and I think plays just as easily as a metaphor for postwar Japan and the era in which it was made. 
The cinematography and visual design are peak classic cinema. So many immaculately designed shots filled with moving people and moving camera. It's not just the individual shots that are impressive, but the way they are presented together to build a unified aesthetic of perfectly balanced movement and stillness.  
The film has a unified, coherent visual design that marries to all other aspects of its aesthetic to create a world that is at once brutally realistic and delicately ethereal.
As much as I can intellectualize and explain the things I find so brilliant and beautiful about this film, there is something at the core of it I can't quite articulate that makes it so incredibly timeless, which is the mesmerizing effect it has on me and the emotional connection it creates from the first second to the last.",5.0

"Success always comes with a price in suffering.
Why to Watch: Coming to the end of my 2023 Asian Cinema Challenge, I am trying to squeeze in some all-timers. In addition to featuring on the Sight and Sound list, Letterboxd's Top 250 list and 1001 Films to See Before You Die, this 1953 Japanese samurai-adjacent morality tale is also one of Martin Scorese's favorite films. Streaming on Max, Criterion Channel, Tubi and Kanopy.
How It Went: In a war-torn land, a pair of neighbors dream of riches and glory, while their wives do everything in their power to convince their husbands to be happy with what they have. It starts as a fraught allegory about imperiling a modest but happy existence by overreaching your own aspirations. But it makes a turn about halfway in, transforming into a haunting tale of regret and longing, wherein the illusory and the spiritual are allowed to take center stage. It's a special film, certainly worthy of its inclusion in so many ""best of"" lists. It does feel a bit slight at times, but it's a story that definitely sticks with you.
Summing Up: Recommended",4.0
"Ugetsu imperishably crafts a ghostly fable of wartime greed as two selfish individuals risk the suffering of their families to pursue warped ambitions and oppressive obsessions, in Mizoguchi's unearthly cautionary tale which cinematically weaves wispy waters with alluring apparitions - echoing eerie noises from the mysterious afterlife to corrupt the living - though ceramically solidifying Akinari's original themes perhaps too heavily.
Tainted temptresses, ambitious ambivalence, samurais in the Sengoku period and clay ceramics. Oh yes, this is 50s Japanese cinema. Classic cinematic storytelling in the same pedigree of Shindo and Kurosawa of a moral tale through the distorted eyes of man. What Mizoguchi does here is elevate two fairly straightforward albeit timeless stories from Akinari's book by just being the pure masterful director that he is. The landscape shots, the shadowed lighting, the slow panning through Kutsuki manor and then highlighting the astral beauty of Lady Wakasa (who is incredibly haunting). The unfortunate suffering of the wives contrasting the slow descent into chaos of the husbands is just emphatically powerful. Sure the screenplay itself is heavy-handed at the best of times, particularly towards the end where the moral of the story is narrated multiple times, but it never detracts from the haunting beauty of Miyagawa's cinematography. Just gorgeous.",4.0

"Of the three credited composers, I’m not sure who is responsible for the avant-garde horns, but great choice! This presents a conniving front of comfort and softness, only to explode into moments that predate the mania of something like Matsumoto’s Demons. No country does ghost stories quite like Japan.",4.0
"So Kenji Mizoguchi has gone from a director I had never heard of (which admittedly is poor on my part) to a director I admire greatly. After watching Sansho The Bailiff, I assumed that would be his magnum opus. And even though that movie is fantastic, I think Ugetsu is actually even better. 
The two things that I love the most about Kenji Mizoguchi is one, how much he is able to fit into his movies (which out of the two movies I have seen from him have not been long in the slightest) without them feeling messy or lacking emotion. Ugetsu especially deliverers such a rich and well crafted story that presents its ideas and themes so thoughtfully and flawlessly. The second aspect I love the most towards his films so far have been his honest depictions of the chosen events he’s decided to portray. He doesn’t shy away from showing the brutal side to humanity, especially when looking at when these movies are set. He presents these sometimes harsh events with such importance to the overall narrative that it makes their weight and significance even more impactful especially by the end of the film. 
This movie looks absolutely stunning. Too think that this film was made in 1953 is honestly insane. The camera movement on display is incredibly dynamic and free flowing. The framing of many shots is masterfully done and the depth to many scenes really adds to the world building. I loved the use of fog in many of the scenes. Aesthetically, this movie is just a joy to behold. 
Again, many films of this time period seem to have very similar sounding scores but Ugetsu again stands out with a very unique sounding soundtrack. It really helped the tone of the movie and added to the very poignant atmosphere. Also, certain aspects of the sound design also reminded me in ways of how Tarkovsky used sound which in of itself is a huge credit to the film. 
One of the reasons I prefer this movie to Sansho is because I really got a lot out of the characters. I much prefer our lead in this as his story arc felt more complex along with his wannabe samurai friend. These two really helped bring the themes of the movie together in a satisfying and emotional way. 
The story is consistently moving except for a tiny scene in the middle of the film but on a rewatch that’s probably not going to even be a problem. There is so much to unpack with this movie and it’s plot twists worked amazingly well every single time. 
Honestly, this movie was fantastic. I loved it a lot and am going to be thinking about it for a while. I am super impressed by Kenji Mizoguchi as he is a clearly amazing director even after only seeing two of his films. Would recommend this movie to everyone!",4.5

Review: wp.me/pat7iE-2zo",5.0
"Mizoguchi has a real talent in creating an atmosphere. Just like Sansho Dayu, Ugetsu Monogatari is also based on a folktale from feudal Japan. The long takes, the music, the mise-en-scene all create an ambience that's hard to remove eyes from. Mizoguchi's talent at telling stories is unparalleled, truly. No other director could have told this tale as beautifully.
Ugetsu is a reflection on the blinding nature of excess ambition. When ""ends justify the means"" slowly corrodes into means rendering the ends meaningless. Both the protagonists got transfixed by the power of their ambitions. The shine of possible achievements captured their full attention as they lost sight of the rest of their world crumbling around them. And they end up paying dearly, as they realize that what they'd hoped for was not what they'd envisioned it to be, and that the price paid to achieve that goal far far outweighed the accomplishment.
But above all, this film is a masterclass in filmmaking. The acting could have been better imo, but okay enough, given the folktale nature of the film. I prefer Sansho over this, but this is a brilliant, brilliant film too.",4.5

"I read that this was a ghost story. It struck me as more of a parable. It’s gentle even when depicting brutality and scariest for nailing something true about male behavior rather than for anything supernatural. 
Similarly, the lake sequence is more haunting than the scenes with ghosts. The boats seem to materialize from the fog, like vapor becoming solids, and Mizoguchi clearly gets that soldiers are the more formidable threat. 
The sound design floored me. There’s music through most of it, but quietly backgrounded. At a couple of points, it’s just one drum, like a heartbeat. In another scene, it’s deadly silent except for an otherworldly cry from a child. 
The main four cast members are all excellent, but Kinuyo Tanaka stood out for me. I’ll always gravitate to the actress playing a tough woman in a situation that may well be even tougher.",4.0
"Ugetsu is a story about two couples living in a village that gets overtaken by soldiers who ransack everything, take the men to be their servants or soldiers and rape the women. The two couples get out before being found, but fate separates them and they all go on to have their own stories.
Genjurô's solo adventure winds up being a ghost story, but I didn't realize it until I was too deep into the story to bail and come back to it in October. Tobei's was more comedic as he tried to find armor and a spear so he'd be taken into a samurai clan.",4.0
"During the Japanese Civil Wars of the 16th century, two men seek to overcome the circumstances and lead successful lives; one as a pottery merchant, the other as a samurai warrior. They’re willing to go to great lengths to succeed, but the long-term cost may be too much...
I’ve been watching this movie for three days now; I’m somewhat notorious for my proclivity of falling asleep during movies, regardless of quality (just ask my podcast cohosts), and this one proved to be especially difficult for me to finish in one sitting. Even though it’s not very long, it’s methodical and meditative, and actually somewhat uneventful. It’s also great. I’ve never seen anything by Mizoguchi before, so I thought this might be a good place to start, and I’m glad I did. It’s a fantastic representation of how war affects people on an individual basis without ever displaying any visceral action or combat. There are certain period pieces that expect the viewer to have some working knowledge of the era, but this is not one of those (although I imagine having that knowledge would shed light on even deeper subtexts).
It’s also an interesting allegorical story of how ambition can lead to downfall, and the big, pivotal moments never feel forced or conventional. There are a lot of great movies about a slow descent from success to failure (Greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, There Will Be Blood, etc.), but this one is infused with so much minimalism, culture, and confidence that I don’t mind the somewhat familiar plot points. It takes a seemingly wrote idea (overambition leading to eventual loss) and transcends it by incorporating interesting ideas and concepts having to do with honor and spirituality that I couldn’t get enough of.
Ugetsu is often cited as one of the better films ever made, and I can’t say I have too much objection to that. I’m really excited to see what else Mizoguchi has to offer in the (hopefully) near future, just so long as I’m fully conscious next time. If anything I said sounded interesting to you, I’d definitely recommend watching it, even if you’re unfamiliar with the genre or time period. It might not be your style, but I can almost guarantee you’ll get something out of it.",4.0

Everyone endures temptation in their lives. It's an unavoidable force of destruction and causes doubt in even the most earnest and studious of men or women; significant others cheat on their beloved partners in favor for a brief moment of infatuation and relentless passion or others are swept up in various objects or activities that prove to have a seductive aura to them (pornography, drugs, and alcohol, just to name a few) and find that their attempts at escaping their addictions are primarily difficult and sometimes even impossible to accomplish. In the wake of the decaying life you've now grown to hate, lies the shadows of your past; a simpler, easier time, where life was more meaningful and things seemed more enjoyable to do. In Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu, a dissection of temptation is shown, without any barriers, saturated images, or PG images: the brutality of temptation is on full throttle and the lasting effects are devastating, scarring.
We follow two men and a woman on a boat, steering their way from the burning village, their village. War has devastated them. They steer on a small body of water. A thick fog dances over their little boat, capturing them into the spider-web of unknown early on in Ugetsu. A woman and her child look on as the boat becomes invisible quite early on in their rowing. Her husband promises to return within 10 days, filled with pockets of money and wealth. He intends on selling his beloved pottery to a new marketplace. The other man, his friend, becomes convinced that he will achieve fame by being a samurai. His delusional dreams outweigh everything else in his life. The woman, his wife, only insists on coming with because she recognizes her husband's inability to think for himself, his mind more clouded than the river they row on. These are the characters of Ugetsu; two families. Two family-men, intent on surviving with their aspirations in mind. Two women, who see the changes that these temptations have had on their husbands; one has become delusional with fame, the other has become greedy, thirsty for money. In this moment, we seem to know the outcome of Genjuro (the greedy man), Tobei (the dreamer), their wives (Miyagi and Ohama), and Genjuro and Miyagi's son, Genichi right then and there; two men, shroud in their greed and temptation, have become two men their wives don't recognize anymore. How easy would it have been to turn back, save the pain, and continue to live as they once did? We're not so sure, even Mizoguchi can't answer that, but we can only watch it all unfold.
At what cost is their goals accomplished, their dreams fulfilled? Each friend and family member becomes separated from one another; Miyagi and Genichi remain at their decimated village, Tobei runs off and journeys to become a samurai, Ohama is violated and her morals now shattered, and Genjuro now entangles not only with money, but a beautiful temptress, Lady Wasaka. Their fates, locked away by Mizsoguchi, have been sealed; the two women will struggle to survive without their husbands, leading to drastic situations and devastating results. Tobei will cheat his way through for power and Genjuro will commit adultery and forget the life he once had, that promise to his wife now broken. Two honest men, clouded by judgement, have become images of men they never knew. If only they had listened to their wives, none of this would've happened.",5.0

"Hoop-Tober 2.O Film #18
Ugetsu is one of the great moral fables I've seen, at once powerfully incisive in its observations, yet also universal, cosmic in its truths. Like the elegantly beautiful sweeping camera movements for which he became famous, Mizoguchi's stories are at once wide in their breadth and intimate in their details. This film is mysterious in its ghostly mysticism, but it is also clear in its themes and meanings. It is deeply beautiful and eminently wise. It is very, very good.
So much is touched on here, from the subtext of the pervasive brutality of war to the allegorical treatment of the city as a spring of vice. But first and foremost, this is a story about greed and the folly of excessive ambition and how the pride of men will be their downfall. One the most resonating moments comes early on, when Genjûrô makes a gift of a fine dress to his wife, and how little he understands when she says the gift means less than his love. Genjûrô and Tôbee are men, and they are blinded by greed and lust. There's something deeply sad about how their foolishness drags their wives through terrible pain. How simple it should be, that family and an affectionate home and peace are better than the world's treasures, and that faithfulness is more beautiful than any beautiful thing; how slow we are to remember it.
I have now seen six of Mizoguchi's films, and I am coming to believe he is one the greatest of all directors. As with Ozu, his films are like transcendent experiences: their styles are at once obvious and mysteriously powerful, drawing me with strength and gentleness into narratives that are are as simple on the surface as they are infinitely complex in their underlying emotions. But if Ozu is like a friend who comes alongside you, as Roger Ebert so eloquently put it, then Mizoguchi is the Wise Man on the Mountaintop, not a friend, but an Oracle. We approach him with fear, but we can trust what he says.

"""Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering."" - Ohama
Kenji Mizoguchi really is a storyteller at heart, and I feel he knows how to deliver powerful endings with 1953's Ugetsu being a fine example of that.
A tale of ambition, family, love, and war set in the midst of the Japanese Civil Wars of the sixteenth century.
What Mizoguchi does well is how he introduces the characters in a solid way. The performances are solid, and they do a good job at showing how they change as their ambition ends up not having the best achievements in their life showing the oppression of war and the death of the dream.
The direction by Kenji Mizoguchi is creative since he has scenes that last longer with little to no movement of the camera, and shorter scenes where he does inventive techniques in order to make the film stand out. I feel this one doesn't resonate with me as much as Sansho the Bailiff, but I liked what Mizoguchi achieved here by presenting a film that tackles multiple themes at once that makes you think.
I do think the middle section does feel tacky, and some parts made me feeling lukewarm to the film since it didn't fully invest me. I still think 1953's Ugetsu is a great film to study since it shows how Ozu and Kurosawa were inspired by Mizoguchi but all three sit on different sides of the Japanese spectrum of traditions.

"In contrast to 1953's other canonized Japanese drama (Tokyo Story), this just may eclipse it for me. There's a sense of balance which feels remarkably calming from the opening sequences. The long crane shot of Genjiro's hut, the beautiful moments where he admires kimonos, some candle-lit interiors in vivid monochrome, and even the justly celebrated love scene by sparse trees and a shimmering lake. These are all abounded in cinematic beauty.
I also thought it was a beguilingly peculiar film. You don't see any of the extraneous performances which have plagued preceding Japanese films and there's an unfathomably great deal of content despite its simple storytelling.
What initially appeared as Kurosawa-like (struggling peasants just trying to make a living) evolved into much more. A tragic romance, a socially conscious morality tale, and ultimate a ghost story. On that second aspect (which it primarily focuses on), this is a curious moral for a Western perspective. Sure you can work hard, but not too ambitiously, for a life that is more about acceptance than excess can lead to the loss of your loved ones.
I was transported into the realm for dreams and the heartbreaking consequences of greed. The haunting sadness lingers long after in this strange, wailing and illuminating classic.",4.5
"Quando Genjuro chega em sua casa, depois de ultrapassar as ilusões do espírito de Wakasa, a câmera se move em uma panorâmica, transformando a casa destruída e revelando o espírito de Miyagi.

Foram necessárias todas as ilusões, que para Genjuro e Tobei devem ser quebradas e para Ohama e Miyagi representam a única forma de continuarem existindo (existência da dignidade de Ohama depois de sua violação e a humilhação pelos samurais e pelo marido; existência enquanto permanência no seio familiar mesmo depois da morte para Miyagi), para que possamos compreender a unidade de Contos da Lua Vaga: tendo visto tudo isso se quebrar, nesse giro de 360 graus, o retorno não representa salvação, e sim o único meio de poder garantir alguma fuga deste mundo cruel.

"Lo mejor del estilo de Mizoguchi es la manera en la que desnuda por completo el alma de sus personajes. Es una característica fundamental, en mi opinión, para entender las acciones que realizan cada uno de ellos. En Ugetsu Monogatari esa profundidad la encuentro en ambos protagonistas, pues no pasan ni siquiera cinco minutos de la película para que el espectador ya tenga una idea de sus defectos y sus virtudes. Asimismo, otro aspecto que es perfecto en las películas de Mizoguchi, es ese punto infaltable donde se mezclan la belleza y la oscuridad, y en esta película hay muchos de ellos gracias a su dirección realista y tenebrosa. Por estos motivos, confío plenamente en todas las personas que consideran a Ugetsu Monogatari una de las mejores películas de la historia, pero antes hay que hacer un recorrido a una parte de lo que ella tiene que contarnos a nosotros.
En principio, la historia nos cuenta la vida de Genjuro y Tobei, dos campesinos que luchan para cumplir sus sueños. El de Genjuro es volverse millonario vendiendo la cerámica que él fabrica, y el de Tobei es volverse el samurái más poderoso de Japón. Las esposas de ambos les advierten constantemente sobre los peligros que sus deseos conllevan, teniendo en cuenta, además, que están en época de guerra, pero ellos deciden no prestarles atención y arriesgarlo todo para lograr sus objetivos. Sus decisiones, cegadas por la codicia y la ambición, los llevará por un viaje infernal que traerá serias consecuencias para ellos y sus esposas.
En ese sentido, no hay fotograma durante toda la película que no nos recuerde nuestra fragilidad como seres humanos, ya que, en busca del poder y la riqueza, nuestros protagonistas pierden lo más importante dentro de sus vidas que era el amor de sus esposas. Lo que quiere lograr esto es que nos preguntemos qué es lo que decidimos hacer con nuestras vidas, y si, además, es algo en verdad necesario para nuestra existencia. De igual forma, la riqueza es mostrada como algo transitorio, ya que, Genjuro, a causa de su obsesión por conseguir dinero, alucina con una mujer muy bella y adinerada que le dará todo lo que él desea. Este segmento se plasma de manera fantasmagórica, y está acompañado de un soundtrack que nos ayuda a diferenciar cuando nuestro protagonista está alucinando y cuando no. De hecho, el sonido es de suma importancia en el filme, ya que afirma el mensaje de que, al igual que el fantasma de la mujer, la riqueza es solo una ilusión, o lo que es mejor, algo que no vale la pena perseguir.
Dado a estos hechos, la película del japonés Kenji Mizoguchi ha envejecido perfectamente y consigue sorprender a cualquier tipo de audiencia que se deje llevar por su belleza lúgubre. Además, su ritmo es perfecto para que cualquiera se adentre en ella, junto a su corta duración que hace de su experiencia sorprendente por todo lo que está dentro de su narrativa. Así que, ¿es una de la mejores películas de la historia? Bueno, supongo que es difícil de decir, pero es seguro que puede cambiar la perspectiva de vida de cualquier espectador.

"There are some interesting ideas in this story, and I enjoyed the look of it all, but I struggled to connect with these characters, and ultimately felt disappointed by the resolution. I was rooting for them to hit it big selling pottery, but things took a major left turn when they instead made a series of bad life decisions. By the time things got supernatural late in the film, I was already pretty baffled, and that only made matters worse. Still, I was glad I watched the film, and appreciated the central thesis that men are idiots, and their wives deserve better.",3.5
"Probably a shallow comparison but I was reminded of Onibaba, and in my log for that film, I noted that it felt like a parable without enough development to carry it to feature length. I can't say the same for this, because it uses its runtime wisely, evoking a clear passage of time even though it's barely over 90 minutes (shorter than Onibaba for what it's worth). I still think these types of stories are better suited to short films—I'm overdue for a Kwaidan rewatch—but the pacing makes this one work.",3.5

My second watch
So gradual but so atmospheric and subtly strange. The haunting tone is ambiguous but clearly communicated through the hazy, ghostly music and visual choices, and Mizoguchi's compositions are as striking as ever. There's also a really satisfying contrast between peace and chaos, as well as how social turmoil affects men versus how it affects women, both of which contribute a lot to the especially potent middle half. The moral ideas are clear-cut but feel fitting of the fairytale influences and nuanced due to an ending that's totally different and much more interesting than what I remembered. This film isn't quite as consistently gripping for me as I wish it were, but it deftly pulls me into its world and gives me so much to chew on.",4.0
"إخراجياً يضربُ ميزوغوتشي منذ أول لحظةٍ في الفيلم. تعطي اللوحات الافتتاحية مع الموسيقى الفلكلورية اليابانية (بالقيثارة اليابانية / الكوتو) احساساً مخيفاً وغريباً تجاه القصة ذكرني برائعة ماساكي كوباياشي Kwaidan التي تستلهم أيضاً قصتين اخريين من قصص Ugetsu الفلكلورية. يبرز أداء ميزوغوتشي أولاً - وكالعادة - من خلال الإحساس العالي بالزمان والمكان. أفلام ميزوغوتشي تحرر المشاهد - بشكلٍ كلي - من ارتباطه بالوسيط وتجعله يعيش فعلاً حقبة حكايته ولا أعتقد أن هناك مخرجاً آخراً في تاريخ السينما كله يضاهيه على هذا المستوى. ينجح ميزوغوتشي أولاً في السيطرة على الزمان بالرغم من صعوبة تنفيذ ذلك مع الحكايات ذات المواعظ الأخلاقية التي تعتمد في سردها على استمرار الخطأ وطول فترة التكرار قبل حدوث التطهير ، وثانياً من خلال خلق احساسٍ عالٍ بالمكان وطريقة تفاعل عناصر كل مشهد معه. يتضح ذلك في مشهد هجوم الجيش ، وفي مشاهد سوق البلدة ، وفي مشهد النهر ، وفي منزل الشبح ، ثم في صورة البلدة المنكوبة بعد العودة. هذا يفسر سر الاعجاب الشديد من جاك ريفيت بأسلوب ميزوغوتشي في توظيف الميزانسين كعنصرٍ بالغ الأهمية في الصورة. علاوةً على ذلك يبرز الايقاع الداخلي لميزوغوتشي والذي ميّزه بوضوح عن سينما كوروساوا عندما تلقى الغرب أعمال الرجلين في الخمسينيات. نغمته هادئة وإيقاعه ينسل بتأنٍ (تخديري) على خلاف كوروساوا وهو ما يفسر الحس الشاعري الواضح لسينما ميزوغوتشي. رجله الأول في ذلك هو مدير التصوير كازو مياغاوا الذي يحقق - مجدداً - الرؤية التصويرية الخاصة بميزوغوتشي حيث الحركة التدفقية للكاميرا التي تقوم على دراسة نقطة بداية كل لقطة وأين تنتهي وعلاقة كل لقطة بما قبلها وبما بعدها وكأنك تنتقل ضمن قطعةٍ بصريةٍ واحدة تنزلق فيها من مشهدٍ لآخر. يعمل ميزوغوتشي أيضاً وفق طقسه الشهير حيث كل مشهد يصوّر في أقل عددٍ ممكنٍ من اللقطات ، وفي كثيرٍ من الأحيان في لقطةٍ واحدة (غالباً واسعة ونادراً ما تكون متوسطة) ، و هو طقسٌ شاركه فيه ياسوجيرو أوزو (وإن فضّل أوزو ثبات الكادر وسكون العناصر داخله). عمل ميزوغوتشي بشكلٍ أكبر على اللقطات الطويلة الواسعة المتحركة وأحياناً المنزلقة حيث تبدأ اللقطة من اليمين لليسار مثلاً وتتبعها في المشهد التالي لقطةٌ أخرى في الاتجاه ذاته ، ويصنع المونتاج (الذوباني غالباً) في المشهدين المتتابعين وحدةً بصريةً مترابطة توظف غالباً لاختزال الوقت وكمية الضياع التي عاشتها الشخصيات في تلك المحنة ويبدو مشهد الحمّام في البريّة مثالاً واضحاً على ذلك. ميزوغوتشي من خلال هذه اللقطات الواسعة يعوّض الحيوية المنقوصة في استخدام لقطاتٍ محدودة لكل مشهد ويضمّن القيمة التعبيرية للميزانسين بشكلٍ أوضح، مما يمنح سينماه مذاقاً اكثر واقعيةً علاوةً على أن المونتاج الذوباني يعطي الحكاية حسها التخيلي ويعزز أكثر من مذاق قصة المرأة الشبح تحديداً ويدعم قيمة الدرس الأخلاقي من خلال اضفاء ذلك الحس الشاعري الحالم عليها ، وكأنما هي مرحلة محنةٍ سرعان ما ستزول! وفي الواقع فإن هذا الحس الشاعري للصورة موجودٌ في الفيلم كله ، ومشاهد مثل المشهد الساحر للقارب في النهر ، أو مشاهد البرية ، أو ذلك المشهد الذي يذهب فيه جينجيرو لشراء ثوب كيمونو لزوجته ويتخيّلها تنتقي ما تريد على جانب المحل ، أو المشهد الذي يعود فيه جينجيرو الى منزله ولا يجد فيه أحداً بينما تراقبه الكاميرا من داخل المنزل وهو يدور خارجه قبل أن يعود الى الموضع ذاته ليجد زوجته جالسةً تطهو الطعام ، وبالتأكيد مشاهد جينجيرو في منزل واكاسا التي يتفّهّم فيها ميزوغوتشي جيداً قيمة الاضاءة في التعبير وخلق التأثير من خلال الستائر والإحساس الشبحي للصورة ، ويعطينا من خلال الكاميرا احساس جينجيرو تجاه المنزل : الاستغراب والانبهار والفضول والخوف أيضاً ، قبل أن تصبح اللقطات أقرب فأقرب مع زيادة الألفة بين جينجيرو و واكاسا. كل تلك المشاهد – على خلفية الموسيقى اليابانية - التي تخلق مزيجاً مُريباً من الحميمية والقلق في ذات الوقت - تثبت برأيي أي قيمةٍ إخراجيةٍ عظيمة كان يمثلها كينجي ميزوغوتشي .

"""De deux choses l'une, soit Mizoguchi a poussé l'art de la transparence classique à un tel degré d'exaltation et d'incandescence qu'il excède le commentaire ­ n'importe quel commentaire; soit le cinéma, même le plus achevé ­ ce qu'est par excellence le cinéma mizoguchien ­ ne doit en dernier ressort sa magie qu'au «""miracle"" automatique de l'impression de réalité», et le commentaire est tout aussi superflu. Que la magie du cinéma finisse par lasser, par donner la nausée après trop d'années d'éblouissement et de fuite transie devant le réel (comme dit Bergman, «le cinéma est le refuge des poltrons devant la vie»), c'est une évidence qui en rejoint une autre: sur Mizoguchi, ce nom de code qui signe le moment où le cinéma se confond avec l'image sublimée du réel, rien ne peut se proférer. Mizoguchi, c'est le cinéma en tant qu'il échappe au montage, à la suture. Cinéma du ralentissement, de l'accélération des émotions, de la mort lente. Mizoguchi, c'est Ford qui prendrait son temps pour regarder passer, non seulement la caravane des hommes, mais aussi celle des femmes. Chez Ford, une femme accompagne un homme un bout de chemin, elle lui permet d'être «complet» (sous cet angle, Ford est très juif). Mizoguchi installe au contraire un dispositif d'amour et de souffrance dans lequel une femme ne s'accomplit pleinement que par le passage d'un homme dans son champ de vision, dans sa vie. Une fois qu'on a dit ça, on est bien avancé. Le cinéma en tant qu'art, en tant qu'art secret, a été inventé pour Mizoguchi. Le plus grand, c'est lui.""

"Filmwelt Wichtelclub #17 - Ugetsu - Wichtel-vermutung: Lukas
I always thought this was 3 hours long. Guess I was wrong huh? It definitely isn‘t and it doesn‘t feel like it would be either. It‘s a nice and short flick that I wish would be a little longer. While the basic theme of war and how much better life is without it is clear this throws so many different things in it that is sometimes feels a little messy. From romance to violence, comedy and even ghosts this has a lot. It would propably work a little better if there were more time to fully explore all of them a bit more, but I kinda really love how messy this is at times. It feels just so natural and like Mizoguchi needed to tell those stories no matter how much time he had. For me this heightens the importance of them. 
Definitely worth a look or two or three. Now I‘m interested in his other works.",4.0
"🇯🇵 Japanuary - [dir.Kenji Mizoguchi]
There is so much to be gained from the subtext here:
1) Foremost, the idea that having the world means nothing if you have no one to share it with.
2)The importance of being content and at peace with your life and the things you are blessed with, not lusting for more.
3)The horrors of war.
4) The importance of the family unit.
It was of interest that when both men left their respective family units to pursue their lofty goals, harmony was disrupted and their lives suffered for it.
The strength of the film for me, was definitely the superb writing and the source material it was based upon. I really should have read Tales of Moonlight and Rain (Ugetsu Monogatari) years ago—I need to get on that. Mizoguchi can also be credited with skillfully blending the realistic and fantastical elements of his film with apparent ease.
Admittedly, I’m not the biggest fan of films produced before 1960 (I’m trying to work on that) and I can count on my hands the number of films from the 50s I actually enjoyed. This is among the better of them.
The score was great!

"Often considered by many as an important milestone in cinema Mizoguchi's Ugetsu was also a key film in the rising fame of Japanese Cinema in the west. Shot so beautifully that the film feels unearthly (and hints at the supernatural elements), Ugetsu is an experience of classic cinema that still holds up after almost seventy years.
That said, the fates of the men in the film don't feel to be the result of their individual choices but rather their individual choices feel to serve their ultimate fate. This reduces the power of the film's themes and morals and even though the ending is emotional, my takeaways are not as strong as they might have been.",4.0
"Une oeuvre d'une richesse inouïe.
L'approche du fantastique par Mizoguchi est sans pareil, confondante tant elle s'incruste dans le réel, tant elle incarne une autre réalité qui en a toutes les apparences, dénuée des artifices habituels.

"A ghost story to break your heart. The folly and grotesqueness of man, the evils of greed and delusional ambition. I read it as a strong commentary on Japan in WWII, seduced by fascist notions of power and expansion, war fever gripping the nation and driving it to self-destruction. The men at the end of the film return to their village, beaten down and humiliated, suffering grave loss, but having learned the harsh wisdom of taking satisfaction in a simple life, a stand in for Japan after the war turning to business and economic growth in order to put behind the demons of its failed bid for a greater Asian empire. The fascist ghost of seductive power has been defeated and sent back to the netherworld but the ghost of those lost in the process will continue to haunt for a long time to come",5.0

"I feel quite unsettled after watching Ugestsu, as if I now carry the burden of an ancient curse. The commentary on greed would've been enough for any other full length feature, but Mizoguchi takes these themes much further: into the eternal abyss of death.
Visually this was quite striking. I especially appreciated the use of lighting and camera work - it lended atmosphere to scenes that might've otherwise been static. My favorite scene was certainly the one where Genjuro returned home, which served as a second (and more heart-breaking) helping of eeriness.
I'm beginning to think that Mizoguchi likes his creepy music. Both of his films I've seen have soundtracks that use wobbly and screechy sounds.
I'll admit that this was more of an appreciation watch than an active ""enjoy"". I think this is due to the fabled nature of Genjuro and Tobei, whose actions are so stupid that it's hard to find them relatable. Their wives get far less screen time, and I think the film could've used more of their presence.

"As a disclaimer I watched in two separate sittings but still it’s powerful, moving cinema. 
Mirages of pleasure giving way to images and realities of suffering. Hubris and pride into vain empty ambition. The, or at least a, lone and dreary world. 
One thought was I found it interesting how this plays relative to Kurosawa, I think specifically of the ghosts in Throne of Blood or even in Rashomon, and also Shindo’s Kuroneko. The mystical world that constantly creeps in the edges of their worlds, sometimes veering in.  While that is present in Ugetsu, it’s in a different way than those, as it presents virtually all perspectives, and where Kuroneko focused on vengeance, Rashomon on justice, these people, and ghosts, just suffer and cry out into the night. Yet the ending was tragically touching. 
Beautiful, cold, dark cinema.",4.5
"O conflito que ludibria os desavisados. Partindo da chegada do exército saqueando as aldeias, Mizoguchi entra num misticismo que diz muito sobre o homem frente à ganância do mundo. Dinheiro, poder e desejo à frente do bem fundamental: O amor e a estabilidade familiar.
O filme logo entra numa mistura entre os devaneios místicos - A cena do lago sob a névoa e a forma com que Mizoguchi encena a família nobre e sua obscuridade - e as forças físicas do exército. Enquanto o homem parte para a desolação após o que foi perdido, após o estrago consumado, a mulher sofre em terra seja com a punição com a morte ou a desonra física imposta pela desolação mundana pós conflito.

Year of Release: 1953

Main Cast: Masayuki Mori, Machiko Kyō, Kinuyo Tanaka, Eitarô Ozawa, Ikio Sawamura, Mitsuko Mito
Like many other Japanese directors of post-World War II era, Mizoguchi utilizes stories set in feudal Japan to tell cautionary tales while also criticizing the contemporary situation his fellow countrymen were living. Ugetsu is a tale of greed and mindless ambition, of men driven by the wrong things in life, neglecting their families to pursue wealth and honor. With stark black-and-white cinematography, sumptuous dresses, and deeply flawed human characters, this is a really engaging narrative that benefits from a captivating and simple screenplay and really great central performances.
I was quite fascinated by the female characters in this, they aren't just there for eye-candy or a means to an end, but as complicated figures that are suffering due to their husbands putting other priorities in front of taking care of their families. But the two leading men as well are conflicted internally, wanting to both support their families but also tempted by greed and even lust. Its ending is emotionally devastating but also quite tender, complimenting everything that came before and delivering a message of hope to the viewers.

"It took me some time to get into the rhythm of it, but it first clicked during the boat scene; the story is simple and folkloric, but the real power comes through the graceful, almost balletic motions and the way Mizoguchi balances people and landscapes, finding power in images of trees, fog, water, and tall grass blowing in the wind.",4.0
"It’s often that you hear Ozu’s name pop up when speaking of visual composition, and how not to move the camera, but I think Mizoguchi is Japan’s real master when it comes to mise-en-scène. Only other director that comes to mind with this simple yet effortless and consistent capability of simple effective style of framing is John Ford.",4.5
"Hungry Ghosts - or Pretas - is a concept closely tied to Buddhism. It means “departed or dead one.” Hungry Ghosts are unfortunate in being reborn into existence with a ceaseless hunger. Ugetsu is a tremendous moral story of two hungry ghosts: Genjuro, a man who stops at nothing to work on his love of pottery and Tobei, a farmer who seeks the valour of a Samurai.
Mizoguchi offers us these two antithetical characters that diverge along their paths. One is so obsessed by his work and art, that he sacrifices everything dear to him to ensure its creation and sale. The other is so obsessed with the recognition and pride that comes with being a Samurai, but isn’t willing to sacrifice anything to achieve the accolades that come with it.
When war breaks out in their village, themselves and their loved ones are put at risk. Genjuro and Tobei take their families away to safety. But then the thought of traveling to the closest city to sell their goods emerges. It’s their attempt at salvaging success from unfortunate circumstances. So it’s somewhat easy to understand why Genjuro would leave his family at shore in order to seek more for them.
But that’s where the sympathy for Genjuro stops. There’s an unrelenting descent into success and the seduction of the material world that renders Genjuro’s world more and more dreamlike with each passing scene. No other film has slowly walked down the staircase from reality into illusion quite so subtlety and with such horror.
Many filmmakers these days jump from someone sleeping and then into a dream or a music cue hits and suddenly the characters are somewhere fantastical. But with Mizoguchi, the transformation from reality to the unknown is so graceful and so soothing, you nearly can’t tell where one begins and the other ends. And that’s the point.
The power of the odyssey into the dream in Ugetsu is where it’s true strength lies. It’s easy to tell the story of the dream, but to delicately lead the viewer into that place without them even knowing is something short of a miracle.
When Genjuro arrives to the city, he sells these beautiful bowls to the nobility of Japan, but they’re empty. There’s nothing to fill them with. Tobei dons the wardrobe of a skilled Samurai, but behind the stories of his heroicism, there’s banal lifeless philosophies about what makes a true hero. These characters slowly starve so much for the truth and spiritual nourishment that they abandon everything in their hunger for something outside of their souls.
What good is a bowl without the food of the soul to fill it with? What good is the uniform of the Samurai without the strength or willpower to fight with it? Ugetsu tests these realms of the material world in a way very few stories do. It makes sense that this came towards the end of Mizoguchi’s career. It’s a warning of many things, but I think mostly of losing sight of what you’re working towards and the sacrifices that come with it.
The gentle spirit of Mizoguchi seems to whisper, “Be gracious for the food you have or you will always be hungry.” Tobei ends up falling from his pride into the depths of shame just as Genjuro inevitably welcomes the company of those whom he has become: phantoms in need of possessing someone or something.
Very few films take on this spiritual importance and even fewer are this haunting.",4.5
"Kenji Mizoguchi's Epic period piece ""Ugetsu"" is a war movie, ghost story and love story all rolled into one, but really it is derived from several stories from Ueda Akinari's book of the same name.
Mizoguchi does a brilliant job of creating a scene where the lines of reality and fantasy are blurred. It is like watching a fairy tale come to life and accepting it as reality, like being in a dream where everything seems real no matter how absurd it may seem; we don't question it's validity, we just take it as it is. When we think we are in fantasy, we are suddenly thrown back into reality and vice versa. This is highly attributed to the masterful cinematography and use of music. ""Ugetsu"" is unlike any film I have seen.
We are brought to a poverty-stricken Japan at war and follow several individuals who's world is different than ours. They try to survive when their village is raided, trying to avoid enemy pirates and bandits alike. They deal with love, loss and temptation. The realism of the mother (played by Kinuyo Tanaka) and her child being attacked and robbed by bandits is in direct contrast with the next scene of a man (Masayuki Mori) caught between his world and the fantasy world of the living and the dead as he asks for forgiveness from the spirits he dishonored. This is all done in a way that blends these different realities together, creating a wonderfully woven spectacle that is, in the words of Joseph Campbell, ""not a contradiction, but a transcendence of the tragedy of man.""
It is a Samurai movie but there is hardly any sword fighting. Of what there is, however, is very effective. The difference between ""Ugetsu"" and a Kurowsawa film is evident in the style. Kurowsawa was definitely influenced by this. Heartfelt and innovative in technique, ""Ugetsu"" is not only one of the greatest of Japanese Cinema, but ALL of Cinema.",5.0

"Ugetsu Monogatari, roughly translated as Tales of Rain and the Moon in English, is one of the finest Japanese movies I've seen yet. I knew little of the film before I watched it, only aware of the high regard it was held in from fellow movie lovers. For that reason I'd simply urge anyone who has an interest in Japanese cinema to check this one out immediately. The plot is quite simple, but keeps you guessing at times too. The acting was superb and the direction from Kenji Mizoguchi is simply stellar.
The first half pulled at my heartstrings, and the second truly creeped me out, the atmosphere and mood created through the lighting and sound design was excellent. The final ten minutes were revelatory to say the least, and cemented my opinion that is was one of the best films I've seen. Layered, emotional and eerie, a definite, (and almost definitive) masterpiece.",5.0
"A landmark of Japanese cinema and one of the most untouchable cinematic experiences, Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is a phenomenal masterpiece in every aspect. Dwelling on themes of greed and class and telling a wonderful fantasy masterpiece that challenges the human mind, Ugetsu is alongside Kurosawa's Rashomon, the Japanese masterpiece that introduced Eastern cinema to Western countries.
Wrapped around as a fantasy, Mizoguchi's Ugetsu tells the story of two peasants: one aspires to being a samurai and the other desires to sell his wares to lands further away. Both characters in virtually parallel storylines are challenged by their greed, stubborness and their fierce desire for wealth and fame.
Though its story is fantastic and its characters are compelling, Ugetsu is ultimately about the rare cinematic experience of observing 16th Century Japanese conventions. Twisted, rare and absolutely immersive in every regard, Ugetsu is in  an enhanced cinematic experience, a large reason for its popularity and praise in Western countries that was not found in Japan at the time of its release.
From the eclectic music to the stunning cinematography and brisk pacing, Ugetsu is in every way a masterpiece of the fantasy genre as it is an influential Japanese masterpiece. Bending what was allowed at the time of its release by being an almost early erotic thriller, Ugetsu was dismissed by Japanese audiences but admired by Western audiences. A classic in every regard that is incredibly effective at setting up an atmosphere, Ugetsu is more about the experience than the story and characters.",4.5
"Around the World in May-ty Days Challenge
Movie #10 - Ugetsu (Japan)
I think for me, the Japanese cinema will always remain as the most perfect example of why and how watching movies gives you a sense of epic adventure without really wasting its time on visual effects or over the top action dynamics. How in a very subtle, somewhat dense and layered way in most of the movies mixing reality with fantasy, they seem to convey lots of messages and give an excellent commentary on morals of life whether they are period movies or post-war domestic dramas. Even their strictly entertaining movies involving samurai or things from the supernatural/fantastical world becomes much more than what they initially seems to be. Even though i really don't get to watch lots of movies from different countries and i have been trying a lot to get as much of cinematic knowledge as i can. But from what i have seen from Japan, i am a big fan of the movies by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Hayao Miyazaki and now adding to this list is Kenji Mizoguchi since ""Ugetsu"" is his first movie that i have seen. I just had an amazing time watching this movie, how wonderfully things are unfold in a seamless way where different layers connected to different themes unfolds in a way that makes the entire experience heavenly. This is a period drama which is set during the Azuchi–Momoyama period in the late 16th century. It tells story of these two families who live in a village near Lake Biwa in Omi Province. Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) is the main character who with Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa) goes to sell things in a nearby town amid the storm of soldiers who are rumored to be causing chaos in various villages. Genjuro is a potter, a very dedicated person while Tobei dreams of becoming a Samurai one day, to a point where he actually comes off as a foolish person. Genjuro has a wife, Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) who is a very caring woman always advising her husband to take care of himself and not think too much about money as health and safety comes first. They have a child too, Genichi. Tobei's wife is Ohama (Mitsuko Mito) who is really sick of his daydreams and foolishness.
When Genjuro earns some money, he brings home some kimonos for his wife and food. He doesn't want to stop even though his wife tells him to but he just wants to work hard and earn more and more money. The soldiers storms their village one night and even though his pottery creations, on which he worked pretty hard are in the oven which is the final stage, they just have to flee the village. The plot really thickens when these four people gets separated from one another. Tobei after earning money sets off to fulfill his wish of becoming a Samurai. His wife while searching for him encounters some soldiers and her life changes from then on. While Miyagi stays behind trying to care for her child and wait for her husband, Genjuro encounters a very beautiful woman, Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo) while he is selling his pottery. The noblewoman and her female servant buys several pieces of the pottery and tells Genjuro to bring it to the Kutsuki mansion. I wont reveal anything else but that there are spirits in the movie. That spirit world seems to be existing along with the real world and the way Mizoguchi does the transformation is fluid. In between the war and the chaos that it brings with it, how the male members of the family are caught up feverishly in their efforts to save their family by working hard to earn money. War doesn't only destroys homes or lives but those who are left among all this, they have to survive and protect themselves which is a very tough thing to do. Genjuro finds a new life with that noblewoman, a peaceful, beautiful and wealthy life where you don't have to worry about anything. He is really moved by it and surprised that a life like this even exists among all this. Mizoguchi perfectly examines the themes of family, commitment, war and its effects, ambitions, dreams, survival, life and death. The supernatural themes doesn't disrupts the nature of the movie but instead it helps Mizoguchi's vision. It is grand, masterful and just pure classic in so many ways. The cinematography is top notch, the actors are handled perfectly, brilliant costumes and setting. Ugetsu is a moving, emotional, marvelous and ravishing tale that is presented as a fable but speaks so much about life in general that it feels universal. One of the greatest cinematic achievements and one of my favorite movies of all time.

"LES CONTES DE LA LUNE VAGUE
(extrait des Cahiers n°81, Mars 1958, rétrospective Mizoguchi)
Tiré de deux contes populaires japonais du XVIᵉ siècle. La guerre expose une famille de villageois à la tentation de l'aventure. Tandis que son beau-frère veut tâter du métier des armes, Genjuro, venu à la ville vendre ses poteries, est séduit par le fantôme de la princesse Wasaka. A la fin, l'enchantement dissipé, il regagnera son toit. Il n'y retrouvera que le fantôme de sa femme, tuée par les soldats pendant son absence, et qui l'exhorte à poursuivre sa tâche quotidienne. Sa soeur et son beau-frère, devenus, l'une prostituée, l'autre samouraï, ont compris, eux aussi, que le bonheur était dans le pays natal, non dans de vaines illusions.
Adopté d'emblée le ton du chef-d'oeuvre. Le chef-d'oeuvre de Mizoguchi, le chef-d'oeuvre du cinéma japonais, un des plus beaux films de l'histoire du cinéma. C'est une somme où convergent et s'additionnent les tendances les plus opposées de l'art, ses sources d'inspiration les plus diverses. Il n'est possible de parler de lui que par énumération: il est, de quelque point de vue que l'on se place, à la fois ceci et cela, et quelque chose de plus encore: leur conciliation. C'est à la fois le mythe grec de l'Odyssée et la légende celtique de Lancelot, un des plus beaux poèmes d'aventure et d'amour fou, un des chants les plus fervents qui aient été composés en l'honneur du renoncement et de la fidélité, un hymne à l'Unité, en même temps qu'à la diversité des apparences. C'est un conte de fées, traité avec un réalisme si minutieux qu'on peut dire que le moyen âge n'avait jamais été, avant lui, évoqué correctement sur un écran. En lui se réconcilient le goût du hiératisme, propre aux arts de l'Orient, et cette soif de nouveau, cet irrespect de toute forme imposée qui est permis de considérer comme l'apanage de l'Occident. Concerté comme un Kammerspiel, il ne laisse pas la moindre place au staff, au sens propre et figuré du terme. La caméra, sensible aux moindres granulations de la matière, s'attarde sur les eaux et les roseaux, les chevelures ou parures féminines, avec un plaisir paresseux qui ne freine en rien la décision de brefs mouvements d'appareil par lesquels homme et nature voient continuellement leur sort lié. Les gestes sont libres, vifs, la course fournit le tempo de base. Les regards, eux-mêmes ne se dérobent pas, ici, avec l'ordinaire pudeur des films nippons... Et ainsi de suite. Dès que les noms de l'Aurore et des Fioretti ont été prononcés, ce double rapprochement nous pousse à l'inventaire de beautés sans fin.
Plus encore que sur sa valeur intrinsèque parmi l'œuvre d'un très grand cinéaste, insistons donc sur la signification que revêt ce film à nos yeux d'Occidentaux. Il est le point de coïncidence de deux univers, de deux morales, de deux esthétiques, de deux ésotérismes, qui, par le truchement d'une forme d'art amie de l'universalité, nous sont découverts à leur degré de culminance extrême, infiniment plus proches que nous ne le pensions, même depuis Van Gogh.
Ce film, le plus japonais des films japonais, est en même temps celui qui exige du spectateur européen le moindre effort d'adaptation: venu le mot «fin», on a peine à croire qu'il se soit écoulé une heure et demie. Aucune salle parisienne n'a encore daigné l'inscrire à son programme.

Remarkable in so many regards. It's not often that I revisit a film just a week after my initial viewing but I felt the need to do so with this one because I just wasn't in the right mood to get the most out of it the first time around (though even then I found it very interesting and could tell it was great). Very excited to explore more of Mizoguchi's filmography.,5.0
"Ugetsu nos habla la historia de dos hombres que viven en el campo la guerra entre soldados y samurais está en su apogeo los dos hombres son hermanos genjuro tiene un niño y el otro tobei vive solo con su esposa Genjuro trabaja las artesanías que son codiciadas por las personas de Japón en aquella época valían mucho y hacerlas es todo un arte aparte de que el director muestra estás cosas pequeñas se nota que si hubiese estado a color esto sería un montón de vestuario llamativo hermoso toda la preparación es un arte y de esto viven la historia comienza cuando los samurais llegan a la aldea destrozando todo matando a la personas y despojandolas de sus vienes
Los temas principales en la película es la avaricia o ambición de los seres humanos en este caso los dos hermanos son atacados por sus propias ambiciones y sueños tobei desea convertirse en un samurai reconocido y ser parte de ellos con todo su ser y Genjuro sin querer termina por olvidarse de su familia por el deseo de estar con una mujer más joven termina siendo arrastrado hasta ahí a causa de los trastes de barro y cerámica que vendía
Es bastante triste como Genjuro se olvida de su familia ese último pasaje final es algo onírico es una última despedida es obvio que su mujer no le reprocha nada por eso se me hizo no real pero es bastante hermoso supongo que su mujer lo único que quería es que su esposo volviera con ellos la voz de su mujer Miyagi al final no me gustó tanto pero es como todo vuelve a ser como era el trabajo honrado y la dedicación que tenía Genjuro volvió al igual que su hermano tobei
Tobei por su parte se hizo un samurai su esposa se volvió una prostituta y un día estando con su gente el la reconoce es una película reflexiva de como las consecuencias que se toman en la vida de dejar a tu familia son malas y también una reflexión a la guerra la guerra es mala tobei tirando todo como niño regañado me gustó
Ugetsu es una película que ganó la palma de plata en el 53 tiene un ritmo lento pero entretenido ambos hermanos se pierden en la codicia de sus deseos y retoman el camino gracias a la reflexión de su conciencia no cabe duda de que las oportunidades que tenían ambos las aprovecharon en el momento
Tobei cuando tenía el dinero pudo comprar su armadura y lanza y unirse solo para ser alguien de los samurais y ser respetado etc. Y Genjuro fue seducido por una mujer hermosa solo faltó saber que era lo que Genjuro obtuvo de esto riqueza ? Bienestar el final que tiene con esta mujer y todo no se sabe muy bien solo son supersticiones de la película yo crei que se convierte en una película que habla sobre los encantos y cosas sobrenaturales pero lo único sobrenatural es la parte en la que Miyagi visita a su esposo por última vez haciendo esto algo real y triste
Ugetsu es el dolor que representan las mujeres de ahora y de aquel entonces pero mejor representado en el Japón que está pasando y pasará por la guerra de samurais el dolor de las mujeres abandonadas de hombres corruptamente inmorales necios y mujeres que tratan de sobrevivir solas en un ambiente donde son atacadas y tratadas como si no valiera nada desoladas tratando de salir adelante a cómo de lugar pero bueno lo que me gusta de esto es que el director usa un arco redentor para los hombres un arco donde la moral y reflexión vuelve pero a qué costo son las consecuencias es hermosa pero no creo que todos puedan conectar completamente con ella",4.5
"“Money is everything. Without it, life is hard and hope dies.”
Ugetsu tells the story of two families who are caught in the crosshairs of nightmarish reality and the allure of pacifying dreams and riches. We see not only the hope such a dream can instill, but the burden that can develop off the backs of grand delusions; when someone releases from their arms those around them that matter most, in order to extend their hands out into the endless expanse hoping to secure a star between their fingers, only to realize it might burn their hands.
We see not only how blinded people can become when they choose to be stuck inside a dream, but also what desperate people are willing to do to claw their way out of a seemingly endless nightmare. We see thieves in the clutches of starvation and brutal violence take place in the name of minimal personal gain. Hungry hands clawing through the dirt for crumbs intended to feed a starving child.
And in both, we see guilt: the ghosts of past actions appearing between the cracks in the walls as our characters struggle to come to terms with what their priorities truly are and the path it has lead them down. A thin curtain pulled across the stage of the life they once known. Their old loved ones have become banshees, whose whispers stick in the trenches of their consciousness.

"As Tanaka Kinuyo’s Miyagi makes her way through the woods with little Genichi on her back, she is set upon by a band of soldiers from the losing side. The men, starving and gaunt of face, snatch the food she is carrying for her son. One of them stabs her with his spear when she resists. Mizoguchi’s famously fluid camera, for once, hangs back and watches impassively as she staggers and struggles to stay on her feet. Genichi, still hanging on to her back, can be heard crying. In the middle distance, the famished soldiers can be seen fighting each other weakly over the food before falling on it ravenously. I don’t know why I hadn’t noticed it in previous viewings, but Mizoguchi places all this action in the same frame - Miyagi in the foreground, grievously wounded and teetering, the soldiers in the background devouring the food they have stolen from her. Ugetsu monogatari is the expression of an entire tradition of filmmaking brought not so much to its culmination as one of its periodic flowerings.",5.0
"The slowly unraveling ghost story of Genjuro, Lady Wakasa and Miyagi is so great, but unfortunately the blatant unevenness of the film really reveals itself as the Tobei-Ohama story is not nearly as intriguing. Where as Genjuro's journey feels Shakespearean, Tobei's just feels more like a fable shuffled into the story at large. It's a fascinating film that ultimately feels disjointed.",3.5
"''What a beautiful shape!
Helping you spin the wheel is my greatest pleasure.
How I long to see it when it's baked!
The firewood is cut and ready.
The rampaging soldiers are gone.
So make your wonderful pottery in peace.
So many things have happened.
You've finally become the man I had hoped for.
But alas...
I am no longer among the living.
I suppose such is the way of the world.''
These men were tested with their virtues, loyalty and greed on their journeys to earn money and become a better husband to their wives. These two, became handcuffed to pleasure and passion. While being treated in an unfamiliar way they carried the intoxication of money and power.
At the and they finally returned to the purity of their home, where everything has started, but it was too late. A wife who died in the brutality of war with thoughts of her husband returning to her, and a wife who lost her chastity to the wild nature of men, were left behind.
However, these two beautiful women was; 'What should I do with the money you bring home if you're not there? Let's be poor, but let's not lose each other.' kind of people.
Such a shame, that this stuff happened and happens. Such a shame, human-kind. All the women who suffered. Oh, all the children who died while they're laughing like dying is a game. I am so sorry for you. And for this world. You all deserved better. To live. To laugh more. To see these beautiful night sky more.",4.0
"Ugetsu is an unexpected ghost tale filled with interesting twists and a lot to say about humanity in their most desperate times. It was a bit too slow for my taste and I didn’t really care for any of the characters. I’m also asking myself if I’ll ever rewatch this and I can’t see myself doing that. I did appreciate the story and themes though!

Idk why it took almost a year to watch this on my criterion but lowkey glad I waited cause it could not have been a more perfect time. It’s such an October type movie!! Very eerie and sad surprisingly. AND quite complex but easy to follow. Loved the direction this went and all the stories branching out and coming back together in the end. New favorite of mine and just might become an annual October watch.,4.5

"Much has been said about Ugetsu's ghostly atmosphere and its supernatural elements, but there's a lot more than that going on here. Mizoguchi draws on folklore with heavy mysticism, but only to paint a detailed portrait of then modern Japan, fuelled by the post-war anxieties of the 1950s. In it are the sobering ethics of war when observed in a domestic setting. Men chase ambitions while their avarice brings ruin to their families. Men are foolish creatures only capable of learning after they suffer misfortunes brought about by their own ignorance. The price for every success of man is paid by women, insight is only gained after sight of what is important is lost. A country ravaged by war; a people changed by it. Mizoguchi's control over light and sound releases a visually arresting narrative that shifts between drama and horror effortlessly. Ugetsu is a mystery whose quality doesn't necessarily reside in the weight of the mystery itself, but in its evolution from being cruel, then emotional, and finally incredibly profound.

"Distante da modernidade onde o velho místico é charlatão e o senso comum é moralismo ultrapassado, em Ugetsu o místico é verdade inexorável.
Verdade que também é certa pureza (também pureza da mise-en-scène), que trás o místico como integrante concreto de seu universo. Quando um barqueiro é encontrado à deriva é tomado como mau presságio, o personagem é primeiramente confundido com um fantasma, mas antes de tudo é a aura fantasmagórica que Mizoguchi dá ao rio cheio de névoa que trás essa impressão. É um mundo puro em sua encenação, não precisa-se mais do que a sugestão para transpor o fantástico.
Quando filma o protagonista sendo seduzido pela fantasma e é mostrado gozando dos momentos com ela, é a movimentação da câmera para a esquerda, juntamente com uma fusão quase invisível que trás os ares oníricos das cenas, aprisionando-o nesse paraíso artificial. Para demonstra-la como um demônio somente a sugestão do seu corpo se arrastando como uma serpente pelo chão até chegar a ele bastam.
Ao finalmente voltar para casa o protagonista se depara com o vazio, atravessa a casa pela esquerda, dando a volta e chegando novamente a entrada (pela direita), vendo sua esposa em uma aparição fantasmagórica que, no entanto, é tomada com um deleite prazeroso concreto, apesar da mesma movimentação da cena com a mulher demoníaca a cena carrega não o peso de um sonho, mas de fato impõe a dúvida do real no próprio espectador.
Mizoguchi trás uma pureza na mise-en-scène que está em equilíbrio com a própria narrativa de conto fantástico. O formalismo (essa espécie de concretude) que gera a transcendência para o místico sem aparente esforço.
Obs: muito bom ver esse filme depois de ter assistido o horrendo Green Knight, é basicamente o mesmo conceito, mas com seus maneirismos sendo o oposto do filme de Mizoguchi.",4.0

God I love Japanese cinema from the 50’s and 60’s. If your looking to get into Japanese cinema I highly recommend this film as a starting place. It’s very entertaining and the plot is pretty straight forward. It’s quite accessible in that way. I thought the cinematography was excellent and I’m super excited to get into more of Kenji Mizogutchi. I do think the tonal shifts in the film didn’t  always work for me. Sometimes characters are doing stupid things and acting like they are drunk even though they are completely sober. Other than my nitpicks it’s a very fun and easy to watch film with a great story.,3.5

"I hadn’t seen this since perhaps high school, and in my memory it loomed larger as a melancholy tale of ghostly tragedy; what struck me this time around was how much it was rooted in the historical specificity of a particularly brutal era of Japanese war, bloodshed, displacement and poverty, and what a relatively unblinking eye it trains upon the brutal realities endemic to that merciless context. That said, its storybook artificiality and poetic resonance, along with the perfection of Mizoguchi’s mise en scène, bring grace to its air of somnolent tragedy.",5.0
"Fantastically immersive, Ugetsu combines exceptional direction and cinematography with emotional performances to provide an incredible period piece. Themes of greed, ambition, and unintended consequences are interwoven with supernatural elements that are peculiarly Japanese, and provide a sincere, hard-hitting climax.",5.0

#4 in Kenji Mizoguchi
Still a masterpiece though the continual praise for this within Mizoguchi's canon is still a little odd, as with Sansho and Oharu (though they're worse offenders) in that this isn't really that representative of his style; or rather, it's Mizoguchi-lite and not in the way I poke fun at Naruse for being. Handles multiple narratives expertly and makes them feel exciting even on a 4th watch. Atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife. It's such a chilling movie and I do wish there was more of the ghost story but I don't think this gets enough credit for its allegory about women's sufferage during war, Mizoguchi doubling down on how money is total shit. Excellent stuff. Not to mention the superb acting and Kazuo ""The GOAT"" Miyagawa's cinematography. Feel like I could watch this hundreds of times.",4.5

but in all seriousness, I don't think I've ever seen a masterclass in camera movement until this movie. it's so fluid and perfectly moved, even when it should be focusing on something else. the shot that comes to mind is when they're in the pool and it follows the stream of water and it's just like... this man's a genius. I love the performances in this, but a personal opinion and a hot take:
ohama's subplot was the best one. I couldn't help but feel so sorry for her and angry at tobei when they had that scene where he realizes who she became
I love the ending, the messages and themes about loyalty and I can't wait to watch three other Mizoguchi films later on! (ps they're on my list but I might watch more)",4.5

"One of the classics of Japanese cinema, this is an elegant ghost story about two brothers, consumed by greed and hubris. It's never aiming to frighten or scare, but as a lesson regarding ambition it very much resembles a Grimm's story, or folk tale. It came out the same year as Kurosawa's Rashomon, and features the same female lead, Machiko Kyo. It takes place in the 16th century, during a time of war and considerable hardships are the norm. The two brothers dream of riches as a merchant, or renown as a samurai, but each puts his wife in danger in order to chase their ephemeral dreams.
The ghost is pretty apparent the minute she arrives, all wrapped and cloaked, and she seduces the merchant brother with flattery and the promise of both riches and subtle suggestions of love. She is not evil, but she is a somewhat devious spirit. The other brother, in a stroke of luck and trickery, becomes a samurai. Both of their wives suffer for their single-minded ambitions. In the end, they both realize that impractical ambition caused suffering, death, and there were heavy strings attached to their respective prizes. What they gained in the moment was not worth what they lost forever. There is also a second ghost, but this one is loving reminder to value what you already have.
Mizoguchi is responsible for several of the finest films Japan ever produced, and was known for his strong female characters and criticism of Japan's restrictive patriarchy that runs through nearly all of his work. His films are mainly about simple folks and the trials and inequities they face, and his style is both simple and beautiful.",5.0

It was apparent in The Life of Oharu, Kenji Mizoguchi’s previous project to Ugetsu, explored the parallels between his nation’s history and the present climate that surrounded society during production. Oharu dissected the suffering of women in a manner that felt powerfully brutal, and it was an initial experience into this auteur’s filmography that drove me with excitement to further explore his oeuvre.
Immediately I will state this, Ugetsu doesn’t carry with it the sweeping bravado and penetrating depth that Oharu managed to capture, and yet I still admire the concepts it decided to explore. Here we find Mizoguchi, once again, demonstrating the parallels between Japanese history and the country’s modern condition. Fresh off their defeat from the war, Mizoguchi encapsulated the sense of temptations and downfall that grew within men’s hearts in the midst of war, where their feeling of dissatisfaction were amplified and was easily disillusioned by the promises and opportunities of warfare, may that be to earn more money to garner them a more comfortable life, or to finally prove their worth as the head of the household by becoming a samurai or soldier to fulfill their desire for glory, revealing the insecure souls that linger beneath that needed to be fed. It seemed apparent through the omens that conveniently enter into their pathways for hopeful success that ill-fate would befall upon them and that such profit and glory would only be temporary.
Ugetsu exists as a warning to its viewers of the true nature of war, that its function is only to take lives and happiness away, and the longer that one becomes trapped in that spider-web, the more suffering would be inflicted.",3.5
"well, that sure was a mizoguchi movie. women suffer from the poor/selfish decisions of their men while the only punishment the men receive is becoming wiser/dealing with the grief of their wife's life being irrevocably changed. there were some really nice cinematographic moments, such as our first introduction to the spectral lady wakasa's manor. i also think if i was more familiar with japanese folklore/literature this would have been a more meaningful viewing for me, as i didn't like this one as much as street of shame (but it's still worth a watch).",3.5

"Ugetsu is the first film I've seen in a while that, after it was over, I felt compelled to just reflect on what I'd just taken in. I certainly found Ugestu to be a striking work while watching it, but it was on further reflection that the film's greatness grew in my eyes. The film is set during a period of civil war in 16th century Japan and focuses on two families who are displaced by conflict. Their choices following this displacement permanently shape their futures. At the most immediate level, Ugestu is about the chaos of war. The film presents the displacement of the main families and the ensuing chaos, but it also observes the general disorder and anarchy that comes to reign. Interesting and crucial as this content is, I'd argue the film is even more a feminist critique of patriarchal family structures and the dangers women face which men do not consider. What happens to both women following the departure of their husbands is fascinating and makes some pretty blunt statements. It's particularly interesting when one considers neither husband was deliberately acting malicious, in fact, selfish as their actions were, it can be argued that both men were trying to do well by their families, at least to some extent.
The film also takes on a spiritual aspect. Though it doesn't announce itself as a ghost story until fairly late, the film's gliding camera and a striking sequence on foggy waters create a sort of ethereal tone. When ghosts are revealed, it feels like the logical place this story had to go, not some left-field twist. Director Kenji Mizoguchi is known for his long takes and camera movements and both are used to brilliant effect here. One slowly becomes absorbed into the film, but Mizoguchi's hand is always subtle, to the point where one hardly realizes they've become enraptured in the film. There are also a lot of great sequences, including an impromptu murder where he single take excellently conveys the improvisation and clumsiness of the act, and the aforementioned stroll down a fog drenched river, which just dripping with atmosphere. And then there's the climax, which simultaneously feels huge while being remarkably simple and the ensuing denouement is highly intriguing. The performances are all strong and the film as a whole is a remarkably assured accomplishment.
I can't wait to watch Ugestu again.",4.5
"Starts out predictable and plain, then gets very frustrating and then gets very creepy. A great variety of experience. While a prime example of Women in Fridges, you do get time alone with these women and you feel their anguish. Nothing happens in the margins or between the pages.",4.0
"While Ugetsu ostensibly follows two peasants in 16th-century Japan as they blindly chase their desires (one for wealth, one to be a samurai), Mizoguchi is as attentive as ever to the toll on the women in their lives. Even the spirit temptress who lures Genjurō from his wife and child is a melancholy figure, trying to regain a life denied to her, not unlike the rest of the characters. Mizoguchi's long, sweeping camera moves and expert control of silence and music maintain a delicate, eerie tone throughout. The lake scene in particular is the movie in miniature: hauntingly pitched somewhere between real life and impressionism, a harbinger of real-world sorrow and danger emerging like a spirit from the fog.
The most impressive balance is between the realism and the supernatural elements. This may be presented as a fable, but it doesn't play like one until retrospect-- these seem like real lives in a real place, stately and evocative though it is. Some fables on film threaten to overlook the real human cost (in this case, of the two wives) in favor of the Message, but here Mizoguchi makes the nuances his biggest strength. If the first spirit's appearance serves a more obvious narrative purpose, the revelation of the second spirit is a real jolt and paradoxically brings Genjurō ever closer to reality. This is a ghost story whose ghosts emerge from the same desperate, war-torn world as we do, and represent real loss to the living.",4.0
"The parts where they're sowing are kind of like yeah this is obviously bad and you shouldn't do this, in a classic fairy tale fable type way.

"This is actually the second time I sat through this. For as much praise as Mizoguchi gets for his craftsmanship, it only truly impressed me in The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum.

You never learn anything about them outside of what is happening to them, and because of this, his films are essentially torture porn.",1.0

"""Lucros feitos em tempos de guerra nunca duram"", comenta um dos personagens a Miyagi, destacando a ganância tanto de Genjuro quanto de Tobei em conseguir riquezas em um momento de completa desolação. A guerra é sombria e as aspirações individuais se chocam com as realidades cruéis do destino. 
A opção de Mizoguchi pelos planos longos se tornam uma forma de fazer o espectador acessar esse mundo através dos gestos dos atores, mas principalmente pela forma com a qual a luz e a sombra são trabalhadas no filme. Uma das cenas que carrega isso como evidência é a travessia no lago Biwa. À medida que a neblina densa e a voz de Ohama são engendradas na imagem, uma atmosfera hipnótica é construída. 
Os personagens parecem flutuar entre realidades, fazendo com que a cena não sirva apenas como uma transição geográfica, mas também como um portal simbólico para o desconhecido e para as consequências imprevisíveis que aguardam os protagonistas. 
A habilidade de Mizoguchi ao construir esse momento é o que provoca algo muito semelhante a uma ruptura: se antes estávamos diante de um tom realista, agora tanto os personagens, quanto nós, espectadores, somos levados a um ambiente inseguro, por essência fantasmagórico, em que tudo se torna opaco. 
Nessa opacidade, Lady Wasaka leva Genjuro para um lugar que parece estar suspenso no tempo e no espaço, no limiar entre a vida e a morte. Ela começa a dançar, envolvendo não apenas o ceramista que a observa, como também o próprio espectador. Mizoguchi faz da sua câmera esse objeto de observação e transcendência, transformando o real em fantasmagórico através do domínio da mise-en-scène. 
As luzes diminuem, a música se torna mais grave e a voz de um homem ecoa, enquanto a câmera, em um movimento panorâmico lento, vai ao encontro de uma máscara que personifica o que é impalpável. A opção por esse lento movimento de câmera é capaz de provocar a imersão do espectador. O espírito de Lady Wasaka atrai Genjuro e quem assiste para o outro lado da imagem, para o mundo espectral.
Ao sair dele, ao dar-se conta de que tudo o que viveu era, na verdade, uma grande ilusão, o que resta é o retorno para casa e deparar-se com a desolação de um povo e de um espaço. Esse retorno acontece exatamente como foi previsto no início: com consequências. 
Ao finalizar o filme exatamente no mesmo espaço em que começou, Mizoguchi leva seus personagens para o reinício, mas sem qualquer possibilidade de serem o que eram antes. Espíritos e corpos foram dilacerados. Os fantasmas do passado permanecem no presente como assombração e como lembrança.

"I won’t become a friend of Mizoguchi‘s films. They are so impressively made, the sets, the soundtrack, the costumes, the number of actors and the sheer amount of commitment and passion are unmatched in a project like Ugetsu, but it never convinced me at any moment to feel something for anything or anyone on screen. 
I run into the same problem that I already faced when finishing Street of Shame: it‘s hard to find the proper rating. Ugetsu is slightly better in terms of story telling and scenery, nevertheless, I‘m more than sure that not a single film of Mizoguchi‘s will honestly win me over since I don’t feel any emotional or motivational connections to anything.

A adaptação aborda pontos essenciais como a ganância, orgulho, honra e a busca da real felicidade. Sua trilha sonora que acompanha cada cena majestosamente, apenas aumenta essa sensibilidade.
Mas no final, tudo parece voltar a se encaixar e temos um final incrível e profundo.",4.0
"Shoutout to Geordie Greep from Black Midi. He recommended this in the Amoeba Records video. I guess this film has a ""purrrrrrrpose"".
""Ugetsu"" is a ghostly picture about wants and desires. Tōbei dreams of becoming a samurai. He poses himself in a corner between being a peasant and a standup guy. His village is attacked and he's is forced to move on. Genjūrō, Tōbei, and all their wives flee across a lake where they find shelter. From there, they try to readjust until a mysterious woman appears. A spirit in which it decides to wish desires for both men (Genjūrō and Tōbei).
This film flashes by like the boat flowing through a panoramic lake. Even on a surface level, it's strangeness overflows the senses. Lady Wakasa appearing out of thin air adds even more of a mystery to this. All of the women have a purpose in their desires. While the men, don't have any avenues to express their feelings.
Yeah, this rocked.",4.0

100 Years 349/646
A movie I wish I could enjoy solely for its form, but one that continually gets bogged down in its narrative, preventing me from being fully immersed in the form. Much of the Sensation is there with all the moments detached from reality, evoking all the feelings they should — uneasy, but filled with a sense of wonder for their self-contained, otherworldly nature. That never really extended to the broad strokes of the narrative, unfortunately, as I'm left with a movie telling a story that exists primarily (and maybe solely) to express the moral of its fable, one I'm never interested in, and perpetually hoping will be entirely forgotten in favor of its image-crafting, which it frequently strays from to focus on — but the fable always comes back, and I'm stuck detached when I don't want to be.",2.5

"== Finale of my Japanuary ==
Over the last few weeks I tried to approach the legend Kenji Mizoguchi for the first time. This one is my fifth entry and I still don't dare to give a rating (more about that later). Realizing, the few previous films I watched in a short period of time were just enough to give me first impressions of his style, I think I appreciated this one not just more, but because of them and believe to see why he became such a popular name of his time.
In my opinion he was not only a strong, but definitely a clear voice in terms of pointing out social injustices. Many dialogues feel like characters documenting the circumstances they have to live in than having an actual talk. Woman demanding their rights and men on a desperate way collecting money for status, is a leitmotif of his works that isn't hard to recognize and offers a poignant criticism that is applicable for the whole japanese society during different ages is what makes these movies timeless after all and Mizoguchi one of the most consistent filmmaker. Consistent has also been the feminism of his works. Woman who weren't supposed to be in charge became the center of the stories being told and the eyes the world is being seen by.*
Even though Ugetsu is told through the point of view of men, the most relevant characters are also women, their needs and where the world controlled by men and their desire for money and power has brought them to. Based on the novel Ugetsu-Monogatari by Ueda Akinari from 1776, who adapted chinese folklore tales into japanese, Mizoguchi brought his own style into it. Set during Sengoku-Jidai (the civil war during the 16th century), we see the consequences the war has on different people (what could also be seen as the prologue for ""Onibaba"") with a supernatural element - a ghost lady starving for love she was never able to experience. Reality and dreams are being mixed and even though we get another very clear end, we were confused most of the time like the protagonists by what the dream and reality even is - or if the dream isn't just being constructed to survive reality.
The reason why I can't rate it yet is just because it also brings the negative aspects of its age and I'm in a dispute with myself. I see the brilliance it had back then and appreciate everything about it, but there were still few times my attention faded away. Like a traditional play it is more interesting than exciting in the first watch and gives you a lot of lectures to think about like how societal differences just fuel the horror of war and the greed for money will leave you in front of nothing and ending up with being an illusion all the time like the ghost lady was.


*(I'm also aware the sceneries Mizoguchi was creating were similiar to the traditinal No-plays or about the longer camera shots he is famous for as a filmmaker, but I don't know much about that tbh and am more interested in the narrative/writing.)",0.0
"A classic piece of Japanese cinema, and for good reason. Ugetsu is a straightforward morality tale of two men who didn't realize how good they had it, achieved more than they bargained for, and paid the price dearly for their overzealous ambitions. There are prostitutes, there is war, there is poverty, and there are ghosts--all the ingredients for a great mid-century Japanese movie.
And what makes Ugetsu so timeless is the relatability of our two protagonists. Sure, they don't pay enough attention to their families. But they also aspire to achieve more than their station in life. They strive to move to the big city and earn more money. They strive to work hard and received recognition, and even fame, for it. They want what a lot of us in capitalist societies want--fame and money.
But when that drive takes them too far, misfortune falls upon them and their families. Innocent lives are lost. Spirits are enraged. Love is spoiled. All because these guys wanted some more money and recognition.
They should have taken Kendrick Lamar's advice.",4.5

"My first foray into the oeuvre of Kenji Mizoguchi, many of whose famous works are available to stream in France on the website of the Franco-German channel Arte. One of Martin Scorsese's top ten favourite films, the American director gets a credit for ""consultation"" on the restored print. A ghost story and morality tale set in feudal Japan, it is most striking for its focus on the plight suffered by women during the Sengoku civil wars. While men are enticed away from their families by greed, extramarital bliss and foolish dreams of military glory, their wives bear the brunt.
It is arguably this dimension that sets it apart from the films of Akira Kurosawa - my only other reference point for films about feudal Japan! - and from many movies made in the early 1950s. Told with great economy and clarity, there is an unflinchingly modern sensibility to its themes, despite being based on Ueda Akinari's 18th century, parable-like tales of the same name. One wonders how such a film must have resonated with audiences in post-war Japan: painful to watch today, it must have been perceived as a virulent rebuke to a certain generation of men.",4.0

"I wasn’t sure what I was getting into with this film.  The film is very well directed and presented so I can easily see why it has become recognized as a classic.  I’m not sure what to say about it. Some of the imagery is quite striking. The story is very entertaining and haunting.  As soon as you get your footing with the film the runtime flies by. The soundtrack is so unique and unsettling. The characters seek pride and fortunes for the wrong reasons and also want to profit from war. They become so blinded by these vices that they neglect the things that are important to them. Ultimately that triggers the events of the story and it becomes a cautionary fable.  You can tell that the stories this is adapting are worthy classic Japanese literature that delivers a powerful message along with a great story. 
Great film. Highly recommend.",5.0
"I’m hoping to check out some of Kenji Mizoguchi’s films and thought I’d start with Ugetsu, and I absolutely loved it. 
This movie is crafted expertly. Every aspect of this delivers on its intention, whether thats the awe inspiring cinematography, the perfectly executed tonal shift from drama to ghost story, or the chilling and tense atmosphere, everything this sets out to do, it does it incredibly well. 
The use of music is great too. I find that sometimes in older films there can be an absence of a score and it can be rather noticeable. In Ugetsu the score benefits the movie massively, helping to evoke particular emotions or to ramp up tension. 
I think the tonal shift acts as a fantasy/mystery element whereas newer films would probably frame this same plot as a horror. But Ugetsu is all the better for taking it in this direction, one which maybe isn’t as common today. 
It’s both objectively and subjectively brilliant, a thoroughly enjoyable and enchanting tale. I feel like this is one that everyone would enjoy in some capacity.",4.5

"Ugetsu (1953), directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, tells the tale of a potter named Genjuro (Masayuki Mori), his wife Miyagi (Kenuyo Tanaka) and their adorable little son named Genichi (Ichisaburo Sawamura), who live and profit during the 16th century civil war of Japan. They make ends meet by selling pots to soldiers. 
They also have a married couple living next to them, Tobei (Eitarō Ozawa), and Omaha (Mitsuko Mito), that the film follows too. Tobei dreams of being a samurai and bringing honour to his families name, but it’s immediately clear he’s a fool and will get himself killed. 
The peasants do their best to survive under the harsh brutality of war. The subjugation of the working classes are fully displayed, and it’s hard not to root for them. At the same time, you can see that the money they earn is slowly corrupting the husbands and disaster is inevitable. At first they are happy, but it’s not long before the selfish, greedy actions only exasperates their already dire circumstances. 
This is a Moralistic tale, almost Shakespearean, that has a voyage and return structure, and feels very complete during its 96 minutes duration. 
There’s also a surprising third act that blends genres, and works really well, reminding one of Kwaidan by Kobayashi.
It’s also quite beautiful, with a wonderful attention to detail to the characters daily lives. The costumes range from rags to opulence, all giving an authentic impression. 
The performances are wonderful and many of the actors have starred in other Japanese classics such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, The Human Condition, and The Face of Another.

"Wow, this is an absolute classic, and easily one of the pillars of the Golden Age of Japanese Cinema, and I'm surprised I hadn't heard much about it before sitting down to watch yesterday. Kenji Mizoguchi crafted something brilliant and breathtaking, with lots of space to imagine and interpret.
The story follows two couples who know each other from their village. Genjūro, a potter, and his wife Miyagi, as well as Tobei and his wife Ohama. Genjūro wants to sell as much pottery as possible, but Miyagi cautions him against trying to make profits during turbulent times, with an apparent attack forthcoming. Tobei has big dreams of becoming a famous and decorated samurai, with Ohama thinks is absurd for many reasons. When soldiers arrive to take all the men of the village into forced labor camps, the two couples barely escape, and even manage to salvage the latest batch of pottery for sale in the next town over. Genjūro leaves Miyagi and their young son behind, against her will, assuring them that they will be fine. Ohama refuses to leave Tobei's side. Once they arrive, the pottery sells very well and Tobei uses his share of the money to buy armor, and sneaks into a group of samurai, leaving Ohama behind. Both men have made selfish choices to leave their families, and their wives soon suffer horrible consequences of those decisions. The story proceeds from there, dipping heavily into the realm of fantasy, and ends on a very emotional note.
I was simply blown away by everything from Mizoguchi's direction to the acting of the four principals (Mitsuko Mito as Ohama, Eitaro Ozawa as Tobei, Kinuyo Tanaka as Miyagi and Masayuki Mori as Genjūro), as well as the musical score and the stunning cinematography. Thematically, the film is a treasure trove, offering commentary on arrogance, selfishness, greed, militarism, life and death, appreciation for what you have, the role of women in the family and more. The fantasy elements of the film give it a lot of layers, and from a technical standpoint those scenes were marvelously executed in a way that keeps us on our toes before eventually nailing us to our seats.
I was truly in awe of this, and need to revisit it later. I want to say so much more, but would rather discuss it with others who have seen it. I couldn't possibly recommend this any higher. It's tragic, beautiful, powerful, funny, and insightful, and deserves its spot on any all time list it finds itself on.",5.0
"Existe uma evocação de uma tradição narrativa singular do Japão, uma fusão de folclore esotérico e de ensinamentos da espiritualidade budista e xintoísta. Algo tão particular que em alguns momentos parece ser a realização cinematográfica de uma tradição oral popular.

"The last time I saw this, I must have been twelve, and I remember liking it a whole lot more back then. Now, I was struck with how broad it all seemed. It's certainly of a piece with everything I've been watching lately. It is also a story about commoners that get caught up in the chaos of war. The difference is that Genjuro and Tobei think they can get ahead in the midst of all this. The story is in how their ambition blinds them to the needs of their loved ones, who end up suffering because of their absence.
There are still moments that I found really beautiful. The boat ride will forever be one of the most beautiful things ever captured on film. But yeah, it just felt kind of loud and unsophisticated. The movie often feels like it's just rushing to the next beat. And the themes are just kind of spelled out by the characters, who don't really have a whole lot of depth to them. The men are ambitious, and the women are wary of their ambition. These people are changed by the end, but we don't see a lot of the process. The film just jumps to the next thing.",3.5

They're both tempeted by their desires in the form of infamy achieved as a samurai and the other man by a spirit who is able to give him a luxurious life.

What they saw here of merit is beyond me, so maybe the burden of proof is on fans of the film. What I experienced was an excruciatingly dull and plodding story, little-to-no-events of worth, a lot of hardpan scrabbling around in medieval Japan to no purpose, no emotional investment in any of the fools involved, and a wan, flaccid supernatural element that arrives far too late to amend what came before.",1.0
"Ugetsu Monogatari es la muestra de la capacidad que tiene el cine para descomponer al ser humano y a la vez darle la esperanza de ver con otros ojos lo hermoso de vivir.
Kenji Mizoguchi plasma la historia de dos campesinos cuya ambición por hacerse rico o convertirse en samurái puede más que la realidad social del Japón feudal de los finales del siglo XVI y la opinión de sus esposas, consagrando así esta propuesta como una de las más importantes obras del cine japonés.
Para cualquier cinéfilo es fácil evidenciar todo lo grandioso que hay en Ugetsu Monogatari, cinta que cuenta con un magnífico apartado técnico, relevancia cultural y sobretodo una narrativa que mezcla historia, realismo y una de las más hermosas secuencias del mundo sobrenatural que nos ha dejado el séptimo arte.
Un verdadero ejemplo de cómo manejar la realidad y lo sobrenatural con un trasfondo que contiene mucho contenido moral y filosófico, cuya apreciación aumentará visionado tras visionado.

"My first film by Kenji Mizoguchi. I'm still fairly new to this period of Japanese cinema, although I've dipped into some films by Kurosawa, Ozu, and Kobayashi at this point, so it's interesting to see where Mizoguchi fits into the picture. This film, of all of those, feels the most like something Kobayashi would make, or more accurately, it feels like something from Kwaidan, albeit shot more naturalistically and not so much like an unsettling theatrical production. I guess it's like the humanism of a Kurosawa film applied to a Kwaidan-like ghost story, which is cool. Both of the main storylines in this film have a definite fairy tale/bedtime story arc centered around a clear message of morality to them, with two men each abandoning their wives/families to pursue some other interest that, ultimately, is not what they should have been doing, and having to experience the consequences and grow from their mistakes. The cinematography is, like I've come to expect from the Japanese films in the Criterion Collection of this time period, really superb, with more than just a few memorable shots and sequences (the big standout is the boat sequence, but there are several others as well). Overall I liked this movie but I don't quite yet get the almost hyperbolic praise of Mizoguchi - it was definitely a solidly told story, but I think I will need to see more of his films to get a more solid perspective on his position in Japanese cinema.",4.0
"Ugetsu follows the lives of two families: Genjuro, his wife Miyagi, and their young son, and Tobei and his wife Ohama. Our leading men each have desires. Genjuro, a farmer whose side hustle is making pottery, developed a gluttonous need for wealth, which blossomed from his initial desire to provide for his family and spoil his wife. After a successful trip selling his wares, he is ecstatic and craves more. ""Money is everything,"" Genjuro says, ""without it life is hard and hope dies."" Later, he opines, ""War is good for business."" Tobei, on the other hand, wishes to become a fierce and revered samurai, despite his general bufoonery and the degrading remarks from his wife, amongst others. Ohama is perhaps brusque in her delivery, but it seems as if her sentiments are accurate: Tobei is not samurai material.
And all the while the heart of the film, Miyagi, dutifully plods away. She encourages her husband while reminding him that their peace and joy are worth more than silver coins or extravagant kimonos. She pleads with him, time after time, to no avail. While in other instances one might view Miyagi as the wet blanket of the ghost story, I can't help but be utterly and completely wooed by Kinuyo Tanaka's performance, her earnest transparency so visceral.
Ugetsu is about desires turned to false pride, deceptions and distractions, regret and evaporated dreams. The culmination of these concepts is realized in Lady Wakasa, an ethereal ""woman"" with a commanding presence, who craves the things she never had in her waking life, the antithesis of Miyagi. She is as hypnotizing as the reverberating bells that echo throughout the depths of her manor.
A gripping film, yet slightly too condensed. I felt as if it could have used more time to breathe fully into each sector of the story, and perhaps a scene or two more revolving around Miyagi and Ohama. That said, it was assuredly a touching and at times grand film experience.",3.5

Japan
A simple morality tale of greed and love, but told so well it is supremely entertaining just on a surface level. Do not seek fame for fame's sake, and don't be so inflamed for your lust of money that you sacrifice your family. This is a textbook kind of film that people are looking for when they say they want to get into foreign films. It's extremely accessible and the thematics at play are always evident being the major forces propelling the plot.
Most scenes involving the Lady Wakasa were highpoints for me. Without spoiling anything, I can say there were a few moments that that chilled me to the bone. Her disembodied ""father"" singing through the armor made my skin crawl.",4.0
"Upon reading excerpts from Ueda Akinari's Tales of Moonlight and Rain and then revisiting Mizoguchi's adaptation, Ugetsu, I couldn't help but appreciate it more on a cultural level. Paradoxically, understanding the details in Ugetsu's design makes me less enthusiastic about it as a whole. It's a great film, make no mistake about that, and if one has any doubts, just look at that boat scene... beautiful. It's just that I once liked this more for my many questions. Overall, it's a satisfying, albeit overwhelming experience. What I really enjoy about this film is the bitter-sweet nature of the story and how it ties in with the supernatural coexisting with the lead characters. The ghosts seem far removed from one's common perception of ghosts, but it's not like they seem too human either. There's something unsettling but sensual about the film's depiction of the unknown.",4.0

Its an amazing film experience, that will be even more rewarding with multiple viewings, an emotionally riveting film that in the first twenty minutes takes some time to set up the characters, and could do without an exposition scene, but besides that, i am really looking forward to the Bluray Criterion Release.",4.0
"As fantastical as it is subtle, Ugetsu is a multi-faceted work that refuses to reveal its intent until the very end of its twisting, unpredictable narrative.
The film follows four people in feudal Japan: a farmer with ambitions to further his pottery business, his loyal wife who only wants them and their son to live a quiet and happy life, their foolish neighbor who has aspirations to become a samurai, and his loyal wife who is constantly trying to pull his head down from the clouds. During a time of war, the four of them are separated, each of them going down different literal and metaphorical paths to learn the same lessons and values along the way.
From the very start of the film, it makes certain to let the viewers know that this is an adaptation of folklore, didactic tales that intend to teach something. Created in the wake of World War II, I wasn't surprised to see this, so I set my expectations accordingly. But what surprised me is that as archaic as Ugetsu may seem, with its period-piece setting, the score straight from the Sengoku period of Japan, and folklore background, the film is timeless in its execution. At times, even modern. This, coupled with the fact that it touches upon many, many genres (from heart-warming romance to realistic period piece to exciting war film to bone-chilling horror), keeps the film unpredictable and engaging.
That aspect is largely in part due to the four branching narratives of the story. From the beginning there is a looming sense of death or destruction, aided again by the atmospheric score and the subtle exposition of a forthcoming war. In the first act of the film, the protagonists escape misfortune after misfortune, mounting this tension of dread until all four of them finally go their separate ways, dispersing that tension as their individual journeys take center stage; it makes the entire first act of the film feel like a prologue, setting the stage for the rest of its 90 minute runtime.
From here on out, the pace is lightning-fast. I was worried that the subplots would get too entangled or too irrelevant to each other, considering each one is a different story involving a different person, but instead, by the last 20 minutes of the film, they all tied together beautifully, interlacing like yard to form a cohesive thread. This has got to be some of the tightest writing I've ever seen; not a second is wasted.
Unlike my preconceptions of what a film from this era should flow like, the film's fast pace hammers in its myriad of themes and tonal shifts in a way that surprisingly meshes together flawlessly. As aforementioned, the film felt almost modern in its execution at times. I was expecting something extremely archaic in its didactic nature, specifically characters laying out the moral of the story and so forth.
But instead, director Kenji Mizoguchi allows the ideas and lessons to be shown. His grasp on visual storytelling is a firm one, using long, tracking shots to emphasize the importance of a character beat, or silent static shots to emphasize the loss, change of something in the script.
Like the story itself, the cinematography of this film is hyper-realistic, dreamlike in quality, but still grounded. It all boils down to a narrative that doesn't feel too much like a fantasy but doesn't exactly feel too much like a straight-up period drama either.
Ugetsu is a masterwork of Japanese cinema. This is a prime example of adaptation done right; taking the core of the source material, repurposing it to fit into a new medium, and adding new elements that breathes new life into that narrative. It's gorgeously-shot, timelessly executed, and poignant in its delivery of the core message. It's cinema at its most concentrated.
Like a ghostly enchantress, Ugetsu is beautiful and bewitching, dubious and surprising, and very, very hard to truly pin down.",5.0
"There's a lot to unpack here and I don't even know where to begin so let's just say that this is one of the greatest films of all time and leave it at that.
Actually pause, I will say this. Mizoguchi's effortless blending of the fantasy (through cultural Japanese spiritual lore, I'm actually really hesitant to refer to those sections as fantasy because of that) and harsh reality (the effects of war on men and the consequences women face as a result of that) are done so magnificently and the cinematography is so beautifully rendered throughout.
I just really love this movie and I really just want to have a discussion with someone about it because I don't want to write five paragraphs here.",5.0
"My 2nd film by Mizoguchi is just as melancholy as my first experience of his film...Sansho.
Ugetsu is almost a realistic tale of 2 husbands who desire ambition more than family and realise their mistakes a little too late..
The thing I also admire about classical Japanese films from the 50s is that they all seem to have morals within them, Mizoguchi's Sansho, Kurosawa's Ikiru and many films by Ozu. They all depict the realistic struggles or problems within a family and how the characters cope up with it.
Fantastic acting performance by the entire cast, all were Phenomenal..
The score is too depressing, almost at the verge of irritation.
Overall, I felt Sansho was better would recommend it for people who have never seen a Mizoguchi film but Ugetsu is morally and structurally equal to Sansho.",4.5

"One of Kenji Mizoguchi's last films (he made seven more from 1953-1956), Ugetsu is an attentively created work of art.

Mizoguchi's adept handling of the more supernatural elements invoke a sense of wonder instead of bewilderment, and perfectly portray the overarching spirituality of 16th century Japan.
Diligent farmers Genjûrô (Masayuki Mori) and Tôbee (Eitarô Ozawa) have dreams much larger than their current circumstances, and decide to use the impending civil war to their advantage. Genjûrô's hobby, pottery, pays off when he is able to make more money than he or his conscientious wife, Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka), have ever seen. Enlisting the help of Tôbee and his wife, Ohama (Mitsuko Mito), Genjûrô and his wife put everything they have into one large batch of pottery. When the army arrives in their village ahead of schedule, they must flee into the mountains – but not before they gather up the freshly-baked pottery. Going ahead with their plans, Genjûrô leaves his wife and son, and sets off across a lake with Tôbee and Ohama to strike it rich in a bigger town.

"""Ugetsu"", das wohl bekannteste Werk des japanischen Regisseurs Kenji Mizoguchi, ist eines der großen Meisterwerke des japanischen Kinos. In seiner recht schmalen Laufzeit von sechsundneunzig Minuten gelingt es Mizoguchi so unheimlich viel über den Menschen und sein Begehren zu erzählen, dabei aber keineswegs nur oberflächlich zu bleiben. Das Thema des Begehrens äußerst sich in diesem Werk in verschiedenen Ausdrücken. Zum Einen in Form von Geld und Besitz, was sich vor allem durch die Figur des Tobei bemerkbar macht, der nach Aufmerksamkeit sich sehnt. Für diese opfert er sein Familienleben auf, da er erst als Gehilfe von Genjuro beim Verkauf der Töpfe sich bereichern will, damit er genügend Geld besitzt, um sich als Samurai einzukaufen, und später, wenn er dann erfolgreich ist, lässt er es sich auch sichtlich gut gehen und gibt mit seinem Erfolg auch an. Dabei ist sehr interessant zu sehen, wie sehr er sich aufgrund des Erfolges menschlich verändert - die Veränderung des Menschen durch Anerkennung ist generell eines der zentralen Themen des Werkes. Es ist in diesem Handlungsabschnitt auch sehr schön herauszusehen, wie Erfolg oftmals nicht verdient ist, sondern auch viel mit Glück und List zu tun hat, da Tobei durch die Ermordung des Samuraigenerals an diesen Ruhm gelangt, obwohl er diesen eigentlich nur hinterlistig ermordet hat. Des Weiteren spiegelt sich das Thema der Begierde auch in Form von Genjuro wieder. Bei ihm jedoch nicht in Form von Ruhm oder Reichtum, sondern durch Liebe und dem Begehren nach Wakasa. Man merkt schon bei ihrer ersten Begegnung, dass etwas Magisches zwischen den beiden herrscht. Dies lässt sich natürlich zu einem sehr großen Teil auf die Inszenierungsweise von Mizoguchi zurückführen, wie er diese Szene filmt, der Ausdruck von Genjuro aber auch nicht zu vergessen die mysteriösen und magischen Klänge von Hayasaka, die dieser Szene erst so richtig ihre Magie verleiht. Der Kontext ihrer Romanze macht jedoch den weitaus wichtigeren Bestandteil davon aus, was Mizoguchi mit diesem Strang zum Gesamtbild hinzufügen möchte. Denn es ist keinesweges bloß so, dass es so wirkt, als wäre etwas Magisches zwischen den beiden, nein, es ist auch etwas Magisches zwischen den beiden, da Wakasa, wie sich im Verlaufe herausstellt, eigentlich ein Geist ist. Man könnte aber auch genauso sagen, dass es der Wunsch und die Sehnsucht von Genjuro nach einer Verliebtheit ist, ein Traum, was die Ästhetik in diesen Szenen ebenfalls unterstreicht, da sie von einer wahren und natürlichen Schönheit zeugt, wie die Einstellung mit dem Baum in der Landschaft und wo im Hintergrund ein Gewässer zu sehen ist. Es ist auch der Traum, der im Krieg ensteht - indem der Film spielt -, nach etwas Besserem, nach einem schönen Leben. Genjuros Fantasien treibt Mizoguchi jedoch erst in der letzten Szene auf die Spitze, die dann den Traum und die Wunschfantasie als solche entlarvt und Genjuro mit der knallharten Realität konfrontieren lässt. Eben jenes trifft auch auf Tobei zu, der nach seiner Zeit des Ruhmes ebenfalls zur Vernunft wieder kommt und feststellt, dass ihm nichts so wichtig ist, wie seine Liebe zu seiner Frau. Und dies ist dann eben auch eine der großen Kernaussagen des Films, der Wunsch nach etwas Besserem, der sich nicht manifestieren kann, wegen der harten Realität, die Tobei und Genjuro früher einholen wird, als es ihnen lieb ist. Es ist aber auch die Entlarvung der dümmlichen Blickweise auf den Krieg, die Entlarvung, den Krieg als eine Möglichkeit zu begreifen, sich selbst etwas zu beweisen. Darüber hinaus aber auch noch sehr viel mehr. So ist zum Beispiel sehr spannend, wie Mizoguchi noch in einer anderen Hinsicht über die Liebe nachdenkt. Denn in der Gestalt des Geistes Wakasa und Genjuros Anziehung zu ihr lässt sich noch sehr gut ablesen, was er eigentlich an ihr liebt. Es ist nämlich nicht ihr Charakter, es ist der Körper. Diese Tatsache spielt für ihn jedoch so lange keine Rolle, bis er ihren wahren Charakter durchschaut hat. So entlarvt Mizoguchi also auch das oberflächliche Bild, das viele Männer haben, wenn sie sich in eine Frau verlieben, da es ihnen nur um das Äußerliche geht, was sie solange dulden, bis sie den abstoßenden Charakter der Frau nicht mehr länger ausblenden können. So ist ""Ugetsu"" ein hevorragendes Werk über die menschliche Begierde, seine Wünsche und Träume, die er aufgrund der der Härte der Realität nicht manifestieren kann, weshalb sie idell bleiben müssen. In dieser Hinsicht also auch ein ziemlich interessantes Werk, das über das Kino nachdenkt, indem wir unsere Träume zumindest für eine kurze Zeit träumen können, ehe der Film endet bzw. wir aus diesem Traum erwachen.
ENGLISH VERSION
""Ugetsu"", probably the best-known work by Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi, is one of the great masterpieces of Japanese cinema. In its relatively short running time of ninety-six minutes, Mizoguchi manages to tell so much about people and their desires, without remaining superficial. The theme of desire is expressed in various expressions in this work. On the one hand in the form of money and possessions, which is particularly noticeable through the figure of Tobei, who longs for attention. He sacrifices his family life for this, as he first wants to enrich himself as Genjuro's assistant by selling the pots so that he has enough money to become a samurai, and later, when he is successful, he visibly allows himself to do so do well and also brags about his success. It is very interesting to see how much he changes as a person because of his success - the change in people through recognition is generally one of the central themes of the work. It is also very nice to see in this section of the plot how success is often not earned, but also has a lot to do with luck and cunning, since Tobei gains this fame through the murder of the samurai general, even though he actually only murdered him deceitfully. Furthermore, the theme of desire is also reflected in the form of Genjuro. For him, however, not in the form of fame or wealth, but through love and the desire for Wakasa. You can tell from their first meeting that there is something magical between the two. Of course, this can be attributed to a large extent to Mizoguchi's way of filming this scene, Genjuro's expression but not forgetting the mysterious and magical sounds of Hayasaka, which really gives this scene its magic. However, the context of their romance is the far more important part of what Mizoguchi wants to add to the overall picture with this strand. Because it is by no means just that it seems as if there is something magical between the two, no, there is also something magical between the two, since Wakasa, as it turns out in the course, is actually a ghost. But you could also say that it is Genjuro's wish and longing for falling in love, a dream, which the aesthetics in these scenes also underline, as they testify to a true and natural beauty, like the shot with the tree in the landscape and where a body of water can be seen in the background. It is also the dream that arises in war - where the film takes place - for something better, for a beautiful life. However, Mizoguchi only takes Genjuro's fantasies to the extreme in the last scene, which then exposes the dream and the wishful fantasy as such and lets Genjuro confront the harsh reality. The same applies to Tobei, who also comes to his senses after his time of fame and realizes that nothing is as important to him as his love for his wife. And this is one of the big core messages of the film, the desire for something better that cannot manifest itself because of the harsh reality that will catch up with Tobei and Genjuro sooner than they would like. But it is also the exposure of the stupid way of looking at war, the exposure of seeing war as an opportunity to prove something to yourself. But beyond that there is also much more. For example, it is very exciting how Mizoguchi thinks about love in a different way. Because in the figure of the ghost Wakasa and Genjuro's attraction to her you can clearly see what he actually loves about her. It's not her character, it's her body. However, this fact doesn't matter to him until he understands her true character. In this way, Mizoguchi also exposes the superficial image that many men have when they fall in love with a woman, as they are only concerned with appearances, which they tolerate until they can no longer ignore the woman's repulsive character. ""Ugetsu"" is an excellent work about human desire, his wishes and dreams, which he cannot manifest due to the harshness of reality, which is why they have to remain ideal. In this respect, it's a pretty interesting work that thinks about cinema in that we can dream our dreams at least for a short time before the film ends or we wake up from this dream.",0.0
"This film is wildly ahead of its time, especially in regards to the soundscape it creates. The eerie drawl would fit perfectly in a modern horror movie, so to hear it employed in a film from the 50s was quite unique. Also ahead of its time in its portrayal of women. As much as I love Akira Kurosawa, there is a glaring absence of women in most of his films, so to see multiple women with large roles and the critique of masculine urges was really great to see in a classic Japanese film.

"""Ugetsu - Erzählungen unter dem Regenmond"" ist einer der schönsten Filme der Welt. So beschrieb ihn ein Arte-Portrait von Mizoguchi. Ich kann das nur unterstreichen: Schrecken und Grausamkeit, Tragik, Verlangen, Liebe und Unglück sind hier fein verwoben und visuell spürbar umgesetzt.
Zwei Paare im Bürgerkrieg des 16. Jahrhunderts driften auseinander. Die Männer folgen den Verlockungen des Erfolgs und des Ruhms. Einer verliert seine gierige Händler-Seele an eine Dämon-Adlige, der andere schließt sich einem Samurai-Klan an und mordet feige für den vermeintlichen Ruhm. Den beiden Frauen, die versuchen die Familien zusammenzuhalten wird übel mitgespielt. Entehrt und in die Prostitution gedrängt oder überfallen für ein paar Reisbällchen.
Man kann die Geschichte und ihre Moral als Ode an das einfache und harte Arbeiterleben verstehen.
In Erinnerung bleibt aber vor allem die Präsenz der adeligen Dämonin, die ganz und gar natürlich und amutig (also gar nicht - ei in westlichen Sehgewohnhiten erwartbar - geisterhaft) dargestellt wird. Ihre unglückliche Suche nach Erlösung durch eine Liebe ist fast ebenso schmerzhaft und tragsich erlebbar.",5.0

"Normally something as full of despair as the cinema of Mizoguchi would leave a very nasty taste in my mouth. The deep pain that screams throughout so much of his work is tempered not just by how richly beautiful every film is, but also by how fate operates in his world.
There's a tiny drop of jet black humour in the bitter ironies of how fate operates in a Mizoguchi film. We're just as likely to see characters held aloft as we are to see their every hope dashed, and it's in their upward swings that they often become the most devastated.
One way that Mizoguchi is able to pull off not one but two of the most successful 'but she's been dead for 10 yeeeaaaarrss' bits in the business is by how much the ghost story is simply an extension of everything else in the film, another of the delusions the male characters have about how easily their miserable lot can be turned around.
Masayuki Mori is such a magnificent screen presence, he has so much of the grit and darkness of certain old Hollywood stars, but it's hard to think of any American actors that did so well to cut a pathetic figure as Mori did.
The music has a brilliant unearthly, scorching quality, no more so than in the scene where the truth about the ethereal palace comes to the fore. The score has the sound of the whole world being torn apart.",5.0

"Is it truly possible for a life of comfortable mediocrity to actually be comfortable? Or will ambitions boundless as the ocean always present themselves, always making you question why you're not a famous writer or whether your life partner is truly the best you could do? These ambitions come out in familiar ways, graspings for fame, money, sex, and the other valueless totems we've tricked ourselves into believing in, but are these not just the forms we've latched onto to represent our deeper yearnings, our search for that ethereal, effervescent substance called ""meaning""?
Unfortunately, it seems that search can only lead us to phantasmagoric mansions and ghostly ladies, figments of our own mind, that lead us farther and farther away from the meaning already present in our mediocrity. And what if that search is a one-way road, and when we realize how blessed we've always been, we come home to find those blessings have already passed us by?",4.0

"Fables tend to have simple narratives with rich themes and deep lessons. Such is the approach taken in Kenzi Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu, an adaptation of two stories from an 18th century short story collection. 
Combining period drama and ghost story, the film tells the story of two men who are “too stupid to learn except through misfortune.” One tries to profit off of the ongoing civil war by selling his pottery in densely populated areas, eventually finding himself seduced by a dangerous force. The other seeks the glory of becoming a samurai at the expense of his marriage. Whether it’s money, power, or sex, both men ignore and take their wives - both of whom know where their husbands’ passions will lead them well before they actually face the consequences of their actions - for granted. Is it a byproduct of an ongoing war or is it simply “the way of the world,” as stated by the spirit of one of the film’s innocent victims?
Mizoguchi does an excellent job of using folklore and the supernatural to attack the patriarchy. His characters are constantly shrouded in fog, literally and/or figuratively, and his camera is always moving around ominously. For most of the film, I found myself pleased with the sleek visuals and eerie score, but not necessarily enamored with the intertwining stories themselves. But as the stories reached their crescendos and the fog cleared, I found myself thrilled with and stimulated by the lessons Ugetsu was teaching and the way it was doing so.

"“Success always comes with a price in suffering”
Despite the interesting ideas of male greed and the consistency in the themes, this one fell just a little short for me. I like when a movie can do many things at once and at times Mizoguchi did a great job maintaining the multilayered plot. However around halfway through the film becomes a little clunky as far as the pacing. We don’t see certain characters for long stretches of time, and when we finally do get to them my brain was still stuck in the previous storyline. I felt that this hindered my emotional connection to the movie despite there only being four characters who I was meant to be invested in.
Like I said the themes never felt unnatural. Even as the story got messy the messages stayed the same. There were also some incredible scenes of horror which were enhanced by the outstanding cinematography. And despite knowing they were probably only used to make editing easier I did really love the long takes. Overall it’s a little messy, but still quite creative. I do plan on watching much more of Mizoguchi’s filmography.

"Throughout 'Ugetsu' ran an intensely eerie feeling, created by its atmospheric visuals and sounds but also my expectations of it. Not just as a ghost story, but also from the style of folk story it established itself as early on. It was deeply tragic throughout and mesmerisingly tied into ideas around war, desire and greed.
Whilst the tragedy was deeply personal it was well woven into the wider war surrounding the narrative, and that also allowed the occasional glimpse into the suffering of others too.",4.5
"wartime: bad for men, worse for women! a beautiful, terrible film; constructed out of pure (bad) feeling — angry and cynical and often overwhelmingly sad. the ending is somewhat hopeful, at least compared to everything else in the film, but still steeped in melancholy and regret. i imagine this would be a rather crushing experience if mizoguchi’s form weren’t so elegant and note-perfect on every level. a gorgeously designed film, filled to the brim with indelible shots. the camera movement is simple and understated but stunning more often than not, sliding into each new, spectacular composition without a hitch...idk, this is kind of a hard movie to write about. it never hit, like, transcendent levels for me for whatever reason but it’s also basically a perfect object",0.0

"’Ugetsu’ did enough for me to be quite invested throughout but not much other than that. Probably the biggest reason for my underwhelming reaction was the tonal whiplash created by a narrative that isn’t as cohesive as I hoped it would be. The film is only around 90 minutes long. As the four main characters split up somewhere around the middle, we keep following each of their stories. Having a little bit of every storyline really broke the pacing for me and I would have wished the film to be either longer or focus on fewer characters. The another issue I found with the structure is that the different storylines are tonally quite different. Tobei is a whimsical and rather comedic character, what the wives go through is horrifying and melodramatic and Genjuro’s storyline is very mystical and borderline horror. With the dense runtime, the film keeps cutting from one tone to another at a pace that was just too much for me. I really appreciated the use of music in the film and I found some long takes to be rather impressive.",2.0

"A ghost story and morality tale about the value of family vs greed of personal gain.
We follow two men who abandon their wives (and child in one’s case) — one wants to be a samurai and one is bewitched by the ghost of a wealthy woman. They each eventually see the error of their ways, but not until after tragedy has struck their abandoned spouses. 
A thing I thought was interesting was how it portrayed the sort of “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” mentality of these men. There’s complexity to both of them, in that they do genuinely care for and love their wives, but they are blindsided by their own ambitions. The bewitched man is shown conflicted by the ghost’s proposal, but he still goes ahead and marries her. And I believe that the samurai guy genuinely thought that part of what was motivating his actions were to impress his wife. He’s a real dummy and seemed shocked that she had fallen on hard times in his absence. I think the scene where they meet again is one of my favorites. But then the question is: How much can you say you really love someone if you’re able to push their needs out of your mind so easily?
I also appreciated how desperate and starving the soldiers were depicted when they raided the villages. Not that it excuses their horrendous actions, but it really paints a picture of a time when things were really rough in Japan. 
Machiko Kyo stood out as the elegant ghost, having just seen her in THE FACE OF ANOTHER, and her being one of the more memorable TORA-SAN Madonnas. However, I was most moved by Miyagi, played by Kinuyo Tanaka (another TORA-SAN Madonna btw), who is left by the man who marries the ghost. Her plight was easily sympathetic, but it’s her final scene where you can see the pain in her face after reuniting with her husband that really grabbed me.",4.5

"Ugetsu, a film which takes place on the border of modern life, also takes place on the border of the real and the mythic. It resembles other stories in that way -- Takhata's The Tale of Princess Kaguya, also based on an old folk-tale, the stories of Homer of course, and certainly Hamlet too (another modern ghost tale.) But Ugetsu nonetheless holds a distinct place in that story type, in part because of its haunting exploration of the spiritual realm, and in part because of the aesthetic prowess of a Japanese master we have yet to visit on my page, Kenji Mizoguchi. Mizoguchi's style is fluid, and knows when to use fades, sets, and effects to re-enforce the atmosphere of the world he is crafting. The style of the film gradually immerses itself in dream-like qualities, playing on the line between real and imagined for the audience in the same way it plays for the protagonist, Genjuro. Mizoguchi's style, despite using few cuts, is less patient than Ozu's, and perhaps a bit more Hollywood. But like Ozu, he knows to use the film's form to create sensation. And the sensation of Ugetsu is an unforgettable one.
Modernity is a violent force. The people of Japan, who have witnessed the devastation of two nuclear bombs, are perhaps more keenly aware of this than most. Indeed, throughout our examinations of Japanese cinema we have seen the way modernity seems to commit a sort of violence against the traditions of Japan, which are rooted in a relationship to the divine, the natural, and the spiritual. Princess Mononoke, Only Yesterday, Ikiru, Floating Weeds, Perfect Blue, even the American film Lost in Translation, seem to tap into this sentiment. Ugetsu dramatizes the violence by embodying it in the spirit of conquest, of raping and pillaging. The film features multiple rape scenes, and on the border of all that occurs for these characters, we seem to be eternally conscious that ""warriors"" are just beyond the frame ready to take and exploit our heroes at any given moment. The soldiers, in that sense, are not simply characters in this world, but symbols of time marching forward, of modern life conquering the traditional life. Those soldiers destroy the village of the heroes, they ""corrupt"" their women, they force them to re-locate to the crowded city in order to live. The logic of this world and its culture also re-enforce the idea that conquest, a sort of survival of the fittest, is inherently justified. Look, for example, at the rewards our jester-hero Tobee is granted after he sneaks up and kills a samurai general. He has fought him by surprise, cowardly really, but because he presents his head to the leader, he is rewarded and made a rich hero. Surely the people of this world have forgotten something essential about the values and traditions of their old world. The key is that while the world has lost something, Mizoguchi, the artist, has not, and the spiritual and mythic layers he has embedded in the film keep us conscious of that. The past is present in the film Ugetsu, that is the essential ingredient in its magic.
But if modernity is an intrinsically violent force, that violence is widely legitimized by capitalism. It is capitalism which creates the hope, the optimism, the thought that even a village peasant, with the right skill for pottery, can become a rich king. We have seen this exact same idea at the beginning of Takahata's Princess Kaguya. It is capitalism which drives the people to embrace the system so unquestioningly that they overlook the values and traditions that were once essential to living a happy and balanced life. The genius of Ugetsu is that our heroes are no less susceptible to these desires than any of those around them. Look at Tobee, the fool sidekick who dreams of being a samurai instead of a peasant. He wishes to be just like the very same people who commit violence against him and mock him. He cannot look past his ambitions, his vision of glory, of being loved instead of mocked. And look at Genjuro, who, once he tastes the profits of his work as a potter, is increasingly easily seduced by his obsession with money and prestige. Indeed, he daydreams about buying his wife a kimono so grand and expensive, that he forgets to take care of his wife in real life.
The tragedy at the core of the film is that humans have an endless capacity to be seduced by dreams. But the dreams we are seduced by are not the ethereal collective dreams of our community and culture, but personalized dreams driven primarily by greed and insecurity. Dreams, after all, Mizoguchi suggests are very real, and very powerful. They cost Genjuro his wife. They cost Tobee his wife's social dignity. They drive our decisions, they enshroud us and can exploit us. Look at the way Mizoguchi captures the descent into the dreamland in the famous river-boat shots. They are shot in heavy fog, but in a space that seems to be clearly a set. It is a beautiful, effective set, but nonetheless a set. This is significant in how it alines the film with the concept. They are entering a dreamland, the land of film, of constructions, of twists and turns, trials and tribulations. But while the film's conclusion is a tragic one, it offers us the solace of quiet art. We watch Genjuro work as a potter again, but finally not for the sake of enriching himself, but art for its own sake. This is the key to modernity for Mizoguchi -- that we create for ourselves, for our own well-being, for our own souls. We must take part in humble, almost Buddhist, self-reflection and craft from that. It is greed, and the seduction of dreams, which will ultimately betray us. First by forcing us to take what we have for granted, then by taking even that away.
I am not sure if there are flaws in the film, but I can say my own experience was disturbed by inconsistent wi-fi. That frustration, however, unfairly kept me from completely losing myself in the experience of the film. I nonetheless believe it is a film I will see many times more in the future, and, now having considered it in all its thematic detail, I believe it will only grow on me. It is a film with a great deal to say, but which entertains us so thoroughly, so effectively, that we begin to take for granted how much it wishes to communicate to us. It is my first outing with Mizoguchi, but I believe I will have many more. Many consider Ugetsu the masterpiece, but if the other films are close to it, we will be in for a treat. For now I believe I have said what I can on the film, it is a masterful piece of classic cinema. One which examines time, myth, culture, and spirituality not with blind allegiance to liberalism, but with a critical eye that seeks to get to the bottom, to answer the question of just what is lost as the world moves forward. For that reason, for our own good, we must be sure to return to it again and again.",4.5
"What a beautiful, sensitive film.
By telling us straight away that the movie is adapted from a folk story, Mizoguchi sets the foundation for a wonderful morality play where characters are essentially archetypes for human behaviour.
Easy to see why this is one of Scorsese's favourite films -
1) Some of the smoothest camera pans you'll ever see (that moment when Wakasa joins Genjuro in the bath and the camera moves from the splash towards the ground and to the next day with both lying side by side on the grass - FUCK ME DEAD.)
2) The aforementioned morality play angle (which is an accurate descriptor for Scorsese's mob movies)
Also, the folktale ambiance made me coom hard (Genjuro's story is similar to Kwaidan's Black Hair - the latter took the horror route though I prefer this one). Idk man it's late in the night and this film is beautiful af and color was a mistake and some scenes will stay with me forever - the aforementioned camera pan, the boat/ fog scene, Miyagi mending as light enters through the cracks, the ending - it's just an incredibly moving and amazing film and I'm glad I checked it out.",4.0

"Ugetsu is a fairly short film that actually covers a significant amount of thematic ground. On one hand you have gender roles in medieval Japan, ghost stories, getting caught up in profiteering over loving your family, and watching people cope with the end of the war in Japan. Ugetsu takes a very anti-war perspective and puts samurai in a mostly negative light--outside of Tobei, who more or less falls into becoming a samurai, they're all drunken leches and thieves with nothing better to do but to harass people. Such a huge contrast from the typical romantic portrayal of Bushido.
The story between Genjuro and Wakasa is the real crux of the film's emotional sincerity. We can see the faults that Genjuro makes with his obsession over pottery and from the beginning we are lamenting its ability to separate him from Miyaki and Genkichi. It leads him to pursue love and fulfillment in Wakasa, but the entire time we can tell that Genjuro is somewhat uncomfortable with his position as a professional pottery maker. This conflict interrogates the idea of a professional artist at all--what use is being paid to make art if they have no one to really share it with?
The ending of course, drives it all home. We don't get a happy ending for Genjuro but we do get a lesson learned--and it's so fascinating and powerful for him to come home to the ghost of his wife when he just spent a month living with a ghost. As interesting as it would've been to see Tobei learn a similar lesson, it does give it some levity that their ending is much more optimistic.",4.5
"Ein toller Film über Gier, Familie und auch etwas schwarze Magie.
Mein erster Kontakt mit Kenji Mizoguchi war direkt ein Volltreffer. Eine allgemein gute Cinematography, tolles Schauspiel und ein schön untermahlender Score erschaffen hier ein sehr rundes Filmerlebnis. Mir hat vor allem Machiko Kyo als Lady Wasaka gefallen da sie eine unglaubliche Leinwandpräsenz hatte. Das Thema ""Gier"" eingebunden in das Bürgerkriegsszenario ist zuerst befremdlich aber ich konnte mich schnell dort einfühlen und es hat alles gepasst. Auch hat der Film ein hervorragendes Pay-off und die Entwicklung der Hauptfigur ist großartig dargestellt. Ich bin gespannt auf mehr von Mizoguchi.

"A beautiful shot classic Japanese ghost story set in grim war-torn conditions. This being a fairy tale the moral is a bit on the nose for my liking although the interplay between descent into bestiality and enchantment does compensate. The ending, especially of the potter's wife sowing until daybreak, is quiet something as is the almost casual remark about war making men do absurd things. I love how Japanese filmmakers used to slip in these messages.",3.5
"""Success always comes at a price and we pay in suffering.""
At desperate times, people get driven by ambition and greed.Money, comfort and illusions often blinds them.Mizoguchis's classic period drama is a perfect visualisation of this.
From creating a plot by mixing up many stories to the great cinematography and lovely music, everything is great about Ugetsu.It's a fine fairy tale with much realism.Of all the Japanese movies I've seen, except the anime, Ugetsu seems the one that easily flows like a river.There are some classic that bores the audience in some way, let it be the length, content or anything.But unlike those, Ugetsu can be a perfect choice for anyone.
The film ends at everyone coming to their senses and working hard to earn a living.There'll be hard times, but there's not much that can't be countered by hardwork.I think that's Mizoguchi's message to the society.",5.0

There's a lot to like about Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu. It's an atmospheric and quite mysterious stories about selfishness and love. After about thirty minutes into the film it took a turn I didn't expect, but that I actually liked. Yet, I find myself conflicted about how I feel about the film. There's so much good stuff, but it also feels weirdly put together. While the switch between Genjuró, Miyagi and Tobei doesn't kill the film, it kind of put an halt to everything. The storyline with Tobei also feels a bit weird compared to the one with Genjuró; it's not bad per se, but I felt that it was almost veering in the comedic style. While I might have been a bit disappointed by Ugetsu, I won't refrain myself from exploring the rest of Kenji Mizoguchi's filmography.",3.5

Ugetsu ist eine Adaption zweier ineinandergeflochtener Handlungen aus dem gleichnamigen Geisterbuch von Ueda Akinari aus dem Jahre 1776. Eine Geschichte folgt Genjuro (Masayuki Mori), einem Töpfer, der seine Waren verkaufen will, um seiner Frau Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) und seinem Sohn Genichi ein besseres Leben zu ermöglichen. Die andere Geschichte erzählt von Tobei (Eitarô Ozawa), einem Bauern, der gegen den Willen seiner Frau Ohama (Mitsuko Mito), ein Samurai werden will.
Ugetsu ist eine Mischung aus sozialem Realismus, Drama und Geistergeschichte, die während des Bürgerkriegs im sechzehnten Jahrhundert in Japan spielt. Die Geschichte handelt von irdischen Menschen und spektralen Geistererscheinungen, berücksichtigt aber in erster Linie das Schicksal von Frauen während des Krieges. Frauen werden Opfer der Ambitionen ihrer Ehemänner und der Grausamkeit von Männern, während ihre Geister zurückbleiben, verfolgt und unfähig sind, sich weiterzuentwickeln.
Kenji Mizoguchi ist ein begnadeter Regisseur, der mit grösster Genauigkeit auf die Einhaltung hinsichtlich der Details seiner Produktionen achtet, einschliesslich Sets, Requisiten und Kostümen. Als Zuschauer erhalten wir einen klaren Einblick in die Lebenssituation im Japan des sechzehnten Jahrhunderts. Wir lernen das Dorfleben und das schwere Los des arbeitenden Bauern kennen, während uns von der Unmoral des Krieges und der Weisheit der Liebe einer Frau erzählt wird. Gleichzeitig achtet Kenji Mizoguchi besonders auf die Verhaltensweisen und das innere Wesen seiner Figuren, um eine emotionale Genauigkeit seiner Darsteller zu gewährleisten.
Kenji Mizoguchi erschafft mit wunderschönen, poetischen Schwarzweissaufnahmen und einem gekonnten Spiel mit Licht und Schatten ein einzigartiges, atmosphärisches Filmerlebnis. Der Film hat eine wunderbare, mystische Atmosphäre, die die Geschichte widerspiegelt, indem sie den fliessenden Übergang zwischen Fantasie und Realität perfekt unterstützt.
Ugetsu’s Mischung aus Historizität, künstlerischer Raffinesse und menschlicher Beobachtung kombiniert mit dem Übersinnlichen ist in seiner Wirkung bezaubernd, beeinflussend und unvergesslich.",4.5

Week 12: Auteurs - Kenji Mizoguchi
Mizoguchi manages to do what few people can: tell a story about people whose lives are irreparably damaged by greed and self-destruction while still grounding them in their humanity. It’s only because we empathize with them so much that witnessing their plight is that much more difficult to watch—the last shot of the movie is particularly painful. It’s not a moralistic horror-show like Requiem for a Dream (though there are some ghosts), but  haunting, elegantly told story, representing the beauty and honesty of what cinema can do.",4.0
"Film #19: Around the World in 30 Days (March 2018 Challenge)
Film #12: Film School Drop Outs (2018 Weekly Challenge)
Country: Japan
Theme: Kenji Mizoguchi
I’m a little embarrassed to say that I had muddled the two plots (Genjurō the potter and Tōbei the samurai-wannabe) at the beginning, confusing one actor for the other as their stories weaved in and out during the army invasion that opens the film. I’m usually an attentive viewer, so I don’t know what happened there. The actors do look similar, and the Tōbei subplot doesn’t get the strongest of introductions, so I don’t think I’m losing it just yet. It’s probably because I’m so used to having directors delineate what’s what with an exacting rigour that made me unprepared for the more fluid approach that Mizoguchi takes. He conceives these stories not as individual units, but as parallel adventures that subtly comment on each other and the film’s broader reach: warfare, patriarchy, female disempowerment, and familial duty. Maybe, in a way, both Tōbei and Genjurō are two fragments of the same man, taking two dissimilar paths and finding that the outcomes are one and the same: total disrepair and disenchantment, as well as the abject suffering of their women caused by their selfish desires.
A second viewing will no doubt make these distinctions crystal clear. It’s not at all a knock on this beautifully-calibrated film, the careful construction of which is evident from top to bottom. I was so enchanted by the seamless incorporation of the ghost story, and how it never feels overdone or ridiculous. I take it that’s because Mizoguchi has an intuitive understanding of these characters and their personal histories, so that their longings and passions are always in the foreground, regardless of whether they’re living or dead. The graceful cinematography, the traditional music, and the efficient pacing help Ugetsu further blossom into a prime viewing experience that I honestly could not fault in any major sense. There’s the right mix of humour and pathos, a wonderful ensemble of gifted actors, and that satisfying sense of completeness you want to see in a film of good calibre.
What more can I say? Bring on the Mizoguchi, I guess, if this is the kind of quality he brings to his work.",5.0
"Ugetsu is a popular Japanese film that I've been interested in for quite a while. I finally got around to it last night and I liked it a lot. It's very well made and tells a compelling story that goes to some unexpected, but welcome places. It's well paced, the cast is good, I liked the score, and the film is pretty powerful at times and I enjoyed the supernatural elements. I should have watched this one sooner. 8/10",4.0
"This didn't quite push the right buttons for me. As a samurai movie it was neither epic nor fun. As a horror movie it wasn't frightful or surreal enough. It doesn't quite satisfy itself as a movie, but it's a great concept and was worth the watch.",2.5
"After watching Sansho the Bailiff, I instantly wanted to dive into another Mizoguchi work, and I was not disappointed.
Ugetsu is so many things. Haunting and brutal, yet spiritual and poetic. Scarily real and natural, yet surreal. Profound anti-war, yet very little actual war? Incredible.
There is a tremendous atmosphere carried for the entire duration of the film. The eerie score added so much to every scene, whether it be high pitch screeching whistles, or slow building drum beats. It set the tone for each moment, without feeling forceful or overbearing. The cinematography was also fantastic, with each individual shot being noteworthy. The crawling camera movements were hypnotic and drew me into every scene. Again, much like the score, it never feels forceful or flashy. Mizoguchi crafts each moment down to a tee.
The story told in the film is relatively simple, yet wildly complex with multiple themes and a mixture of characters running throughout. Each person with their own desires, morals, ambitions, and dilemmas.
Another moving piece from Mizoguchi. Very well crafted in all aspects of film making. I'm loving his work so far!",0.0
"This melancholy masterwork from director Kenji Mizoguchi is a difficult film – richly detailed but narratively mysterious, filled with flawed people making poor decisions and paying for them, dearly. Mizoguchi crafts it as an ornate period piece, but the story’s temptations and betrayals keep harshly interrupting its scenes of splendor and grace with unexpected bursts of brutality and pain, masterfully using errant sounds and unsettling music to create real discontent. It’s far from a fun movie, but it sticks with you.",4.5
"There was a moment about halfway through this where Lady Wakasa started to emerge as a driving force of the story and it felt a bit disappointing. The family drama of two men literally risking their lives to rise above their station in a hopeless, wartorn Japan worked enough as a standalone drama. The noble, ghostly seductress who leads one of the men astray (admittedly with little to no cajoling) seemed almost extraneous. I was much less interested in that story than the wreckage of families the two men left behind. But then the movie returns to the push-and-pull of characters choosing between the stability of family and the green-eyed monster of ambition and gets even more compelling and intense.
While too little time is spent on the melodrama at the center of the story AND too little time is spent on Lady Wakasa as a metaphor of the mysterious allure of upper class comfort, I was still into this. Regardless of any narrative issues I may have had, each shot is gorgeous and the musical score is wonderfully demanding. An artistic achievement that unfortunately is just missing the tiniest draw of character for the thematic ideas to land as fully as they deserve.

"This is both a ghost story, and one of poverty-to-wealth, exploring the effects success can have on a person.

"Having had the opportunity to watch this great Japanese classic theatrically, I sat in the best seat of the almost-empty room and prepared myself for what was coming next. Right from when the lights went off and the beautifully-crafted credits started rolling on the screen, I was mesmerized. And as the film unfolds, revealing its contrast between the beautiful springtime of Lake Biwa in the Province of Omi and the Civil Wars that occurred at the same time, that sense of enchantment and beauty persisted.
The two neighbor families that live around this lake are friends, while Genjurô and Tobei, the men of each family, work together making clay potteries. They plan to go to the city, sell many of their pieces and enrich, taking their wives along with them. This dream proves difficult, though, when an army (of the cruel Shibata) approaches their village.
After a brief encounter with a dying man, they find it safer for the wives to go back to the village, and so one of them returns. The two end up in the big city, only accompanied by one of the wives, and sell almost every piece. Soon even the princess of the town goes to buy some pottery. When this happens, Tobei, a fool man who dreams of becoming a samurai, leaves his wife behind to buy a samurai outfit and seek fame. She goes after him and Genjurô, now alone, starts to fall in love with the princess.
This story then develops into layers of consequences, redemption, fantasy, and the horrors of war, lying there the greatness of all the film. For its phantasmagoric music, shadowy photography and very believable acting are so impressive and mastered by Mizoguchi that its epicness and timelessness are revealed.",4.5

There aren't many movies that stick with me like this one does. I ponder it often. Why is it that man has everything he really needs for joy and happiness and yet doesn't realize what he has? Why is the heart not so easily satisfied ? The heart is deceitful above all, who can understand it? Jeremiah 17:9. Any movie that can tell a story and enlighten a man and make him search himself for the important things in life is rare. There arent alot of films that can do this. This is a wonderful film and is in my top 10 list of my all time favorites. 5/5.",5.0
"Been stewing on this one for a while now, and with the risk of sounding reductive about a universally beloved film, I’ll say I find this film a somewhat didactic morality play about the folly of temptation. We are given two men whose desires for a woman and honor lead them to neglect their wives, one of whom dies while the other is raped and then forced into prostitution. This reads to me a bit like Peckinpah’s primitive moralism in Straw Dogs as the pacifist Hoffman’s unwillingness to confront Irish hillbillies results in his wife getting raped by one. The two men of Ugetsu similarly have their wife’s punished for their own moral transgressions in Mizoguchi’s cosmic universe where awful things happen to the characters so that we may learn a sobering lesson about how the world works. The characters in this film are merely pawns in this lesson, stripped of any sort of interior life so that we may not be distracted from the instructive function they serve in the film. With its predictably mapped out trajectory, the film lacks any real unorthodoxy or jagged edges to suggest a sense of ambiguity lingering beneath Mizoguchi’s straight-forward moral concerns. Even the supernatural bits feel like ways to lend the film an aura of mystery that is sorely lacking in the film’s text. The ghost of the temptress serves a specific role to suggest the transient nature of lust and the dead wife’s ghost serves to heighten the tragedy and symbolize the way the protagonist views women. Both of these ghosts seem like ways to punish the main character for his frivolous desires. Mizoguchi seems more interested in punitively exposing his protagonist’s flaws than he does in providing a nuanced, sensitive depiction of characters struggling with their temptations.",3.0

BY FAR my favourite Mizoguchi I’ve seen to this point. Everything is far more potent and engaging, and I really enjoyed how this was in a way kind of a genre piece. There was some truly haunting imagery, and to me, easily Mizoguchi’s most compelling narrative so far. The male characters I feel had more development and were well written, but for a director that so often specializes in the plight of women during hard times, I found the female characters to be surprisingly underwritten and 2 dimensional. I feel like they were well acted, but they often felt as if they were there simply to feel the brunt of suffering caused by the greed of our 2 leads. I didn’t find either of them to change much as characters, but still, regardless of that I still really enjoyed my time with this one. Glad I was able to finally find a very enjoyable Mizoguchi for myself before the end of our director of the month!",3.5

"Japanuary 2024

Ugetsu is a fantasy drama that tells a tale of ambition, family, love, and war set in the midst of the Japanese Civil Wars of the sixteenth century.
I picked up the Criterion release of this a while back without knowing anything about the film and it’s absolutely one of my best blind buys yet! At its core, Ugetsu is a film about desire, militarism, arrogance and greed, themes that continuously stand out within its utterly compelling premise. Set during the 16th Century, we follow two men who continuously prove just how selfish they are and greedy they are, something that leads to us seeing the effects it has on their wives too.
On paper, it’s a simple enough premise but the brilliant execution helps make it something much bigger, bringing in intriguing supernatural elements that work really well whilst never sacrificing the more grounded moments that delve into the effects of war within this time period. There are various twists and turns that I really didn’t see coming and it’s a very intense film too.
From the moment that our central characters discover the dying man in the boat who had been attacked by pirates, a clear bad omen, it feels like there’s an underlying sense of dread present throughout the rest of the film.  It’s not a horror film necessarily but it includes horror elements that work to create an unsettling atmosphere that fits in well alongside the horror of the unpredictable nature of war.
The cast all do a fantastic job with everyone fully committing to their roles in a way that makes the story all the more engaging. But for me, the best performance of the film comes from Machiko Kyô in her role as Lady Wakasa. Kyô plays the role in such a mesmerising way, looking stunning in the amazing costume designs and working brilliantly alongside Masayuki Mori‘s Genjurô.
The cinematography is phenomenal, using excellent framing and low lighting to create some truly haunting visuals that make great use of shadows. The score fits perfectly with the visuals, never feeling like it’s overused but always standing out whenever it’s used, particularly during Lady Wakasa’s scenes. 
Overall, Ugetsu is a haunting and intense film that features themes of desire, militarism, arrogance and greed within its very well written story. It blends very grounded elements focusing on the effects of war within this time period with well placed supernatural elements, all whilst also looking at women dealing with the consequences of their husbands’ selfish actions. Stunning cinematography, incredible score, amazing costume design and a brilliant cast, this and Sansho the Bailiff both have me wanting to watch the rest of Kenji Mizoguchi‘s work.

""How high can a Man rise without big Dreams? Ambition must be boundless as the Ocean.""
Das größte Leid wird oft auf dem Fundament nobelster Absichten erbaut... während des 16. Jahrhunderts tobten in Japan heftige Bürgerkriege, welche die Leben der einfachen Bevölkerung zu einem grausamen Alltag aus Furcht, Armut und Hungersnot verkommen ließen.
Inmitten dieses von Menschenhand geschaffenen Albtraums träumt der talentierte Töpfer Genjuro vom großen Geld auf dem Marktplatz und der tollpatschige Bauer Tobei vom gesellschaftlichen Ansehen eines Samurais, um ihren geliebten Frauen etwas besseres als diese traurige Existenz im Dreck zu ermöglichen.
Beide lassen sich allerdings von Ruhm und Wohlstand blenden, ignorieren die bösen Omen auf dem Todessee bzw. deuten dessen mystische Symbolik falsch und verwechseln Euphorie mit Starrköpfigkeit... anstatt nämlich ihr bereits-vorhandenes Glück zu erkennen, verwandelt sich deren Ehrgeiz bald in Gier und der Traum von Ehre in feige Lügen, was am Ende statt Erfolg nur Schmerz über ihre Nächsten bringt!
Kenji Mizoguchi behandelt in ""Ugetsu"" außerdem die Flucht der hungernden Arbeiterschicht vor der depremierenden Realität des Krieges und lässt sogar einen bösen Dämon Besitz von Genjuro's Träumen ergreifen, indem dieser ihm in Gestalt einer bildhübschen Prinzessin eine alternative Welt ohne Sorgen vorgaukelt, um ihn beschwipst von Illusionen schlussendlich in's Reich der Toten zu ziehen!
Während unsere beiden Tagträumer immer weiter vom Pfad der Tugend abkommen, dabei aber betäubt von vergänglichen Erfolgen kaum etwas vom lächerlichen Irrsinn mitbekommen, in dem sie sich mittlerweile befinden, lässt Mizoguchi währenddessen ihre Frauen für sie die Rechnung zahlen, verteufelt die eine hinter die sündigen Pforten eines Bordells und lässt die andere beim Kampf um ein paar mickrige Reiskuchen krepieren... denn wenn Tobei und Genjuro endlich wieder zur Vernunft kommen, ist es bereits zu spät und aus ihren einst so erstrebenswerten Ambitionen wurde ihr Untergang!
Sei zufrieden mit dem was du hast, stelle finanziellen niemals über familiären Wohlstand und verwechsle Schönheit niemals mit wahrer Liebe... denn der Verlust innerer Werte wiegt schwerer als man denkt, lockt einen mit vergänglichen Wunschträumen immer weiter weg von der Wirklichkeit, bis am Ende von deinem einstigen Glück nichts weiter als ein trauriger Geist übrig ist, der von nun an nur noch sphärisch zu dir flüstern kann, statt dich liebevoll in den Arm zu nehmen...
Es kommt wirklich selten vor, dass ein Film seine Botschaft so geheimnisvoll und gleichzeitig so zielstrebig präsentiert, doch mit ""Ugetsu"" gelang Mizoguchi damals unverkennbar der Gipfel moralischer Lehrkunde im Gewand mystischer, japanischer Energien!

"The kind of Sengoku Jidai film that portrays feudalism as a literal hell on earth, malevolent spirits included, which is the kind of Sengoku Jidai film I like (see also: Onibaba). In this ghost story it’s more than half the film before a hapless craftsman wanders into a haunted mansion, making it a distinct retelling of the classic Japanese folktale template - in this case an episodic chronicle of suffering and temptation, with capital and martial glory presented as alternative keys jangled by the peasants’ superiors as unlocking the only escape valves from their nasty, brutish lives. Those and death, that is.
The pro-status-quo resolution feels a bit odd given the acidity of the film’s structural critique up to that point - and undermines what I thought was one of the finest ambiguities of the film, that the men who want to take risks to better their standing and the wives who want them to protect what they have both make valid points. But Mizoguchi isn’t just here to preach, thankfully, and the film is more than willing to soak in the feeling of a moment and the awe of the supernatural as he carries the story along a more abstract arc from the omnipresent dread of to the unearthly encounter with to the eventual acceptance of death as companion to life. The tonal period scoring gives this a very different feel from, say, Kurosawa films of the era, and the long silences and slinking pans (including some brilliant deep frame shots) give it a more interioristic and ethereal air as well. 
Mizoguchi, then: good stuff.",4.0
"I'm glad that I decided to watch Ugetsu again because it didn't stick with me that much on first viewing but felt considerably more memorable and impressive this time. The film is set in 16th century Japan and follows the fortunes of two men and their wives who desperately try to make money and increase their status while avoiding the dangers posed by the ongoing civil war. What makes this movie truly special however, is the way it incorporates ghostly elements into the narrative to create a wholly unique blend of fantasy and realism in its storytelling. After an admittedly slow start the plot really starts to engage the viewer from the moment that the characters have to flee their home and it is after this we experience the unforgettable encounters between the protagonist and several spirits. Even before this there is an incredible scene set on a lake which has one of the most effective uses of fog that I've seen in a film to create an unsettling, otherworldly atmosphere that is almost dreamlike. This atmosphere is increased further when Genjuro is led to a mansion and seduced by Lady Wakasa as it gradually becomes clear that something about the characters and location is not quite right. This sequence is intercut with the fates of the other key characters in the film and while these may not be as interesting as Genjuro's story, each character's journey is powerful in its own way and very emotionally effective. Mizoguchi intelligently saves the most impactful moments in the film for its climax to create an ending that is mysterious, beautiful, melancholic but somehow strangely uplifting all at once. The performances are varied and excellent throughout while the sound design is pretty incredible featuring an endless array of undefinable and peculiar noises and instruments which increases the supernatural atmosphere that dominates the second half of the runtime. The stand out technical aspect however is the cinematography which simply put is amongst the most stunning that I have ever witnessed. I've already mentioned the lake scene but every composition in this movie is visually arresting and it must have the most cinematic trees of all time. The camera pans that open and close the film beautifully invite the viewer into the story and provide an immensely satisfying way of departing from the characters and setting at the end. Then there are the extraordinary individual shots throughout the film that are far too numerous to mention but the one that stand out is near the end where Genjuro is asleep in his house and light pours through the cracks in the wall and door. There are still moments that are slow and struggle to engage me but overall, Ugetsu is a beautiful and atmospheric blending of realism and fantasy to create one of the most important cinematic works in Japanese history.

"Ugetsu tells the story of the blind ambition of two men. In their pursuit of wealth and glory, their wives are led to ruin.
This is a film of stunning beauty. Throughout Ugetsu's 96-minute runtime, Mizoguchi employs many of his signature shots that each last an entire scene. These shots, generally filmed at a distance from the protagonists, set the dreamy tone and pace of the movie. The camera is almost continuously in motion—during moments when its movement is barely perceptible, the camera work adds to a sense of unreality or illusion, which heightens the experience of the ghost scenes in they movie.
Equally stunning are the acting, set design, and costumes. Ugetsu is a must-see masterpiece.",4.5

I know it's not a direct parallel but I'm seeing more of myself in this morose Japanese movie from the 50s about ghosts and samurai than I was expecting to, and that speaks volumes about the writing and the storytelling.

The splendid script, sets, and landscapes were beyond appreciation and truly makes the black and white more vibrant than reality itself.

"My experience with Ugetsu was strange. It had all of the ingredients to make a great film, and I’m quite certain that it is very good, but it never moved me emotionally. I always felt curiously detached from the characters and the situations that they were trapped in. I mention all of this because I do think that Kenji Mizoguchi’s films are meant to provoke a strong emotional response. He’s an extraordinary filmmaker, who seems to be exceptionally knowledgable when it comes to conjuring up realistic emotions and relationships in slightly fantastical settings. Some of his films work on dream logic, but you can still hold onto the fact that they tell the story of the dissolution of a marriage, or the embarrassment of a young man whose career has only been successful because of his family name. Ugetsu has all of the merits of his other works, but there’s something missing here, and I can’t quite put my finger on what it is.
I kept thinking of the German Expressionist silent melodramas that this was presumably inspired by. It covers the theme of overly ambitious men with delusions of grandeur who simply can’t learn to be happy with what they have. For them, life will be an eternal struggle in which they constantly want to amass more money, power and respect from the people who surround them. It’s a struggle that many people face, regardless of whether they achieve a measure of success or not. It’s a powerful theme that should cause everybody to readjust their expectations when it comes to earning more money and having the ability to do whatever they want. It should have caused me to feel a deep sense of anguish and it didn’t. I’m somebody who gets worried about all sorts of status symbols and being judged for not having a fancy enough job, so this should have shaken me out of my funk. As I thought it over, I could definitely pick up on those themes. As it passed me by, I wasn’t as viscerally impacted by it. I’m not saying that every film should have to have a visceral impact, but I shouldn’t have felt so passive as I watched it.",3.5

As Winston Zeddemore would say - if a wandering spirit asks you to have sex with her, you say yes! ...wait. Was that the message?
For me, the biggest triumph in Ugetsu - beyond its historical significance in Japanese cinema - is it so easily balances several different stories and themes in a mere 97-minute runtime.
We have a haunting ghost fable; a critique on capitalistic and social-climbing ambition; a heavy anti-war message; and a family drama that ranges from tragedy to redemption.
And! It all works very well together. Though part of me thinks the ghost story aspect of the film could've been better connected.
It's also beautifully shot, combining sweeping scenic imagery, the dirty earthly hell of war, and the pristine crispness of royalty life.

"Tragedy as a result of the greed and obsession of humankind.
Ugetsu is a film that feels sort of like an old folk-tale or some ancient, divine, fantastical story on the nature of human temptation and sin. Taking place in Japan, during a time in history of civil-war, It is concerned with the age old story of a couple starting out to find something better than what they’ve got at hand, only to forget their original intentions  and become overly consumed by their desires to an extent where they end up not only hurting themselves in their ignorance, but also hurting those they care about. Important to note that  It’s also got some mystical supernatural stuff, but I don’t feel it necessary to elaborate on it further. Anyways, with a commonly used general sort of plot like this, it can be quite easy for a movie to become uninteresting and bland if the film doesn’t completely commit itself to delivering its story within the frames of its own unique vision. However with the amazing directing talents of Mizoguchi and the genuine and inspired performances from pretty much  all of the cast, I found it hard to not be invested in this films marvellously, intriguing story.
From its haunting score, to its beautifully refined yet often wondrous and dream-like cinematography, Ugetsu has a deep and rich atmosphere filled with an intrinsic sense of eeriness and passionate longing that I think works perfectly in tandem with the nature of the film as a whole. This is just such a beautiful and captivating film, that I think is still incredibly relevant today. Although some minor parts of it didn’t quite land for me, Ugetsu is a picturesque landscape of the dark side of humanities wants that I intend to revisit many times in the future.",4.5

I wouldn’t say it’s boring but it’s definitely slow and meandering, I feel the time even at an hour and 40 minutes. It has some beautiful scenes and some real haunting moments, but nothing that makes it a masterpiece for me. It’s good and worth watching but sadly it’s not a movie I’d watch again.",3.5
"Criterion Challenge Film 25: Martin Scorsese's Top 10
I think if you were to go back to the very beginning of storytelling, you would find a morality tale about not being greedy. It probably went something like:
Ug saw that there were bigger berries near the tall grass. Mog told Ug that the other animals never ate those berries for a reason. Ug really wanted those berries. When he went near the tall grass a tiger ate him and the berries.
Every culture has their own version of this story. I'm pretty sure Japan's is the only one where a man meets a ghost with a singing, invisible dad and gets laid in a hot spring with such skill he forgets he's married.
It's not a particularly sophisticated story. It suffers from a bad case of women-getting-hurt-for-men's-mistakes. But it's absolutely gorgeous: the fog on the lake was clearly a way to hide a small lake or modern buildings in the background but it's perfect nevertheless. Genjuro tripping over lanterns and spilling coals and cutting candles in half like a complete klutz while he swipes ineffectually at nothing should be stupid and mockable, but it absolutely works for the moment. The world rarely feels quite solid and people act like simalcrums of human beings, perfect for a ghost story. Distances never feel real and time skips, with an internal consistency that elevates the whole thing. This is all in the ghost-marriage narrative third of the movie.
The wannabe-samurai third isn't given the proper setup and time to boil over in the way it eventually does. I was really hoping Tobei's wife would become an awesome vengeful ghost too, but instead she suffered until her husband (who caused her problems in the first place and then got to live his dream the entire time) saved her and she was, somehow, grateful. It definitely undercuts the don't-be-greedy message.

"67 Jahre auf dem Buckel und kein Stück gealtert. Das ist Ugetsu von Mizoguchi. Japan, 16. Jahrhundert. Es herrscht Krieg. Zwei überambitionierte Bauern, deren Frauen darunter zu leiden haben. Der eine, ein Töpfer, sieht das große Geld, und lässt dafür Frau und Kind im Stich. Der andere, ein Samurai Verehrer, treibt seine Frau in die Prostitution, um eine unehrenhaft erbeutete Rüstung tragen zu können. Beide müssen am Ende ihren Träumerein Tribut zollen, und sehen sich mit der harschen Realität konfrontiert.
Ugetsu ist ein ungemein intelligenter Film. Nicht nur storytechnisch (in dem uns eben gezeigt wird, welche Blüten blinde Gier nach Status und Wohlstand tragen kann), sondern vor allem auch auf filmischer Ebene. Die Kamera ist unglaublich dynamisch, sie begleitet unsere Protagonisten bei ihrem Aufstieg und unvermeidbaren Fall. Unterstützt wird sie dabei von detaillierten Setpieces, die, obwohl jederzeit als Studiomaterial erkennbar, gerade deswegen eine träumerische Qualität besitzen, die den Effekt der illusorischen Hatz verstärkt. Gepaart mit dem exzellenten Blocking, den Szenenübergängen zum Zungeschnalzen und dem tollen Soundtrack ergibt sich ein Gesamtbild von zeitloser Schönheit und vor allem auch Wichtigkeit.
Allein, wenn ich etwas zu kritisieren hätte, dann das Ende. Ich verstehe Mizoguchis Intention, das Träumerische mit der Wirklichkeit knallhart zu brechen, doch nimmt er sich so die Möglichkeit, ein meisterhaftes Ende zu inszenieren, welches auf dem Silbertablett lag.
Ich darf erläutern: Im Verlauf des Films widerfährt einem der beiden Protagonisten eine Traumsequenz, die eindeutig als solche zu identifizieren ist. So etabliert Mizoguchi bereits ein Bewusstsein beim Zuschauer, welches er später auch wieder hervorruft, als der Protagonist nach Hause kommt und mithilfe einer extrem intelligenten Kamerafahrt klar gemacht wird, dass auch hier wieder eine Traumsequenz vonstatten geht. Diese Tatsache (also das es sich um einen Wunschtraum handelt) wird dem Zuschauer leider überdeutlich erklärt. Entweder, weil Mizoguchi ihn für zu dumm hielt, oder aber, weil er den Kontrast zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit noch deutlicher heraustellen wollte.
Wie gesagt, ich verstehe die Idee dahinter, aber es ist für mich ein Störfaktor, der diesen ansonsten brillianten Film minimal belastet.",4.5
"I have always loved movies but it wasn't until the summer after my senior year of high school that I really started devouring them and diving into more film canon, especially older films. Prior to that, I had watched a ton of movies but they were almost all contemporary to when I grew up in the 90s and 2000s. When I first started diving into older film, I was astounded by how great this medium has held up over time. That sounds juvenile, but it really is a difficult thing for a lot of people. Going back and watching something 70+ years old, completely analog, with no special effects is a jarring transition from the glitzy digital films a lot of us grew up with. Even now after watching so many films I still find myself surprised by what can be accomplished in older films.
UGETSU is one of those films that astounds me and reinforces my love for movies across all of film history. It's subtle, haunting, and magical. Mizoguchi balances the more realistic sequences of greed and civil war with highly stylized sequences of art, love, and romance. The film is seriously cruel and yet so elegant and haunting that it's hard to get it out of your head. When Genjuro yelled ""I never imagined such pleasures existed!"" I really felt that.",5.0

"How does someone with so much talent as Mizoguchi manage to create films with some of the blandest visuals in cinema? It's like he forgets that camerawork, framing, movement, even lighting can be used to greatly enhance a film. Not everything has to be propped up by your script man. Give me something to look at that doesn’t feel staler than a tin of my Grandpa’s crackers.
Granted he did have a really strong script to work with here. The characters are all very compelling and the political themes of Japan at the time compared to the time when the movie was made in the 1950s are interesting to juxtapose. I was genuinely taken back by how fun and intriguing the film managed to get, I can’t say I expected that.
There are even a few scenes where Mizoguchi manages to create a sense of dread so powerful he had me nervously eyeing around my room making sure no ghosts were walking through my walls. The mixture of sound cues, off-screen disembodied singing, and the cadence of his actors creating such a feeling that I haven’t quite felt since Hereditary. It was shockingly intense.",4.5

"Ugetsu is moving in every area and, knowing the director's past, serves as a great expression of regret over pro war sentiments. The core plot of this revolves around men abandoning their families due to visions of glory and grandeur. It is the women who suffer the most, and some times, returning home is not sufficient to make things right.
The way lighting is used was probably my favorite part of this aesthetic. There is a scene where one of the main characters cuts a candle with his sword, shrouding the room in darkness. That scene, along with others, build Ugetsu's look as a fairy tale. Speaking of fairy tales, the supernatural elements tie the whole thing together. The final appearance of a ghost shows an expression of pure kindness and love, and the revelation that it was only a ghost is devastating.",4.5

"My first Mizoguchi film! Ugetsu is many things. It's a Jidaigeki ghost story. It's a cautionary tale against greed and the lust for power. It's a film that shows the suffering caused by war and especially the suffering of women. Many critics have viewed the film through a historical lens as a harsh critique of Imperial Japan's ruthless conquests during WW2. No matter how you view Ugetsu, it's a universal tale that has a huge emotional impact. It also doesn't hurt that it's well acted, well shot, has beautiful costumes, etc. Mizoguchi served in the Chinese theater of WW2, despite writing the government to announce his pacifism. He purposely refused promotions so he could due menial labor and not have to kill. Mizoguchi was a gentle soul and was horrified by the mass rapes and use of comfort women. If you wondered why women keep getting raped and sold into sex slavery in Mizoguchi films...that's the reason. That's a theme in Ugetsu, Sansho the Bailiff, and Life of Oharu.
An interesting fact is that Ugetsu was nominated for an American Academy Award for best costume design, but lost to Marty which completely swept that year. Sadly, it wasn't even nominated for anything else. Hollywood didn't think this even deserved to compete against a campy, kitsch film where Ernest Borgnine plays a 40 year old virgin going on his awkward first date. Black KKKlansman losing to Greenbook was mildly disappointing. Ugetsu losing to Marty isn't even something I can get mad about. It's honestly hysterical. I fully recognize that I myself have shit taste. I'm told so on Myanimelist on a bi-weekly basis. Even I'm laughing at the 1955 Academy voting committee. They deserve a memorial plaque for extraordinary achievement in poor taste.",5.0
"The more Mizoguchi I watch the more deserving I think he is of being ranked alongside Japanese greats like Ozu, Kobayashi, and of course Kurosawa. Ugetsu is the ghostly story of two men obsessively driven towards their goals. One, a skilled potter (Genjuro), takes advantage of war time prices and gets a taste for wealth. He lusts first for silver then for a woman, Lady Wakasa. The other, his neighbor and occasional assistant (Tobei), wants to bring glory and wealth as a samurai. The film sees these goals to fruition but at terrible costs. Genjuro's wife is killed by soldiers and Tobei's wife is forced into prostitution after being brutally raped by other samurai. Ugetsu feels progressive for its time, it's very much interested in the female sacrifice that the men's rise to power imposes. They aren't bad people and have good intentions but are blind to the consequence of their actions. Ultimately happiness is found by the two men in the place they started geographically and socially. This is a cautionary tale warning against the betrayal of familial responsibility and the blind pursuit of riches (or anything really). This grounded story is augmented by the supernatural. The evocative black and white cinematography is otherworldly and suggests the story's existence in a different reality long before the plot directly introduces it. Consider their journey by lake with the fog obscuring the surroundings just a little to perfectly. When a ship appears you can't help but expect a ghost and it's all thanks to the visuals. The plot introduces this element via Genjuro's muse in the market who turns out to be a spirit returning to earth to experience the love she never had in her life. The extent of her control over him is vague, he seems lucid when making the critical decision to get married to her but apparently forgets this overnight. A priest in the market eventually warns that he must leave the woman at once or face certain death. He also covers Genjuro's body in sanskrit text, a fact concealed to the audience until the wonderfully creepy Lady Wakasa recoils after touching him. He wills himself to leave the home but awakens to find it all burned down, and not all that recently according to the soldiers shaking him awake. The film nails this atmosphere of a period piece ghost story, not at all scary but undeniably creepy. The beautiful cinematography, thematically rich story, and well executed supernatural elements work in perfect harmony. It's another masterpiece from Mizoguchi.",5.0

One wants to become a samurai and one wants to live by making pottery; both leave their wives for other stories. They want leading roles in grand narratives, even if those narratives are illusions. It’s the old question of a virtual paradise—does living in something unreal count as living?—with distinct twists. Here, the virtual world of a samurai or a courtier is not distinct from the real world of a farmer. To move from the latter to the former, as Tobei and Genjuro do, means they have to avoid what they leave behind. And here, the virtual world is not a dichotomy of heaven and hell; conventionally, the virtual paradise is revealed as a kind of illusionistic nightmare. But here, the virtual contains as much pain as the real.
The horror comes from the men’s inevitable encounter with themselves as their two worlds meet. The new narratives are only bad for the pain they have caused—both to the men’s wives and the people that exist in their new lives. When Lady Wakasa touches Genjuro, covered with Buddhist prayers, it’s just as painful as Tobei’s brothel encounter; the dreams are alive too, which means the central question is less a case of avoiding dreams than of falling into the right ones. It makes sense Mizoguchi chose to adapt these stories but leave them in their diegetic time: how many people would feel as though they’re still dreaming, less than ten years after the war?
Earlier, the two couples and their son row over the lake. The fog hangs low on the water and mixes into the still, cloudy sky. They’re taking their pottery across the lake to sell it, away from the roaming army. The space is so shallow that the fog makes it look like they’re emerging from the horizon line and that they are giants—it’s one of the few times they’re enclosed from the war together. Ugetsu wishes they could stay together, even as this scene becomes the first separation, and the first encounter with a ghost.",5.0

Week 12 - Auteurs - Kenji Mizoguchi
Ugetsu follows a rural family in feudal japan, in the midst of a brutal civil war. As they struggle to survive, selling what they can and hiding from soldiers that raid their village. The two main characters we follow are peasants that look to make ends meet by selling pottery. As the war ramps up so does their business. Both men have their own aspirations and we see what men will do to reach for what they want. The vice of men lead to the destruction of everything they thought the loved.
The first thing I really notice in the film is the sound. From the haunting to score to the beating war drum that announces the soldiers, the sound of this film adds an extra layer to the viewing experience. The camera work is also masterful. This is my first experience with Mizoguchi film but by this point, almost thirty years into his directing career I’m assuming he’s at the top of his game. For a film released in 1953, it is amazing to see what he can do with the camera.
This is a film steeped in magical realism. This makes it seem more like a fairy tale than a historical narrative. This allows Mizoguchi to really ratchet up the tension and fully explore these themes that he uses Maybe because of this we experience some ominous foreshadowing throughout the early part of the film. The foggy boat ride to get to the market gives you a feeling of uncertainty. The wife expressing how all she needs is her loving husband is stuck in your head by the time your realize it’s too late.",4.0

Week 12 - Auteurs - Kenji Mizoguchi
Progress - 11/52
Haunting and very sad piece here, as two villagers are tired of being poor and upon having some success selling their wares, get a taste of success/money and push themselves, and their families, into unknown territory. The local village chief warns them of seeking profits during wartime but they continue on.
It's beautifully shot but the most impressive part is the degree of emotions experienced by the main characters. It feels real in each scene, and I was pretty impressed by all of the actors. The haunting, spiritual part feels a little odd at first but I ended up liking the direction that they took it in.",3.5
I really liked the part where he slashed the candle in half with a sword and it went out. don't know why that struck me.,4.5
"Beautiful, flowing camerawork, enthralling, expressive performances, and a harrowing, heartbreaking story of war, greed, and loss, overlaid with an atmosphere that seamlessly switches from mournful to brutal to ghostly and back again. Absolutely brilliant. Mizoguchi is the man, forever and always.",4.5
"Ravishing, dreamlike monument from Mizoguchi about a man (Masayuki Mori)'s greedy abandonment of his wife (Kinuyo Tanaka) and son during a time of war and his subsequent, tragic cavorting in the spirit world is sourced from fable-like stories by the writer Ueda Akinari, and the sweep of the plot has the deeply rooted, elemental feel of folklore being passed down directly to us. The film is pulled in many directions simultaneously in terms of its focus, ironically given the somewhat schematic and unbalanced nature of its structure, but a key theme is the ravages that war inflicts on people, especially women; in this way the film fits neatly in with Mizoguchi's '30s works about the sufferings of women like The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums, Osaka Elegy and Sisters of the Gion... but despite its reputation this film lacks some of the elegance of those, introducing a compelling but comparatively weak subplot about a man-child (Eitaro Ozawa) whose aspirations to become a Samurai warrior leave his wife suffering that it cannot really resolve satisfactorily. One is so seduced by the opening act -- with its chronicle of slowly creeping obsession and escape -- and by the ghost story elements of the midsection, and the plight and downfall of the potter Genjurō's wife, that your only wish is to spend more time in that world and it's strange to have it routinely interrupted in such a short film. Every part of the film is sensorially arresting (the fog! the light!), however, and the feeling of redemption and grace at the finale, as bleak as the actual events depicted really are, is so persuasive in its maturity about love and death that it could save your life.
Seeing this extremely late at night in a dark room is an experience I wholeheartedly recommend.",4.0
"Guau.
Nunca olvidaré mi primer contacto con Mizoguchi: Proyectaban El intendente Sansho en los Doré y yo iba un poco bastante borracho (aún a día de hoy no sé cómo lo conseguí) y, al llegar y terminar de ver la película, me encontré totalmente embobado por las imágenes que acababa de ver y cómo en menos de un cuarto de hora, un director japonés hizo desaparecer de mí todo signo de alcohol.
Sin embargo, una de las cosas que más me fascinó de él (además del tratamiento a la mujer) fue lo naturalista de sus dramas. La suciedad inherente al sufrimiento en la sociedad feudal y cómo en determinados momentos puedes hasta sentir el polvo de tierra que se te mete entre los dientes.
En esta película logra ese mismo efecto y le da otro enfoque distinto: Añade elementos del folclore nativo y le dota a su historia de tintes de realismo mágico que no hacen si no reforzar de manera sobresaliente la intención y la idea controladora de la película, con un poso agridulce en el espectador que, teniendo en cuenta las anteriores vistas suyas, parece algo habitual en él.",4.0
"Director Kenji Mizoguchi’s film is based on the 18th century supernatural stories in the Ugetsu Monogatari (Tales of Moonlight and Rain), and takes place during civil warfare in 16th century Japan. Despite the concerns of his wife, a potter seeks to take risks and profit from the chaos of war. His friend has the desperate ambition to become a samurai, despite not being of the right class or even possessing the armor necessary. It’s this desire for money and fame, as opposed to being cautious and content, that will prove to be the men’s undoing. The potter will meet a young woman from a market who turns out to be an alluring phantom, a Japanese Circe of sorts, and so the desire for sensual pleasure is added to these temptations.
Machiko Kyo plays Lady Wakasa, the temptress, and it’s interesting as her true nature and emotions are gradually revealed. Unfortunately the role of the would-be samurai is comically overacted by Eitaro Ozawa, which took away from my enjoyment. There are some beautiful shots, such as a boat slowly disappearing into the mist and fog, as well as great moments, such as when the samurai reunites with his wife under very different circumstances (which I won’t spoil), and the film is certainly well done and worth watching. However, the story is a bit too much of a morality tale for my taste: the men put their wives at risk through the temptations of money, fame, and sex, and, well, of course bad things happen. The film clearly has a place in film history, but I find it hasn’t aged as well as other classics.",3.5

Top 20 Films of the 50’s
1953 Top 10
Spanish/English Review:
La segunda mejor película de las que he visto de Mizoguchi tras la perfecta “El intendente Sansho”.
Aquí Mizoguchi se aleja de su principal obsesión, las Geishas, y todas esas maravillosas películas que dirigió sobre ellas para crear una película que pienso que sirvió de inspiración a Kurosawa para dirigir su película “Trono de sangre”, ya que a pesar de no tener un argumento parecido sí que tienen elementos muy similares, como la terrorífica ambientación o las relaciones con la mujer y la anciana (que por cierto realiza una interpretación impresionante).
Tremenda es toda esa parte, la del que quiere ser samurai también es magnífica, pero me quedo con el ambiente tremendamente siniestro de la mujer “vampirica” que le chupa el alma y la voluntad a ese hombrecillo que lo dió todo por ella.
La película tiene algunas secuencias que se me quedarán grabadas, como la de las barcas avanzando en la niebla hacía una más que probable muerte y desolación. También la secuencia en la que el samurai que ha alcanzado la gloria se encuentra a su mujer prostituyendose, o la de la locura de Genjuro cuando se da cuenta de que está atrapado en casa de Wakasa y que nada es como él pensaba.
En fin, una maravilla, una obra maestra, esto es cine en su máxima expresión.

English:
The second best film I have seen of Mizoguchi after the perfect ""Sansho the Bailiff"".
Here Mizoguchi moves away from his main obsession, the Geishas, and all those wonderful films that he directed on them to create a film that I think inspired Kurosawa to direct his film ""Throne of blood"", since in spite of not having a similar story it does have very similar elements, such as the terrifying setting or the relationship between the woman and the old woman (which she plays an impressive role).
That part is impressive, the one with Tobei wanting to become a samurai is also magnificent, but I will choose the extremely sinister atmosphere of the ""vampiric"" woman who sucks the soul and the will of that little man who gave everything for her.
This film has some sequences that will remain in my memory, like the one of the boats advancing in the fog to a more than probable death and desolation. Also the sequence in which the samurai who has reached the glory finds his wife as a prostitute, or the one of the madness of Genjuro when he realizes that it is trapped in the house of Wakasa and that nothing is as he thought.

"A bit too plain and predictable to deserve the 5/5 I thought I may have given this. As my first Mizoguchi, I was expectedly pleased at the cinematography and acting but a little underwhelmed by the story.
The film certainly picks up throughout the second half though, slightly shifting from the moralistic tale of greed and war to this bizarre ghost love story.

In feudal wartime Japan, two men (a potter and a farmer) move from their home village to a city, hoping to become war profiteers, but tragically opt to leave their wives behind; as the men become wildly successful, one of the wives is murdered and the other is forced into a life of prostitution. The homecoming finale, which sees the protagonists as “sadder and wiser men,” is shattering. Mizoguchi’s ravishingly photographed fable of greed and ambition uses light, shadow and fog (not to mention those legendary crane shots) to perfectly complement his view of the world as a place of impossible moral choices.",5.0
Is it really cheating if it’s with a ghost??,4.0
"I really wanted to love this one, but I just couldn't engage with it much. The juxtaposition of realism and folklore never clicked, and the fact that the two stories were taken from entirely different sources was painfully apparent. It gave the characters a ridiculous quality as they shifted between the two forms. The idea of the real pains of war occurring within a magical folktale really appealed to the teenage Neil Gaiman fan in me, but the balance was off.
I also tend to dislike parables where the moral is ""you should have been happy in your station."" I was reminded of how much I hated reading Steinbeck's The Pearl in school. These kind of stories hector the poor for any class disruptive ambition and insist a peasant life (that the author has never experienced) is full of spiritually honest bucolic delights if only these ungrateful pigs will open their eyes and accept a little hardship.
I know Mizoguchi was more concerned with portraying mens selfishness and womens tragic generosity to them, but that idea fails because the women are flat, idealized characters compared to the men (who are not exactly rich characters themselves). The women feel more like a mechanism of punishment than suffering people in their own right.
There is a very effective evocation of mood going on here, and much of the direction displays a quiet but deep mastery (particularly the lake boating scene and the hot spring scene), but the aesthetic pleasures didn't lift me above my issues with the story. Certainly my least favorite of the foundational American appreciation of Japanese cinema films (Rashomon and Tokyo Story being the other two).",2.0

It was like “oh men are trash and greedy and will sacrifice everything for gain” then completely shit on its females characters and treated them as means of their male counterparts reaching enlightenment. I know this is from 1952 and about medieval Japan, but, come on. Ugh.

Ugetsu is directed by Kenji Mizoguchi and it stars Masayuki Mori, Machiko Kyô, Kinuyo Tanaka.
Director Kenji Mizoguchi is not as well known as Akira Kurosawa, nor is he yet enjoying a renaissance like Yasujiro Ozu is now. However, he had a long, career that stretched over four decades culminating in the 1950's with a handful of well known movies, the most famous being 1953's ""Ugetsu monogatori (Tales of Moonlight and Rain)"". Set in 16th-sentury Japan, it's a ghostly morality tale of two brothers, poor farmers who are both anxious to make their fortunes from the wartime activities surrounding them but via different means. The more focused Genjurô seeks his fortune through his homemade pottery which he sells in the bustling nearby town, and the younger Tobei's pipe dream is to become a samurai warrior.
What Mizoguchi does remarkably well is interweave the two stories so that they reinforce and reflect upon each other seamlessly. He also avoids the pitfall of having the story pontificate upon the obvious morals of the story by not using archetypes but instead showing the realistic flaws in all the main characters. Without the use of special effects, the fantasy elements are not remotely contrived but rather emphasize the often nebulous difference between dreams versus reality, ambition versus happiness, and gratification versus fulfillment.
Even more impressively, with the expert work of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, Mizoguchi provides meticulous, often stunning tableaux to set his scenes, and his narrative is suffused with deep humanity even when the characters perform deplorable acts.
Ugetsu is a movie about the human condition, it shows how a two simple families can be corrupted by things like money, the greed, the selfishness but the movie never tries to condemn the characters, because they are just ordinary people living on difficult times.

"Seen at Film Forum’ “Japanese Horror” series. 
A folktale with a straightforward moral message: the desire for money, power, admiration, and sensual delights only leads to suffering. Beyond that, Ugetsu is a multi-hued symphony of loss and failure, shot through with intense feelings of mujō, the ephemeral, impermanent nature of all things in life. 
Though the story timeframe is the 1500s, I read the film as an allegory of Japan’s WW2 imperial hubris and tragic failure. It’s difficult to comprehend the intense loss and disillusionment experienced by the Japanese people. Ugetsu is a document of this monumental post-WW2 pathos, presented in the universal language of the folktale, therefore timeless and relatable for all.",5.0

Japanuary 2024 Film No. 10:
Kenji Mizoguchi's ""Ugetsu"" is a haunting and timeless masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its era and has left an indelible mark on film history.
Set against the backdrop of civil war-torn Japan in the 16th century, we follow the intertwined fates of two couples whose lives become entangled with the supernatural. Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) and Tobei (Eitarō Ozawa) are driven by dreams of wealth and social status that lead them down paths that reveal the fragility of human desires and leave their wives as the victims.
The film deals with themes such as love, sacrifice, greed and opportunism, the cruel nature of war and its consequences for the population. Above all, the women who not only become victims of unrestrained soldiers, but also suffer under the ambition of their husbands. Supernatural elements are used to create a narrative that works on both an emotional and philosophical level and adds to the mystical atmosphere.
The cinematic craft is visible in every shot. The camera work, long takes, but above all the wonderful lighting of the film, make for visually impressive images. These capture not only the beauty of the landscape, but also the ethereal, memorable undertone.
A work that remains in the memory and leaves a lasting impression long after the credits have rolled.

Japanuary 2024 Film Nr. 10:
Kenji Mizoguchis ""Ugetsu"" ist ein eindringliches und zeitloses Meisterwerk, das die Grenzen seiner Epoche überschreitet und einen unauslöschlichen Eindruck in der Filmgeschichte hinterlassen hat.
Vor dem Hintergrund des vom Bürgerkrieg gezeichneten Japans im 16. Jahrhundert verfolgen wir die miteinander verwobenen Schicksale zweier Paare, deren Leben sich mit dem Übernatürlichen verstrickt. Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) und Tobei (Eitarō Ozawa) werden von Träumen von Reichtum und sozialem Status getrieben, die sie auf Wege führen, welche die Zerbrechlichkeit menschlicher Sehnsüchte offenbaren und ihre Frauen als Leidtragende hinterlassen.
Der Film befasst sich mit Themen wie Liebe, Aufopferung, Gier und Opportunismus, der grausamen Natur des Krieges und seinen Folgen für die Bevölkerung. Allen voran den Frauen, die nicht nur Opfer von hemmungslosen Soldaten werden, sondern auch unter dem Ehrgeiz ihrer Ehemänner leiden müssen. Mithilfe von übernatürlichen Elementen wird eine Erzählung geschaffen, die sowohl auf emotionaler als auch auf philosophischer Ebene funktioniert und der mystischen Atmosphäre zuträgt.
Das filmische Handwerk ist in jeder Einstellung sichtbar. Die Kameraführung, langen Einstellungen, aber vor allem die wundervolle Ausleuchtung des Films, sorgen für visuell eindrucksvolle Bilder. Diese fangen nicht nur die Schönheit der Landschaft ein, sondern auch den ätherischen, einprägsamen Unterton.

Ugetsu has been one of the first non American/European movies of this challenge. And to be quite honest when I first laid my eyes on this I didn't quite know how disturbing this experience was going to be.
Ugetsu takes place during the 16th century Japanese Civil War. We get introduced to Gunjuro and Tobei, two farmers who in the midst of the war, are selling handcrafted products to the local villagers. Both men desire to become rich. But their lives change drastically in different manners. Gunjuro meets a mysterious young woman who lures him to her mansion, whilst Tobei becomes the powerful samurai he always dreamed of becoming. But both men's actions leave severe consequences behind for both them, and their wives. Seriously impressed by this. I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to understand much of the story but thankfully that wasn't the case.

"As it turns out, making a historical film and a ghost film are the same thing. When Mizoguchi finds that perfect distance between his floating lens and the bodies of his actors within those lush spaces both decrepit and opulent, when the camera moves just right and takes us with it, when a shadow falls just into place, when the most exact cut melts one space into the next; it is in that total cinematic form where materialistic determinism and paranormal phenomena fully converge and coalesce, and where we are fully immersed in that fourth dimension of cinema Eisenstein described. The physicality of the present, the only moment that exists is the here and now, until those fickle abstractions of past and future invade and the shadows that enshroud a woman become the testament to our failures and the stranger passing by you on a boat is the warning of the road you should not take but inevitably will. The camera creates its own moral universe and history. Its beginning and ending are set until the final frames are done; the camera glides from a gravestone to the open hills, as if to acknowledge that when the film ends is when the rest of the world begins again, where nothing starts or ends, simply continues.",5.0

A ghost story without a ghost. Such a story of war and greed, love and betrayal is of course inherently cinematic, but Mizoguchi’s control over the medium is what allows him to create a truly singular experience. Moments are genuinely haunting. The soundtrack elevates the supernatural feel superbly.

Lady Wakasa step on me please.,3.5
"Ugetsu kicks off as an adventure film about the misfortunes of XVI century peasants caught off guard by war. It later splits into two plots, one of which shall become a comical cautionary tale about vanity, so quotidian and cliché that one will barely remember it the next day, and the other that shall haunt one even after the screen turns black. This latter story, accompanied by beautiful uncanny soundtrack, culminates in a breathtaking encounter with the preternatural, which unravels into an all the more disturbing thought of the omnipotent power of the inconceivable over man.
I am no longer among the living. I suppose such is the way of the world.
The way of the world. What horror rests upon the syllables of the phrase! The measured flow of sounds, indicating the invisible reigning void. The precise movements of the camera, indicating an otherworldly presence in the final scene of the film.

Absolute masterpiece . There is no human action that has no consequences. The result is a seductive and suggestive work, where the sense of the supernatural hovers almost like an oasis of peace and serenity over a world in the throes of madness. The lesson is only learned after suffering pain and loss, ending worse than how they started. A lesson in exaggeration, greed, desertion, sacrifice, and love. Using a dramatic piece of Japanese history, Mizoguchi succeeds in framing the cruelty of war, and the expedition to the bumpy road to prosperity and to be human is expressed and in this journey life and death meet.",5.0
"Kenji Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu is a towering masterpiece which serves as one of those “perfect” works. After watching a film like Ugetsu, I feel as if I’m entirely satisfied with cinema for the day. Few films are as smooth, confident, and masterful as Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu. A ghost story, a samurai tale, a war film, a story of greed and temptation, and a film about poverty and regret. Ugetsu is so much more than that. War is the backdrop and it creeps up on the characters. A quest to care for the family becomes a journey where the peasants ask for more than they can handle. From the first scene to the last, I knew I was watching a film about greed, and as I predicted, that’s pretty much the central theme of the story. Mizoguchi makes no mistakes here. Every shot, every line, and every scene isn’t wasted. It makes me wish I watched this in better quality, so it only guarantees a better experience once I watch this when it looks better. Ugetsu isn’t a thriller, but it features some thrilling sequences. These characters can never catch a break and their sins lead to despair. Ugetsu is a film of darkness and constant conflict, mostly seen through the turmoil of the civil war. When I revisit Ugetsu, I’ll love it more and appreciate it more than I already do. 
Ugetsu follows the story of two village peasants who make a living off of selling their earthenware pottery. One man is a husband and father, the other dreams of being a samurai, but his wife dreads the idea. When their village is raided and robbed by the opposing army during a civil war, the two men and one of their wives leave for a nearby island, leaving one man’s wife and kid behind. There, the samurai life becomes a possibility for one man, and as the other one becomes rich in silver, a mysterious woman and her servant invite him into their life. Ugetsu is beautiful on the outside, but it was unexpectedly chilling in a tonal sense. You can feel dreadful events creeping up on the characters. Ugetsu is famously beloved and acclaimed due to its ability to mix fantasy and realism. It feels like a fairy tale, in fact. Overall, it’s a brilliantly directed and written film. So many areas of the film feel sophisticated for the time. The acting is great and the slow, quiet finale is far from a letdown. Haunting score, too.

""La imagen siempre está por hacer""
Una de las películas más virtuosas y perfectas de la Historia del Cine, que cumple setenta años. La importancia del canon, la búsqueda ilusoria del lujo material y el precio del éxito. La condición humana y sus vicios irrevocables.
Los grandes clásicos no sólo nos comunican infinidad de cosas de su pasado recreado y su presente, sino también de su futuro. Están provistos de una clarividencia que emana de la intuición y la capacidad de los creadores de sintetizar los pálpitos y las contradicciones de un período concreto. Esta es una cita misteriosa, imperdible y totalmente deslumbrante, un estudio moral y filosófico del ser humano en condiciones de precariedad, deseo y ambición desmedida. Kenji Mizoguchi retrata impecablemente el rol de la mujer en los ambientes urbanos del Japón del siglo XVI, a la sombra de la insaciable codicia, lujuria y crueldad masculinas. A su modo, diagnostica las heridas que dejó la Segunda Guerra Mundial en el seno de la sociedad nipona, pero bajo un barniz de fantasía poética que interroga los mecanismos de poder en la esfera pública, desde las transacciones hasta el trabajo físico. El personaje de Lady Wakasa es uno de los más fascinantes e intrigantes que nos ha proporcionado el cine japonés -y quizá mundial-, de naturaleza homérica, como si fuese una sirena cuyo canto atrapa al protagonista en su isla particular.
El cineasta es perfectamente consciente de la distancia que debe elegir en cada toma para que resulte tensa y significativa, y su coordinación de la puesta en cuadro está al alcance de muy pocos. Cada plano engarza con el posterior en una clase maestra de narrativa audiovisual, ritmo y también de montaje, interno y externo. En términos argumentales, Cuentos de la Luna Pálida es una inmensa actualización del retorno a casa de Ulises, que se demora hasta la extenuación. El viaje no es sólo externo, sino también psicológico. Poco a poco, los protagonistas se van percatando de que no es oro todo lo que reluce, hasta ir desvistiendo poco a poco su ego desmesurado y sus ínfulas.
Análogamente a otra de sus obras pilares, El Intendente Sansho, Mizoguchi filma una de las escenas de reencuentro más hermosas y tristes que se recuerden, rayana en el placer de lo efímero. No obstante, hay un sabor optimista en su clausura, pensada a través de un plano que se eleva.

"""Success always comes with a price in suffering.""
Hmm. You know I like it, I agree it's beautiful, it got a more than well deserved nomination for costume design, but I didn't love it like so many people here do. I don't mind that it's more exposition heavy as I really love both Onibaba and Kuroneko which deliver somewhat similar stories, but it never fully clicked with me unfortunately.
That being said, I do appreciate the history and importance of this film for its influence on not only Japanese cinema, but also helping introduce western audiences to Japanese films.
Hopefully when I watch Sansho the Bailiff I don't feel the same way, but I was kind of scratching my head at why I didn't love this one as much. Maybe I'll do a rewatch down the line.",4.0
"In 16th century Japan, the prevalence of war and its varying array of casualties is exhibited in Mizoguchi’s gothic cautionary tale of obsession and greed. In the desolate landscapes of war torn Japan the commoner is shown how the many effects of war can lead to a life of self-destruction fueled by self-serving desires. The certain actions influenced by man’s ego and personal gain have ultimately more severe costs for women than the men who initiate such actions. The bondage of poverty and personal anguish, the need for self-worth and stature perverted into obsessive compulsions. Honoring oneself in order to achieve the illusion of fortune and materialistic greed. Abandonment and shame are not worth the price of a Kimono. The haunting drums and soundscapes that scratch away while restless ghosts bring about alluring temptations. An extraordinary metaphorical film about society and the sins of our fathers.",4.0
"There are many films like this, but few as effective, evocative, and downright beautiful.",4.5
"A harrowing folktale about the folly of man's greed and lust for power, and the tragedy of war. Mizoguchi beautifully mixes dream and reality, until delusions are finally broken, and we are left awaken anew. An absolute master of the art form

"I thought this was fantastic. There’s something so melodramatic and horrifying about it. There’s a darkness to the film that you really feel. You almost wish the film were longer, that it had multiple episodes and more stories to tell. The music is obviously amazing. It’s this hypnotic, haunting background mechanism that makes you feel a constant suspended state of shock. The tension it brings to the film is partially why I think it’s such a success. The brutality of the anti-war sentiment and the foolish, chaotic nature of patriarchal rule runs so closely to the current moment and touches you. Mankind keeps making these Faustian bargains with itself and it seems we will never stop. That’s the actual nightmare.",4.5

"this is phenomenal. incredible storytelling that explores human desires and unwillingness to be satisfied. the music, editing, and lighting give the whole movie and eerie undertone that, at times, makes the main character’s feelings of regret almost palpable.
all in all, a masterpiece that explores what it means to be human: desire, loss, regret, learning, and redemption.

"Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu tells us a story of two peasants whose greed and ambition takes them into a path where they meet their inevitable fate. This one was beautifully shot, acted and narrated in such a way that, it completely gets us immersed into that era and their lives. I was with the characters and followed their journey throughout, rooted for them to find their peace and happiness. I loved Kenji's depiction of love, greed , ambition , its after effects and the redemption arc towards the end took this movie to a notch higher, that was much needed. But, I felt bad for Miyagi , as she deserved a lot more than what she got, such a lovely women. Over all, a beautiful piece of cinema. Loved it !!!!!",4.5

"Success always comes with a price in suffering.
What a individual defines as success though may vary. And what price seems justified is something that changes with perspective, age and wisdom.
Although Genjuro and Tobei seek danger after danger, take risk after risk, and are thus constantly reminded of what's at stake, they run with their eyes open towards pain and sorrow.
The real and the surreal are two realms that seemlessly melt into one another in Mizoguchis Ugetsu. Just like outside of film, the truth is sometimes best found through dreams.
This is a masterful tale on how greed can blind men. And how fleeting pleasures may eventually cause long lasting pain.",5.0

Mein erster Mizoguchi! Zeitlich wie ästhetisch irgendwo zwischen Kurosawa's „Rashomon“ und „Das Schloss im Spinnwebwald“ platziert sich „Ugetsu“ als wunderschönes, wenn auch bitteres Märchen.
Gemeinhin wird der Film wohl als Frauen-Drama gelesen, durch die drei in Herkunft, Tun und Streben unterschiedlichen Damen. Ich konnte jedoch nicht umhin, den beiden Männern und ihren Bemühungen um finanziellen und sozialen Aufstieg meine Hauptaufmerksamkeit zu schenken. Dieser blieb freilich vergeblich.
Und dieses „Schuster, bleib bei deinen Leisten“-Prinzip kennt man zur Genüge von einem Großunternehmen unter der Führung einer kleinen resoluten Maus. Man wird eben als Löwenkönig oder Hyäne geboren. So ist das nun mal.
Bitter.

ENGLISH VERSION
Japanuary #11
My first Mizoguchi! Somewhere between Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" and ""The Castle in the Cobweb Forest"", ""Ugetsu"" is a beautiful, if bitter fairy tale.
Commonly, the film is probably read as a women's drama, due to the three ladies differing in origin, actions and aspirations. However, I could not help but pay my main attention to the two men and their efforts for financial and social advancement. This, of course, remained in vain.
And this ""cobbler, stick to your last"" principle is well known from a large company under the leadership of a resolute little mouse. One is born a lion king or a hyena. That's the way it is.

"Kenji Mizoguchi's exquisitely shot parable from 1953 is a heartbreaking look at greed, unchecked ambition, love and loss in a time or war. Strong performances throughout and steady and thoughtful (but generously light of touch) direction from Mizoguchi keep the film engaging but it's Kazuo Miyagawa's outstanding cinematography that's the star.",4.0
"Criterion Challenge 2022
1950’s (3/52)
It’s been a long time coming but I’ve finally seen my first Mizoguchi film, and it’s a marvel.
A haunting, dreamy exploration of greed and hardship in 16th century Japan. Told through two different couples and how the men are driven by promises of fortune, and the impact this had on their families. What I found so refreshing about Ugetsu is the female perspective and truly empathetic look at how much women suffered at the hands of a patriarchal society in those times. It’s so nuanced that even the temptress spirit is a tragic figure rather than a vengeful one, having been just as wronged by Genjuro. Machiko Kyo is mesmerising as Lady Wasaka, at once capable of being spooky, alluring and heartbreaking.
Such a great unsettling vibe throughout too, with hazy cinematography and beautiful use of light and black/white. The score is unforgettable.",4.5

Considerato fra i massimi capolavori del cinema mondiale, ""Racconto Di Pioggia E Di Luna"" è una sovrannaturale storia di perdita, di amore e di rendenzione sullo sfondo dell'era Sengoku, percorsa da infinite guerre civili.
Le scene di battaglia iniziali sono riprese da Mizoguchi con inquadrature statiche e montaggio lento, insolita scelta che permette tuttavia di percepire la brutalità collettiva. I pochi movimenti di macchina sono sempre concentrati sulle singole persone, vero fulcro dell'opera, o sull'ambiente circostante (sia casalingo che naturale), andando a ricreare quell'armonia che i personaggi cercano e perdono continuamente, sia per ragioni interne (la sete di potere e ricchezza dei due protagonisti) che esterne (le donne oppresse dai soldati, in particolare la timorosa Miyagi e la coraggiosa Ohama). Proprio su quest'ultimo punto è interessante soffermarsi per capire la contemporaneità del cinema classico giapponese: come Ozu in vari suoi film (""Tarda Primavera"" e ""Il Tempo Del Raccolto Del Grano"" ad esempio), e forse ancor di più del suo collega, Mizoguchi spoglia il cinema del suo normale sguardo maschile per riflettere sulla violenza misogina (i tristemente famosi stupri di guerra per dimostrare il proprio dominio sulle ""cose"" dei nemici) e sui ruoli di genere che ingabbiano le donne ma anche gli stessi uomini, schiavi dei propri desideri (alcuni hanno visto nella sottotrama sovrannaturale una rappresentazione della tossica idealizzazione, tanto cara alla nostra tradizione cortese per esempio, che contribuisce agli stereotipi e dunque alla sottomissione femminile) e destinati, pertanto, alla sconfitta; pulsioni autodistruttive rappresentate anche dal tradimento, il quale permette al film di aprirsi ad una parentesi romantica apparentemente idilliaca e a tratti bucolica che, un po' come ""Mulholland Drive"" di Lynch, prende sul finale una piega inaspettata ed inquietante ma di cui già si erano avuti sentori nel corso della pellicola (basti pensare all'iconica inquadratura della barca circondata da una nebbia spettrale, estetica baviana in anticipo di anni). Inaspettato è anche che in un'opera basata principalmente sulla critica all'egoismo maschile vi sia un sentito elogio alla professione di uno degli uomini protagonisti, rappresentazione dell'arte e della creazione come sintesi ed espressione dell'anima umana.
Nonostante la versione tagliata di alcuni minuti impedisca di apprezzare l'opera a pieno, il classico di Mizoguchi resta un racconto morale intenso e stratificato, tecnicamente funzionalissimo e con una colonna sonora (il tema principale è citato anche da Björk in ""Holographic Entrypoint"") che è perfetta sintesi del film: un'onirica commistione tra violenza e tristezza con brevi scorci di dolcezza.",4.5

Greed is always dangerous, it can destroy people's lives.",4.5

"So formally impressive and stunning to look at (especially that foggy rowboat sequence). The ominous tone is established quickly and does not let up. Greed, temptation and ambition as traps only to be realized when it's too late, a meditation on what really matters. A timeless tale masterfully told, bleak but not completely devoid of hope.",4.0
"An exquisite ghost story, told by an ageing Japanese master, Kenji Mizoguchi's 'Ugetsu' strikes a cord with its balance of both, terrestrial and fantastical folklore, earning its reputation as one Mizoguchi's defining cinematic works.
Garnering its stories from Ueda Akinari's 1776 book of the same name, Mizoguchi's film, centres on the struggle of two peasants, who each struggle to make a fortune in the sixteenth century era of civil wars in Japan.
Clearly crafted with an immense amount of humanism and elegance, there is a remarkable atmosphere of mystery present at the heart of Mizoguchi's film, something that remains the clear reason this tale of greed, envy and fate, is still impactful today.",4.0
"Kenji Mizoguchi is a cinematic master of painful beauty. Two months ago, I experienced Mizoguchi’s greatest film, Sansho the Bailiff. The motion picture was the most disturbing depiction of slavery and family separation I have ever seen. With Ugetsu, Mizoguchi creates a fantasy within the parameters of a bleak, naturalistic setting. Amid civil war, Mizoguchi examines how two men leave their families to seek success. One desires to be a samurai, and the other aspires to make money through his pottery. As the narrative evolves, Mizoguchi introduces motifs and themes of spirituality, deception, greed, and how these aspects contribute to a haunting result. Mizoguchi uncovers how the delusions of greed cannot only affect the person but the people close to the individual. The motion picture also acts as an insightful look at life for women in a patriarchal society. Like Sansho the Bailiff, it is clear during several scenes how Mizoguchi would be an influence for Steven Spielberg and Terrence Malick. Spielberg might have directed some haunting films in his career, but none of them have matched the potency of Sansho the Bailiff and Ugetsu. Terrence Malick’s masterpieces contain a lyrical beauty, but Mizoguchi’s two films make Malick’s artistry seem obvious in comparison. For every heartbreaking moment in Ugetsu, there is an elegant scene of restraint.",5.0

I had to watch this for school and usually the films I watch for class aren't always my cup of tea but I actually really liked this one. I legitimately had no clue what this was about so when certain things got revealed towards the end, I was genuinely surprised.
It does really slow down in the middle tho. That's when it almost lost my interest. But the first and last 30 or so minutes are really good.
Overall, this was a pretty good film that I do believe I'll rewatch one day.",3.5

"Fairytale-esque, but with a much more nuanced portrayal of human nature. While the film definitely has moral message, it doesn’t judge the flaws of the characters to harshly and instead gives an empathetic view on their behavior.",4.5
"Even though the narrative takes place in the 16th century, the film's themes are timeless and can be easily applied to modern times. Folk tales which might seem, prima facie, simple are gorgeously adapted, and, while the original material enables Kenji Mizoguchi to pour a fair share of incredible mysticism to the movie, they never feel anything short of human, as the director's eye for social realism is also wonderfully apt.
I don't believe a single frame is wasted, and the narrative flows just as fast as if the tales were being told in spoken word. As a final and marvellous touch, the score is outrageously evokative, being it a blend of Japanese folk music with the eeriest and most spacial usage of sounds among its contemporaries.",4.0
"Ugetsu is a parable about men who pursue success in unwise ways, leaving their families vulnerable. It seems to warn against not being content with the things you already have in life. Both Genjūrō and Tōbei go off, one to sell pottery and one to become a samurai, and both of their wives suffer misfortune, subject to the horrors of war.
One of the more memorable stretches of the film involves a ghostly noblewoman trying to ensnare Genjūrō as her husband. The prayers written all over his body reminded me of the ""Hoichi the Earless"" segment of Kwaidan, a movie which also has a story about a ghostly woman seeking a husband. I do like a good Japanese ghost story.",3.5

"اولین چیزی که درباره این فیلم نظر من را به خودش جلب کرد . تاثیر عظیمی هستش که این اثر بر روی فیلم بزرگی چون کوایدان اثر ماساکی کوبایاشی گذاشته است . اینکه یک فیلمساز بتواند یک روایت انسانی در فضای اسطوره ای و فانتزی خلق کند ، بی شک کاری شگفت انگیز است .
این اولین فیلم است که من از کنجی میزوگوچی تماشا میکنم . باید اعتراف کنم ، به شدت اثر قدرتمندی بود ، فیلم برداری و موسیقی و همین طور فضا سازی این اثر ، مخاطب را محسور خود می کند ، در یک سکانس از فیلم که شخصیت ها در قایقی کوچک در حال سفر هستند ، به یکباره به یک مسافر خسته و مریض بر می خورند و گفت و گو هایی میان آنها رد و بدل می شود ، دوربین از زاویه هایی شخصیت ها را تحت سیطره خود قرار می دهد که مخاطب از خود سوال می کند ، کارگردان و دوربین در حال حاضر در کجا واقع شده اند؟ ایا در وسط رودخانه ؟ این لحظه در دوران خود بی نظیر است.
در فیلم نامه این اثر به نوعی رگه ای شاعرانه وجود دارد که فضا و حالتی اسطوره ای و افسانه به آن می بخشد. فیلم در ابتدا کاملا بر واقع گرایی و رئال استوار است ، اما در اواسط و اواخر فیلم مخاطب شاهد فضاهایی سورئال است و این تغییر ماهیت فیلم نه تنها آسیبی به بافت داستانی وارد نمی کند ، بلکه در داستان و حوادث فیلم را از حد خود فرا تر می برد و به آنها ماهیتی ماورالطبیعی می بخشد و این نکته در اینجا مطرح است که تمام تغییرات موجود در این فیلم تکیه گاه و پشتیبانی محکم از احساسات و عواطف انسانی دارند ، به همین دلیل تلخی داستان فیلم تا این اندازه اثر گذار است.
آکیرا کوروساوا و همین طور یاسیجیرو ازو کارگردانانی هستند که میتوانند احساسات صحنه ها و سکانس های رویارویی شخصیت هایشان را به مخاطب منتقل کنند .
مخاطب می تواند احساس آن دختر کوچک را در ریش قرمز زمانی که کاسه را می شکند و از شدت شرم و خجالت زدگی سرش را پایین می اندازد درک کند.
مخاطب می تواند تنهایی و غم یک پدر و یا همسر را در فیلم های ازو درک کند.
کنجی میزوگوچی و سینمایش این امتیاز را داراست و مخاطب در مقابل غم و تلخی که در این فیلم وجود دارد احساس شرم و سرشکستگی کند .
این ویژگی بسیار خاص است.",5.0
"A poignant examination of how greed and lust can ravage a persons life, Kenji Mizoguchi's 'Ugetsu' is a bold outing in the jidaigeki genre that seamlessly blends the supernatural with the struggles of everyday life. This loose adaptation of Ueda Akinari's 'The House in the Thicket' and 'The Lust of the White Serpent' is a cautionary tale of how the pursuit of short term profits in a war time environment can ultimately dismantle your way of living, as Genjuro and Tobei erode the stability of their family lives in the name of honour and lust.
At times Mizoguchi's classic feels as though it could read as a feminist drama, as the wives of our protagonists are provided no agency in the hardships they are forced to endure at the price of their husbands. Their downfalls ultimately indicate the damaging effects male toxicity has on a small community of villagers, as the greed of the patriarchy leaves the honour and sanctity of its women permanently tarnished, thus destroying the initial hopes of improving the material conditions of the family unit.
Ugetsu is an aesthetically pleasing film to watch. The camerawork, movement and framing here is almost perfect throughout and provides a real momentum as we follow our characters journey across feudal Japan. Misty lakes, haunting mountainsides and dilapidated family manors all appear picturesque, and provide the film with an evocative beauty as the supernatural slowly begins to seep out of our characters environment.
A true classic and up there with even the strongest of works from Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi, Ugetsu is essential viewing to anybody wanting to explore the wonderful world of Japanese cinema.",5.0

"I'm pretty sure it would be 4+ stars projected in theaters -- there are shots in here that freeze your heart and warp time, that feel like whole poems in an image -- but the small screen really isn't kind to Ugetsu because, frankly, there's not much else here beyond the power of its compositions. Reaffirms my conviction that the bleakest and most affecting war stories don't stint on jokes. The characters are stock saints and cads, the tone swings from ""This happiness is suspect"" to ""Yep, everything's terrible"" with the dependability of a metronome. It's less a drama and much more a parable, one with a rather obvious lesson. Although I suppose ""don't go home with a horny ghost"" is such an extreme edge case it deserves to be spelled out.",3.5
"Ugetsu monogatari is eerie, brutal, and timeless. What separates a special film like Ugetsu from everything else is that it touches on some of the finest details of the human soul.

The photography by the master Miyagawa is haunting. The way he uses long takes to keep the viewer in the shot as long as possible adds to the ghastly atmosphere. 
The score is very traditional and is magnificent constant accompaniment. 
Machiko Kyo who plays Lady Wakasa is stellar in her role. She can say more with her face than most actors. Her physicality and grace display her rare skill.

""Ugetsu"" loses steam at about the 3/4-mark, at which point we feel both the director and screenwriter hurrying to patch up an ungainly story of two brothers and the losses they incur.

Director Kenji Mizoguchi told his cinematographer that he wanted to create the illusion that the film unrolled seamlessly like a Chinese scroll-painting. The enchanting nature of its camerawork, which consisted of 70% crane-shot footage, the editing, and music all achieve this to give Ugetsu a strikingly hypnotic effect long before any of the paranormal elements begin to unfold.
Another reason the seamless flow of the film is so impressive is that adapts ""The House in the Thicket"" and ""The Lust of the White Serpent,"" two separate short stories by Ueda Akinari into one tragic narrative.

"Kenji Mizoguchi contrasts the depressing reality of late 16th century Japan, which was plagued by civil wars and territorial struggles, with a fantastic ghost story in which his protagonist, a potter named Genjūro, only finds a temporary way out. The film is loosely based on two short stories by Akinari Ueda, published as a yomihon (reading book) under the influence of Chinese and Japanese folk tales during the Edo period, and also incorporates some motifs from a story by Guy de Maupassant. In contrast to the ghost from the literary source, Lady Wakasa is not portrayed in the film as fundamentally negative, but appears as a melancholic love-seeker who wants to bind the potter to her in order to make up for the never experienced pleasures. While the yūrei are often depicted as vengeful ghosts in Japanese folk tales, this is not her main motivation. However, her gestures, clothing and make-up were clearly influenced by yūrei depictions in Noh plays, while in the famous sequence of idyllic scenes in the garden pool and at a picnic on the lakeshore, the scenes were inspired by calligraphic scrolls (kakemono). The potter's wife, played by Kinuyo Tanaka, who also appears as a ghost, symbolizes an archetypal mother figure as in the 18th century collection of stories. In a plan sequence, one of Mizoguchi's greatest achievements, she appears at a previously empty fireplace. This scene illustrates Genjūro's illusion, staged with unique precision. The aesthetically impressive film was made during the director's most productive phase, it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 1953 and was awarded the Silver Lion, the main prize was not awarded that year.",5.0

I had the urge to finally watch this- it’s been hovering on my watchlist for far too long. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. The black and white cinematography is some of the best I’ve seen. This film tells a continual battle with inner desire and facing off between good and evil. Humanity in it’s truest form. Poetry in movement as the camera gracefully transitions into new frames. Also as I begin to experiment with photography I saw this film in a visual composition. The architecture especially with the harsh shadows and lines made it visually engaging. I love that it all comes down to forgiveness and full circle after the antihero learns his lesson. These characters are empathetic right from the start. We cherish their growth. The montages of what could’ve been and the fleeting idea of eternal love was touching. Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering. ",5.0

"Set during the sixteenth-century while the country was gripped with civil wars, Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu chronicles the tragic drama of a potter and a pleasant who are caught-up in realising their dream. Their aggression, their greed to profit from the ongoing war, unintentionally costs them their familial lives. Mizoguchi subverts all the genre tropes, draws us in his murky fantasy drama of men abandoning everything for selfish reasons, while their wives had to pay for it, in prolonging suffering. Mizoguchi doesn't romanticize their suffering, he is interested in exploring the egotistical & self-conceited men who have long forgotten the smell of home.",0.0
"In an interview included on the Criterion Channel, cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa reflects on a three-year illness that left him bedridden, nearly deaf and stuck watching television.
Watching the dramas on television and the commercials, he saw, what he could tell as an industry veteran, a lot of money being spent making these pieces of media look as good as money could by. However, being deaf, he couldn't tell what was going on in any of them.
He reasoned that the problem was not a lack of audio, a simple fix that closed captioning could cover, but a lack in visual language. Without craft and a goal of story over spectacle, these dramas and commercials weren't entering the viewers minds in any meaningful way.
He suggested contemporary story tellers go back to silent films to learn how to tell a story visually.
This film is a golden example of this thought process. Camera movement that one might not even noticed if they were overwhelmed by the fairytale story before them, each nudge and dolly roll meaningful and purposeful. Characters transformed, not by CGI or green-screen, but by the toying of a lens while pushing in or drawing the camera back. Clever placement of lights or an all-hands-on-deck mid shot transition.
You can recreate the effects in this film with a computer, but it'd be like watching a magic show without the magician.",4.0
"Visually entrancing, thematically absorbing, and featuring a profoundly stirring blend of human drama and fantasy, Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is an unforgettable masterpiece. When it comes to Japanese fantasy-romance movies, it doesn't get any better than 1953's Ugetsu, which is quite an extraordinary film about family life, family duty, greed, war, familial ethics, and what happens when our ambitions come in the way of familial duty. Ugetsu is very much a ghost story that falls under the Japanese period drama genre known as Jidaigeki. Based off of stories from Ueda Akinari's book of the same name, the film is set during the Azuchi-Momoyama period and focuses on a peasant farmer who leaves his family in order to gain monetary success for his pottery. He soon thereafter falls victim to a spirit that seduces him. Meanwhile, there's a subplot involving his friend and neighbor, who also leaves his wife in order to pursue his desparate dreams of becoming a samurai. Through their selfish and delusional ambitions, these two men pay the price of abandoning their families all for the sake of success. Ugetsu is a very powerful story about the consequences of ambition and greediness as well as dealing with the immoralities of relationships between the real word and the spirit world. It's a story that will emotionally sweep you off your feet especially thanks to some amazing performances by Masayuki Tanaka and Mitsuko Mito as the farmer and the wannabe samurai friend. Mizoguchi fills the screen with some fantastically enthralling cinematography that seamlessly blends together reality and fantasy. Ugetsu is truly a cinematic experience one must see before they die. It's one of the best films of Japanese Cinema. If you enjoy great dramas about human beings, life, family, spirits, and duty, then definitely check out Ugetsu.

"Il film di Kenji Mozoguchi è definito dalla critica fra i migliori capolavori del cinema giapponese. La trama è davvero semplice: nel Giappone del XVI secolo in clima di guerra civile il vasaio Genjurô e il cognato Tobei aspirante samurai, una volta costretti a lasciare la città assieme alle mogli, decidono di separarsi temporaneamente da quest'ultime il primo per incrementare la sua vendita di ceramiche e il secondo per raggiungere il suo sogno.
Sin dalla prima visione, Ugetsu è entrato di diritto fra i miei film preferiti di ogni tempo, oltre che per uno dei finali più belli e commoventi mai visti in vita mia, soprattutto per la sua capacità di affrontare così tante tematiche in così poco tempo: partendo dal ruolo dell'uomo e della donna nella storia nipponica arrivando alla concezione giapponese di 'fantasma'; infatti, i fantasmi nel film, alcuni benevoli e altri maligni, sono tutti in carne ed ossa in quanto non esiste nella loro concezione l'idea del fantasma 'invisibile' diffusasi nella nostra cultura, poichè se il processo immaginifico tramite cui creiamo l'idea di fantasma non potrà mai prescindere dal piano della realtà e dai nostri sensi allora non ci si dovrà stupire se gli stessi fantasmi sono rappresentati fisici e tangibili.",4.5

"Je trouve ce film vraiment excellent. Mizoguchi jongle entre un réalisme dur avec misère, guerre, quotidien où la mort n'est jamais loin; et du fantastique, onirique, fantasmagorique. Il le fait très bien et ça se ressent visuellement avec ce travail sur la lumière où toutes les scènes d'amour fantasmatique sont enveloppées de vapeurs étranges et mystiques(il y a aussi cette scene sur la rivière avec le pêcheur qui est absolument magnifique).
Mizoguchi parle indirectement des femmes, oubliées, abandonnées par leur mari trop occupés à rêver. L'un reve de devenir samouraï et l'autre rêve d'un amour idyllique. Par vanité, avidité et soif de reconnaissance ils délaissent leur famille. Les femmes se retrouvent livrer à elles même et dans cette société japonaise médiévale(sûrement reflet de la société japonaise des années 50) elles ont la vie dure. Mizoguchi montre la faiblesse de l'Homme, un Monde rempli de pourritures sans honneur et sans valeurs.
La mise en scene de Mizoguchi est exemplaire, il utilise le corps de ses acteurs dans le cadre pour montrer leur rapport de force. Ses mouvements de caméra sont gracieux, il arrive à créer du mystique dans la dure réalité et ses transitions sont intéressantes.
Je me répète mais la lumière du film est sublime, la version restaurée que j'ai vu est somptueuse(merci Scorsese).
Mais voilà même si tout est excellent, comme pour Barberousse, Rashomon ou encore La rue de la honte, je n'arrive pas à rester attentif au film, à etre impliqué. Malgré la séance de cinema je divague constamment dans mes pensées comme si j'étais incapable de suivre ce cinéma là et ça m'énerve. D'autant plus que la fin m'a quand même mis un coup et je suis sur que j'aurais pu adorer si jetais pas un bouffon. Je suis dégoûté.",3.5

Week 12: Auteur - Kenji Mizoguchi
Good life advice: Don't bang a ghost. And maybe appreciate what you have in life, even if you're poor as dirt, and don't throw everything away to be a samurai, yeah?
I can't decide which of these scenes is more devastating: Miyagi being robbed and stabbed by roving warriors or Tobei running into Ohama in the local brothel after he cheats his way into samuraidom. But the freakiest scene is easily Lady Wakasa's full reveal as a spirit: Every time she was on-screen, I was both entranced and on edge the entire time.
I've never seen any Mizoguchi films before this one, but given how assured and poetic—and gorgeously shot—Ugetsu is, I don't think it will be my last.",4.0
"Film School Drop Outs Class of 2018, Week 12- Auteurs: Kenji Mizoguchi
Ugetsu is widely known as one of the most famous films by Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi and as one of the most important films of classical Japanese cinema.
Oftentimes, when it comes to foreign cinema, we tend to look over some directors because there' usually one or two directors that stand out so much in one country. For example, when it comes to Turkey, other than Ceylan virtually no other director is really recognised in the cinematic world, same can be applied to many, many different nations. I feel like this is somewhat true for Japan as well, aside from the diehard cinephiles, most people probably have only heard of Akira Kurosawa being the most famous auteur in Japanese cinema. However, that's neglecting countless numbers of great directors in the nation, including that of Kenji Mizoguchi.
Mizoguchi was raised in a family that lived in mostly poor conditions after the Russo-Japanese war and Mizoguchi himself took on a number of different occupations, a lot of them with the help of his sister, Suzu. Soon, he began involving himself in the cinematic scene firstly as an actor then later as a director. Mizoguichi continued his passion for arts (such as painting or opera) while at the same time making an astounding number of films in a short period of time (apparently most of these films are now lost, however). Mizoguichi's films at this time oftentimes incorporated criticisms of Japanese society (especially when it came to feudalism) and the role of women, or the unfair treatment of them, which is present in even his most earliest works. His cinema is also known for his long takes, which he developed out of his personal cinematic philosophy that one scene should have one shot, leading to either extremely drawn-out shots or simply a lack of any camera movement.
Surprisingly, his films at the time were not very popular in his native Japan (probably due to the fact that since they were mostly about feudalism they didn't fit in with the growing modernist approach to cinema in Japan at the time). However, after earning some recognition in the Western world, he continued making films set in historical time periods, oftentimes incorporating the role of women (again) and Japanese folk-tales. These would become his most successful films, which included unforgettable classics such as Ugetsu and Sansho the Bailiff, leaving a legacy as one of the most important filmmakers of Japanese cinema, influencing countless numbers of directors that came after him.
As for the film itself, it revolves around the tale of two brothers during a time of civil war in Japan attempting to make a name for themselves, but ultimately losing a sense of who they are. While technically it can still be called marvellous, what I'm more astounded at is Mizoguchi's directional abilities that shine throughout the film. I feel that, in a sense, the entire film is a product of a journey about 'beauty'. We first begin by seeing the two brothers, who see beauty in their simplistic lifestyle, creating potteries for the sake of creating potteries. But when Genjuro arrives at the large manor, his idea of beauty immediately changes—it is no longer a simple life with a loved family, for him, it becomes a money-ridden, lavishly luxurious lifestyle that is a desirable form of beauty. Only when that illusion is finally broken does he return to his original life and recognise the beauty within it once more.
As the film was created after World War II, militaristic sentiment in Japan was high, and Mizoguchi wanted to portray how damaging the effects of war can be to a man and to a family, because it blinds them in ambition and passion, oftentimes. For example, we see Tobei wanting to become a Samurai at any means possible, because he is unaware of the dangers that accompany it, nor is he genuinely looking to serve his country, he simply sees it as a glorious, and recognised lifestyle. Becoming so blinded in being hailed as a hero, he forgets to take care of his wife—leading to desperate and dire consequences, causing him to ask what is really important to him in life? And, my favourite parts of the film come from this representation of the shattering of illusions—the scenes when Tobei realises his wife's become a prostitute, or that Genjuro has been dreaming that his wife was alive, make for extremely devastating and disheartening scenes that further underline the pains and unforeseen agonies of war.
That's perhaps another reason why I believe Mizoguchi included the notion of 'ghosts' is because he wanted to show that they were merely illusions. Living in a large manor with a beautiful lady is nothing more than an illusion that Genjuro wants to live in, but eventually, that illusion is shattered—and he loses his normal life as a pure, pottery maker because he was so distracted in his illusions of grandeur. And here's another Mizoguchi theme—the mistreatment of women (perhaps this stems from his respect for his sister, personally), whereby men, and their constant bickering, their constant ambitions, always blind them from seeing reality. But they aren't the ones that have to suffer, it's always the women that have to mend and deal with these consequences—the film itself states that the damage done to a woman's honour is more than any damage that can be done to a man's.
Overall, the surrealistic, and at times, quite dispiriting, as well as uplifting film works as both a period drama about traditional Japanese morals, as well as Mizoguichi's personal warnings and thoughts on modern Japanese society and its faults. Through the power of cinema, he has created something timeless and beautiful, something that can be recognised through the ages as both a piece of artwork and as a biting social commentary.",5.0

"Film School Drop-Outs 2018! Week 12 - a film by Kenji Mizoguchi!
I'm rather glad this challenge has introduced me to Mizoguchi. Till now I confess I fell into the all too common camp of great familiarity with Kurosawa and at least respect for Ozu, but no knowledge of the third Japanese filmmaker to popularize the country's cinematic output in the west. This, of course, means I don't have much knowledge about the man's life or previous work to draw upon for discussing his adaptation of Ugetsu Monogatari. What I DO have is a few hours thumbing through a translated/annotated copy of the original text, and some thoughts to share on how combining and altering the two selected tales for celluloid impacts their overall meaning in a post-WWII Japan.
I do this because whenever I am unable to provide opinions satisfactorily in a manner wholly my own, I fall back on writing late high school/early university analysis-style mini-essays, as you might have guessed by the stiffer, more formal tone here.
Ueda Akinari's original 1776 collection of short stories presented tales of ghostly apparitions and supernatural encounters through a highly refined, courtly writing style. In drawing from Chinese and Japanese sources for his material, Ueda firmly grounded his material in familiar territory for his audience of newly-educated city-dwelling commoners, Chinese literature and folklore being very much in vogue at the time. To create something more than a simple collection of folklore, Ueda spent years refining his material, saturating the tales with quotes from and subtle references to East Asian classics and scholarly texts, while penning the text with a master's grasp of the Japanese language. To a Westerner without any proper exposure to Japanese literature or pre-WWII culture, the vast majority of this brilliance isn't terribly evident in the actual text*, but the translations of The Reed Choked House and The White Serpent's Lust both still demonstrate a deliberate contrast between every day superstition and a high-minded learned approach to the world. The former's tale of a man knowingly abandoning his wife to war and returning seven years later for a meeting with her ghost ends on a meditation of how truly-felt grief and regret can impact harder than all the world's greatest diatribes on the matter; while the latter truly finishes a young schollar's unintentional affair with a snake demon not with the actual banishment, but his resolution to stop running for help from a higher power and finally put the needs of others ahead of his own. These concessions to inner strength and emotional honesty indicate knowledge that, for all the respectability and intellectual-satisfaction a grandiose style brings, there still exists a need for the ugly, average day-to-day side of the world in art and life.
Mizuguchi's approach to adapting these tales takes a decidedly less kind approach to the supposedly richer arts. To be certain, cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa's camera captures the world in exquisite detail, particularly in the way it pans across multi-textured leaves and dirt in shadow, or drinks in the decadence of a ruined manor restored by ghostly power. There remains an appreciation for life's finer things, but rather than using contact with them to elevate the commoner to greater heights, lust for and achievement of status only destroys them. Genjurō and Tōbei see the needs of the wealthy and status of samurai as things they can exploit and profit from as soon as possible, to the point of completely ignoring the needs of their wives and children. They gradually surround themselves with beautiful trappings and lovely courtesans, and it all looks quite stunning in picturesque black and white, but they come by these niceties obsessively and dishonestly, and when the true cost of their desires is revealed, it breaks them.
Not so utterly as it breaks their wives, mind. Mizoguchi and screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda spend plenty of time with Miyagi and Ohama as they lose their breadwinners to greed and selfishness in the midst of civil war, tossed asunder in a word with no care for their fates. Ohama's teardown of Tōbei's delusions when they reunite stands as the film's most powerful moment, and though the revelation of Miyagi's death takes largely the same form as it does in the parallel story in The Reed-Choked House, much greater attention is paid to the exact nature of her suffering in the lead-up and what remembrance of her entails when she's gone. Mizoguchi takes two stories where wives are presented as idle-sufferers or trickster demons and imbues them with a great deal of sympathy and understanding of pain through adaptation. Even though much of the screentime is given over to Genjurō's exploits with a mysterious ghostly high-class lady and Tōbei's cowardly attempts to become a samurai, the clear, quiet focus on the wives' pain during their brief scenes of suffering makes it clear whose story really matters here.
The husbands may change and become dedicated, hard-working men by the end, but it's not through any inherent virtue of their own. They've been spooked by apparitions of love and glory vanishing before their eyes and wounded by knowledge of what they've done, but the change only comes about because they were pigheaded enough to leave the most important people in their lives behind, and came back to find them damaged or gone forever. Eternal acknowledgment of these sins and recognition of the beautiful person they destroyed with naught but greed and wild desire for life's exquisite elements is the only way to quiet the dead and begin to make up for a fraction of the magnitude of their crime.
Powerful stuff, and an interesting means of approaching the clash between common and courtly in the wake of World War II. Mizuguchi himself developed several propagandistic, pro-Japanese military might films a decade prior during the war's opening stages (particularly The 47 Ronin), and found himself wanting to use the occasion of adapting classic literature as a means of addressing the conflict from the other side. From the way they examine their protagonists' underhanded means of exploiting the fears and weaknesses wracking those who HAVE seen combat to enrich themselves, it seems clear Mizoguchi and Yoda saw the promises of glory and greatness advanced by the government for those families who fought to the last man no matter what as utterly horrifying, and crafted their film to reflect these views. An obsession with surrounding oneself with riches and beautiful art CAN elevate even the lowliest to great heights, but the meaning derived of this contact comes not from simple attainment, but the tragedies one's actions inflict on innocents. In this way, Mizoguchi transforms Ueda's text by changing the nature of his cultural clash, while retaining its all important acknowledgement of the important fundamentals by bringing them to the forefront of the conflict.
All in all, I'd say that's worthy of a place in the canon. Now why didn't anyone think to tell me about him before now?
*(I highly appreciate Anthony H Chambers' commentary for giving me some idea of what's below the surface, even if it can only go so far during a casual read.)",4.5
"I wanted to watch something special for Valentine's Day, so I picked Ugetsu based on it's description as a ""romantic fantasy film"". One of the most celebrated works from acclaimed director Kenji Mizoguchi, Ugetsu is a period drama based on classic moralistic tales that center on Genjurō, a peasant who becomes obsessed with his pottery business as a worsening war on the homefront drives up demand.
From the opening title theme, I knew I was in for something special. The score is impressive! The first half of the picture introduces our two couples: Genjuro + Miyagi, and Tobei + Ohama, who are driven from their homes in a violent raid. Miyagi is soon left behind to care for her young child, while the other 3 make the journey to a large city where Genjuro can make a bigger profit for his work. The characters splinter off when Tobei runs away, just as Genjuro meets an otherworldly woman and her older servant. Lady Wakanda invites Genjuro to her home, where he soon finds himself way over his head.
The film shares a lot of thematic elements, and some visuals, with Onibaba (1964), a personal favorite of mine. Ugetsu too has a fair share of horror elements in it's story, with plenty of misfortune and comeuppance besieging the characters. The film has excellent sets and atmosphere, blending natural beauty and chaos in feudal war-torn Japan. Mizoguchi, a master of the long take, expertly builds suspense in frequently lingering scenes. Long takes require good performances, and the cast of Ugetsu never fail. Masayuki Mori as Genjuro and Machiko Kyo as Lady Wakanda, who had previously worked together in Rashomon (1950), were especially impressive. The only thing that bothered me was how fast their relationship developed. It's as if Genjuro didn't think about his wife and kid back home at all. Other than that, this is a really top notch movie, definitely worth anyone's attention.",4.5
"I've somewhat often read of people claiming to be put into a ""trance"" by certain movies, but I never truly understood what they meant—until Ugetsu. Mizoguchi's trademark fluid long-take recessive compositions—with striking moments of landscape, aggressive depth, and expressionistic shots to boot—is becoming. The often quietly pounding score is rhythmic. Something about the film's zoomed-out, slow style allows it to have this feeling of capturing actual people, an actual village. While the parable-like quality of the film's early goings (man's greed) may be a bit simplistic, when the film's supernatural elements begin to take hold it aids the ineffable higher mood of Ugetsu. I still understood why some might get impatient with the film's almost ludicrous slow-motion and flailing performances, but this is a slow-burn Art film where I mostly not only understand but feel the raves.",0.0
Men are trash... ambition is blinding... war brings out the worst in people.... did I miss something or was this one of the most plain and boring films I've ever seen?,1.0
"2nd viewing. When I first watched this movie over a decade ago, I took it as a screed against greed; now I see it more as a tragedy of the plight of the poor, and the civilian victims of war. The two men arguably would not have acted so desperately, so delusionally, if they were part of better times, or if they weren't penniless. The promise and allure of success, wealth, status are all that much more potent, more desirable, more sacred when you're in the situation these characters are in. So this is a classic morality tale, made doubly intriguing by its touching the plane of the supernatural, with incredibly wonderful atmosphere using terrific photography and haunting sound design and score. It still earns every bit of its high reputation.",5.0
"Wondrous, haunting cinema. A fable-like folk / fairy tale warning against excessive greed and the manipulation of misguided ambition, achieved through myth and fantasy within a 16th century civil war environment.
Gorgeously shot and enticingly atmospheric, this one will stick by me for a long time i'm sure. Mizoguchi is a master storyteller.",5.0
"Yep, still great. Unmatched for quiet eeriness - the score is employed to great effect but some of the most impressive moments come when Mizoguchi decides not to use it at all, at exactly the times when a less brilliant director would probably throw really overbearing music on top (like the soldiers' raid on the village near the beginning, or when Miyagi's attacked for her food). I adore the supernatural elements but there's something even spookier about watching things go so horribly wrong in the most mundane of ways, while the camera just floats in space. Haunting.",5.0
"Cautionary tale on personal responsibility made great by carefully crafted imagery and a phenomenal score. Too much exposition gets in the way of what is, for the most part, a very subtle and intelligent film. Still, there are many unforgettable scenes and, at its core, that's what cinema is all about. It's also a wonderful metaphor for today's state of world affairs.",4.0
"I was completely floored by this at the end. I haven't heard anything about it before hand, but I wasn't expecting it to be that exciting or great but I was so wrong. The atmosphere is engaging and haunting, the camerawork is beautiful. The last like... hour kept shocking me more and more until the last scene.",5.0

"Like with a lot of great films, it took me a second viewing to fully appreciate Ugetsu. The entire thing is so dense and lush that most of it can definitely fly over the head at first. It takes a patient viewer to fully appreciate the care and attention to detail seen here. If you've seen it once and thought it was okay, but wasn't quite sure what the fuss was, I urge you: Just watch it again. This is a film that only grows and fleshes itself out.
This isn't even a very complicated film, it's through its elegance and simplicity that Ugetsu succeeds. There is no pretension or artsy smoke or mirrors, just a simple story to be told: Two men venture forth into a land torn by civil war seeking glory and riches, unaware of the consequences that lie for their wives and children. The morality themes are at first playful, but soon tragedy befalls the characters, savaging their ignorance and vanity.
There's something about Ugetsu that I have not been able to enjoy in basically any other film I've ever seen. The ingredients are so simple yet so difficult to emulate: The exaggerated characters that both embrace and deconstruct their own archetypes at the same time, the dream-like narrative that flows from moment to moment without the refines of a conventional structure, the dense fairytale-esque morality themes, the ambiguous fantasy and supernatural elements, and the lush, atmospheric cinematography, accentuated by a series of masterful long takes at pivotal moments in the story. All of these elements blend into a vivid tapestry. The end result is absorbing, almost like an illusion.
What makes Ugetsu different is that it doesn't even play for the same elements of human nature as most other films. The main characters aren't malicious or spiteful or cruel. They're simply foolish, driven by naive ambitions and a superficial perspective. And yet they still bring great suffering upon their loved ones. Great ambitions and their meaningless boons are juxtaposed with their real consequences: In one of the most striking sequences, a man embraces his mistress as they frolic in a lush field, declaring their love for each other. This segues into a scene depicting the brutal murder of his wife, whom he abandoned to pursue his ambitions. In another scene, a man boasts to a crowded tavern about becoming a great and respected samurai, only to encounter his wife, who had since been sold into slavery as a prostitute and now works at the tavern. At this exact moment, everything he believes he has achieved, and his sense of satisfaction, becomes nothing to him. The mood flips violently in an instant.
There is some solace, though. These men are senseless, but they are not evil, and although the damage has been done, they work towards redemption in the end. And that is the true beauty of Ugetsu. A million times we have probably been told to appreciate the truly important things in life, to care for the people that really care for us, and not to pursue what is fleeting and artificial. But that message always rings hollow and superficial, a catchphrase that is parroted in a million works without carrying any meaning. Ugetsu shows us exactly why that is important, and no other film has ever done it so well. This is one of the greatest films of all time.",5.0
"Phenomenal in every regard. The plot takes center stage here, and what a wonderful plot it is. I love how the Japanese like to have plots and stories that center around ghosts.
When we speak more about the plot, I'm almost speechless. It's to a point where I'm amazed by every part of it. Yet, I don't know how to say what I'm thinking other than just list out the parts I love. How we're thrown into Japan during a war. How the two husbands are obsessed by money and becoming a samurai. How they have to flee and eventually go across the river. I don't want to say anything more, it's just that there's times where you just fall in love with a plot and I did in Ugetsu.
The direction is phenomenal. It doesn't overshadow the story, but it creates this ghostly and ominous atmosphere. Tons of shots with fog in them, great use of trees obscuring parts of the camera view, use of the cloudy sky. I especially love the manor, and seeing Mizoguchi and Miyagawa play with light and silent movement.
Going more into the direction: There's this one scene in particular where the main character is bathing in a hot spring and the camera pans down to some flowing water, across sand, where it blends into the next scene of an open field covered by a endless sky. Just mind boggling how it was done.",5.0
"Mizoguchi, come on down! I feel we will get to know each other a little bit more :D
Ugetsu is my first Mizoguchi. A very powerful, moral film about 2 ambitious men and their already satisfied and suffering wives in a time of chaotic feudal civil war.
The moral of the story is powerful, as the mens priorities (especially the samurai wannabe) are out of touch. One even desires to be (and later have) a vassal, ugh! They both spiral down their own abyss before coming out at the end having learnt their lesson.
The most transcendent element of the film is the ghost story. The entire score has some beautiful, transcendent music, and that is used eerily in these sequences. It makes the 'happy' ending a bit suspicious, and ultimately a sad dream.
Ugetsu ultimately is a powerful moral tale about not taking for granted and feeling blessed about what you have. A genuine classic, I am now keen to see more of Mizoguchi's work.",4.5
"‘how high can a man rise 
without big dreams? 
ambition must be boundless 
as the ocean.’ 
es una de las mejores cosas que vi en toda mi vida. 
una película que combina muchos elementos y muestra TANTAS cosas. 
uno de los principales factores que se presentan es la ambición del hombre cuando se trata del dinero; de llegar a cierto poder y, por lo tanto, aparentar ser alguien más…. alguien distinto a lo que era, ya que el dinero cambió todo eso. de hecho, eso se lo habían advertido a Miyagi, ella se lo aclaró a Genjurô, pero aun así la ambición siempre es más fuerte. 
por otro lado, los aspectos sobrenaturales!!! ese fantasma, el cual demuestra y señala el grande nivel de deseo que tenía Genjurô de su “vida soñada”, el cual luego lo lleva a darse cuenta de su egoísmo, de esa fantasía y de ese anhelo imposible; Lady Wasaka es la demostración de la dualidad entre la vida de Genjurô, quien trabajaba horas y horas al día para poder ganar algo de dinero (junto a Tôbei, Miyagi y Ohama), y su fantasía. tiempo después, luego de haber sido percatado por el cura, decide volver a su vida real, a lo que había abandonado y dejado atrás. allí de da cuenta de la realidad a la que se enfrentaba, ya que con las visiones de Lady Wasaka había sido totalmente opacada, y esto mismo demuestra cómo Genjurô tenía que afrontar la vida, por más que se encuentre con millones de obstáculos; también dejar la ambición de lado y enfocarse en lo que realmente importa. este lado fantástico se puede ver muy sutilmente y a veces se logra diferenciar la realidad entre ese aspecto sobrenatural (lo cual es fascinante).
algo similar sucede con Tôbei, quien soñaba con ser un samurai, debido a que estaba harto de su pobreza. Ohama siempre quería recordarle lo imposible que eso sería, pero él nunca escuchó. por eso mismo, cuando en un momento por fin lo consigue, se encuentra a Ohama y se percata del daño que le hizo a Ohama y de lo poco que significaba ser samurai sin estar a su lado. 
al mismo tiempo, se puede observar el gran contraste entre las ambiciones de los dos hombres protagonistas con sus respectivas parejas, Miyagi y Ohama, quien la primera mencionada fue asesinada por piratas en busca de comida, dejando abandonado a su hijo y, por otro lado, tenemos a Ohama quien fue violada por samurais ya que Tôbei la había dejado completamente sola en busca de su “sueño”. tiempo después, Ohama tuvo que prostituirse debido a que esa era la única forma de conseguir dinero. 
habiendo mencionado sus situaciones, en esta película se ve reflejado el poco trato que se le tenía (o más bien tiene lamentablemente) a las mujeres, quienes estaban al lado de Genjurô y Tôbei todo el tiempo, pero fueron apartadas por ellos dado que el dinero les ganó. 
finalmente, ambos hombres fueron liberados de su codicia y se dieron cuenta que su familia era lo más importante y lo que debían cuidar, por más que les haya costado un gran sacrificio y haya tenido grandes consecuencias. 
quiero agregar el hecho de que tiene demasiadas fusiones de géneros, cómo se puede ver la época de la guerra en Japón, los paisajes y lugares mostrados de una forma bellísima; las costumbres japonesas, que se pueden observar tan atenta y detalladamente. 
la escena del bote!!!! todo ese humo!!
el uso de sombras y las dissolve shot DIOS!!! 
la música y los sonidos… espeluznante por momentos. la escena final de Genichi…. LÁGRIMAS. 
esta película es simplemente perfecta y resalto todo de ella. Mizoguchi hizo un trabajo espectacular…. goat",5.0

"Mizoguchin taide on kaikkein monisyisintä, koska se on kaikkein yksinkertaisinta.
– Jean-Luc Godard
Japanilaisista kummituselokuvista klassisimmassa savenvalaja Genjūrō (Masayuki Mori) ja hänen samurain urasta haaveileva lankonsa Tōbei (Eitaro Ozawa) lähtevät ajamaan takaa unelmiaan vaimojensa toiveista piittaamatta ja heidät ja perheensä oman onnensa nojaan jättäen. Seuraukset ovat traagiset (joskin tuotantoyhtiön painostamana Mizoguchi joutui taipumaan optimistisempaan loppuratkaisuun kuin olisi halunnut, kuulemma). Tarinan historiallisena viitekehyksenä on Azuchi–Momoyama-kauden (1568–1600) raaka sisällissota ja käsikirjoituksen perustana kaksi Edo-kaudelta (1603–1867) periytyvää yliluonnollista kertomusta, jotka julkaistiin ensimmäisen kerran Ueda Akinarin kirjassa vuonna 1776.
Tästä historiallisesta ja yliluonnollisesta kehyksestä huolimatta Ugetsu – kalpean kuun tarinoita kertoo tietysti omasta ajastaan ja heijastelee Mizoguchin ja monen muun japanilaisen tuntoja hävityn ja hirvittävää tuhoa aiheuttaneen maailmansodan jälkeisessä yhteiskunnallisessa myllerryksessä. Ohjaaja oli sodan aikana itsekin tehnyt patrioottista uhoa pönkittäneitä propagandaelokuvia ja poti siitä kaiketi jonkinlaista syyllisyyttä. Naisten kärsimys, tavallisesti miesten itsekkäästä toiminnasta johtuva, on yksi hänen koko tuotantoaan läpileikkaava teema, ja tässä siihen siis yhdistyy myös pasifismi.
Jotkut ovat nähneet Genjūrōn, tuon aristokraattisen aavenaisen viettelemäksi joutuvan käsityöläistaiteilijan, tarinassa myös omaelämäkerrallisia piirteitä. Tämän enempää elokuvan mahdollisiin piilomerkityksiin nyt syventymättä totean lyhyesti, että Ugetsu on minusta ennen kaikkea sanoinkuvaamattoman kaunis faabeli, realismin ja fantasian välillä luontevan itsevarmasti liikkuva lyyrinen mestariteos, joka ei lakkaa kiehtomasta mieltä. Näin sen ensimmäisen kerran jo pikkupoikana huonolaatuisesta televisiosta ja vaikka en silloin vielä mitään ymmärtänytkään niin silti elokuvan eteerinen tunnelma ja tietyt yksittäiset kuvat, kuten usvaisella järvellä hiljalleen lipuva vene, piirtyivät lähtemättömästi mieleen. Vuosikymmenten saatossa, uusien katselukertojen myötä, teos on vähitellen noussut omien lempileffojeni joukkoon eikä sen asema näytä horjuvan, pikemminkin päinvastoin. Nyt, heti aihepiiriltään samantapaisen mutta aivan toisentyylisen Kwaidanin perään katsottuna, elokuva tuntui yllättäen myös paljon sähäkämmältä ja viihdyttävämmältä kuin millaisena olen sen muistanut.
Läheskään täydellinen elokuva Ugetsu ei ole, mutta rakastan sitä silti.",5.0

"Não sei se inaugura, mas demarca um modelo de drama/fantasia/terror que mistura com muita eficiência um realismo, denunciando o horror da guerra civil, a situação de abandono e falta de perspectivas das comunidades naquele Japão feudal; com o folclore, as tradições místicas e religiosas, mais precisamente na figura dos yureis (fantasmas).
Traz também uma abordagem pungente sobre a posição da mulher naquele país.
Desdenhada e escanteada pelos planos pessoais e pela ambição do homem. A sede por dinheiro, status ou glória.
Miyagi e Ohama, além da entrega e companheirismo são a tentativa de racionalidade no seio familiar (teoricamente tão valorizado na tradição japonesa) que tentam de todas as formas despertar os maridos de suas fantasias.
Mas acabaram enfrentando o desprezo, o abandono, a fome, a violência e a indiferença enquanto Tobei e Genjuro desfrutam suas glórias fictícias.
O espaço, retratado nas paisagens, nas relações sociais e nas tradições ganha enorme força através dos planos longos e imersivos, assumindo uma função determinante no cotidiano daqueles personagens.
É um filme trágico e pessimista, mas extremamente poético e belo.

Vou bater no martelo e mencionar o quanto sou fascinada pela atmosfera sombria, sobrenatural e onírica do filme.

Quando vi que Ugetsu ia passar em 16mm em um das salas da fundação, soube que teria que ver. A experiência foi incrível e gostei do filme mais do que imaginava.
Ugetsu nos mostra a vida de dois casais que, apesar dos desejos diferentes, se ajudam em busca de dinheiro e melhores condições de vida. Fugindo dos soldados, eles vão de barco até outra cidade, deixando a esposa de Genjuro e seu filho na vila onde moram. Essa viagem de barco rende uma cena linda, que marcou o momento em que comecei a prestar mais atenção no som que o filme apresenta, o som característico do filme em si sendo projetado, assim como a ambientação, as canções.
Enquanto o desejo de se tornar samurai cega Tobei e o leva a abandonar a esposa, que acaba sendo abusada pelos soldados numa cena dolorosa, Genjuro parte até a mansão onde conhece Wakasa e ela deseja que eles se casem. Pouco depois, a cena de Wakasa cantando me chama atenção, uma voz grave começa a cantar junto com ela e quando ela para, diz que é seu pai, já falecido. É minha cena favorita, o filme se mistura com um terror, avisa o momento que as coisas começam a se agravar e é visualmente linda, a voz de Wakasa e de seu pai também são. Logo, Genjuro descobre a verdade sobre Wakasa e ao voltar pra sua vila, vê a vida que conhecia em pedaços.
Ugetsu é encantador, assustador e finaliza de forma trágica. Todo seu charme ainda é elevado (na minha opinião) quando somado às marcas do tempo no rolo do filme, em momentos como o de Wakasa cantando, a cena treme, o som falha levemente, a imagem escurece, adicionando ainda mais terror e drama a cena. Quase os mesmos efeitos se repetem na cena final, antes do preto com letras brancas que diz ""fim"", como se Wakasa ainda te acompanhasse ao final da exibição.",4.5

"“Success always comes with a price in suffering.”
Ugetsu is more impressive for its directorial prowess than the actual script. It's a glorious testament to director Kenji Mizoguchi's mastery of cinema language and his ability to extract the maximum entertainment values out of a story, even when the narrative is far from impressive itself. Based on traditional Japanese folklores, Ugetsu is a resounding cautionary tale on the danger of human greed, against the cruel backdrop of a society amid civil war. It showcases how men lose themselves in war, and how women suffer the consequences. Chronicling two couples' surreal experiences of survival and fortune-hunting during social unrest, this film is simply masterful in its stylish, patient presentation of intertwined character studies, even though almost all ""twists"" are visible from miles away, but it doesn't take away anything from the viewing experience, thanks to both Mizoguchi's commanding of the score, camera, and light, as well as outstanding performances from the foursome ensemble.
There is absolute bonkers photography while our ensemble of characters cross on the lake when fleeing their house. Im not sure how they managed to create such thick fog or the lighting on the water, But wow does Mizoguchi command a visual style. I loved his restrained, free-flowing compositions. This film has the atmosphere and tone of a fable, a story you'd tell around a fireplace to warn others about the dangers of greed and lust, and looking at it through that lens makes me appreciate it so much more. I wish I had a stronger emotional reaction to the ending, and I still think there are some pacing issues throughout, but this film is still great. It’s a timeless tale — one told with masterful flourishes of style and skill.",3.5

"There are good moments within ‘Ugetsu,’ even some great ones. But, to say that they were not spaced between drawn-out and unsatisfying-ly boring, almost filler scenes, would be a lie. At least to me. There remains the same mysticism as ‘Sansho’ but it does not hit as strong and is in far diminished frequency. I can sit through slower films, I can love slower films, but I found here that even in 90 minutes the begrudging pace could not keep me consistently pleased. With that being said, there are moments here that are worthy of the film’s praise, and I believe that overall there is a very apparent genius in the directorial abilities showcased here, but the lack of substantial nuance in the script leaves me with the rating I have here.

"Ugetsu is a somewhat opaque film. It does not give itself over easily to the viewer. However, it lingers on the mind. It sticks in its many ways, in its seemingly disparate stories. Let's break down why this movie is so interesting.
-----> Kenji Mizoguchi as a person and director
I'm no expert on Japanese directors and Mizoguchi is no exception to that. However, in every notation I see about the movies he made, there is an awareness of how his sister Suzu had to give up so much for their family and for him. Suzu, due to their family's poverty, was adopted out to become a sex worker. However, that did not cut their family ties. When Kenji was in need of a home after their mother died, Suzu took her siblings in. When Kenji needed a job, Suzu helped him secure one – more than once, at that. Within that, you can see the very format and struggle of his inspiration arise.
The majority of his most well-known movies engage with women as geisha, as concubines, as sex workers at large. The major missteps within that are his works during World War II – most notably The 47 Ronin. I saw disagreement as to whether he was forced into propaganda or if he was “an opportunist.” As someone who hasn't studied the man, I can't say for sure. However, I do believe that there is a real sense of grief and loathing for war in Ugetsu that cannot be denied. I find that there are absolutely creators who may have felt they had no future in film if they did not concede to the strict censors set during WW2.
However, perhaps that isn't particularly kind of me to say, considering the amount of leftist creators tortured and killed in this period. Should creators be wedded to that? Should they bend the knee to fascism? Should they protect themselves to survive another day? Those are interesting questions. However, I am of the opinion that Ugetsu is a movie that intends to reverse the course of propaganda. A movie that wants to be better than he was in the past and a movie to offer some kind of apology therein. It's unfortunate to know that Mizoguchi was pressured into giving the movie a happier ending when he intended for it to be more harsh or tragic.

-----> Dual Narratives and Mirrored Stories
Genjuro, the potter, and Tobei, the wanna-be soldier, are presented as the primary protagonists/actors within Ugetsu. Their wives – Miyagi and Ohama, respectively – are both deeply aware of the coming tide of violence. They are aware that at any possible moment, things could fall apart, and that they need to be prepared for the worst. Genjuro's pottery career is finally taking off and he refuses to simply give up on it when a seeming life of comfort is right around the corner. Even the fact that he is taking advantage of difficult times which have stopped other people from performing their craft means nothing to him. The potential for gain and wealth is more important to him than considering the danger he may be putting himself and his family in.
Tobei views the war happening as another chance for him to worm his way into an army so he can become a powerful samurai leader. He puts everything he profits into becoming a samurai by any possible means. Ohama loses track of her husband. In her tired desperation trying to track him down after he worms his way into a samurai clan, she encounters soldiers who sexually assault her and throw money upon her after the fact. It lingers on her and the cloth over her mouth, speaking to the silence foisted upon her as she did everything she could to support a man who refused to put her safety first. Women in Ohama's situation are inherently at a disadvantage both in the Sengoku era and the Showa era (when this film was made). This can be further discussed in another topic, but it's vital to the dual narrative.
Ohama and Miyagi are both effectively abandoned by their husbands – seen as victims to attack, seen as marks, and seen as people who are incomplete without their husbands. Women without husbands are specters – ghosts in their own right.
Genjuro's journey leads him to the promise of a beautiful woman who will praise and give him everything he wants – to be seen as a true master of pottery, to give him all the space he needs and wants to practice his craft, to feel safe in times of tumult. It's funny that he finds such comfort within that when he ignored and hated his wife insisting that they were unsafe, that they needed to flee. All he wants is to be told that things aren't that bad. And that his choices aren't wrong.
Much as Tobei does. He happens upon a general and simply steals his head from someone else, sneaking up and killing them. No one really believes him to be anything or anyone special. But because he gave the leader an image of power, Tobei is granted that false power as well. He is told that is is special, that he will be kept safe by his vassals, and seen as a great man – a true master. Ohama was absurd to bother him about his goals.
Genjuro and Tobei come to the same point. Their dreams were foolish. They hurt everyone that cared about them. And then they continue to hurt them more.
Genjuro says to Lady Wakasa, “The value of people and things truly depends upon their setting.” That describes his entire worldview in a single sentence. Ohama says to Tobei, “Buy this fallen woman with the wealth you earned from your exploits. My fate meant nothing as long as you became a samurai.” The value of people truly depends on their setting.

-----> Disreputable/Cowardly Samurai and the Japanese Empire during WW2
The book, “Bushido: The Soul of Japan” is one that has broadly influenced foreign understanding of samurai. However, it was not imported to the west. It was written in English from the start. It was translated into Japanese a decade later, due to its immense popularity in America. This was 1908 and would be a particularly negative influence for how its descriptions of samurai led to further nationalist propaganda. Funnily enough, you can even see that in how Mizoguchi's film The 47 Ronin utilized a fictionalized idea of samurai honor as literal fascist propaganda. The attack on Pearl Harbor happened A WEEK after the movie premiered.
Bushido: The Soul of Japan is deeply flawed as any kind of analytical or historical explanation of samurai. It was something meant to appeal to American and Western cultures. Samurai shown as an idea they could project their own concepts of war and masculinity onto.
Tobei comes across as a very direct criticism of the popularity of that book and how samurai became a symbol of fascism during the reign of Imperial Japan. He is a pathetic man who only manages to succeed when sneaking up and killing a man who killed the person /he/ wanted the valor for killing. The leader of the army he wanted to appeal to only deigns to give Tobei what he wants because the situation benefits him. The samurai who lose do nothing more than attack women and destroy homes. The soldiers who did win steal all of Genjuro's money. There's no honor. There's no decency. There is only greed, power, and selfishness. The same traits that Genjuro shares.

-----> Women as Ghosts – Woman as sex workers – The conveniences of men
The final speech that Miyagi gives – the speech that is seemingly within Genjuro's mind – mirrors Lady Wakasa. Miyagi speaks of how much she loved his pottery. She speaks of how much she loved helping him with his work. Speaks of how she's always with him. Their love is … sealed for a thousand years within a (cup) grave.
Though in the beginning of the film, Genjuro kept thoughtlessly telling Miyagi that she couldn't stop helping him yet, even when their son was hungry and asking for food, even when Miyagi was exhausted of the physical labor. And yet at the end he … simply does it for himself. All of it. As if she was never really there. Though her grave is, only their son Genichi seems to acknowledge the memory of Miyagi.
Genjuro spent so much time hidden away in a tranquil safety with Lady Wakasa. It speaks to the same horror of what Miyagi had to give up to make Genjuro feel safe, to make him feel powerful, to make him feel like he could be successful. All he truly gives her in return is a beautiful and expensive kimono. When we see Lady Wakasa, she too has an incredibly beautiful kimono. She lost everything in the war. And she cannot live without a man within her life. Indeed, she is already dead and the closest she can come to being more than a spirit is when a man acknowledges her as existing.
Yet the only way Lady Wakasa can keep him there is by lying to him. Is this a sin on her part? Is this a seduction on her part? Or is it another demand that her nursemaid is foisting upon her? It is her nursemaid who argues and demands that Genjuro admit to his wrongdoings and stay as her husband. All Lady Wakasa can do is look on in pained silence – the expression which was once so tranquil now contorted by a deep sadness. Her face is so much like a Noh mask. Yet even when she is sad, it Is nothing more than a mask, because Genjuro does not see the women in his life as people unless it conveniences him. A woman can be ignored when he thinks he's right. A woman can be ignored when it comes to concerns of war and business. And a woman can be ignored when it comes to leaving because he himself never admitted that he had a wife and child from the beginning.
A woman can be a sex worker and not matter until you realize she is your wife, working in the place you decided to stop at for the fun of your vassals rather than actually trying to look for her. Just as Lady Wakasa is a ghost, just as Miyagi dies and becomes a literal phantom – Ohama is nothing more than a specter of a thought in Tobei's mind. I would say that Ohama is the most metaphorical expression of this issue. Rather than recognizing his own wrongs, Tobei simply takes her home as though that would simply fix what he has done. Genjuro realizes to some degree how he has wronged Miyagi in the end, yet he only realizes this due to his own learned fear of Lady Wakasa, leading him to wrong her as well.
How different are the three? Miyagi being stabbed and dying over men desperate for food, Ohama being forced into sex work due to her husband abandoning her in a city, and Lady Wakasa having to seek out a man to acknowledge her because she was killed due to sharing a name and blood with her father.
Another major point is the idea of comfort women. During WW2, it's become more and more well-known that Japanese soldiers and the Japanese Empire would trick, coerce, and even outright kidnap women and girls to force them into sex work. For the “comfort” of their soldiers and to “reduce” rape. This was something done in Japanese territories primarily because exporting Japanese sex workers could have made them look “bad”. It's funny in a horrific way.
This is not the same thing. But it is a very important point. Ohama's story is most directly related to how women are used and abused by solders, pushed into sex work, and then mocked and punished for doing this work – a work that many of them never wanted. However, Lady Wakasa is much the same way. She exists only when she comforts Genjuro. When she has sex with him. When she gives him a place where he doesn't have to worry about money, war, or nagging wives. The moment she becomes an inconvenience – the moment that Lady Wakasa becomes a seeming threat – he is scared of her. He threatens her. He terrifies her. Because it's convenient for him. Because a woman who is meant to comfort him is no longer doing her job.
Buddha comes up at many points in the movie. People praying to Buddha. Doing crimes before Buddha. But – Lady Wakasa and her nursemaid are the only two who are openly negatively affected by Buddha. Begging that he wash away the sanskrit, because he is hurting them. Because Buddha's eyes are blind to the struggles of women, deemed ever and endlessly unimportant by all power structures.
My take on the ending is … again. It's all about Genjuro's convenience. Miyagi's death changes nothing. They keep moving on, with Ohama now having to do more work to maintain two households. Women go unappreciated. All their complaints and sacrifices ignored. Invisible. As nothing more than pleasant memories. As nothing more than ghosts.",4.5
"Ugetsu is a fascinating tale of the perils of ambition with wonderful directing, especially how Kenji Mizoguchi beautifully conveys the etherealness of Lady Wakasa's manor. If I had one major complaint, the movie gets too moralistic in the end, but still has some great moments (like the appearance of Genjuro's wife by the fire).",4.0
"Eerie, haunting, and a lot sadder than I expected it to be. Mizoguchi manages to build an atmosphere of impending doom simply through the production design, depicting almost liminal seeming spaces of foggy, unexplainable uncertainty, as well as through the film’s otherworldly, dissonant score. 
In the end, though, the horror in Ugetsu stems mostly from the feelings of guilt, brought up by the selfish actions of the two lead characters, who’s irreversible consequences will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Ugetsu is a film about greed, jealousy, infidelity and, rather progressively in that matter, misogyny. It handles, balances and combines those topics incredibly well, and in merely 100 minutes gives us such a multi-faceted look at these characters, their emotions, and their relationships. Its theatrically climactic rise will have you more and more invested as the film progresses, before leaving you in a pit of utter despair as the final shot fades to black.",4.5
"""I watch seventy of the Sight and Sound top 100 (4/70)""
It feels crazy to me that I've only watched four films in this series, and yet it feels like I've journeyed all around the world! I started in Senegal, moved on to Thailand, watched a French man escape from prison, and now I've found myself in Japan! I've got to give it to the Sight and Sound critics: their list carries perspectives from all across the globe.
So how was my little ""stop"" to Japan? It turned out to be pretty cool! ""Ugetsu"" seems to be praised as one of the greatest of all films because of its feminist lens. The ones who give into greed and cannot see life for what it is are male, whereas the females have to suffer for their mistakes. If ""Ugetsu"" had very little depth I might have found myself bothered by this feminist approach (I was even bothered by this director's other film ""The Life of Oharu""). However, ""Ugetsu"" functions more as a Shakespearean tragedy that humanizes the male main character and grieves about his mistakes with him. It results in a classic tale that I feel is deserving of a lot of respect.
Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING is a fantasy in ""Ugetsu"". The main protagonist, Genjuro, is almost never capable of seeing reality. This is sometimes physically true, but it is almost always spiritually true for him. Genjuro fantasizes about his wife's happiness while missing her gratitude right in front of him. He also fantasizes about money because of the war, as do many of the male soldiers. Even the land itself in ""Ugetsu"" seems like a fantasy. The river is clouded with a mist that conceals everything. The land is constantly ravaged by violence, and there seems to be no clear authority around. It makes for an expressive tragedy that is ""Macbethian"" in its darkness. Genjuro is more of an accidental tragic hero than Macbeth, but the world is just as dark of a place in both.
The darkness and fantasy shown is expressive, but I did find myself wanting more when it came to Genjuro's motive to buy into the fantasy. It rings true that people are greedy just because they want to be, but I really wanted to know more about what Genjuro thinks his greed will achieve. Mizoguchi does a good job of showing Genjuro's desire to get a nice new kimono for his wife, but this does not strike me as an extreme enough desire to connect to the travesty of greed that makes up ""Ugetsu"" and its setting. I feel it does significant damage to the experience of the story, as a tragic hero must have a relatable reason to make the choices he/she does. If not, the hero seems irrational and the story is no longer tragic but judgmental. A hero without depth can reduce a story either to pity or harsh criticism of a person with unrealistic desires or actions. ""Ugetsu"" has enough sensitivity toward its hero and the war surrounding him to avoid sinking this low, but it could have been a more powerful tragedy than it is.
That being said, it is great to see a tale told in such a classical style continue to get so much critical acclaim that it deserves. These traditional types of stories have proven to be profound and effective time and time again, and it's great to see them continue to rock the charts. I wish I was more deeply moved by ""Ugetsu"", but I found it interesting and still relevant to the state of movies today because of its traditional approach. I'll give ""Ugetsu"" the final rating of ""maybe"" just because my personal enthusiasm does not match with my more objective analysis of this film's greatness.",0.0

"Mi primera película de Mizoguchi y bingo. Una película que te va ganando poco a poco, a medida que las consecuencias de los actos de los protagonistas se van manifestando.
Un drama de época, con toques de cine de samurais y fantástico, sobre cómo el exceso de ambición puede hacer perderlo todo, con el trasfondo de la tragedia que suponen las guerras para la población civil.
Tarda un poco en arrancar y, durante buena parte del metraje, la trama se dispersa un poco con los personajes. Pero todo el último tercio es fabuloso, con momentos realmente conmovedores, como la despedida de cierto personaje, copiada en películas y series bastante recientes.
Gran trabajo de fotografía, jugando con la luz y los contrastes de iluminación, además de algunas estupendas elecciones de perspectiva a la hora de rodar algunos planos.

There’s always mystery, there’s always more to know, and you always wanna know what’s gonna happen next. This isn’t the kinda movie you that politely tells you how good it is.

"É simplesmente um dos maiores filmes japoneses de todos os tempos – não, melhor, é um dos maiores filmes de todos os tempos, ponto. Mizoguchi parte de um famoso livro de contos de Akinari Ueda, e conjuga algumas histórias marcadas pelo fantástico e fantasmagoria. A principal, que serve como moldura, é de um camponês que também produz cerâmicas e vende na cidade, e, mesmo casado, acaba se envolvendo com uma jovem de um clã muito rico. O desenrolar é surpreendente, e, ao mesmo tempo, poético e violento. Aliás, gosto muito como a violência é retratada no filme. Zero fator de choque, é algo quase normal, só mais um elemento na vida das personagens – até uma decapitação não tem o menor senso de espetacularização. Nos comentários do DVD (Box O Cinema de Kenji Mizoguchi Volume 1 da Versátil), numa análise do filme é dito que o diretor não gostava muito do longa, e achava um dos seus menores.

Safe to say this changed me. Haunting in every sense of the word, from every unexpected turn in its narrative accompanied by the most eerie score. People will throw away everything good in their lives to chase after their most insane ambitions. Even once they achieve those goals, it’s only a matter of time before they realize what fools they’ve become and what they’ve taken for granted. 
I was expecting a simple drama and became soaked in a depressing tale of war, betrayal, and everything else unfair about life and common human decency. Like how a fish is so easily attracted to a shiny lure, we have to resist that urge or else we’ll be yanked away from what truly matters.

"É tudo muito caprichado, a atmosfera de guerra e que evoca o sentimento de abandono (tanto daqueles locais destruídos, como dos que abandonaram a vida, e também, como das personagens que deixam para trás seus próprios valores naquele caos), traz ao filme um visual muito forte.

"Guchi mane stays winning. Like the two films of his I’ve seen before plainly some of the most beautiful images you’ll ever see. I love how his and Miyagawa’s camera tracks people, as if in simple awe of their very movement. My favorite shot is of Miyagi between two pieces of pottery, a woman with a deep appreciation for her husband’s labor to be discarded just as easily once it bears fruit. Mizoguchi paints a tale of two men trying to actualize without realizing they already had. Ambition as loves antithesis. The greed and glory seeking only leading to a quiet destruction. The unfortunate echo of a ghostly siren who’s past wail has faded to present whisper. Like murmurs moving mountains.",5.0

"Wasn't expecting to spend a big chunk of last night thinking about ghost bigamy but that just goes to show you that Forrest Gump was right about the whole ""life is a box of chocolates that's full of surprises"" thing.
Lets consider two scenarios.
In the first scenario a man remarries after his first wife dies but then the ghost of his first wife appears in his house. Now in this scenario I don't think the man is a bigamist even though he has two wives in his house because I don't think that the ghost wife counts as an actual ""wife"".
In the second scenario a man is married to a human wife and then gets tricked into marrying a ghost wife. Now in this scenario I *do* think that the man is a bigamist - but does that really make sense? After all, he has the same number of human and ghost wives as the non-bigamist from the first scenario.
Is there a contradiction there? Do ghost wives count as actual wives or not?
Here's my best answer to that philosophical quandary: I think it matters whether you marry the human wife or the ghost wife first. Because if you marry a human by saying a vow that ends in ""till death do you part"" and then she dies then the contract is broken - so you are then free to marry someone else. That's a bummer for her ghostly spirit but thems the breaks.
However, if you are married to a woman and she's alive then the marriage contract is still in full effect - and that contract prohibits any sort of second marriage so if you go through a second wedding ceremony then you're a bigamist even if your second wife is just a spirit.
So yeah: this guy is not just a war profiteer he's also a bigamist. Even worse: a GHOST bigamist (which is basically the spookiest type of bigamist)",3.0

"A pretty mesmerising and surreal film. I thought this was an excellent movie. 
I like the hazy and dream like quality that’s present throughout this film. Whether that be in its story or it’s truly gorgeous visuals. This is definitely one of the best looking films I’ve seen in a while. There’s a surreal quality to one of the plots in here that isn’t just appropriate but is also an excellent method of foreshadowing. 
I also think the other plot deserves some attention for it’s more human stakes. It does a good job at showing that some men can be pretty careless and stupid when presented with something they want, regardless of the consequences. 
As previously stated, the film is absolutely stunning throughout. One of the best scenes being when five characters are on a boat. That’s probably one of the best looking sequences in the film. 
Overall, I really liked this. While it probably isn’t my favourite Japanese film of this era (I could probably name at least 4-5 I like more), this is still an excellent piece of work. Highly recommended.",4.5
"Ugetsu is one of those movies that after a wild ride, it drops you off right where you started, but with a whole new feeling and knowledge. It's an interesting genre that heavily relies on its tonal shifts which is what makes this one so great. The main reason it has such accessibility to achieve this comes down to the four original characters. With the intention of each one eventually branching out (and then coming back together), you are able to cook up so many different emotions for each of them - going back and forth until everything going all over the place feels natural, and then immediately halting such action makes you realize that nothing is any longer the same.
Where my personal roadblock lies is in the problems that the characters run into. For whatever reason, they feel so distant and excited for me to perhaps feel the impact of each of them. Maybe slowing it down and stretching the film out more would be my solution (it's only 96 minutes after all) because I know that Mizoguchi had the talent to make you feel great emotions, only I didn't feel any of that here.
I also wish that Tobei and Ohama's story had a better ending. The simple and short realization of where each other have gone with their lives in such a short period of time felt very unrealistic. Tobei's success felt like it happened instantly, so to see how drastically Ohama's life had changed in the equally short period of time felt very offside.
It is certainly interesting and very beautiful too, and while I was entertained, I felt like it could have accomplished what it did in a slower, less rushed way.",3.0
"My first Mizoguchi!
Knowing my luck I’ll just dumbly say the obvious thing about him, but what I most liked was the tension between the foreground & background. My eyes would be drawn to an object in the back then BAM new image pops up in the fore-.
And it wasn’t just by having a character suddenly appear in the fore- of a stationary shot, he did it through camera movement too, camera panning across, our eyes drawn to something in the distance, then BAM the camera passes in front of a tree or a house.
Of course, the fact that what most interested me in this film was something as technical as that was in fact because I didn’t find anything the story engaging in the slightest. Sorry!",3.0

"Ugetsu informs audiences how greed and ambition can be dangerous to an individual and also the people surrounding them. As simple as it sounds, it is actually deep. The movie breathtakingly delivers great values of life, with stunning black and white visuals, enthralling performances of the cast, and gripping score. Ugetsu is also haunting, as it brings a ghost story in a plot.
Audiences would blame the two main protagonists men as being so vain throughout the movie. Thus, I would like to point out the place and time settings of this movie. The men characters’ struggles are the result from the feudalism and militarism. Hence, both men are actually the victims of war. 
I would like to also highlight the feminist theme in Ugetsu. It explores how patriarchy can lead to negative impacts. Arrogance and vanity of men can be so dangerous. Eventually, both men realize that wealth and power they have achieved are nothing without their families. 
To conclude, Ugetsu is a fine, moving, and phenomenal social critique.",5.0

"Poised on the threshold of a new kind of cinema, but doesn’t quite cross over. Still diverges at enough points from the formal conventions of Edo period dramas (jidaigeki) that I can see why Criterion selected this feature for the collection. I’m more in love with the Kabuki score than the visuals — no clue if it’s a traditional arrangement or not, but it’s piercingly eerie and offsets the corny moments onscreen.",0.0
"Ugetsu erzählt eine klassische Märchengeschichte über Gier, Egoismus und die verheerende Auswirkung des Krieges. Während - wie bei Kenji Mizoguchi üblich - das tragische Schicksal der Frauen zu Zeit des japanischen Bürgerkriegs besonders im Fokus steht, versuchen die Männer Profit aus den Unruhen zu schlagen, oder ihre eigene Heldenerzählung zu verwirklichen. 
Verwoben wird dieses realistische Drama mit einer mysteriösen Geistergeschichte und so fließen Realität und Fantasie im Verlauf des Films ineinander über, denn das Trauma des Krieges lässt selbst die Toten nicht los. 
Neben der mitreisenden Geschichte, sticht vor allem die Inszenierung hervor. Die langen dynamischen Einstellungen, die Kameraperspektiven, das Spiel mit Licht und Schatten und die sphärische Filmmusik, die viele traditionelle japanische Sounds aufgreift.
Die Szene des Films: Nach dem sehr realistischen Beginn, deuten sich die fantastischen Elemente das erste mal bei der Überquerung eines Sees an. Dicke Nebelschwaden hängen des Nachts über dem Gewässer. Die Bootsfrau stimmt ein trauriges Lied an, während in der Ferne das Trommeln des Krieges zu hören ist. Plötzlich taucht aus dem Nebel ein unbemanntes Boot - ein Geisterboot - auf.

"My two favorite things about this fantastic supernatural war-time melodrama: the haunting score and the amazing final 20 minutes. As the shoes fall, as UGETSU spirals down into its grim fuck you of an ending, everything that came before is elevated. Yeah, the ""wannabe samurai"" sub-plot isn't nearly as compelling as the ghost story, but it does round out the film a bit in regards to paying off its themes and allegorical swings.
Further, the direction — and lighting, cinematography, etc. — only gets better as the movie goes on and the cast is generally doing the damn thing at a high level. It's technically sound, emotionally satisfying, and consistently surprising.",4.5

"Ugetsu is one of the supreme achievement of Japanese cinema. It will surely have a deep impact on the viewer.
The film deals with man's vanity, over-ambitious attitude. In spite of possessing the basic necessities, man tries to literally touch the moon, run for un-realistic pursuits, often leading to his downfall. In the process, his family and all those close to him suffer, some even meet death. And after everything is lost, man realizes his error. These were perfectly portrayed by Mizoguchi with the story of two neighbors.
The atmosphere, set design, music deserves special praise. And the story of a man falling in love with a ghost reminded me of Tarkovsky's Solaris.",5.0

"This movies convey such a nuanced look at the consequences of greed and by putting materialistic pursuits above all else. Any criticism I may have about the themes being too obvious are cancelled out in this case when the themes are so impressively woven and integrated together into basically every line of dialogue. With the addition of fascinating characters, each with their distinct morals and individual desires, you get a really engaging film. The visuals tell it all, brilliant transitions that can also make a statement on the fantastical elements in the story.

The camera work is stripped down and bare. Yet it’s all so beautiful and majestic, how it lingers in the bleak atmosphere and takes a steady pace in unraveling the drama. You look at these painstakingly staged scenes of bustling marketplaces and cursed manors, and thankfully, Mizoguchi gives you enough time to soak it all in and immerse yourself in this challenging world.

"Uma fabula sobre os perigos de se perder e se deixar consumir pela ganancia usando como cenário uma terra devastada física e moralmente pela guerra. Imagens de saques violentos e de desolação coexistem com a mansão quase etérea onde mora a fantasma e que seduz o protagonista justamente pela sua paz que parece tão distante dos horrores que ele viu, mas nem mesmo ela estava imune dos efeitos do conflito. Foi uma grata surpresa pra mim ver que a personagem fantasmagórica que seduz o protagonista não é retratada como uma vilã, mas apenas mais uma vitima dos conflitos e que foi impedida de ter varias experiências em vida. Existem apenas vitimas de uma guerra que vai pouco a pouco engolindo a vida e a dignidade dos protagonistas.

"In preparation for Sight & Sound's eight decennial international critics poll of the greatest films of all time, set to come out next year, I decided to catch up with all the films that made their previous eight top ten lists. Up next is Ugestsu, with tied for fourth place on the 1962 list, and tied for tenth place on the 1972 list.
This is a 1953 romantic fantasy set in wartime in medieval Japan., directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. It involves two couples whose lives are upended when their village is beset by warring factions. I don't want to say too much about the plot. The movie is often categorized as a ghost story. It's worthwhile to go into the film without knowing much about how that manifests itself in the plot.
The couple we spend most of our time with is Genjuro and Miyagi. Miyagi is devoted to her husband and their young son. Though a peasant, Genjuro is a skilled potter and longs to acquire material success at market with his wares. Miyagi encourages him to be more attentive to his family's security than to his trade. There's a subplot involving Genjuro's friend Tobei. Tobei idolizes the samurai, and his wife laments the extent of his preoccupation.
The movie is largely about the suffering of women from the poor choices of the men in their lives. It's a simple moral parable, but also heartbreaking. The movie is beautiful. Mizoguchi prepares us for the film's supernatural elements with an indelible scene involving boats on a fog-drenched lake. While nothing happens here that is overt fantasy, it settles in with an eerie pallor that buys it some leverage to push its boundaries a bit farther shortly after.
This is my second encounter with Mizoguchi, my first being Sansho the Bailiff. Both are epic medieval tearjerkers. I think at this point my preference is for Sansho, but I'll see how this film sticks with me. It has a haunting quality that made me somewhat tempted to watch it again the next day. It's one of those movies that feels pretty straight-forward, but still is cloaked with the sense that there may yet be quite a bit more to mine.",4.0

deeply haunting and a gothic tinged atmosphere is a way to describe this drama. exploring your unfulfilled dreams and becoming selfish to the people you love has it’s consequences. in this film you experience those consequences in which the characters bring upon themselves and their spouses and children. spirits and ruthless samurai ravage on the screen as they tear apart the lives right in front of our eyes. truly a great film that has its morals in the right place but is very blunt about being weary of our own selfish dreams and wants.,4.0
"A great ghost story that stands the test of time. The impending tragedy looms large as the men trade their happy home life for wealth and ambition. The women of course are left paying the cost. Mizoguchi is so frank in exposing their suffering that I can’t help but reflect on the price of my own goals. What price is too high? Is my family better served if I shift my goals and feel more content in the present? And how much did Mizoguchi see of himself in those men and in this story?
The camera work is beautiful. Mizoguchi is such a master of framing. Half the fun comes in how he decides to reveal new information. Even the reveal of the supernatural comes in drawn out camera moves. 
I also appreciate that this managed to be less depressing than Sansho.

Greed and pride will be the downfall of men. The two men just refuse to listen to the voices of reason (their wives!) throughout the film and end up briefly achieving all their hopes and dreams only to see that the price paid for them is beyond what anyone would be willing to pay.  Such a beautifully shot film too. Many of the scene transitions just seem so ahead of their time. While they are commonplace now and we just take it for granted but back then it was quite innovative.

"This Mizoguchi masterpiece set in the Azuchi-Momoyama period is closer to a horror movie than a samurai film. The film builds up its mood from the very beginning, thrusting us into a war torn country where peasants fear another attack at any moment. This film draws on Japanese folklore which gives the film its eerie atmosphere, and it draws from classic Japanese literature for its moral and social complexity. Apart from its stunning visuals, desolate atmosphere, and engaging plot, Ugetsu explores the morality of ambition as well as wartime profit. This all exists in a dreamlike hazy world of fog and blackened earth that is just as chilling as it is fantastical. An absolute Jidaigeki essential, Ugetsu is much more than another ghost story.",4.5

this is stunningly shot; the long takes are just exquisite. even though the film moves quite quickly, constantly cutting between the different plots, it never felt rushed; i was easily pulled under the film's spell (just as Genjuro was Lady Wakasa's) into this completely unfamiliar time and place, and the beautifully tragic atmosphere, but always with the promise of violence lurking in the distance.

""i told you so, but you were too foolish to learn except through misfortune...""
my blood boiled watching these women who sacrificed their dignities and devoted their entire lives to their husbands, for whom these sacrifices were so easily thrown away, not nearly as enticing as a beautiful, mysterious ghost, or the promise of riches and fame.
the ending offers us some hope and a beautiful glimmer of redemption through a beautiful shot uniting the past, present, and future, as well as the spirit world and the living world.

الفيلم ده بعيد عن كونه دليل أخر دامغ علي عبقرية ميزوجوتشي فهو درس لأي صانع سينما أو رجل مهتم بالمجال وفي ذهنه أنه يقدم شئ ذو قيمة .. أزاي؟
أولاً درس في عمل معالجة سينمائية لنص أدبي .. طبعاً المسألة دي سهل تعلمها من أي حد بس هنا الوضع مختلف شويتين لأن النص المقتبس هو نص تراثي خيالي بتغلب عليه روح الأساطير والخرافة .. كمان هو مش نص واحد بل أكثر من نص تم مجهم لخلق تجربة جديدة برؤية مختلفة .. وهنا تكمن النقطة .. ميزوجوتشي خد النص لما هو أبعد من الخرافة أو أي بعد روحاني أو تسلية خيالية ونزل بيه علي أرض الواقع .. أيه رأيك بدل ما نتكلم عن العفاريت والثواب والعقاب نتكلم عن بشاعة الحرب والنفس البشرية ومطامعها وتطلعاتها اللي ممكن تؤدي بيها بالجميع إلي الهلاك؟! .. بدل ما أركزعلي حدوتة الشبح أو دائرة الكارما اللي بيقع فيها رجل أختار أن يكون مقاتل أتكلم عن ظرف بشع بيخرج أسوأ ما في الإنسان وبيضعه في أختبار صعب علي حافة الموت .. هنا نقدر نشوف مدي الثقل الفني لميزوجوتشي .. رجل بدل ما يسرح في عالم الخيال زي كتير من أبناء جيله بياخد القصة لمستوي جديد وبيخرج منها أبعاد وجوانب يمكن ما خطرتش علي بال حد قبل كدة
ثانياً مدي الجمال والشاعرية اللي بيتمتع بيهم الفيلم فنياً خلوني شخصياً أتغاضي عن الطبيعة الكلاسيكية للقصة اللي مكتسباها من كونها تراث أقرب للسير والخيال الشعبي اللي الصدف والقدريات بتلعب فيها دور محوري .. الفيلم تحفة إخراجية أبرز مواطن الجمال فيها واقعيتها البارزة أوي في بناء وتصميم القري والأسواق وملابس الممثلين اللي بتخليك تعيش أجواء العصور القديمة وكأنك سافرت عبر الزمن .. إلي جانب التوظيف المظبوط للبطء والهدوء في المشاهد بشكل يخدم شاعريتها ويديها روح الشعر السينمائي .. يمكن مشهد المركب في البحرية ومشهد رقص الأميرة أهم مثالين علي هذا الكلام .. أنت بتشوف المشهد بتأني وده بيخليك تركز في تفاصيله وتندمج مع الحالة وتتفاعل معها وكأنك جزء من الأحداث
لو قعدنا نتكلم عن ميزوجوتشي الكلام مش ح يخلص .. لانه علامة من علامات السينما وملهم ومعلم لأجيال وأجيال",5.0

As with other great films the specific circumstances and structures of time and place are beautifully explored whilst maintaining a universal message, far removed from the actual setting.

"Em Contos da Lua Vaga, a história mistura fantasia com realidade, porém essa fantasia apenas exalta o grande problema dos homens: a ambição e ganância.
Japão está em plena guerra civil, e as famílias precisam se proteger dos samurais que saqueam as casas, estupram as mulheres e tomam os homens como escravos por todo lugar que passam. Entretanto, o que destruirá as duas famílias presentes na trama não será a guerra, mas a enorme ambição dos maridos. Genjuro não quer deixar em sua pequena vila abandonada o sonho de enriquecer com suas cerâmicas e Tobei de tornar-se um samurai, mesmo que suas mulheres os implorem para esquecerem tudo isso.
Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering.
Essa extrema ambição acaba em ""sucesso"" dos homens e abandono das mulheres e da pequena criança de Genjuro à mercê da guerra, precisando se virar como podem sozinhas nesse país caótico. E, infelizmente, o ser humano aprende que errou às vezes do jeito mais difícil, e aqui não é diferente...
I told you so, but you were to stupid to learn except through misfortune.
Posso dizer que esse filme não me deixou perder a atenção um segundo, ainda mais que mistura fantasia com realidade, então chegou um momento em que fiquei ""o que será que realmente está acontecendo?""...

But slowly the supernatural seeps into the story beautifully, from the breathtaking sequence in the lake, to the eerie dancing and singing from Lady Wakasa.

"I’m well aware how highly regarded this film is but on this (at last) first watch for me, I did not connect fully with it and I think further viewings will help. Certainly it is a beguiling morality fable (ghost story is an inappropriate description, I think) and one which blends the real with the unreal in a way which is at times very powerful and at others conventional. Having heard much about the beauty of the cinematography, I found that there were definitely beautifully constructed moments and great movement with the camera, but taken as a whole I suppose I could imagine films that I’d consider more visually effective.

"""The war drove us mad with ambition..""
One lesson to take away from Ugetsu is ""be happy with you lot, never leave your station, or face the consequences."" I remember watching this film for a class I took in undergrad, and my professor had this take. He argued that the film penalized the characters for their ambition, especially their drive for capitalistic profit. But I don't know that now, having seen the film twice, I entirely agree with this take.
I don't think the film despises ambition as a whole. Take for instance in the beginning, when Genjuro returns from his first trip to the city. He has made money, more money that his family has ever seen. So, at least in this instance, Genjuro's ambition, his drive for profit, has resulted in something good- money to feed his family and buy his wife nice things. Where Genjuro goes wrong is when his ambition becomes unshackled, when he shirks his familial duties to pursue money. Of course, if one understands the criticisms of capitalism, one knows that Genjuro's story is indicative of the inherent failures of the system. When profit is valued above all else, it is no surprise when men like Genjuro completely abandon their families in order to seize an opportunity to make money. Even more so, Genjuro is attempting to profit from war. Even if he is just selling pottery, Genjuro views the immese suffering and death surrounding him not as an abhorrent situation, but as one ripe for opportunity.
This is the mindset that capitalism engenders in people. Genjuro's fall comes when he wholeheartedly buys into this mindset. He views money not as a means to provide for his family, but as a means to promote his own status and economic class. This leaves him vulnerable to seduction by the spirit of Lady Wakasa. Her imposing manor, noble dress, and seeming wealth easily ensnare Genjuro, as he is a man obsessed with the status that money brings. Even if he loves his wife, the idea that this woman's money would make him important, a man of renown, is enough for him to basically commit adultery and nearly die in the process. I think, then, that the movie is really criticizing Genjuro for allowing his ambition to cloud his judgement and make him shirk his duty to his family.
Tobei too, has ambition, but of a different nature. Tobei aspires to be a renowned samurai warrior. He continually abandons his wife, Ohama, in pursuit of this goal. Here again I don't think the movie is simply saying that Tobei dreaming of leaving his station is a bad thing. Rather Tobei's character is meant as a criticism of military fetishism and the fascist government that led Japan during World War II. I found it really compelling when Tobei leaves his wife to go buy himself a suit of armor so that he may finally become a samurai. As he does this, Ohama is surrounded and then raped by a group of samurai. The thing he desired to be, the men he wished to emulate, had violated his wife and stolen her honor. The real crux of this issue is that Tobei believes that becoming a samurai will somehow make him greater than what he is, that it will elevate him to some higher plane. When he lucks into a promotion, he acts accordingly: he holds his chin high, offers advice on how to fight, and just generally speaks out of his ass. He has the opposite of imposer syndrome. In the end Tobei realizes that his ambition had led to his wife becoming a prostitute, and he eventually relents, throwing away his armor and returning home with his wife. I think the message with Tobei's character wasn't so much ""how dare you try to rise above your station"" but more so ""how dare you try to emulate the men who ruined this country and caused so much suffering.""
Though I had a lot to say about this film, I wouldn't rank it as high as other films in its genre, like Kuroneko . It's just not quite as entertaining as I'd like it to be. That being said, I totally understand why for some people this film is a masterpiece. It is incredibly stylistic, with deep and powerful themes. And it has some genuinely spooky moments to boot. Definitely a must-watch for anyone interested in this era of Japanese film.",0.0
"The strength of this film lies mostly in the eerie soft glow of the cinematography: the fog as they drift across the river, sunlight floating in between the boards of a peasant's ramshackle home, candles illuminating a haunted palace one room at a time.

"Ugetsu Monogatari is a Japanese dark fantasy, love story directed by Kenji Mizoguchi and is adapted from the novel of the same name, written by Ueda Akinari. It is not only credited to be Kenji Mizoguchi's one of best works but also known to be one of the most influential works in the country, helping the Japanese cinema popularise in the western world. Ugetsu Monogatari ought to never be forgotten, as it's a ground-breaking useful example story against enticement. Through its numerous side stories, the film shows how human impulsion and pining for prompts overlooking the components of our lives vital for perpetual bliss, for example, the people who really care for their family, and can finish up in tragedy.
The film is set in the 16th century of feudal japan and tells the story about two families, Genjuro, his wife Miyagi and their young son, and living next door is Tobei and his wife Ohama. Both of the families works in pottery making, in the endless war which forsaken the whole village. Genjuro is a greedy person who wants to earn lots of money and be wealthy and Tobei wants fame and to be a famous samurai. Both of the men overlook the alerts of a sage in their town and proceed with making a benefit in ongoing war. Their own greed and personal motives take steps to obliterate both themselves and their families in the process.
The visuals are just magnificent, however they aren't as different in stills, as they are in development. The camera skims around at simply the correct occasions, making each minute feel characteristic. Most may not see it, as not at all like the movies of Welles, these visuals aren't as clear or aggressive. In any case, they are similarly as fitting, and out of the three. The film's lighting is additionally amazing, the utilization of shadows being particularly essential in the harsher scenes.There's a consistent accentuation on music, which off-sets scenes of depression, to a great extent. The music sets a dreadful vibe that helped me a bit to remember a later work of some other 50's extraordinary japanese filmmakers. It's one of my most loved components of the film, it's unbelievably varietal, with various instruments and vibes all through. It coordinates the story staggeringly. With phenomenal direction, extraordinary performances, and staggering cinematography, it is unquestionably a standout amongst the best movies to leave the Japanese Golden Age of cinema. In spite of the fact that the first few parts of the movie were a bit slow, the build-up is completely worth it, as the last demonstration is splendidly ground-breaking and disrupting in equivalent measures. It is a fascinating investigate the ascent and fall in every one of a gathering of four villagers, and offers convincing knowledge into the universe of ravenousness and debasement, just as that of supernatural authenticity and dream.",5.0

Better than any Kurosawa film I've seen. Lazy comparison, I know, but I'm shocked this isn't talked about as much as lesser Kurosawa, so, you know, just a note.
I really liked this at first, but the middle kind of starts to spin out of control and I kind of fell out of it. I think the twist(s) toward the end caught me off guard, and pulled me back in, despite making me twice as confused. I don't know if I liked it over, though. It's a film I definitely need to rewatch after I've sat with it for a little bit. I'm sure then it'll make more sense. It's hard to say if my gut reaction right now is based off of confusion or distaste, so I'll give it a second go eventually.
Still, it's got some of the most gorgeous cinematography, design, and experimental structure in narrative I've seen from 1950s foreign cinema. Might not be my personal cup of tea, but I have a lot of respect for it on this initial watch, and I'm willing to gain even more respect. Some movies you don't have to love, I guess, and this is one of them for me. It's clearly a masterwork, and I think that alone gives it all the validity it needs to stick out more in my memory than other 'classics' I've seen recently.",4.5
"Mizoguchi’s follow up to The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu similarly focuses on the untold stories of the women on the peripheries of history who were all too often the uncounted casualties of male ambition, although this time with a slight horror bent. Even the more revisionist examples of the samurai movie like Seven Samurai and Harakiri rarely examine the way that feudal society was specifically unjust to women, and Mizoguchi (and later Shindo) made proto-feminist period films like this to address those issues. 
The film follows parallel stories of two men, led by ambition, to become a respected samurai or a wealthy artisan, to leave their wives in pursuit of their lofty, hubristic goals. The stories are familiar morality folk tales although with the focus turned on the women involved, with even the demonic succubus lent a deal of pathos by the directing and writing. 
The film uses folk horror tropes and story elements recognisable to later films like Kwaidan and especially Kuroneko, with the wives of samurai abandoned in pursuit of glory and the film stripping away the noble reputation of the samurai class, portraying them as underhanded glory hounds who succeed on the battlefield through either pure luck or subterfuge.
As with the work of many of the great Japanese directors of the era, the film looks and sounds captivating with an unsettling score and an eerie stillness to many scenes, even at their most intense. I was surprised at how dark the film went (although apparently Mizoguchi wanted to go darker) with one scene in particular that would still shock today. There was more than one moment that I had to rewind and rewatch more than once, just to see if the moment had really happened the way I had thought it had. There are some very impressive single-take scenes that give moments a sense of both the realism and the artistry of the theatrical. 
The film was made in the aftermath of World War Two, and Japanese films of that era had a distinctly melancholy feel, that of a nation feeling humbled but ashamed less of their victory than of the fact that they had bought into such warlike rhetoric. Consequently many films of the era deal with the samurai tradition in a distinctively revisionist manner, stripping the ideas of their lustre and exposing their underlying warmongering and barbarism. Ugetsu is an atmospheric, progressive and occasionally powerful example.",4.0
"Mizoguchi’s haunting tale of morality, love, and the devastating effect of war on the common people is a flat-out masterpiece. It’s ghostly, slow brooding atmosphere is an incredible achievement in amongst itself, but the way in which Ugetsu is staged and precisely framed from beginning to end is audacious and ultimately revolutionary.
It’s a heartbreaking, beautiful poem of life and death that often feels as if it’s taken place in another realm. Shy of melodrama, prominent with minimalistic naturalism and wonderfully understated performances. Life is suffering, life finds a way, life goes on.",5.0

"SUMMER 2017 CRITERION CHALLENGE: FILM #60
Kenji Mizoguchi's classic from what must be the golden age of Japanese cinema, Ugetsu, bears the appearance of a film that is a couple of movies slapped together into one -- with some elements of the story more fully-realized and thoroughly developed than others. Yet there's also a sense stirring that Ugetsu would be drastically incomplete if it lacked any of the varying elements it has going for it. Professional ambitions (some more unreasonable, yet not entirely unattainable, than others) in the midst of a war-torn country, and supernatural and spiritual spookiness lurking in the authentic setting and creeping up on the melancholy of the characters are among some of the biggest ideas that Mizoguchi explores, crafting an ambitious, yet truly seamless, combination of an historical war film, mythical fantasy, bittersweet romance, and even elements of horror. It's a masterful amalgamation of different inspirations, and the fact Mizoguchi conquers what he sets out to do in just over an hour and a half is bafflingly impressive. Additionally, though, the characters arcs concocted in this thing come off the screen as if reading a great piece of literature (perhaps, at least in part, due to the literary roots of many of the story elements), making it so that Ugetsu isn't so much a film focused on its bold ideas as it is on the touching human element and thoughtful characterization. It's beautiful, hypnotic, elegiac, and surprisingly accessible, and surely up there with some of the finest works in Japanese cinema. And, trust me, that's saying *a lot*.",4.5

Day 343 of 365 of my year long challenge
Week 49: Man Up
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of a handful of films that helped popularise Japanese cinema in the West, Ugetsu is a masterclass of humble, powerful, human filmmaking.
When Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through their village, two peasant couples flee. While fleeing, the two couples are warned to return to their homes but neither listen. Instead, Genjurō (Masayuki Mori) leaves his wife Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) on the nearest shore while Tōbei (Eitaro Ozawa) brings his wife with him. While separated and fleeing, each man follows their work or their dream while the two women simply run from personal disaster to personal disaster. With a country in turmoil and passions tempted, the line between the real world and the supernatural blurs.
One thing I absolutely love about Ugetsu is just how straight to the point it is. Little time is wasted on setting things up. Kenji Mizoguchi just throws us and his characters straight into the thick of things expecting us to be able to keep up. It's a great way of reflecting the audience against the characters and it makes that development and understanding all the more rewarding. In terms of plot, character and world development, Ugetsu hits a sweet spot that leaves it feeling real and tangible but not so grounded that there can't be more to it.
Mizoguchi takes this further when he blends the real and supernatural worlds so subtly. Sure, anyone can see that something isn't right but it isn't then so egregious that they look too removed from each other. It's easy to believe the supernatural is exists in this war-torn land. Thankfully, Mizoguchi doesn't also use it as a gimmick. Revelations may seem big at the moment but it never feels gimmicky. Again, just a perfect balance.
A lot of love has to go to the core quartet for their performances. Each of them feels totally believable but they also feel like they're characters lifted from a fairy tale. Even so, none of the actors pushes this so far that they don't feel relatably and believably human. With all the flaws and temptations we recognise as well as the emotional growth we all wish to have, you can't help but be struck by them and their self-made plights. Mori, in particular, does a spectacular job as the most reasonable and yet most vulnerable of the peasants. It's just such a human performance it's as entrancing as it is touching.
The biggest praise though has to go to Mizoguchi and his team for crafting Ugetsu in such an enduring way. Stark shadows make their appearance but Ugetsu never feels like an over crafted studio-bound endeavour. The world here feels utterly alive and not unimaginable. Torn apart by war, the desperation creeps further and further into the film until it overtakes everything in its past. From this and the minor characters/,moments that drive it, this Japan becomes horrifyingly devastated by its own conflict.
Ugetsu is, in the simplest terms, a masterclass of precision. The film walks a fine balance yet never slips too far into anyone territory that would undoubtedly unravel it. The world is alive with believable characters and, most importantly, for all the supernatural that may exist, this all feels exceptionally human.",4.0
"Ugetsu falls into the same category of the Kurosawa films I have seen so far. The characterizations have a manic nature that is off putting to me. The characters and writing are one dimensional, stark, and harsh. Contrast this with the way I feel about the cinematography and music which I find beautiful and calming despite its melancholy tone. I also responded very positively to the theme of Ugetsu. All this makes me feel like I have seen half a masterpiece and half a travesty. It is upsetting to me, I want to feel what everyone else feels, but I just don't.",3.0
"It is interesting that the men are the ones with the power of decision throughout this film (i.e., they do whatever they want) while the women are essentially subjected to their every whim. When the families fail due to the husbands' greed, everyone is left to poverty, destitution, or tragedy. But it is the women who, even if forced into prostitution or death, retain some dignity about them, while the men lose every trace of honor. Men seem to be vile creatures here, while women get off relatively easy, but that is due to the system of patriarchy that allows the men to make decisions in the first place.",4.0

"March Around the World 2016
Country 6: Japan
Blame my school history lessons- from the age of eleven up until sixteen, the only topic I was ever taught about was WWII, with a rushed week on the cold war when it transpired that would be a focus of the GCSE exam. I scraped a C. If it was all about WWII, I would expect an A*. This extensive focus on one subject across five years has meant that my knowledge of everything else in history is purely on the broad spectrum. How I wish I spent those five years learning about Japan's rich history. Instead, every time I come to a rich historical epic from the nation I'm left admiring it, but left feeling I've been robbed of a masterpiece for not knowing the ins and outs of the historical context in which any given film is set.
Because Ugetsu is clearly brilliant, mixing together the three different genres Japanese cinema is celebrated for into one affecting narrative. We have the family drama/conflicts of Ozu, the rich historical detail and sweeping cinematic flights of fancy of Kurosawa, with an understated ghost story element reminiscent of Hideo Nakata- it was undoubtably an influence on his style. An effective slow-burn, taking its time to firmly establish characters and different tones in order to subtly introduce contrasting ones, this is the kind of movie I'm glad I watched without any prior knowledge. But still wish I had prior historical knowledge to bump that four star up to a five star movie- I feel I'm not in a position to fully appreciate how rich it is.

"Japanese folk tale gets royal treatment from Mizoguchi's camera. i feel the message of ""unlimited greed brings unlimited grief"" is a bit too preachy at times. Kind of like a Hays code noir, but the movie manages to retain a human element without becoming a judge of it's characters.",3.5
"""The value of people and things truly depends on their setting.""
When I sit down to watch classic Japanese film, this is exactly what I hope for. A storyline that combines realism and fairytales. Beautiful camerawork and strong composition. An atmosphere that feels mystical and magical. Ugetsu is everything a great Japanese film should be. This was my first Kenji Mizoguchi film, but I guarantee it won't take me long to see my second. If Sansho the Bailiff manages to surpass this film in any way I'll be incredibly impressed.

"Em um mundo de representação, o que se propõe entre a realidade da ficção e a ficção da ficção pode ser francamente anunciado, explicado, como em filmes do Nolan, em que as dúvidas são postas de formas fracas e e visivelmente sintéticas(escolha de não mostrar o fim de um plano, como em a Origem), ou podem ser enunciado de forma sutil e orgânica, como feito por Lynch em Mullholand ou nesse filme de Mizoguchi, em que tudo a construção é realizada paulatinamente. Em que tanto na visualização direta como em uma visualização hermenêutica, possibilitando a compreensão expandida de elementos só após a sucessão de uma série de outros anteriores. A construção se completa e se aditiva na dualidade dessa dupla existência entre o real e o onírico, no caso de Lynch, e o real e a fantasia, no caso de Mizoguchi.
Nesse caso, é ainda mais afortunado, porque o que quer mostrar é mais do que apenas uma lenda. É a fratura de valores da sociedade somado ao desalento de um pós guerra que quer ser mostrado, a existência uma ordem ""moral"" exterior, organizadora, e capaz de ""estabelecer a ordem"", não sem antes punir e ter algo em troca, fugindo do aspecto um psicologismo individual(como usado no caso de Lynch) para reforçar o caráter social. Mas sem um aspecto religioso de destino, e de falta de vontade do homem, muito pelo contrário, são postas exatamente questões vinculados a sentimentos e desejos, ""tentações"", extremamente humanas, e como a vontade humana é possível de agir em função do próprio destino.",5.0

"When the theme started kicking in, and when Kazuo Miayawa started the scene with that impeccable camera movement, I knew I was in for a good ride.
And very, very fortunately, the film exceeded my expectations.
Every fucking shot man. Every fucking shot. And on top of those great shots there are these crazy 'oooh' shots that just sent goosebumps down my back. No movement is wasted, and the beautifully composed spaces that are so well explored by Miyagawa, the heavy contrast in the light and shadows - I could go on forever man.
It's just so satisfying to see a film from a director that is able to show their color while hitting everything right, it's just as good as it gets.
It's just so good man. There is just so much to learn about not just the visuals, the sound, but also the storytelling - I really wouldn't know how to make the film any better. And when the film ends and just hits you with that soundtrack it started with - and the camera pans towards the scenery of the village - oh man.
I should honestly be more critical but it really was just too good.

Dentro dessa dinâmica de algo não estar certo, o filme estrutura os quatro personagens principais em núcleos distintos; cada um com suas próprias histórias e desejos; uma organização quase de contos mesmo.

"In the midst of war, two men seek their fame and fortune but the wives they leave behind will pay the price for it.
Director Kenzo Mizoguchi creates a haunting tale of men’s pride as two peasants, one who wishes to be a successful pottery merchant and another who desires to become a samurai both forget all else in their obsessions as they see the war around them as the key to their success. Genjuro (Masayuki Mori), discovers he can fetch a very high price for his pottery in war torn areas and seeks to fill his home with riches. Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa) sees the war as a way to find fame as a samurai. Each in their own way is doing it to bring security to the wives and raise themselves in their eyes but each loses sight of them, not seeing what they have.  Genjuro leaves Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) alone with their son while he crosses the river to sell his wares, only to be seduced by the Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo), a survivor of a slaughtered house who admires both the pottery and its creator.  Though she accompanies Genjuro and her husband Tobei across the river, when Tobei uses his money to get armor and run off with the army, she is left alone and defenceless while the ragged army runs rampant, taking whatever they want.
Each discovers, to their dismay, that their dreams have a cost. When their families are brutally returned to their consciousness, they realize what they have set aside for transient glory.  Mizoguchi creates an ephemeral atmosphere, the ruin of war setting the stage, contrasting the bleak with the beautiful as temptation takes control of each man yet the consequence is borne by what they abandon.  It shows the strength of women to survive in a world where men follow their whims, forgetting what gave them structure and freedom to achieve a success they can’t see.  The score wonderfully accents the unnatural around them but the performances are all rock solid, the men always looking beyond the present, the realm women have to exist in where their knowledge is valued less than a man’s ambition, where women must often reinvent themselves to accommodate the situation men have placed them in.
A brilliant film with a powerful ending that lingers like the ghostly feel present in so much of the film. Definitely a film I will revisit.

"The hype is well-earned. Legendary Japanese art house pic from fave director Mizoguchi chronicles two 16th-century villagers crossing the river to sell wares, each finding ecstasy and agony in very different forms.

Filled with an amazing antiwar message and a subtle anticapitalist one, this film has so much in it.

"Seeing this right after Throne of Blood and knowing that it’s often tossed around as one of the “all time greats” I think set the bar too high for me. There are certainly some really affecting and impressive sequences (I especially liked the somber ending and the lake), but overall I never fell under its spell. The movie felt a bit too overstuffed and undercooked with the second couple. It’s definitely an accomplished work full of beauty but feels a bit like one of those old classics that doesn’t quite transcend its age for me. I also remembered the beginning having seen it decades ago and thought maybe I stopped watching but I also remembered the end.

A quintessential tale of how greed and ambition seize men and lead to the plight of women. Here Mizoguchi melds that with a ghost story shot with elegance and grace.

"If a masterpiece is what you’re after, however, Kenji Mizoguchi’s extraordinary UGETSU MONOGATARI, at the NFT late show tonight, is obviously where you should be headed (although Jean Vigo’s lovely, lyrical L'ATALANTE, at the NFT Monday through Wednesday, is equally recommendable). Adapted from a novel by Veda Akinara set in 16th century Japan which has recently been brought out here in translation, this 1953 epic comprises the second in Mizoguchi’s string of late masterworks — THE LIFE OF OHARU, SANSHO THE BAILIFF, THE CRUCIFIED LOVERS, THE EMPRESS YANK KWEI FEI, SHIN HEIKE MONOGATARI, and STREET OF SHAME -– with which he concluded his prolific career, and probably remains the best known of all of them.
A film about war and its aftermath, with haunting fantastic overtones, UGETSU juxtaposes the stories of a village potter seduced by a phantom princess and that of a more ambitious man who virtually sacrifices his wife in order to become a samurai.The title –- roughly translatable as “Tales of the Pale and Silvery Moon After the Rain” -– perfectly evokes the mood: while UGETSU is crammed with enough action to furnish six other spectaculars, its principal focus is less on the action itself and more on its consequences, the effects that war and love leave in their wake. Directed with incomparable beauty and control, it well deserves its place in the International Critics Poll conducted by Sight and Sound in 1962 and 1972, where it figured both times as one of the ten greatest films ever made.",0.0

A fantasia e os elementos sobrenaturais inseridos de forma sutil são arrepiantes e fundamentais para que a proposta do filme seja 100% efetiva. É o segundo filme do Kenji Mizoguchi que eu assisto (o primeiro foi O Intendente Sansho) e ambos os filmes são obras-primas totalmente enraizadas na mais genuína cultura japonesa.

"On retrouve les préoccupations habitées par Mizoguchi et exacerbées dans L'Intendant Sansho (les conséquences des choix forts, la fuite de son milieu, la famille, une société féodale violente et oppressante...) mais ici il traite ça de part un aspect étonnamment onirique (puisqu'il contraste avec une mise en scène que je jugerais de naturaliste) : l'illusion. Emprisonnés par leurs ambitions, leur rêve fructueux, les personnages (masculins) vont sombrer dans une sorte de folie et se faire malmener par des illusions de plus en plus diffuses pour le spectateur. Leur emprisonnement, bien que le cadre le montre aussi parfois, est spirituel. Et forcément ça me touche beaucoup moins que L'Intendant Sansho où l'emprisonnement est physique, matériel (car leur condition se joue dans un espace dont ils tentent de s'émanciper, mais passé cet espace ils sont libres. L'enjeu de départ est donc matériel dans Sansho). Car ce que je préfère pour l'instant chez Mizoguchi c'est sa manière de faire sentir l'espace dans sa mise en scène (j'ai jamais rien vu de tel). On ressent chaque arbre, chaque personne, chaque décors, chaque texture, chaque échelle de plan comme palpable ou vivant. Souvent hors de notre portée, certes, mais pourtant bien réel.
Donc un poil déçu mais j'ai quand même beaucoup aimé pour cet aspect là, et parce que c'est toujours d'une limpidité folle, d'une beauté cristalline, d'une dramaturgie qui glace le sang. Chapeau bat Mizoguchi (mais pour l'instant pas un cinéaste qui me passionne ou m'obsède... A voir avec d'autres)

The women suffer from these selfish decisions. Both the men have moments of false happiness and joy before being brought back to reality.
I also have to mention the music and sound in this film. I think there is some really haunting and eerie music that was essential in creating the atmosphere. I really enjoyed this and I am looking forward to seeing more from Kenji Mizoguchi.",4.5

"The two other Mizoguchis I watched I wasn't huge on. I definitly enjoyed them, but there was something that was lacking overall that would make me fall head over heels on them if it was there. But then I watched Ugetsu, and it was one of the most distressing experiences I've had with a film. I went in knowing there would be some creepiness and all, but this was unnerving from beggining to end and at times harrowing. But the beautiful thing is just how simple it is.
The story is simple, it's based on a japanese folktale, and its message on greed and egoism equally simple. It also employs ghosts, which is something we're all used to, especially those familiar with japanese folklore. But this felt completely new and modern, and with that inventiveness comes a pretty terrifying result. There's a lot going on with the sound in this film, most of them subtle and drony but leave a strong impression. Sometimes they are loud when the scene needs it. The dense, beautiful and naturalistic cinematography is made all the more haunting and otherworldly with it and the serene camera movements that often replace any uneeded cuts. Like you are given little to no escape.
But I find its ideas to be Ugetsu's most interesting aspect. This is a film ingraned with Japan's ancient culture. The sound design is entirely produced with traditional japanese instruments, like a gong, the heavy make up is that of traditional Kabuki, and overall Japanese culture being shown. And with Japan, its religion. There's this chilling sequence of them riding a boat on a deeply fogged lake, reminiscent of a beautiful veil. It feels like it's predicting the curse that will inevitable befall these characters for the path they've chosen. And this aspect of predestination and spirits evokes a spiritual intuition. By the end the characters have returned to their original place, crafting the products that let them to the curse they dealt through to begin with, only this time they need it to survive. But maybe it's only a matter of time when their deepest and self centered desires start to take over them again, and with it, a new curse. The spirits will always be there, waiting. In its totally it feels real and unreal, a merger between two planes. The final shot concludes with an ode to Japan, and possibly the entire world.
Ugetsu is a film of timeless impact. It haunts those who watch it the same way those in the film are haunted. It transports us to multiple realms that become one, most of them spiritual and without agency. It's artistic cinema of the highest calibre, tranforming its ancient tale into a neverending curse.",5.0
"“A mistake for a man, but for a woman, much worse.”
Ugetsu is simply one of the greatest works of Japanese cinema. It is beautiful. It is scary. It is messy. And it is wondrous. It is a film of greed, of war, and of women. It is simply a stunning work, layered with depth and allegory, basking in the surreal and unknowable.
Ugetsu is about the ubiquity of suffering, and how suffering itself is derived from the desires of man (making it a wonderfully Buddhist work). The men’s desire drives them to kill, steal, and risk the lives of themselves and all they love. An early scene shows a man almost killing himself so that he can claim his profit, and this sets the tone for all that follows. But what the men take comes at the expense of the women. The women in Ugetsu are the real victims. Man’s ignorance breeds woman’s suffering. This is a film of rape and infidelity, unpleasant and yet so poetic. A man becomes a fool, his wife pays the price.
Ugetsu is a film of symbolism and surrealism. Oftentimes dreams become one with reality as the characters’ sanity is put into question. There are endless themes to analyze. The fact that this came right after WWII is so deeply meaningful, as it demolishes the country’s views of honor. A man stealing the head of a powerful figure to take his place. The country’s rape by unknowable outside forces. Further still the is theme of greed, particularly lust. Sex is often materialized in Ugetsu, and materials are sexualized. There is a link between men’s need for money and their need for sex. Both come at the expense of those around them, and the thief is the least affected. War is sexual, money is sexual. Men desire to steal wealth, life and sex. Their indulgence in these animalistic desires ruin the lives of everyone around them. To fulfill a desire is to take from someone else. Nothing comes without consequences.
Ugetsu is extraordinary. It is an utterly singular achievement in art cinema. The fact that it is also incredibly entertaining only serves as a bonus. I may have a few gripes, but I cannot deny the absolute masterpiece that is Ugetsu. Deep, powerful cinema.",4.5
"Nearing my completion of every movie Hideo Kojima mentioned during his Criterion Collection closet stint...
I've seen a lot of people associate Ugetsu with ""greed"" but I don't think that's the right word. More about selfish decision making?

"I admire the texture of the war-torn world, the pervasive sense of hopelessness of the ordinary person with a life made disposable by the arcane, ever-shifting power-politics of unseen warlords. But I was bothered quite a bit by the moralism that drives the characterizations, which I found to frequently appeal to apolitical (but ultimately bourgeois) notions of innate virtue with no accounting for material reality.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the entire story of Tobei, who is shown at turns to be quixotic, irrational, cowardly, sniveling, and callous, when he responds to the same circumstances of desperation that drive Genjuro's financial grindset (which is shown as being far more respectable, even if it is positioned as the ego-driver that leads to his downfall). He is so consistently punished for seeking an escape from desperate poverty and vulnerability to violence, that he is implicitly blamed for abdicating his family responsibility and for abetting the rape of his wife (and consequent loss of virtue), a transgression that is held over him for the remainder of the narrative with his wife deputized as moral enforcer. In total, this conveys a somewhat inhumane view of the historically limited autonomy of women, sex work, and lays the blame for systems of violence and order at the feet of those who are victimized by it.",3.5
"only recently i got to briefly watch a couple of Noh and Kabuki Theaters on YouTube, fascinated by the actors' movements and emotions portrayed by their masks and make ups and the eerie and unsettling music played live on stage by four people right next to the actors. since then I've been wondering how it must feel to watch such peculiar plays live. thanks to Mizoguchi i kinda feel like i just did. a very heart-breaking story based on a book of the same name, ""fantasies of the moon hidden behind the rain clouds"" (what a name!), its nine ghost stories commonly adapted into plays.
I'm surprised in many ways but mostly because i cried like a bitch. imagine what it'd be like to see this up close.

"Once again, I meet a legendary filmmaker for the first time being here Kemji Mizoguchi with what could perhaps be his masterpiece, Ugetsu Monogatari.
Set in feudal Japan the film is off to a quick start, and does in general move fastly as it tolds to related stories that combined bulid up the plot of the film, while being related storywise both stories are different, but not completely as they follow the same theme. In both stories the main character has the chance to live his family behind and fullfil his dreams, Genjūrō has the noble desire to earn money to live happily with his wife and child while Tōbei who dreams of becoming a great Samurai, while Genjūrō is seduced by a peculiar woman and Tōbei is seduced by power in the end both stories end with greed as their main character. Both of the men take advantage of the war situation around them, one to earn more money and one tp earn respect, but both seduced by greed end up ruining not only their lives but also the lives of their families.
The message in the film is strong and put in a unique atmospherical way that made it feel, as other people compared it with, like a horror film, which I usually disagree when any film not of the genre is compared to but here I actually see a point.
A strong start into my dive of Mizoguchi's filmography and a film that truly left me speechless.

"Ugetsu is a beautiful, devastating story about the toll that greed & militarism takes on a man's soul, his family & his country. It's also an unflinching portrait of the suffering of women during wartime. Mizoguchi's use of eerie music, his breathtaking visual compositions and Lady Wakusa's pale, doll-like face will haunt me for a long time. Just a perfect, perfect film.

"Goodbye to the eyes of Heaven, and welcome to a Hell filled with tomfoolery and hubris. What Kenji Mizugochi channels within this film is a startling rage, for the greed and patronizing nature of masculinity that women must always suffer, whether in life, or the memory of it. Laden with the sounds of Pagoda rituals, crafting a sacred soundscape, Ugetsu’s on-screen action and acts of misery often oppose and contrast these sounds, so what we witness is all the more haunting. Machiko Kyo is otherworldly in appearance, yet retains in her vocal register such sincere adoration and affection, that she is all the more tragic. To suffer loss is a constant in the lives of many, but men ain’t shit: don’t let them cause more pain.",4.0

"The chaos of war leads to times of uncertainty for both those involved and those who reside outside its parameters, whether they are consciously partaking in an act of voyeurism or if their peripherals are fixated on aspects of their lives that have more importance. The latter sees chaos as a ladder. They embrace the uncertainty that man-made carnage brings and capitalize off of any opportunity that comes their way. Kenji Mizoguchi’s film Ugetsu depicts how prosperous and dangerous this ladder can be through the lives of two neighboring peasants who seek to pursue their desires during the absurdity of war.
Ugetsu opens to two peasants' ambitions to make something greater of their lives during a civil war set in the Sengoku period. They’re warned by some villagers of the fragility of prosperity during times of war, yet they do not heed their advice and pursue their desires blindly. Ugetsu is an absurdist film, one that shows the absurd through the effects war has on peoples’ lives. The land is primed with conflict and painted with blood; man’s darkest psychological elements are unearthed and unleashed onto the innocent as they rape village inhabitants, pillage their homes for food and valuables and kidnap survivors to force them into slave labor; homes are burned down and those not brought into slavery are left stranded, forced to adopt a life more gruesome and cruel than what they had prior. It’s a film soaked in tragedy, mirroring the hardships of life and the dark nature of humanity.
Mizoguchi uses Ugetsu as a cinematic parable about the apathetic and selfish nature of humanity - specifically obsession and greed - and how they affect one’s morality. Both peasants wildly obsess over their desires. Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) wishes to accrue capital and live a lavish lifestyle through his craft while Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa) longs to be a well known and respected samurai. Throughout the film, both characters are brought to crossroads where they must choose between a path of morality, which diverts their focus from their ambitions momentarily, or continue towards the path of their desires, which causes them to relinquish aspects of their humanity permanently. We all know what man desires, and it's to satiate their craving for their own pursuits, and they’ll do so no matter what it costs them. This climb up chaos’ ladder is in ways a shortcut for scaling the dominance hierarchy that rules their world, but as I mentioned before: with chaos comes uncertainty, and gambling doesn’t always yield results, as consequences exist from any action that is taken. Their choices lead them down divergent paths, separating them from their home lives and from themselves, but ultimately lead to the same fate: tragedy.
The cinematography of Ugetsu is stunningly elegant thanks to the prowess of Kazuo Miyagawa, the cinematographer responsible for films such as Rashômon, Yojimbo and Ukigusa. There are signs of visual poeticism through the film’s beautifully captured frames that provide a balance of stillness and gradual tension. Mizoguchi wanted the ambiance in Ugetsu to feel traditionally Japanese, and to do this he adapts two short stories from Akinari Ueda’s novel Ugetsu Monogatari (Tales of Moonlight and Rain), sews them together, alters their structure to create a singular cohesive narrative, then creates two visual aesthetics for the film with the help of Miyagawa. One consists of the traditional presentation of Japanese society by using wide lens shots to capture the expression of beauty of the days of yore. The other uses various dynamic camera angles and detailed set design to present an otherworldly Japanese folklore tale of a malicious spectral force that slowly feeds off the life of the living, tying cultural beliefs to the project in an attempt to solidify its traditional authenticity. It’s super creative and doesn’t lose any levels of compellment.
Ugetsu’s nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a period piece drama that moves with grace through the passage of time. It tackles dark aspects of man’s temperament and how obsessing over temporary gain will only bring about strain and misfortune. I see why this film is considered one of the greatest films ever made, and I look forward to viewing the rest of Mizoguchi’s filmography.

"Raras são as obras cinematográficas que, logrando êxito em construir um mundo particular coeso e coerente, conseguem impor, paralelamente, um subtexto universal e atemporal capaz de dialogar intimamente com os dias atuais em que foram realizadas. Kenji Mizoguchi faz isso com maestria em Contos da Lua Vaga, adaptação da antologia de contos intitulada Ugetsu, de Akinari Ueda. Ambientado no Japão feudal do século XVI - época de intensos conflitos civis e plena vigência do código de honra samurai -, o filme propõe uma mise-en-scène na qual mistério e sobrenaturalidade convivem com alguns dos aspectos mais cruéis e reais da existência humana em coletividade. Tangente a isso, a ambição, o acaso e a desgraça ""predestinada"" revelam-se como forças motrizes da narrativa, marcada por uma dramaturgia densa sustentada na trajetória de quatro personagens centrais e pela técnica apurada do diretor em cada plano, com destaque para o hipnótico chiaroscuro da fotografia e os imersivos planos sequência.",5.0

"i see people saying this movie is feminist for depicting how women (and children) suffer because of men's ambition and dreams/greed, especially during war time. to me this film felt a lot more focused on the internal lives of the men involved. they may be flawed, may commit acts of folly, etc, but ultimately they are the central players. the women are incidental and their fates are largely (1) a result of the actions of men, and (2) included to give the men something to react against. maybe it's because this kind of story has become somewhat overplayed by our modern times?
to me the story is less about greed and more about wealth and poverty. to me the story is less about women's lives being destroyed by men's callousness and more about the men's regrets in failing to prevent it. (one could argue the sidelining of the women's interiority is itself a part of the theme, similar to how it's used in Maus--for those who didn't survive, they are unable to tell their own stories, and the loss of those stories and perspectives IS a legacy of violence--but i don't think that's quite expressed here. or at least, i didn't read it that way)
i do love the eeriness, i love the ghost story, i think it's beautifully shot. i'd be happy to revisit it, particularly in a theatrical setting. i'm having a hard time trying to parse the themes into a single coherent 'thesis statement'. it's no 'Rashomon' to me",4.0
"Lady Wakasa did nothing wrong. God forbid a spirit from beyond tempt a mortal into death.
There were some really neat shots and touches they managed in the production of this -- for instance, the shot where he returns home, walks through, then it pans back and suddenly his wife is at a lit fire, waiting for him to come around again. That was cool! And then, the way they used light when she lit the candle, then it showed daylight gradually come through the slats of the home not long after. I also have to wonder just how they got the breath to be visible during the scenes in the manor?
I also really liked the shot of the women leading Genjuro to the manor through the tall grass, then showing the manor to be totally dilapidated and run down on the outside, and immaculately maintained on the inside. Lot of neat implications there! Seeing the more fantastical and unreal elements trickle in as he spent more time with them, Lady Wakasa's performance with her father's singing, the slight effect on the frame after it panned from them bathing, the reaction of the man when Genjuro went to buy things, all of that really did add to the atmosphere.
I also couldn't help but notice how Buddha was invoked at key moments. They pray in his name with the man on the lake, a woman is assaulted in front of a well-maintained statue, a general is beheaded in front of smaller statues, a Buddhist priest uses Sanskrit to ward off the ghost's effects, and he was thanked when the village chief met with Genjuro once more. Obviously, as a cultural practice, it's not unusual to be invoked at these moments, but it made me take note. With some of those, it felt like an intentional contrast between the serenity and grace of the divine and the brutal mortal nature of what was taking place.
However, it didn't... quite come together in a way that I'm totally sure about. Parts of it felt a little disjointed, or, it made me unsure as to exactly what was being said or the point being made. At a few moments, I went ""ah, I see, so you're saying this"", and then it would go in another direction that wasn't quite as satisfactory as the one I thought we were going towards.
For instance, it does seem to be very concerned about the nature of men turning to foolish ambition and selfishness during times of strife while women are left behind to suffer, but it also seemed to linger more on the fates and experiences of the men than the women who were worse off. I expected something much more tragic for them, something to match the suffering their wives faced, something that didn't let them off quite so easily, and yet... it kinda did. Not that they didn't see hardship, too, but they more or less turned out just fine in the end, while the other was sexually assaulted and had to work in the sex industry, while the other was straight up murdered, and now seems content to spend her days as a ghost lingering in service of a man who was unfaithful to her. Even for all of the coercion and aggression Lady Wakasa employed in seducing Genjuro, it still seems like it came from a genuine sense of loneliness and longing, rather than malice. Even there, the real tragedy is in her, and not him.
This was taken largely from two different stories, and I'm not sure they were woven together quite as well as In a Grove and Rashomon were in Kurosawa's movie, which also starred Kyo and Mori. It feels a little more disparate here.
I do know that this was made with good intent, and that they did want to highlight how women suffer the most in times of hardship. A lot of connections can be drawn here between the Sengoku period and the time around WW2, of course -- that's a no-brainer. I do also particularly like how it shows that status and prosperity absolutely do not equal righteousness and upstanding character. The samurai and elite here are all pretty horrible people, and only through underhanded methods and self-serving deceit do they raise through the ranks. A man goes from a desperate farmer one day to a lauded samurai the next, and suddenly everyone is determined to grovel at his feet, as he rants at them about how you need to be a perfect philosopher and warrior to succeed like he did. That feels pointed. And I do get that. But somehow, it's lacking a certain something to really bring the point home and sell me on those themes with force. By the end, while I knew those were there, they felt a little... muted.

This just seems to be a common occurrence with these acclaimed jidaigeki films. Like with Rashomon and Onibaba, there are a lot of elements of the filmmaking that I admire here, but I ultimately feel like I’m missing something, not getting fully drawn into the film’s world.

Week 13 - Samurai Week: Watch a Samurai film with some horror elements in it !
I don't really know what I think of this. Gorgeously well shot and all, the films I have seen from this era of Japanese film all seem to be excellently made on a technical level. And I think the two stories work each on their own. And they work thematically together. But they don't feel like they really work flowing back and forth in this? Two shared stories of shitty men pursuing greed and glory leaving their women and families to fall victim to other men. I guess the idea was to run the supernatural story parallel to the more grounded war story. And as I said I did enjoy both and can appreciate the juxtaposition but I felt like the shift back and forth kind of took away from each other. I almost rather it had been an anthology or something.
I don't know. Perusing reviews it doesn't seem like most come for the plot or narrative so maybe my criticism just isn't one that resonates. But that is what I tend to go for. And Ugetsu doesn't do bad there. I just feel like it could have done better. But its a spooky and moody story with something to say. Well made for the most part and the technical pros of how it holds up 70 years later probably outweigh whatever cons. Its a good film I'm just not sure I felt the classic hype to it. But I am uncultured swine.",3.0

o Anti-war
o “Suffering mothers” movie
o Ghosts indicated through bell sounds
o Ghosts are mostly women in these films
• This was mostly filmed in the studio

"Ugetsu és una pel·lícula sorprenent per diversos motius. Però aquesta vegada crec que el motiu que més m’ha entusiasmat és el compromís amb la forma d’expressar la llegenda. La pel·lícula integra la fantasia i els esperits com si no fossin només projeccions psicològiques, ja que estan pràcticament al mateix nivell de realitat que la part del conte més pròxima a la versemblança. Així, a la part final, Miyagi apareix de cop després de que Genjurô doni tota una volta a la casa evidenciant la seva condició d’esperit, però hi ha un moment en que la càmera s’aproxima a Miyagi i la deixa sola plorant dins l’enquadrament, donant-li el protagonisme directament, i no sent només una expressió del sentiment de Genjurô, sinó sent un ésser autònom amb sentiments propis. Crec que és molt més interessant quan una llegenda es mostra d’aquesta manera i no només quan està al servici de l’al·legoria, així els elements fantàstics tenen la força en ells mateixos i no només en el que representen.
A més a més, tot i que la pel·lícula es subtil amb les formes, és molt rica amb registres, ja que sembla que Mizoguchi afronta cada decisió segons la situació concreta, però sempre mantenint el respecte per la intimitat que el caracteritza, utilitzant posicionaments de càmera molt sorprenents amb la intencionalitat de deixar fora de camp coses com la mort del samurai assistida pel seu amic o ensenyant només l’esquena dels personatges en el moment just per deixar l’expressió facial per a la intimitat de cadascú. Llavors, la grandesa de Mizoguchi també és troba en les pròpies decisions d’amagar i no només en les de mostrar, tant sigui amb un fora de camp, un allunyament o una el·lipsis.
Però, tot això, sense deixar de ser enigmàtic i apassionant en molts aspectes que lliguen amb el propi desconcert d’algunes escenes, com la de la Sra. Wakasa i l’armadura del seu pare cantant per l’alegria de la unió entre la seva filla i Genjurô o, també, el pla que es repeteix del l’esplendorós pati del palau a la nit amb els sinistres habitants caminant pels passadissos i l’amenaçador arbre al centre de l’enquadrament. En aquest cas, sembla que hi ha tocs de terror expressionista si tenim en compte també la il·luminació de l’escena posterior, quan Genjurô apareix amb els símbols budistes que repel·leixen i revelen la condició demoníaca de la Sra. Wakasa. Tot i que el terror també es troba d’altres formes: en alguns moments la vida de les persones sembla que es pugui vessar com l’aigua entre els dits d’algú que l’intenti agafar, ja que els personatges estan constantment amenaçats per circumstàncies exteriors, com la guerra, i interiors, com la impulsivitat dels homes. Seguint aquesta línia, existeix també una alternança entre ambients asfixiants, amb els saquejos nocturns de les cases, i ambients molt més oberts, amb vistes a naturalesa més diàfana, que crea una falsa sensació de llibertat, ja que no impedeix la desgràcia dels personatges. Però, finalment, es troba certa redempció, quan la pel·lícula es tanca passant de l’enquadrament del fill resant a la tomba de la seva mare a una elevació de la vista mostrant el poble amb els camps un altre cop llaurats i els pagesos un altre cop treballant.",5.0

"While my primary movie watching goal for this year is getting through the Sight & Sound top 100, an exciting secondary effect of watching Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is that it also nets me another notch on the Letterboxd top 250. At least for now. At time of writing it's at number 235, so in rapid danger of being knocked off by the next Shrek sequel, but I digress.
Ugetsu is my second Mizoguchi after Sansho the Bailiff, and definitely not the film I was expecting after how much of a down to earth human drama Sansho was. An admittedly extreme equivalent might be watching Kobayashi's Human Condition trilogy, then going into Kwaidan without doing any reading around it. Ugetsu opens up in a way that suggests what is to come, with credits playing out over music that contains a series of shouts that - for reasons I find myself unable to fully articulate - put me in mind of theatrical traditions. I do not know enough about Kabuki to say whether this is borrowing from that, all I can truly say is that it has a certain specific theatricality to it.
This carries over into the main production of the film itself. For example, an early scene wherein one of our protagonists Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa) witnesses an army approaching their meagre village is played by him literally looking off the side of what is pretty evidently a set and exclaiming that the army is approaching, while the noise of distant gunfire is piped in. Not that any of this should be read as a criticism, of course. I actually find myself fascinated by the way Japanese movies often try to blur the lines between cinematic and theatrical traditions; such as the aforementioned Kwaidan and its gorgeously painted skies, or the terrifying spectre of Godzilla being a man in a suit stomping through a model city, right up to the extremes taken by Paul Schrader in his ultimate tribute to Japanese film and literature in Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. These traditions mix and merge in interesting ways, exposing the theatricality and fiction of what is happening on the screen in a way western films often tend to stray away from.
It's this inherent theatricality that gives the story some of its strange power. Based on Ueda Akinari's Tales of Moonlight and Rain, Ugetsu tells a relatively simple moral fable about two peasants, Tobei and Genjuro (Masayuki Mori) who seek to profit from a war, selling their wares in a neighbouring town against the advice of their village elder, bringing eventual ruin to themselves and their wives Ohama (Mitsuko Mito) and Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka). If there is an issue with this whole approach it's that - and I admit this may be a fault of the translation - I found the writing to be a touch too simplistic. For example, at the very start we have the men making sweeping statements like ""War is great for our profits!"" and Ohama saying outright, ""I don't care about nice things, I'd be happy with just the love of my husband."" It was all extremely blunt in a way that left pretty much no doubt as to what the eventual moral of the story would be, and the likely way it would play out. As I say though, this might have been an overly simplified translation, and for all I know the dialogue in the original Japanese is as wonderful and lyrical as the directing is.
What I can say is I was delighted by how everything did play out - the occasional divergences into ironic comedy as a means to counterpoint the overall tragedy of the tale, and even the movie turning into a ghost story at one point. It's all very imaginative, and superlatively directed by Mizoguchi. I'm not sure I'd be willing to say it's one of the hundred best films I've ever seen, but it is pretty damn good nonetheless.",4.0

"My first of definitely many more Kenji Mizoguchi films. His direction is absolutely astounding in this film and I knew within the first 15 minutes that I was going to absolutely love this. Some of these scenic and higher angle shots are so before the time this was made, and it just blew me away. The way that this director, and many other Japanese directors at the time, was able to frame some of these scenes, is insane.
This direction dude... I just cant get over it. The way each sequence is shot and each shot is framed, it just feels like something that could have been released today. That scene where the group of Samurai rape her about 30ish minutes in is so devastating and crazy to watch. You can feel the panic and the terror. It's insanely well constructed, as is every single scene in this film. I love how you can tell how much care and thought went into every little frame of this whole film. The silhouette shots are to die for dude! They are spectacular!!!
This screenplay is just as, if not more thought out and thought provoking as the beautiful direction. The message of greed and mans hunger for fortune and it's not so fortunate outcome is amazing. It is a theme that many films have used over years and years, but the way that Ugetsu is able to encapsulate this brilliant theme is so well done you can't help but sit there and have your mind blown. Every line of dialogue perfectly falls into place so well and I couldn't find one single line that I didn't think belonged. It all was real, believable, and extremely natural.
Overall, I'm super glad I decided to watch Ugetsu today. I was going to watch Sansho The Bailiff, but I couldn't find anywhere to watch it, so I went with one of many other films I have on my watchlist from Mizoguchi. The way he is able to blend such fabulous themes, an exciting drama, and such mysterious and magical typical Japanese elements is so beautiful.

"No Japão do período Sengoku, dois personagens miseráveis resolvem fazer fortuna em meio à guerra, e partem de casa em busca de seus sonhos. Com a sutileza que lhe é típica, Mizoguchi constrói um improvável Kwaidan, onde se entrelaçam realidade, sonho, fantasia e o sobrenatural, sem que haja uma fronteira clara quanto a esses diversos âmbitos. A cena do lago Biwa, em meio à névoa, é a grande chave do filme, incorporando a transição dos personagens para o mundo dos mortos, e a partir da qual tudo se mistura. À câmera solta e flutuante (as imagens fantasmagóricas e fantásticas são mais uma das inesquecíveis criações de Kazuo Miyagawa, o grande diretor de fotografia nipônico), Mizoguchi contrapõe o formalismo da música característica do teatro Nô, em especial as batidas do otsuzumi, acompanhado pela flauta transversal (a genialidade e ousadia inovadora do compositor Fumio Hayasaka o fizeram substituir a nôkan pelo instrumento ocidental).",5.0
"A story about war, a story about ghosts, and a story mainly about greed leading to a short-sightedness within oneself that can only be rectified once it is too late to preserve what was. I find it interesting how Jidaigekis such as this that are set during the Edo period (though this is set in the Azuchi-Momoya period right before the Edo period) all seem to carry such a pessimistic outlook on the world. Actually, that’s how a lot of Japanese films seem to be as there is rarely to no happy ending in any of the tales. Maybe that is especially the case here where Ugetsu is based on tales by Ueda Akinari that are supposed to be cautionary about the consequences of greed as we see both Genjuro and Tobei fall victim to the biting parasite that is greed. One part of the film that especially exemplified the point that Genjuro is too wrapped up in his ambition is when he’s looking at the fine silks on his way to deliver his pottery wares to Kutsuki Manor and he stops to daydream of buying these silks for his wife, Miyagi. During this sequence, the score is filled with high-noted melodic music that feels dreamy and cheerful but it is also filled with low dreadful notes that feel foreboding and have a sense of longing to them that shows how even if it would be great for Genjuro to be able to afford such silks for his wife then something would be dreadfully wrong because he desires money too much. We see this exact scenario play out later in the film but it isn’t Miyagi he has bought these silks for but his wife Lady Kawasa that ends up in possession of them before revealing that she is truly a spirit who is trying to take him away with her to the afterlife so they can be in love forever. The charming melodic music returns toward the end of the film when we see Genjuro return home and after seeing a once abandoned house he finds Miyagi preparing food for him and the music kicks in to signify that there isn’t something quite right here and before we know it she is gone and the village chief informs Genjuro that she has passed. As much as he wants, Genjuro can’t go and make such grave mistakes and hope to return to life as it once was but instead, his actions have dire consequences and he has unknowingly sacrificed his wife to get what he thought he wanted because of his ambition. The moment right at the end of the film is the most emotional for me as Ohama brings Genichi something to eat and tells Genjuro to eat as well but he continues on with his work and as he does, Genichi takes his bowl of food and runs and puts it on a pedestal by Miyagi’s grave and that’s where we end the film with a simple but heartbreaking ending to this fantastic Japanese tragedy",0.0

"‘Ugetso’ ranked 90th in the recently published ‘best films of 2022’. I confess I had never heard of this film, or of its director, Kenji Mizoguchi - although I vaguely recall Mark Cousins using Mizoguchi as a kind of counterpoint to Ozu when discussing the golden age of Japanese Cinema.
I really loved this film. So much so that I had to go back and revise my rating of Metropolis, which I also gave 4.5 stars to, because I just enjoyed this so much more, even taking into account the earliness of Metropolis.
The cyclical story is simply told. Set during a period of civil war in the late 16th century, a farmer and a potter (bonus) intend to use the opportunity of war to pursue their own self-centred ambitions, with the former dreaming of becoming a samurai, and the latter seeing the war as an opportunity to profit from his pottery. Both pursue these goals in neglect of their wives, both of whom warn against their husband’s sudden shifts in mentality. The wives turn out, inevitably, to be right, both husbands respectively achieving their goals but to the detriment of their marriages, family, and neglected but still present values.
One thing I liked about this film was the clarity with which it demonstrates how war (being made 7 years after WW2 ended) is able to completely disrupt and shift long-held mindsets for the worse. Both of the central male characters are referred to as good men before they see the opportunity for war. But there is something about it’s presence that changes them - it destabilises the social fabric and therefore their conception of themselves, perhaps.
And as such, one reading of the film might therefore be a kind of anti-social-mobility parable. There is a reference to Genjūrō ‘belonging’ in his rural and poor village, for example. But I think that would be missing the point somewhat. It is more about how violence and conflict have the ability to uproot - if only temporarily - those latent values we often don’t realise we have, whether they be personal or familial or national, even. There is an ironic shot in which Miyagi is sexually assaulted in front of a statue of the Buddha.
And it might be broader than just violence. Maybe it’s just a more straightforward cautionary tale of ambition, one that is difficult to avoid. Maybe Genjūrō and Tōbei needed this experience to realise the value of what they had.
Scarlet was fidgety during this one, I think that was more because she had eaten a whole pack of celebrations prior and a packet of magic stars during - it was her first day back at work - but she also enjoyed.",4.5
"""The war drove us mad with ambition.""
Ugetsu is the first film that I have watched of Kenji Mizoguchi and I am impressed with this masterpiece. A mixture of social realism and otherworldly fantasy, Kenji Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu takes place during a time of civil war in sixteenth-century Japan, with two family dramas caused by the blindness of greed. The director’s sweeping tale of earthly humanity and spectral apparitions considers the fates of women during wartime. Wives become victims to the ambitions of their husbands and the cruelty of men, while their ghosts remain behind, haunted and unable to rest.
Ugetsu laments the suffering experienced, by women above all, in times of conflict, through sociopolitical subjugation, and within cultural systems. Mizoguchi explored suffering with the utmost accuracy in regard to the rich details of his productions, including sets, props, costumes, and behaviors, often laboring over the style of a kimono or actor’s expression in a given scene. At the same time, he paid particular attention to the inner being of his characters to ensure an emotional accuracy within his performers. Mizoguchi’s blend of historicity, artistic refinement, and human observation combines with his rare embrace of the spiritual in Ugetsu, and its effect is entrancing, affecting, and unforgettable.",4.5
"Forget about they/them pussy, GHOST pussy is on the market and its hot and ready for YOU!
Utilizing roots in gothic folk and the at time current politics with civil war, this is quite easily one of the most memorable Japanese movies I have seen to this date. The film follows four characters portraying how basic human aspects such as corruption and selfishness can bring upon an even more strenuous situation for characters in an already living Hell.
I tried to stop myself from always going down the same spiel but more people in America should watch movies like this in order to come to an understanding of what actual oppression and absence of human ambition looks like. Every shot in this film is beautiful and looks like a page out of a history book, however it is not the kind of beautiful you find yourself lost in. Long shots of the foggy and motionless setting of the film brings that feeling of hopelessness you don't often feel watching movies.",4.0
"[excerpt from an essay for school]
One of the most striking aspects of Ugetsu is its constant use of natural texture in the frame. In virtually every scene, there are trees in the background or grass in the foreground, deepening the frame and reinforcing the naturalist depiction of the world. In the world of the story, the themes it is discussing are as natural, unchangeable, and timeless as trees themselves. The usage of these natural elements also provides wonderful visual interest, preventing even a single frame of the film from being boring or uninteresting to look at.
The most famous of these scenes is the scene of the boat crossing the lake (23:21). The first shot fades in, but the boat is so obscured by the fog rising off of the lake that we aren’t sure at first whether the shot has finished fading in or not. Ohama’s singing reverberates off the surface of the water, which covers the entire bottom half of the frame and gently undulates, a stark contrast to the upper half of the frame, which seems to be an oil painting of a fog bank. As Ohama’s voice merges with the tiny rolling waves, the boat cuts across the frame diagonally, growing larger and more distorted as it approaches the camera. This composition, in addition to being immensely visually pleasing, is further representative of the naturalist perspective of the story, which places the manmade object and the people inside of it in conversation with the world rather than in conflict with it. The manner in which they emerge from the fog and cut across the water is soft, nondisruptive, and quiet, except for the unintrusive vibrato of Ohama’s song.

"""è proprio vero che gli uomini e le cose cambiano secondo l'ambiente in cui si trovano. Ognuno di noi rimanda parte della luce che riceve.""
Ispirato alla raccolta ""I racconti di pioggia e di luna"" di U. Akinati, quest'opera monumentale è uno dei film più celebri del prolifico maestro giapponese K. Mizoguchi ed annoverato tra i capolavori del cinema giapponese (e non solo), per raccontare attraverso un dramma storico-fantastico una complessità tematica magniloquente che varia dallo scontro tra la ricerca della bellezza nell'Arte e la distruttiva Guerra, ai ruoli sociali dell'uomo e della donna, dal sogno ed ambizione all'esistenza ed apparenza.
Leone d'Oro a Venezia 18, i numerosi spunti narrativi vengono affrontati da Mizoguchi con indomita classe ed eleganza, soprattutto nella sua padronanza del long-take, rappresentando su schermo una messa in scena tanto brillante quanto tenebrosa, nell'ottima ricostruzione scenografica e nella sbalorditiva fotografia in B/N che regala squarci a dir poco incantevoli.

Inspired by the collection ""Tales of rain and moon"" by U. Akinati, this monumental work is one of the most famous films of the prolific Japanese master K. Mizoguchi and counted among the masterpieces of Japanese cinema (and not only), to tell through a historical-fantastic drama a magniloquent thematic complexity that varies from the clash between the search for beauty in Art and the destructive War, to the social roles of man and woman, from dream and ambition to existence and appearance.
Golden Lion at Venice 18, the numerous narrative cues are tackled by Mizoguchi with indomitable class and elegance, above all in his mastery of the long-take, representing on screen a staging as brilliant as it is dark, in the excellent scenographic reconstruction and in the stunning B/W photography that offers enchanting glimpses to say the least.",5.0

"Absolutely incredible when it comes to form. The foggy, almost cavernous look of this movie is so incredibly evocative. Even the scenes set during daytime look as if a dark shadow had been cast over the universe, as if humanity had entombed itself into a dark cave from which we cannot escape. All of this while a thick and hazy fog covers the barren landscape and the distant drums of war echo in the soundtrack. Without being particularly explicit, the first thirty minutes of this movie show some of the most despairing visions of war I've seen - focused, of course, in the miserable toll that warring factions takes on the average peasant. It might be the high of just having seen this that leads me toward hyperbole, but right this moment I am struggling to think of a movie with a more expressive, evocative, and precise mise en scene than this one.
Holding off on that half a star because it's my first Mizoguchi, so there's always the possibility this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his movies. But also because I am not quite sure how to unpack the moral of this story (and this is certainly a moral-minded movie). The men are ambitious and selfish, the women tell warn them not to be, then tragedy ensues. Who pays for what in which feels true to life, but there doesn't seem to be much of an alternative in staying put and trying to scrape by. Not necessarily a wrong way to look at life, so maybe I'm just being a silly dreamer like these other dumb men.",4.5
Men just won't listen.,4.5
"Film 5 of 31 for Hooptober 9: Virgin Sacrifice:
It's very difficult to put into words exactly why Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is a great film - perhaps, as many critics have suggested, one of the greatest of all time. Sometimes words just aren't enough.
Ugetsu is one of those rare works that seems to encompass life itself and everything it entails - to cite some more recent examples, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life springs to mind, as does Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York. This isn't to say it's not about anything specifically; it's about many things, but these concepts Mizoguchi deals with have tendrils which spread out and relate to just about every corner of our existence. The toll of war on common civilians, with no choice but to go about their everyday lives in its suffocating midst. The iniquity and heartbreak sown by the simple construct of money. The unavoidable burden women bear under a hopelessly ingrained patriarchy, and the virtue and folly of the good men who reflexively encumber them. The euphoria and the tragedy of pride, the nature of love, the randomness of fate, the transience of life, our capacity for good and evil. It's all here, and more.
As with its myriad of themes, Ugetsu encompasses several genres. Befitting a film about everything, it's impossible to attribute just one to it, but perhaps three are the most overt and overriding: it's a war film, a period drama, and a horror film. In terms of all of them, it's exceptional work.
As for the period piece, this is as authentic as one can reasonably expect, with Mizoguchi diligently employing actual relics from the 16th century as props and costumes. But equally as important is his incorporation of several traditional Japanese art forms, from Noh theater and biwa music to scroll painting and kaidan (ghost stories with a Buddhist moral). His use of the so-called ""scroll shot"", where his camera continuously drifts to one side, capturing the entirety of a scene in one long, unblinking take - as if the picture on screen is an unfolding scroll - is the stuff of film legend. He rarely uses a cut or a close-up; his camera flows and breathes.
The horror component here is particularly noteworthy, as Mizoguchi employs the Noh and biwa elements to great effect, creating extraordinarily eerie scenes - such as an unforgettable fog-obscured boat ride across a lake in which ominous portents are shown to our protagonists, or a scene in which the mysterious Lady Wakasa performs something of a dance of death for the main character, Genjuro. It's not much of a spoiler to divulge there are paranormal elements to this film; what's interesting is that, while unsettling to the say the least, the inherent terror of these elements pales in comparison to the terror wrought by the mundane. The anti-war element, despite the separate presence of the supernatural element, accounts mostly for the horror element; they're one and the same.
This is far and away the scariest film I've seen from probably any era prior to the late 1960's; there's no comparison. The buildup of dread is masterful and the horror genre would see nothing like it, as far as I'm aware, for years to come. Yet impossibly, through it all there's a certain tranquility underlining the film, a juxtaposition which seems to suggest that horror and suffering are an inevitable facet of this ever-changing life. That Ugetsu is based on two parables from Ugetsu Monogatari - Ueda Akinari's 1776 book of kaidan - would seem to reinforce this Buddhist notion, but then again nothing here is simple. And yet, somehow the film couldn't be simpler.
There's no review that can recommend Ugetsu highly enough, no analysis that can dissect it thoroughly enough. This is a transcendent meditation of a film - a true tour de force. I've tried, but I don't think I can come close to explaining exactly why. Words just haven't been enough.",5.0

"*Major spoilers. If you haven't seen this yet, watch it first!*
There's one particular scene in Ugetsu that I keep returning to, trying to figure out Kenji Mizoguchi's techniques. It is certainly not the only fantastic moment in this film, but if I could only mention one, it would be the one I'd choose. It happens like this: Genjūrō has just learned that Lady Wakasa, his lover, is a malevolent spirit. The priest has drawn symbols on his chest, to protect him, and Genjūrō at long last seems to have been woken from the ecstasy of his extended daydream. Now he remembers the life he led, what feels like ages ago, when he had a wife and child whom he loved. As much as he desires a life with Wakasa free of worry, he knows he must return to his family, and tells her this. A change comes over her, suddenly. She stands up, towering over Genjūrō, and refuses to let him leave. Her presence up until this point has been seductive, but now is menacing. Her exaggerated make-up no longer accentuates her beauty but her alien nature. Her warm hospitality has been replaced by cold emptiness. She has held an indomitable command over the potter since they first met, but before it has been because of her enthralling loveliness. Now she is in charge through sheer venomous malice.
How Mizoguchi is able to depict such a pronounced tonal switch in a character? So far, I have come to few conclusive answers. I have figured out that in this scene we are able to see Wakasa's breath, which must have subconsciously indicated coldness to me. But the other directorial choices would not suggest this shot be so notable. The lighting is not particularly different from before this shot, and the camera angle follows her as she stands, instead of staying at the eye-level of the humble protagonist to emphasize her authority over him. As she rises, we hear the gentle tones of the harp, Mizoguchi's leitmotif for the supernatural, despite it being possibly the least threatening instrument of the orchestra. As Wakasa discovers the curse inked onto Genjūrō's skin, her voice hardens and the music sounds ominous, two obvious ways of painting the character's evil nature ― but how is Mizoguchi able to do so even before these cues? If I had to guess, I would say the terrifically uncanny and subtly eerie performance of Machiko Kyō, but I could not say how much she is responsible for the atmosphere of this scene.
Ugetsu is full of these amazing moments, and although carries a similarly distinct quality of mystery about much of it, it also manages to contain plenty of other aspects ― for instance, the ubiquitous anti-war message. Unlike the typical samurai flick, the reasons behind the fighting are nebulous and never explained. We are not introduced to the two sides, their motives, or their leaders. It is completely unnecessary to know which side is winning at any moment. Even on this rewatch, I still could not pick out which faction attacks the villagers in the beginning, or which one Tōbei becomes a fighter for, or whatever side rapes his wife and murders Genjūrō's. This war is entirely peripheral to the characters. And yet, it is of enormous importance to them, forcefully guiding their moves and affecting their actions. War is the catalyst for Genjūrō and Tōbei's greedy decision to travel further to sell their wares, in a sort of medieval war profiteering. It leads both men to abandon their wives; Tōbei in his obsessive ambition to become a samurai, and Genjūrō when he makes his wife stay on shore due to the risk of pirates. In both cases, these choices bring tragic consequences.
Mizoguchi's storytelling is profoundly feminist. In Ugetsu you can visualize a sort of scale on which the two parts of a married couple are balanced. As Mizoguchi shows, honest labor increases both sides of the scale equally (when Genjūrō returns home to his wife Miyagi having bought a kimono with the money he has earned, and they are both overjoyed in such a wonderfully charming way). But cupidity and selfishness adds to one side of the scale what is taken from the other. When Tōbei runs away to find a suit of armor, his wife Ohama is left alone, where she is raped by a gang of soldiers. And when he achieves his dreams, with a fancy suit of armor and a posse of attendants, he discovers she has become a prostitute. Mizoguchi spells out this message explicitly; when they are reunited, Ohama remarks, ""Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering."" It doesn't get more obvious than that. But even though the damage has been done, Tōbei has the chance to redeem himself and his ""defiled"" wife. It won't be easy, but through dedicated toil, he can regain some of his lost honor.
Genjūrō's transgressions are too heinous for that luxury. He gives himself in to his desires, and for that the apt punishment is exacted upon his wife. Mizoguchi cuts from his and Wakasa's passionate embrace in the sun (""This is exquisite! It's paradise!"") to Miyagi clutching her child in the shadows, watching a woman offscreen screaming for help, as soldiers ransack her house. Genjūrō pledges to be the husband of Lady Wakasa and to stay by her side until the end of time. Miyagi, meanwhile, is set upon by starving soldiers desperate for food, and is stabbed as her son cries, strapped onto the back of the lifeless body of his mother.
To Mizoguchi, war is an inherent evil that exposes the worst sides of men. It is not noble, or justified, or beneficial. Mizoguchi turns simple stories into the ultimate parable of the irredeemable sins that men commit in the pursuit of their ambitions, and a reminder of the importance of selflessness and family, themes which are overt but never preachy. This is also an incredibly beautiful film, with elegant long takes and attractive landscapes. I simply don't think anybody has ever used camera movement so effectively as Mizoguchi does. Quite essentially, I believe Ugetsu is one of the greatest films ever made, and a masterwork not just of the Japanese film industry but of cinema as a whole. And I hope to be watching a lot more Mizoguchi soon.

"As far as ghost stories go, this is a good one, though I’m not sure I’m capable of picking up on the greater nuance of its broader WWII and social context — which means I dug it, but on a more surface level than it was likely intended. 
But what a surface! This is an appropriately ethereal entry that paints its picture of moral and personal decay, how the obsessions of men ruin their lives — and more importantly, the lives of the women that love them.
It’s a great framing device for a ghost story, and helps to argue what a ghost really is in this context. What hangs with us when we let things pass from our world? Who pays the price for our success? What do we mourn? These are hefty questions that I really appreciated having to ask. 
Mizoguchi paints this picture with a hauntingly soft touch, with people often obscured by fog, shadow, wheat, you name it; this is a world of hidden intentions and unseen consequences, and he gets this across with stunning skill. That it’s also wrapped in a soundscape that is distinct and unique enough to drive home that there is something decidedly off at every stage just makes this even more trippy. 
Was I able to pick up on everything it was trying to say within the context of its own telling? No, and while I could tell there was stuff that was whizzing over my head, it didn’t detract from how much I enjoyed what it was doing. This is a quality tale with a lot to say, and is told with great care and skill.",4.0

Within the bewitchingly eerie romantic fantasy Ugetsu (or its less concise English title 'Tales of a Moon Obscured By Rainclouds'), we follow two peasant farmers, one seduced by a tantalising spirit and the other obsessed with becoming a samurai, both preoccupations being detrimental to their families. In my recent review of Sansho the Bailiff, though I highly praised its compassionate storytelling, the frigid framing made me struggle to empathise with the characters' plight - in Ugetsu, gratefully, that issue doesn't exist. The restless camera and fancifully mellow lighting complement the unsettling atmosphere, while the soundscape is brimming with eldritch horror. In one noteworthy example, where the peasants and their families encounter an incapacitated man on their boat journey to Nagahama, one wife sings a poignant melody while rowing. Rich in tone and accompanied by a leisurely, lulling lapping of the water, its abrupt halt is made all the more unnerving by her petrified look off-screen. Exceptional.",4.5

"I'm a little stunned at my underwhelming response to this film.
It's great, but reminds me of a modern film in its fragmented focus and underdeveloped subplots, yet with moments of brilliance.
The shot of our lead sincerely saying ""Paradise!"" against a backdrop of barren, dead trees is highly memorable. It will be forever etched in my memory.
The film feels like a fairy tail for adults. Not just in its fantasy elements, but in its formal story telling features as well.
For a film so lavishly praised as to reach the Sight and Sound top 10 in two concurrent decades (1962,1972) it seemed far less compelling and aesthetically dense when contrasted with every other film on those lists.
Especially interesting is the presence of Ugetsu but the absence of the now ubiquitous Tokyo Story.
This tells me one of two things:
1. An influential critic from the mid-20th century championed the film, carrying it on their back until their diminished presence.
2. It was one of the more widely accessible screenings of an Asian and specifically Japanese film. Perhaps a film like Tokyo Story was circulating less at the time.
If both those conclusions are wrong, then I would be curious to know what was responsible for its critical surge and dissipation.",4.0

"The more of it I watch, and rewatch, the more convinced I am that classic Japanese cinema is the best classical cinema. Take this film: a propulsive piece of storytelling that manages to be visually lyrical, moralistic (but never preachy), gut wrenchingly realistic and ethereally spooky. Like Kobayashi and Kurosawa, watching Mizoguchi never feels like you’re taking in an ‘art film’ in the way (for example) an Antonioni or a Fellini can. His films are, first and foremost, narrative driven - pure entertainment, on a sublime level.
Short plot summary - be careful what you wish for. Two guys in a village in war torn Japan, circa the 1500s, decide to pursue their ambitions (read: egos) at the expense of their long suffering wives. One is a potter, dreaming of wealth: he ends up entrapped by a dead spirit, Lady Wakasa (a classic Japanese wraith, all tippy toes and dreadful smiles) and her (also dead) consort. Meanwhile his spouse and child are waylaid by starving bandits in a truly harrowing sequence.
The other protagonist, Tobei, is ostensibly comic relief - an overreaching buffoon who wants to become a Samurai at all costs. Needless to say, things don’t pan out that funny, as his wife is forced into prostitution after his desertion.
This could be seen as a fable, a cautionary tale; it’s also surprisingly dark for its era. Topics like gang rape are frankly acknowledged - this is a brutal, lawless world, devoid of any societal cohesion. Yet, despite the depths they hit, we never lose touch of the love these couples have for each other; we root for them, despite the husband’s idiocies.
This is a film well deserving of its lofty critical status, it’s just wonderful.",5.0

"After years of creativity, innovation, maturity, and valuable experience, Mizugochi tries to combine surreal fantasies and illusions into the heart of his documentary, realistic, and critical narratives, and how patiently and masterfully he succeeds. The fluid camera, which at first promises us an intangible atmosphere from the past, and the floating boat secene that prepares us more and more for the illusions, are among Mizugochi's most obvious technical and formal leaps in expressing the new look. Adapted from the Ogetsu Monogatari (Tales of Moon and Rain) collection of stories, Ogtsu later became a role model for filmmakers such as Kobayashi and Shindo, inspiring works such as Kwaidan and the Kuroneko in mise-en-scenes and costume design.

It’s impossible to understand that in many ways and places, it’s still like that. The fact that petty conflicts have wasted so many lives and resources throughout human history is truly the greatest mark of our imperfection.
It becomes a pretty spooky tale halfway through, and what better way to welcome the fast-approaching beginning of Halloween season? It’s also about how human beings are scarcely better than bugs in many ways, and yet how some things have never changed. It honestly doesn’t feel too far off from a story you’d see in scriptures, but it’s also better than that, too. Really eerie, mind-boggling stuff.",5.0
"War highlights the divides between people and promotes the class struggle. Wars, even in the 16th century, we’re fought by people who generally had very little stake in the matter. It’s just powerful people sending dispensable people of a lower class to their deaths for the benefit of those in power. War also promotes the idea of nation, and it brainwashes all those who live within a territory into thinking the cause of their nation is an absolute. It shouldn’t be about that. We should be about people, not about nation. I must note that I am not criticizing soldiers and I would generally never do that, as they to are the victims of the class system. Whether they chose to fight for their nation on that notion alone, or if they were forced into it by the notion of free college. I know this is a Japanese film made in direct response to World War 2, but it’s themes can be applied elsewhere. How much longer is the United States going to spend six hundred billion dollars on war and weapons of mass destruction, when a good portion of that money can be put back into the people of this country? Why is it that the leaders of my country only value nation and not the people that nation is comprised of?

Mizoguchi trace ici un portrait de la gente masculine en proie à une cupidité dévastatrice, déferlant avec puissance en une odyssée durant laquelle l’évocation de leur maux se transcendera par l’utilisation d’un fil corrélatif entre la réalité, synonyme de la souffrance infligée bien présente, et une dimension fantaisiste, qui se révèlera grande servante de la condition féminine, première victime des choix et actes accomplis par l’homme, ici en l’image des deux Maris. Si l’un est obsédé par un objectif de pouvoir symbolisé par l’imposance du statut de samouraï, et l’autre totalement obnubilé par sa réussite professionnelle, les femmes seront elles dépeintes, avec un rapport mémorable à la nuance de la part du cinéaste, comme les annonciatrices d’une funeste fatalité. Par nul autre raison qu’un amour et un dévouement cru envers leur conjoint, elles tenteront de les retenir, de les raisonner, en vain. C’est lorsque l’atteinte de l’objectif se proclame donc que le reflet d’une noirceur intérieur ressurgit, comme ayant enfin pu faire exploser les barrières qui eurent conduit le regard des deux hommes à une étroitesse de vision.

"Fascinating in how it presents each character as morally ambiguous, no character at any point in the film is entirely justified or entirely misled. Ohama strongly rejects her husband going to war and seeking out honor for the sake of her family's wellbeing. Tobei wants to go to war to experience the thrills of life, to travel and see Japan as opposed to remaining stagnant in his farming village. Miyagi is short-sighted and does not see the need for her husband to go to the city to sell his wares, for she too wants to keep her family intact. Genjuro, greedy as he is, wants nothing more than for his family to live in moderate wealth, to not need to worry about the basics of life -- yet he is chained down by aspirations for more and more as he spends time with Lady Wakasa and experiences what the life of the rich is really like.
I don't think the ending is clear at all. In certain ways characters are redeemed, in others not so much.

"Tales of Ugetsu, Or: Chastising the Smallholder
This is a movie about two smallholders in feudal Japan, Genjuro and Tobei, and their wives as their world is torn asunder by civil war.
Although both men could probably be classified as poor-to-medium peasants (they own a little land and have small but cozy houses) they aspire to much more. Genjuro is constantly improving his pottery designs and searching for more lucrative markets to sell it in. When pottery season is on the man almost never leaves his wheel and kin. Tobei has the somewhat more unreasonable dream of becoming a powerful samurai warrior. He trips over his own feet all the time but is convinced getting an expensive suit of armor and spear will transform his humble station.
They inhabit an extremely precarious world. Feuding daimyo (wealthy lords) constantly ravage the villages of Japan. Their samurai burn houses, force men into corvee labor, destroy personal possessions, gobble up food, and rape women. Any preconceived notions of samurai as Honorable Warriors are put to rest. They are callous brutes who leech off the poor peasants and do no productive labor themselves.
In the midst of the latest raid, Genjuro, Tobei, and their wives flee into the woods with other villagers. It is an eerie place, but at least they have each other.
They decide to journey to a market town by crossing a mist-enveloped lake. In the movie's first great scene, we feel like we're crossing the River Styx as the fog caresses our characters with ghostly fingers and an unseen woman sings a haunting refrain. The score kicks in and it is incredible; harps and flutes over a dirge-like drum that feels like it is a millennia old.
At the market town, Genjuro and Tobei's paths diverge.
Genjuro's pottery sells well. One day he is approached by a noblewoman and her handmaiden. Immediately things feel like a fantasy. They want to buy his pottery and invite Genjuro to their resplendent manor. When would this ever happen in reality? When would the landholding elite reach down to this lowly commoner and pluck him out of obscurity?
The scenes in the manor are exactly what a smallholder would fantasize about. He's waited on hand and foot, drinks the finest sake, and gets to marry the eerily beautiful Lady Wakasa. There is a terrifying undertone of doom and dread also, but Genjuro is too taken with his luxurious surroundings to notice. This is a man so taken with his dream he fails to notice he's romancing a corpse.
Across town, Tobei steals the severed head of a general and presents it to another general who currently has his. In exchange for the head, Tobei is granted wealthy samurai status. He suddenly has the finest armor, a retinue of soldiers under him, a great steed to ride through town, and every tavern in town is at his feet, begging to have him and his men drink and screw there for the evening. Everything seems great until he makes a shocking discovery: his wife is working at the tavern now as a geisha, ""defiling"" herself on a nightly basis. Tobei, highly distraught, promises to buy back her honor.
Eventually Genjuro realizes his new friends are ghosts and the resplendent manor is a heap of charred rubble. With a level of audicity I did not expect, there is a sort of exorcism/spiritual struggle that is violent, frightening, and necessary. He manages to leave this perverted spirit world and return to reality.
Genjuro and Tobei return to their home village, throughly chastened for trying to rise above their station. Tobei tosses his fancy armor into a river. Genjuro pledges to work harder than ever, but without any desire to improve his standard of living. Balance has returned to the world, which is (supposedly) a good thing.
This film is based on stories by Ueda Akinari, a wealthy merchant/author who absolutely reflects the biases of his class. Akinari's anxieties surrounding social mobility and the inherent foolishness of the poor peasantry are abhorrent, but also have created great art.

"phillip lopate's essay on this tower of world cinema discusses the possibility of mizoguchi's endlessly moving, detached camera to be somewhat like the ghosts it depicts throughout its runtime. ugetsu isn't quite the dreamlike piece (though the iconic shot between the spring and the picnic..you know the one, comes very close) that the last movie I saw (flowers of shanghai) is, but nonetheless there is an air of floatiness to it. the lake scene, another of the more memorable sequences of this movie, is as close as we get to pure surrealism. otherwise, mizoguchi takes an interesting approach at bringing a ghostly view to what is otherwise a very realistically told story. the scenes don't have too heightened of a fantasy/surrealism edge to them, and the whole of the film is kept fairly easy to follow. it was lovely after watching the ascent to see another war movie where common people are affected by war, though this is of course *the* subject of this movie (opposed to the ascent, which has more depictions). despite its WWII roots, the movie does a fantastic job of being timeless, and it's nice to see that Mizoguchi's ideals haven't really aged in terms of Japanese society and the commentary that comes with it. I would argue too that this movie is one of the more perfectly paced ever made...the 97 minutes absolutely flies by, and I feel every single scene, every single shot is integral to the whole of the film. the subplot, though ideally for comic relief, ends up adding necessary balance to what would be an otherwise extremely bleak story, while at the same time feeling appropriate for commentary within japanese society.

"Having watched Ugetsu, I am left wondering if the narrative has underlying Buddhist themes, centered around what is known in Indic religions as dharma (duty). The concept of dharma may be reflected in Buddhism by the truths. Grief (dukkha) is intrinsic to human existence, originating from desire and attachment (trishna). To escape from the origin one has to give up their trishna.
The men in this film have both abandoned their duty to their family. Ignoring the warnings and driven by their greed, they both lead themselves and their family to disaster. Their repentance comes only through grief and upon giving up their greed. Say, throwing away the armour and giving up the madness of profiting from war. I am unsure, however, if this may be correct reading of the narrative. But this has stayed with me.

"I knew this would happen.
I have recently seen ""The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum"" and proclaimed it to be ""the"" film I would have liked to make as my magnum opus before I die. Then I saw ""Ugetsu"" yesterday and it proved to be even more thoughtful and profound. The usual Mizoguchi's topics transcend the regular spatial and temporal confinements and the film that could be classified as a drama with the elements of fantasy transforms into a spiritual horror film before our very eyes (not in a conventional sense, but it is more horrific than many so-called horror films). Everything comes together so naturally that you can only watch it unfold and wonder how can it be so perfect (provided that you appreciate this director's aesthetics). I don't want to spoil the experience by talking about the plot and the story in general, you need to draw your own conclusion (nothing too complicated, this is not a David Lynch film, but it is rich and complex when it comes to the topics, concepts and ideas it covers). It is almost redundant to talk about the quality of direction and acting when almost every frame has a soul of its own. One of the most mature films I have ever seen and definitely a top-100 material (maybe even top 50).",5.0

"""El éxito siempre tiene un precio y lo pagamos con sufrimiento"".
Siguiendo con mi constelación de cinco estrellas (algo que en una futura bio justificaré pues a muchos no le sienta muy bien que ""sobrecalifique"" ciertos títulos), me toca hablar de otro clásico de Kenji Mizoguchi, el cual no pensaba revisar hoy, pero me resultaba insultante dejar de lado a la que considero mi película favorita de uno de los genios de la era dorada del cine nipón.
Eran épocas de guerra y apenas salir de tu metro cuadrado resultaba o ser asaltado o, en el peor de los casos, asesinado por estas tropas conformadas en su mayoría por gente fascinerosa y cruel. En una pequeña aldea, habitan Genjuro quien es un fabricante de vasijas que recibe la ayuda de su esposa, Miyagi; y Tobei, quien embebido por las historias de guerra en donde los samurais se alzaban como grandes figuras de respeto y honor, desea a toda costa convertirse en uno de ellos ante la desesperada negativa de su esposa, Ohama.
El deseo de Genjuro por prosperar en medio de una guerra sanguinaria y la obsesión de Tobei por ser un guerrero samurai serán los móviles de esta historia en donde la ambición de una u otra forma se termina pagando muy caro. A diferencia de Sansho y Oharu, Ugetsu es una leyenda, un relato fantástico el cual Mizoguchi ambienta muy bien, sin necesidad de efectos prácticos ni artificios sofisticados, el escenario y la música hacen los suyo, es muy notable la escena en donde la princesa Wakasa le canta a Genjuro dentro de sus lujosos aposentos mientras poco a poco la escena se vuelve más pesada y perturbadora en el contexto del relato, una vez más Mizoguchi muestra la tragedia entre líneas, sin mostrarla y, a propósito de aquello, la escena del rencuentro al final es otro momentazo de esta preciosa pieza de cine, que dicho sea de paso, es una de las favoritas de Martin Scorsese.
No se puede recomendar más este clásico, que es una de las películas ideales para comenzar a conocer parte de la filmografía de Kenji Mizoguchi.",5.0

Anyway. Loved Machiko Kyō in this, as in Rashomon before. Some splendid pictures, nice music and a wonderfully told story with supernatural elements. This was great.",4.5
"At first I thought these elements combined would make this film fit right in with Kurosawa’s filmography. But as it went on, it was clear that this is more like if Kurosawa:
-couldn’t write a screenplay that established the world properly or elicited anything other than mild disinterested pity for its characters
-was a lot more sexist
-didn’t know how to pace a film
-often didn’t light his set sufficiently (to be fair, this might have been HBO Max’s issue, not the director’s)
Full disclosure: it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine when a filmmaker intends to include supernatural elements in their film, but does not signal, even tonally, that the story is set in a heightened, supernatural reality at the beginning. For me to believe all the ghost stuff that this takes almost half its runtime to get to, there should have been at minimum an air of mystery at the start. Instead it’s mundane and grounded.",2.0

"While Street of Shame remains my favorite so far on my Mizoguchi journey, I literally just finished watching Ugetsu and... I am impressed.
Kazuo Miyagawa's work is amazing once again, his camera work and light are incredible, they instantly give an eerie look to the film. All the scenes at Lady Wakama's house are so well framed it feels dreamy (as it should). Mizoguchi's direction is not as theatrical for a jidaigeki (thank you) as other movies of that time. It's so subtle and that honestly was making me wish for MORE while watching but when I got to the ending.... I just went full on ""bruh"".
What a brutal, ""show don't tell"" ending.
I must also add the soundtrack is INCREDIBLE. Ugetsu would definitely not be as creepy as it is without it! The piano track with the little chimes and strings next to the more traditional shamisen track is a 10/10. The Geza/Kabuki bits? Perfectly well placed.
The parallels to Japan's imperialism and war crimes on WW2 are quite evident, in my opinion. Don't wanna spoil, but Ohama's plot is remiscent of the war crimes the japanese military committed on women. Brutality may not be depicted on a graphic way on the raid scenes, but you can FEEL it.
This is clearly an anti war film, a film about how greed and power can literally tear your life apart. How looking for a better life and falling into selfishness is an essential part of the human condition. Although the story is set in Japan's Medieval age (Azuchi - Momoyama period) , Mizoguchi's adaptation of tale could have been be written into any context, old or modern. Why? Because his cinema is about people... this is not just your regular ghost jidaigeki.",4.5
"First off, this is a feast for the eye. This film is more atmospheric than 90% of any film ever made. And every frame a painting is a worthy description for this beautiful cinematic achievement. This film follows a simple story of action, consequences and morals. But the effortlessness in which Mizoguchi entangled the mystical and the mundane is fascinating. Where dream slips in and out of reality. Very surreal, mildly Lynchian for 1953 indeed. But to be precise there are scenes and moments that left a more powerful impact on me than the whole movie.",4.0
"Ugetsu is a unique ghost story in that it’s more of a supernatural tragedy than a typical paranormal horror movie that we as Western audiences are used to. Ghosts are involved, but they’re more of an extension of our characters greed and pride, there to lead them astray or on the opposite end, stay with them as a watcher.
I also appreciate despite our deeply flawed characters, corrupted by greed and ambition, Kenji Mizoguchi portrays redemption and hope at the end, through a delirious narrative.
 Mizoguchi utilizes an eerie soundtrack and a hazy, sweeping camera (courtesy of cinematographer extraordinaire Kazuo Miyagawa) to create an off-kilter feeling throughout the film.
The film portrays essential truths to humanity’s greed, the ravages of war, the pride of men and the plight of women.

"Letterboxd 5th Season Challenge - Week 30: April 12-18 - Theme - Lists - Martin Scorsese's Film School
This week’s challenge theme was to watch a film from Scorsese’s must watch film list. Easy to see why he thinks do highly of UGETSU. In fact, Scorsese was involved in the restoration of this film. So, good on him. 
My big takeaway from UGETSU is that it oozes atmosphere. This film has a perfect blend of visuals and music, all perfectly communicating the mood, whether it be happiness, or fear, or, most frequently, an unending sense of impending doom. The scene of the boats on the misty lake might one of the most perfect film sequences I have ever seen. But there are many, many sequences that are just as great. The care and attention to detail that obviously went into this film is quite obvious. The story is an interesting one. Basically a Japanese foundational legend and morality tale about greed and family. Very ably acted by all involved. UGETSU is a great example of filmmaking as a true art form.",5.0
"It's odd to watch this film expecting a supernatural horror film because those elements don't appear until the latter half of the film, although there's a slightly uncanny sense created all the way through. It sets its 16th century scene amongst some poor villagers, one of whom (Masayuki Mori) is a potter who is desperate to make money in the local town from selling his wares, having discerned that people seem to be paying more in a time of impending war, while the other wants to be a samurai but is rejected by the local clans for being a poor peasant. When the civil war comes to their very doorstep, they flee with the pottery, intending to make money across the water. But as the action moves across this mist-covered body of water, the film moves from the real world into a sort of supernatural state, where the dead and living seem to interact, as previously strong family bonds fall apart under the influence of money mingled with the desperation of a wartime economy. As such it seems to be a reflection not just on the corrosive power of capital, but on wartime avarice leading to self-destruction, the break-up of the family and ultimately death -- which makes sense given when it was made.",4.0
[said like Uncut Gems] Unfired kilns,5.0
"Films with moral lessons that revolve around characters who are one way (or who make specific choices) in the beginning recognizing the lessons they need to learn and becoming a different person by the end, abound. Some of these stories can feel too familiar, even if they are well told. The best ones have a way of making these stories feel timeless. The most exceptional ones find a way of making this feel both timeless and unexpected.
Ugetsu falls in the latter category.
Kenji Mizoguchi is clearly a seasoned Director, and his command of the screen, both visually and narratively is both obvious and impressive. He has a tendency to do long cuts with an emphasis on narrative structure, which really helps when it comes to telling a story in a straight ahead fashion. Every scene has its place, which each scene giving us the necessary information to move the story forward in a linear fashion.
The story itself blends mysticism and spirituality in with its naturalistic setting. This is done on a thematic level, but more striking is the way the Director does this on a visual level, evoking these subtle shifts in tone through stage and structure as opposed to effect. The soundtrack plays a vital role in bringing these aspects together as well, fluctuating between haunting, chaotic, hopeful and romantic, creating a wonderful fusion of aesthetic.
Entrenched in Japanese culture in a way that shows true passion and care, the moral tale in Ugetsu is ultimately a cautionary one. It is about the temptations of this world, namely the misguided chase for money, security and success, and how these temptations can blind us to what is most important by consuming our mind, heart and soul. And it is about the impact the way we live our lives can have on others around us, where our choices of worldly pursuit can lead to and ignore the suffering of others.
Perhaps most compelling in Ugetsu is the idea that these choices also have a spiritual component and concern. It's the spiritual concern that guides and informs the humanistic concern, giving the moral lesson a necessary foundation for which to interpret and see it through, weaving through some powerful pictures of opportunity and regret that can carry through our lives and inform our connection to the spirit world (and the great Other). It's a reminder that these things that battle for our attention and battle for our allegiances in the every day are often unseen forces, and that these moral lessons, when framed as spiritual awakening, is about these unseen forces being made visible and recognizable, especially in the power afforded to us for resistance and reform.",4.5
"Really liked the music and when the movie could be surreal and “kinda creepy” I did like it a lot. Was bothered by a couple of things like pacing, acting, and wasn’t a huge fan of the story itself. 
I’ve seen people say this is beautiful and a masterpiece of cinema. I just think it’s good. By no means bad, I guess I’m just not a fan. Still liked more than disliked though and I do respect it a lot. May not be my most favorite movie I’ve ever seen but hey, can’t say I regret watching it.",3.5
"I love this. I really like his film Sansho the Baliff. It was my favourite film to analyse when I was a student. I gained an appreciation for the themes and expressions for them.
Likewise, this film touches on similar themes. We have the horrors of war. In particular, we see (in various ways) how women are screwed over by this.
However, it also shows the main men being selfish. Even abandoning their families (during war.. war!!). This is at a time where many other men are being literally dragged away from their families for forced labour. But they decidedly abandon them due to greed within their dreams, essentially.
It kind of becomes a Twilight Zone episode. One of these ""be careful what you wish for"" tales.
Look at the bigger picture, and consider your loved ones. Don't let money or your genitals be the main controlling force of your important decision-making.
Fantastic.
As always, Machiko Kyo is great.

"Another beautiful film from Kenjo Mizoguchi, yet again focused on the importance of family but from the angle of greed and ambition. It can best be compared to Akira Kurosawa’s ‘Throne of Blood’ in my opinion due to the fact that it is a mysterious ghost tale and considers similar themes. As I raved on about in my review of Mizoguchi’s other well known film Sansho the Bailiff, the cinematography is truly remarkable and it’s the same here. The score is effective, the performances always remain grounded despite the happenings around them which keeps it in touch with the folklore it is supposedly based on. At times I felt the film rushed through itself a little bit, that may just be the way Mizoguchi does his films. Ugetsu is another great film from another Japanese master and its influence in gaining traction for Japanese cinema in the west is no surprise.",3.5

"School essay:
Ugetsu is a ghost story set in the 1500s of feudal Japan, following a group of peasant farmers navigating their lives and ambition during a time of war. The real value of this story isn’t the fantastical elements, like the ghosts or the dramatic setting of wartime, it is the exploration of humanity and our weaknesses. The theme of man’s self-destructive nature and the effect it has, are presented through the trials and tribulations of Genjuro, Myagi, Tobei, and Ohama. Kenji Mizoguchi, the director of the film, uses heightened fantastical elements, like ghosts, to tell a complex narrative about complex people. Whether it be the price people pay for success or the delusion of grandeur that distracts us from our responsibilities, the film tackles core human flaws and instincts.
Genjuro, the main protagonist, has the biggest responsibilities of all the characters. He must provide for his wife and son in a time of war and desperation. Needing more money to support his family, he focused on selling pottery with the intention to take advantage of the war for profit. As he earned more money for his pottery as it became more popular, he was overcome with greed and pride. Greed and pride are two of the seven deadly sins, a grouping of vices in the Christian religion. The seven deadly sins, to me, represent the core weaknesses and flaws of human beings. Pride, greed, lust, envy, wrath, gluttony, and sloth are the traits that have led to evil actions like wars, tragedies, betrayals, and oppression. These seven deadly sins lie in all of us; no matter who you are, you have the capability to commit any of those sins. No matter how small or large those sinful actions are, they have an effect on the world and everyone in your life. Genjuro learned the effect of his sins firsthand.
Being consumed by his pride and greed, Genjuro left his wife (Myagi) and child (Gen'ichi) alone during an intense conflict to make money for them. He convinced himself that he did it to help his family, rather than realizing that he was doing it out of selfishness. Genjuro’s sins made him susceptible to a seductive ghost of a noblewoman (Lady Wakasa). She used his greed and pride to draw him to her mansion. Her wealth appealed to his greed and her admiration for his pottery appealed to his pride. Genjuro then was being driven by his lust for Lady Wakasa, which led to him accepting her marriage proposal. He was living in a dream when he was with Lady Wakasa, while in reality Myagi and his child were left to fend for themselves back in his village. Myagi alone had to protect her child as they were surrounded by pillaging soldiers. She and Gen’ichi abandoned their home with a small amount of food. A group of starving soldiers stole the little food she had and stabbed and killed her when she tried to fight back.
Genjuro’s assistant (Tobei) dreams of becoming a samurai. His social status and being a poor farmer makes it extremely difficult for anyone to take him seriously in his pursuits. His wife (Ohama) tries to convince him how pointless and foolish his dream is. Tobei’s obsession with becoming a samurai is an example of one of the seven deadly sins, envy. Tobei is envious of samurais because of the respect and admiration they receive. He is controlled by his insecurities due to being viewed as a peasant who has never had to fight. He grovels to other samurai, begging to be accepted as an equal. He is so stricken by his envy, that he abandons his wife at a market to spend their hard-earned money on armor. Tobei spends the little money he has in a desperate move to be recognized as a man. Leaving his wife all by herself in his pursuit to become a samurai, she searches for him on the outskirts of the city. She is defenseless when she came across a group of soldiers, so they kidnap her and rape her.
A big part of being human is making mistakes and suffering the consequences of those mistakes. We as people grow and learn when we understand the effect of our actions. Genjuro’s greed, pride, and lust led to his helpless wife being murdered. Tobei’s envy led to his wife being assaulted and raped. Their mistakes and indulgences were followed by grave consequences. Even given their disgraceful and shameful behavior, Genjuro and Tobei are not evil men; they are human. They were both overwhelmed by their weaknesses and were not strong enough to resist. They learned from the dark realities of their actions. Tobei gave up his dream of being a samurai and committed himself to care and provide for Ohama. Genjuro realizes the result of his greed and understands that his main priority and responsibility is to support Gen’ichi. Mizoguchi does not just tell a story about ghosts and war, he tells a story about the human condition and the tragedies our sins lead to.",5.0

"A sort of bleak but also kind of not as bleak towards the end Japanese film with a welcomed element of the supernatural. Although I wasn't the biggest fan of this film and felt there could be a bit more included I appreciated its subtlety and reliance on atmosphere. This is a cautionary tale about a man's pursuit of money and power and how a selfish and greedy pursuit of this may lead to the loss of loved ones.
I thought the thing this movie did best was use atmosphere quite well. I loved the fogginess of everything after the main characters left the village after a raid from samurai. I also especially loved the haunting surrealism of the palace of Lady Wakasa. While the main guys (Genjuro and Tobei) are completely selfish and greedy throughout the movie you end up still feeling quite sorry for them and the misfortunes that surround them. I loved the sense of closure that came with the end of this movie as well. The score was also quite good and really added a lot to the haunting atmosphere throughout.
There was still a sense of something missing from this movie that leaves me with the lower score. Although it may have been my expectations of more supernatural aspects. I've seen a lot of reviews saying that it's a movie you look back on and end up liking a lot better in retrospect. I certainly plan on getting the Criterion Blu-ray edition and giving this a few rewatches to perhaps grow a more positive opinion of Ugetsu because it's a movie I can definitely picture myself loving. I also plan on catching more films by Kenji Mizoguchi to better grasp his style and maybe appreciate it more because I definitely love the way he uses atmosphere.",3.5

"I was originally gonna give this movie closer to an 8/10, but then Monica and I discussed it for almost our entire 30 minute drive home.
During that discussion, I realized how much was going on here and just how much of it I liked.
I also realized that I think I hate endings. I'm almost always dissatisfied with how a film ends and this one is no exception. Still great up until those last few minutes, though, and there's some really masterful camerawork on display throughout.

Week 3 - From Season’s Past: Cahiers du Cinéma Week
Picked a Cahiers du Cinema favourite, and one I had had on my watchlist for a while. I tend to put off Japanese cinema's elder statesman, since the drama tends to be quite heavy. All I knew about it was that it was a ghost story, but leave it Mizoguchi to make the most depressing supernatural tale I've ever seen.
It (eventually) slips into ghostly from realist quite easily, but never strays far from the outright misery of wartime. Mizoguchi of course maintains his usual theme of women suffering, and here it's the women who pay for everything when the husbands suddenly get ambitious when times get unstable.
The gliding camera provides some stunning shots, including a brilliantly conceived 360 shot near the end that I needed to rewind and watch again.",4.0

"La separazione, la creazione e la lotta coi fantasmi.",4.5
"I found this a thoroughly unenjoyable watch in the same vein as Bicycle Thieves, but they're both well made and important so I won't skew my rating towards the lower end either. 
Ugetsu is painfully melodramatic and mindnumbingly slow, likely because characters show proof of life once every half hour or so. The film also shows a strong influence from traditional Japanese theatre, which definitely explains why the story is told exactly the way it is. 

Reading a bit about Mizoguchi's life, it definitely seems as though the themes in this movie are a heavy projection of his own early life, in which his father's attempts at chasing profits in wartime ended in disaster. Yet characters feel so one-dimensional that it's hard to feel any sort of sympathy for people walking down a set path just 'cuz, rather than a more organic arc. It's likely just a carry-over from Japanese theatre above all else, but imho it was an aspect that didn't age very well.

I could say something about the military industrial complex or mother courage and her children, but in the end I just found this plain excruciating. I'm glad to get a classic out of the way, but unfortunately I don't think I'm very eager to pour through Mizoguchi's filmography.",3.0
"A slow-brewed ghost story which brings Mizoguchi’s masterful dramatic and visual skills to a folktale-like story of greed and its powerful sway on men where Mizoguchi’s interest in women’s stories brings a thematic cohesiveness to the tales of two families brought to the edges of despair and pain by the draw of money and reputation on the men of the families. Here the concern returns to one Mizoguchi would consider many times over, women’s existence and survival in a patriarchal worl at the whims of selfish men. Setting this story at a point of societal upheaval in Japan’s history, the stakes are more pronounced as war brings an ever-present danger, yet the women’s suffering is all too familiar, forced to sacrifice and suffer for their husbands, fall victim to lustful men, destitution, and violence. 
While the film only belatedly introduces the truly fantastical elements of its ghost story, Mizoguchi’s direction imbues the film with an intense atmosphere through the use of subtly refined technique--the slow panning camera that opens the film and whose motion will continue to set an inevitable flow to the story, the mystical fog which enshrouds a boat floating down a river and the ominous song that accompanies the boat--to lend the film a fable-like quality which pushes it ever closer to the metaphysical and paves the way for the finale as Mizoguchi opens the floodgates of the surreal and mysterious.",5.0

Such a great story about the emptiness of materialistic ambitions and how selfish desires can inevitably end tragically. Overall to me this film is about soul searching. It has this feeling of sad hopefulness that left me in tears.,5.0
"This belongs to a specific style of postwar social realism infused Japanes ghost story.

"Saw it at the TIFF Bell Lightbox.
I was taken by surprise by this one for sure. It started off in a way that I enjoyed but didn't love. As it went along and the film started to establish some major conflicts and drama, it kept getting better and better.
I absolutely love where the film went with the characters and all of the dramatic elements, on top of the fact that it's a gorgeously shot film. Crane shots and other elements give the cinematography an almost modern feeling.
My only complaint was that the ending includes some final scenes that, while maybe not giving it a ""happy"" ending, do tie up some of the more depressing plot elements in a way that take away from that fact that they are quite devastating. That might be more based on my own personal taste, but I also saw a little trivia thing on IMDB that suggests the studio forced the director to add in these more positive elements to the end so maybe the original intent was actually closer to what I wanted to see.",4.5
"The war drove us mad with ambition.
A letdown, considering the prestige. I had nothing really to connect with. The screening was preceded by some introduction where the presenter dismissed an early American critic's assessment of the movie as 'vague' and determined us to prove them wrong. Unfortunately, she might have had the opposite effect on me. Had she not mentioned his critique I might have never had the word 'vague' in my mind, but there it was and it described what I saw perfectly.
Filmed rather plainly, I wasn't moved by even the famous boat sequence, though the fog was really cool. The film's 'painterly' quality was a neat enough piece of information, but was trivial to the film. The twin stories of greed, war and lacking respect for marital duties were apparently adapted from Japanese ghost stories. The themes were interesting and the final act's deceptive ways of making us question what is being presented were effective and haunting. I wish the 'ghost' stuff came in earlier because most of the film felt like a typical morality play with a strong A-plot and a B-plot that simply detracts from the movie's focus. By the time we enter the supernatural it was a bit of a surprise to me. Largely, the film is about two men in the lowest ranks of society, displaced by civil war, but both become opportunists when the chance for a superior life comes knocking, even though it means abandoning their families in the process. The story is a clear moralistic fable, we know that karma will come around and sting these two men whose lust for luxury betrays their obligations. And yet it doesn't condemn or criticize these men whose lives are such struggle that it is only natural that they will cling and claw for any sliver of hope of paradise. The depiction of the wives as survivors and victims felt particularly progressive as well, especially for a film set in such a period. These two points are the film's greatest strengths. I still found it too simple and plainly told, until the final act anyway.
Kenji Mizoguchi is clearly a filmmaker's filmmaker with UGETSU being credited as personal favourite for Andrei Tarkovsky and Martin Scorsese amongst others. Kenji's patient method of storytelling and mastery of moving the camera to capture a whole long take with relatively few cuts show his mastery of the form. I had previously thought Kurosawa was alone in his amazing ability to control movement and composition, it seems to be more widespread amongst Japanese filmmakers than I thought. Still, I wish UGETSU was more than just a sea of fog for me.",3.5
"Film School Drop Outs 2018 - Week 12 - (2018) - Auteurs - Kenji Mizoguchi
A perfectly twisted fairytale of greed and seduction told through two parallel stories, each heartbreaking and terrifying in their own right. The film is like pottery. It starts out blunt and raw, each character unrefined and direct in their motives. This is the part where not much quality is visible, but potential is present. As the film becomes more sculpted, it grows more effective as the characters' backward goals become more concrete, and each character must sacrifice their family for the sake of something dim and material. As the firey repercussions of their actions burn each lead, the film feels complete and utterly stunning.
The film starts off feeling so cold. Symbolist, like an old fairytale with one-dimensional characters and a simple lesson in the end. Well, they learn their lesson all right, but in a way that is somehow more close to home than any Grimm fairy tale can muster. With expressive, old-fashioned performances, a beautiful score, and some amazing (dare I say noir) cinematography, the film treads rather clunkily through two stories. So smart and well informed were these stories, influenced by the honey-like poison of Sunset Boulevard, alongside a more simple, humanist heartbreak. This is a smart movie, and I have already wasted far too many uninformed words on it.
This film is a perfect example of a movie being literary in its storytelling while unmistakenly filmic in its style.",4.5
"Gorgeous cinematography and great performances. After being wholly absorbed for the first half or so I found myself emotionally checking out soon after Genjuro takes up with the noble woman; this might be because the characters I felt the most empathy for and had the most interest in- Miyagi and Ohama- were more or less absent. That aside, still very good as a whole and the closing shot was incredibly effective.",3.5

"“Contos da Lua Vaga” é considerada o maior filme de Kenji Mizoguchi, sua obra-prima. E de fato é. E eu não sei onde eu estava que não sabia da existência dessa pérola.
Poucas vezes um filme explicitou tão bem o que disse o filósofo Aristóteles sobre o vício, a ver:
“O vício é a desaprovação de uma atitude que significa falha ou defeito frente aos valores vigentes de uma determinada sociedade e também é externada individualmente”
Exemplifica o preço que se paga pela ambição, egoísmo, avareza, inveja, vaidade e os caminhos errados que conduzem à perdição de um homem. Misturando realidade com fantasia, Mizoguchi conta duas histórias de infortúnios de maneira magistral. Como nunca é demais lembrar seu domínio da misé en scène, somos presenteadas com lindas tomadas em travelling (a grosso modo: aquela viagem que a câmera faz pelo espaço físico), fotografia orgânica e o uso quase ininterrupto do som. 
O peso do roteiro, a história dos dois casais e a representação feminina como fio condutor torna o filme um deleite para os olhos, ouvidos e mente.",5.0

"Thus completes my viewing of Martin Scorsese's top 10 list in the 2012 Sight and Sound poll. Scorsese's picks run the gamut from ""eh"" to superb. One film, The Red Shoes, is my favorite film of all time. Vertigo and 8 1/2 are both in my top 100. Then there are films like Paisan and The River, which are full and good films, but only dance around the surface of my attention. Ugetsu is one of these. Reading it like a short story, it evokes a metaphorical nod from me, thinking ""Hm, interesting"", but never actually connecting.
Of Paisan and The River, I'm inclined to blame the filmmaking as the storylines of harsh, cynical battle and unrequited/repressed passion are areas of my particular interest. With Ugetsu, a fable whose concern is strictly academic as far as I'm concerned--I am in no danger of overzealous ambition--is told with a staid hand (even as the plot enters the highly taboo) and no humor that I could discern. But it's in my brain now and I'm not upset about that.",2.0
"Having seen this several times, I was most struck this time by the ""wedding"" scene in which the lord's ghost sings while Lady Wakasa, who has traveled back to the boundary of the living as corporeal ghost to find a husband, explains that he is dead and conveys his joy to Genjuro. Unlike Wakasa, the lord is invisible (his helmet and faceplate are seen in the alcove). Only his song arrives at the manor, which is a sort of middle ground between the dead and the living realms. From the living perspective, Genjuro betrayed his wife, but the ghosts don't care about that and are ticked off when he breaks his vow to Wakasa. The layering of living and dead realms is not unique in Japanese cinema, but the singing dad ghost is next level. With Ugetsu or Personal Shopper or Kiyoshi Kurosawa as points of reference, more films should get in on that multilayer corporeal ghost cross-realm action.",4.5

"Brain is mush from this + Kiss Me Deadly back to back so this is mostly just a freewheeling collection of notes.
Forgot just how upsetting (and how damn good) this thing is. Lots of stuff in here, especially felt this one current of class through it but don't exactly know where it ended up there. Tried to pay close attention to the stuff in the mansion, which on first viewing stood my hair on end though I was never sure exactly why. Yes Mizoguchi's lighting is (as always) amazing, but I think it may be so creepy/unusual because it's a sudden shift in milieu. We've been trained to look at a working class/rural aesthetic so looking at this kind of palace is odd within the context of the film itself (even beyond the creepily half-broken wood in the door). Also that every member of upper classes in this movie is either a murderous samurai or a demon. Though ultimately I'm not quite sure where it lies there (smarter and more class-minded people than me can sort that out). It might be a little easy/heavy-handed with its moral tale re: greed and blind ambition, and a bit weaker in the subplot (if you're tired of ""ruined women"" plots... yeah this is gonna grate), but so overflowing emotionally and formally where it really needs to be that it doesn't bother me much. Miyagi's death and her ""return"" are both stunning shots, though her death is the one that faded from my mind until now. The image of her falling, then attempting to stand - with a child crying on her back the whole time - while her murderers just dick around in a rice paddy... that's gonna stick with me.",5.0
"Haunting and moving, but it's saddled by a somewhat hard-to-swallow message about class complacency. I suppose the intended theme here might have something to do with the fleeting nature of happiness, but the ending voiceover with its speech about the joys of being peasant makes it tough to see such a generalized message. Besides that complaint, a pleasure. The pacing is excellent, the varied stories all well-acted and morally compelling, and the imagery is spellbinding.",4.0

"Though this is, in a way, typical [partly] mystical Japanese storytelling, there are definitely elements that set it apart. The main story involves a peasant named Genjuro, who is a potter. He has a real drive to succeed and even risks being caught in a raid to finish a batch of pottery. While selling his wares, he meets an unusual young lady and her mother, and that's where the mystical element begins, and is what the story/movie is known for...
However!
...there is also the plot involving Genjuro's neighbor and co-worker Tobei, who is obsessed with becoming a samurai, knowing the better life and glory that could potentially bring. His scheming and greed do lead him to become a samurai, but at what price? The secondary storyline actually gets almost as much play as the main one, which is somewhat unusual when you're trying to set up a mystical theme and your secondary one has none of that at all. I dunno, it just felt different, in a good way.

I certainly don't mind my expectations being challenged, but I didn't really feel that what I got instead wholly held my interest.  Just a lot of setup for the events that occurred later in the film.

"I suppose I liked this well enough, but at this point movies that are scoring sixes and sevens aren't cutting the mustard. In the past two months, I've only given out two scores of an eight or higher for BOOK movies and only one ten all year, to a BOOK movie (""Scarface""). Sure, I may just be getting to picky for my britches, but it seems that my goal to save nothing but greatness for the final 100 was unsuccessful. Instead, I've loaded the final 100 with heaps of mediocrity and Ugetsu falls into that category. I'm usually not one for fantastical elements in my films, but I suppose it worked here to mild success. I dug the few twists that were strategically placed throughout the film - one where we learn that Lady Wakasa is actually a spirit and the other when we learn that Miyagi is dead.
Perhaps one of the saddest moments I can remember in recent memory to come out of a BOOK movie was the revelation that Miyagi was deceased. When Genjuro finally makes his way back to his family, it's a sweet moment. She tells him she doesn't care where he's been, only that he's safe and he seems genuinely happy to see her again. Not only has he just had an affair, but he learns that his mistress was a ghost. He's scared & confused and it's Miyagi who puts him at ease. Only for us to learn the next morning, that Miyagi has been dead and that Genjuro's dreams of her were only a wish filled dream.

"there's a horrible truth brought to life by ugetsu - the kind of horrible truth which give old tales like these their lasting power. the way ugetsu truly empathizes with its characters gives each beautifully-planned shot a weight which is felt in waves ... the feeling is oppressive, which is cool for a film based around a love story. its unmistakably japanese yet undeniably universal, and id pick it over a kurosawa film any day.",5.0
"Ugetsu Monogatari is a moral fable about the effects of greed and envy. The four main characters, but specifically the two men, all have desires that inevitably redirect their lives.

The story does go in unexpected ways, as the characters succeed against all odds. It does have some overacting and a slow pace. The best comparison I can make is this is a much better Throne of Blood. My mind kept comparing the two movies because of their setting and tone. Overall, Ugetsu is a good movie because of its sympathetic characters.
This movie is considered one of, if not the movie that popularized eastern cinema in the west. Scorsese also lists it as one of his top 10 favorites.",3.5
"Ugetsu is a cautionary tale about the dangers of desperation & greed with heavy supernatural overtones.
I couldn't understand why the supernatural element existed, such is my lack of understanding for Japanese culture, but I was happy to let Ugetsu's lush visuals, floaty camera-work and misty atmosphere wash over me.
Regardless of understanding, it's hard not to connect to the emotional state of the characters. It's themes are universal and depressingly familiar. I've felt like Masayuki Mori's character all too often.

I have seen a lot of praise heaped on this film but I found it to be decidedly average. The moral of the film may be “do not profiteer in war” but comes off more as “know your place and do not try to rise above it”. This might be a ghost story but offers little in the way of scares and I found the direction to be like the plot, pretty average.",3.0
"I decided for this year's DVD Talk Criterion Challenge that I wanted to watch all of one of the celebrity Top 10 lists on their site. After careful consideration, I settled on Martin Scorsese's Top 10. Ugetsu is actually fourth on the list but after failing to fall asleep all night, apparently at 6:30 in the morning I had a hard time with numbers and skipped the third film and went onto this. (Hey, following lists is hard, alright?)
My grasp of Japanese culture and history is rudimentary at best, which is of course the whole reason that Phillip Lopate's essay for The Criterion Collection, Ugetsu: From the Other Shore is less film criticism and more a primer for ignorant rubes like me. I appreciate that Lopate kept whatever disdain he may have for readers like me out of his published essay. Too often, such pieces are defensive and can be antagonistic; all I detected here was enthusiasm for both the film and its director, Kenji Mizoguchi.
Just as I discovered that a state of medicated exhaustion in the middle of the night suited my first time viewing of The Red Shoes, I similarly found that Ugetsu played surprisingly strongly for me after having failed to fall and stay asleep all night. Generally, I shun watching movies in the daylight hours but the morning was quiet and accommodating. By the time we got to the boat-on-the-lake scene, I found myself having flashbacks to when I worked third shift in my late teens. There was nothing else to do in those days except come home and watch Scooby-Doo reruns. (I found that I could time my channel surfing just right and catch three consecutive hours of Scooby, but maddeningly, I could never actually remember who the villain was no matter how obvious or how many times I'd seen the episode over the years.)
That lake scene gave me the heebie jeebies. I absentmindedly found myself making such remarks as ""Nope!"" and ""Oh, hell no!"" (The cats just glared at me for my bad manners.) Try as I might, I honestly could not ascertain whether that was shot on a sound stage or on location somewhere. I attribute that confusion at least in part to how meticulously designed the rest of the film is, but unquestionably that scene even removed from the rest of the picture is so deftly crafted that it's just that convincing. It wasn't until I watched the accompanying interview featurette, Process and Production, with the film's first assistant director Tokuzo Tanaka, that I learned of how painstakingly that scene had been produced.
[Incidentally, that interview with Tanaka discussing Mizoguchi is insightful but also hilarious and easily one of the most enjoyable interview featurettes I've seen yet in The Criterion Collection.]
As for the film itself (and yes, I realize that was quite a rambling preface!), I was captivated from start to finish. I'm still so new to Japanese cinema that I fear going into each film that I just won't get enough of what I'm seeing to appreciate it, but I feel I ""got"" Ugetsu. No doubt, there are cultural and historical nuances that went over my head and I'm sure I could pore over each scene frame-by-frame for decades and find new things to appreciate and admire about it, as its most ardent champions have done for 61 years, so I suppose what I really mean is that I found it instantly accessible.
I quickly connected with all four of the primary characters. Though I hadn't expected to care most about Ohama by the film's end, Mitsuko Mito's performance - unapologetic and defiant, yet also fragile and tender - won me over. I was startled by the sexual violence that befell her, even though it was all but foretold by the dying peddler in the aforementioned lake scene, just as I was heartbroken to see the connection made between being a victim of rape and becoming a ""defiled"" woman condemned to prostitution. And yet, I know that such horrific things have happened - and are still happening - to women around the world.
Appalling and heartbreaking as Ohama's arc is, Lopate succinctly explains why it engages as it does: ""The complex camera movement... demonstrate[s] the way that this director’s compassionate, if bitter, moral vision and his choice of camera angle reinforce each other."" I was conscious while watching the film how kinetic it felt because of the camera movement, but then I've become attuned to such things. I would be keen to hear reactions from viewers accustomed to thinking of old black and white films as being static and lifeless.
In any event, what stands out most to me about Ugetsu isn't the lake scene or its camera work, but rather the overarching/underlying theme that both service: Kenji Mizoguchi's keen sensibilities about exploring the turmoil of war to find, without flinching, the humanity that endures it. It isn't a film that romanticizes suffering as nihilistic provocateurs have tried to do, but rather one that distills - without being reductive - those experiences to the personal level. It's precisely because the film is so focused on these few characters that it can speak to all of us.
Ugetsu Trailer (3:34) ***
Much as we decry the rise of the spoiler-heavy trailer, the truth is that it's been with us all along. In this case, though, I can understand how the intent was to tap into audience identification with its inspirational material, to reassure that the film did hit the highlights. I'm glad I watched this after the film, though.
Process and Production (20:14) *****
As mentioned above, this was terrific from start to finish, swiftly covering everything from thematic commentary to production secrets and some entertaining biographical notes about Kenji Mizoguchi himself. I would read an entire book by Tokuzo Tanaka just reminiscing about such things, though obviously what I really mean is that I would read a translation of that book because I don't read Japanese.
Two Worlds Intertwined (14:09) ****
It's not your fault, Masahiro Shinoda. I'm sure if I'd watched your video featurette first, I'd have thought more of it. But Tanaka is a tough act to follow. Still, I did appreciate the perspective that Shinoda offered on Mizoguchi as storyteller.

"There's no place like home and every love story is a ghost story.
A fantastic, moody piece of filmmaking with an economical first act - stakes are initiated immediately before the film drifts into more of a supernatural art film for the middle third. The surreal segments are expertly realized by Mizoguchi, giving the audience no sense of what is real or imagined until deep into the particular scene. The music is perfectly utilized and understated throughout.
The moral was completely clear and obvious from the beginning which made it clear that I was watching a fable (possibly the Japanese version of 'The Odyssey' - can anyone tell me if the Japanese had access to Homer's writing or did they come up with their own parallel myth??). As clear as the morality was, I don't know that I would've chosen differently than our two male protagonist, which makes the consequences all the more heartbreaking.
Interesting that the only personifications of evil were a woman and her attending ladies, when the rest of the story is positively dripping with the evil and selfishness of all men from beggar to samurai.",5.0
"OK, I just saw Ugetsu monogatari again (also known only as Ugetsu). Now I have to get some things out of the way since most people think this is one of two Mizoguchi's best film and I don't.
I do have trouble with ghost stories. They just don't interest me. Ghosts is the most boring monster I know. They usually don't feel real to me. There are exceptions, where ghosts symbolise remorse and wrong doing, like in The Shining. Now I know this is not supposed to be a horror film but I felt like the ghost part of the story was not needed. It works against the drama, IMO.
Another problem I have with the film is that the moral of the story is told in the beginning. WELL, SPOILERS!!! A Buddhist monk says that quick profit in war will lead to greed and disaster and then we watch the same thing unfold. It made it feel like we where being preached to, instead of told a fascinating story. I would also have liked the end that Mizoguchi had planed rather than the one the studio forced on the film. In Mizoguchi's script, the man who becomes a samurai keeps on rising in status. That would have been a much better ending. Not as preachy as what we have in the film.
Another problem I have is, unlike in his women films where Mizoguchi has sympathy for his protagonists, he is just judging the two men in this film fromt he beginning to end. There is no sympathy for them at all. Not that I think they deserved any sympathy but at least they did not need the judgement. The audience could do that themselves. Let me take an example. The man who wanted to be a samurai. Why not make us understand why he wanted that instead of making it a joke from the beginning? END OF SPOILERS!!!
Now to the positive aspects of the film. It looks like heaven. It is just a dream. An eye candy! Brilliantly visual and cinematic! It is the look and the secure hand of the director which makes this film a great one.
So, a must see and beautiful film, but just a little too preachy :)",4.0

"My first me so coochie film. Somewhere in the middle I was just not having any of this. It just felt rather lethargic for like 10 minutes at one point idk why. But before and after that feeling the movie was amazing. The score was incredible, making some moments that seemed like they would be rather nice really ominous or just kind of depressing to look at. It seems to have a quality of silent-film style choreography and camera work at a good amount of points throughout, mainly involving soldiers fucking with people. Guess it works as a way of critiquing what they're doing since its them robbing people and putting their own life on the line for the sake of some asshole in a better position than them and most of the people they're killing. This combined with the soundtrack and the two main guys path and ending all seem to create this atmosphere of slave morality with the characters and the society at wide. Being content with their place because getting higher is hard to do, but it's not like being poor is easy either. Guess the family makes it worthwhile, idk.",4.5
"This film feels like a classic folk tale or a fable, which, through a chain of narrations, has made its way to you. The story of Genjūrō the potter may have started as a simple story, told around campfires along the shores of a Lake Biwa. At some point, the story may have turned into a poem or perhaps been fancied into a song. Perhaps it then evolved into a theatrical play somewhere, at some time. In the 50s, however, this story was introduced to the budding art form of cinema, and serendipitously placed in the care of director Kenji Mizoguchi. In his care, the seeds of this story produced a masterpiece landmark in Japanese cinema. 
P.S. The sound and music in this film were phenomenal.",4.0
"Beautifully eerie. Story was written in the 1700s and feels like it has to be the basis for so much other content. The delusion dream fantasies seem crazy ahead of its time. Would be really fun to try to adapt the plot today 
Wished I’d read some Japanese history of the movie’s time period before watching - there are a a bunch of major historical name drops that went over my head. Oda Nobunaga, in the Azuchi Momoyama period(end of Sengoku leading into Edo period —> end of the 16th century Japan) 
The movie takes place during a civil war between Japanese clans and focuses on the effects of wartime (greed, warmongering, bloodlust) - the empty promises / dreams of wealth and valor etc. The theme makes sense considering Ugetsu was made less than 10 years after the US nuked Japan. 
I really liked how old movies like this did lighting - intentional or budget-related, when a candle goes out in Lady Wakasa’s house, the lighting on the subject is changed entirely i.e entire room/subjects lighting goes dark. You just have to see it to understand, but its a cool effect that makes use of the audience’s imagination. Good old black and white movies leave lots up to the audience’s imagination and this one does so really well.
The canoe sequence and picnic with Lady Wakasa were stand outs for me

Gente inovador e revolucionário esse primeiro trabalho da juju do pix como atriz uma experiência única,3.5
"pleased that after only about 9 months after last viewing this I had enough new thoughts on it and enough of a new lens…the sign of a true masterpiece. honestly if you were a burgeoning cinephile and you asked me which “classic” Japanese film you should watch first that would get you into the peak 1950s-60s of Japanese film, I’d point you right to this movie. yes, we can talk about Rashomon (too theatrical) or Seven Samurai (too long) or Late Spring (good..but this feels more contemporary, I’ll explain why) all being good fits for that, but to me Ugetsu works perfect. too often people believe that old Japanese movies are all samurai flicks or kaiju (strange creature) films, and Ugetsu kind of flagrantly mocks the idea of both of those throughout its runtime. Kenji Mizoguchi’s hallmarks are all here - the constantly moving camera (thanks to the great Kazuo Miyagawa), female hardship, and above all else, in this film he nailed that fantasy realism better than possibly any movie ever made has. constantly in this film we are left questioning what’s reality and fantasy, and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a movie blur that line better than this. many will point to the idea that there aren’t crazy special effects or anything overtly fantastical (besides some intense makeup), but it’s the way Mizoguchi and Miyagawa created such an atmosphere together where you really can never be sure what you’re looking at. this is one of the more deceptively simple films ever shot, and I wish filmmakers who dig too far into fantasy films nowadays realize you really don’t need all that to trick your audience.
but to an outside viewer, the more modern themes have got to be extremely compelling. you have the ideal of greed, especially as a male obsession (think crypto dudes and the NFT crowd, if you want a March 2022 example) in terms of giving it all away for silly reasons. wartime is raging, and while Mizoguchi originally intended this as a critique of Japanese society at the time, it’s amazing how relevant it all is in the face of the Ukraine conflict of today, and how many ideals could apply to modern society, be it American or western European. in the time since I’d last seen this, it was impressive to make connections to Yasuzo Masumura’s Irezumi (elliptical narrative, plight of women in the face of male stupidity) and Hou Hsiao Hsien’s Flowers of Shanghai. I had just watched the latter not too long after my last visit to the dream world of Ugetsu, and can’t believe I couldn’t make the connection between the two. both films use the fade in/out perfectly, and I’m sure Hou was greatly inspired by this film. many have stated they have issues with the lack of characterization, or the fact that plots and scenes feel short and don’t get fleshed out the way they could, but while I’m usually in that camp, I disagree when it comes to this movie. Mizoguchi set out to make this fable-like story into a dreamy, atmospheric picture, and that’s exactly what he succeeded at. rarely has tragedy felt so beautiful, yet had such redemption. you can see where the newer generation of Japanese directors took from Mizoguchi in this regard - I feel both Hirokazu Kore-eda (especially Maborosi) and Ryusuke Hamaguchi (with Drive My Car) both learned from Mizoguchi on how to deliver melancholy and tragedy at their most beautiful, without the audience feeling like they've been completely wrecked and with absolutely no way out at the end. I generally do not believe any of the best films to be bleak, and the redemptive finale (and closure of the ellipsis...take note of the first and last shots) to be pretty overwhelming every time. Mizoguchi made many great movies, but this still may be my favorite of all...though a run through his surviving filmography is currently in the works.
----------------------------
other notes (spoilers! I don’t want to spoiler tag the above but please don’t read below if you haven’t seen this masterpiece):
-the Criterion Bluray’s subtitles leave out a very important context in the scene where Genjuro comes to his senses against Lady Wakasa: she beckons him by calling him 源十郎様 (“Genjuro-sama”, or “Lord Genjuro”), essentially treating him as her equal. I know Japanese is obviously a tricky language to convey its nuances in subtitling, but I feel adding “Lord Genjuro” would really help English audiences a lot with context to this scene, which is vastly changed knowing this. I’ll have to check the Masters of Cinema disc to see if they got this right or not…
-in Masahiro Shinoda’s glowing interview on this disc brings up a great comparison I’d never made before - in the scene where Kinuyo Tanaka’s Miyagi meets her fate, Mizoguchi changes his shooting to be more documentary-realist, much like an Italian Neorealist film. this is contrasted by the scene where Genjuro returns home to “find” her at the end of the film, where Miyagawa goes with his gliding camera, delving into the dreamy atmosphere more and letting the audience know what kind of scene we’re witnessing.
-Tokuzo Tanaka shared that Kenji Mizoguchi was hard on all of his actors and crew, with the exception of Kinuyo Tanaka, who he was apparently in love with. she certainly had to love him too if she always played the tormented woman in all of his movies!!!
anyway if you still haven’t seen this, I don’t know what you’re doing",5.0
"Incrível como paralelos amarram a película: talvez essa seja a noção de mise en scene, algo que transcende só o ato concreto de guiar o filme, mas que perpassa seu conceito a partir de estruturas tangíveis, e o niilismo inerente ao homem é ilustrado perfeitamente nesse exercício de direção.
Indo além, Mizoguchi sintetiza suas noções em meio a paralelos e dualidades: dois são os casais, ambos ruíram por ambição de homens; duas são as vezes que se vai a vila comercializar, em ambas as vezes são homens que voltam corrompidos, primeiramente de espírito e em seguida de corpo; também são duas vezes em que a câmera se atenta à casa de Miyagi e Genjuro, da primeira para dar largada à história de sofrimento, da segunda, para lhe dar um ponto final.
É, além do retrato mizoguchiano das mulheres e seus fados, a visão do rumo humano a partir de seus pecados: a ambição é o que orquestra a maré no qual o filme boia, o filme traz tal ambição dispersando-se e revelando-se tanto no irreal (no amor de uma mulher fantasma ou pelo menos idealizada) quanto no mais que real, o cruel (no amor rompido e rasgado pela avareza, com cheiro de prostíbulo e moedas de prata).",0.0

"Wow, what a beautiful film overall. Incredible cinematography, narrative, music, and production design. There is something about these older films that I feel has been lost in modern cinema, although I don't know what it is. Is it the meaning attention to detail in dialogue, set design, and location shooting throughout the entirety of a film that heightens the experience? Is it the use of surreal style to demonstrate the destruction of the mind from wartime? Is it the haunting lighting and use of unique instruments to perpetuate the ever-looming danger that violence brings? Or is it how all of these factors work together to impact the audience in such an unexplainable, subliminal way. At this point, I'm just rambling through my thoughts to try to figure out why I am feeling the way I do after watching this film. Early Japanese cinema does not disappoint.",4.0
"Absolutely hypnotic, seamlessly moving between fantasy and reality. It’s easy to see how this was one of Tarkovsky’s favorites, and you can see how Mizoguchi’s touch made its way into his films; especially Mirror.

"Not to quote The Office but if I had a gun, with two bullets, and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden and Tobei, I would shoot Tobei twice.
In all seriousness, I don’t usually love war-time films, but this is such a great showcase in greed, desperation, and ambition, and the consequences of following that darned human impulse.
I love that the protagonists’ journeys split into the spiritual and the physical: Genjuro, the pottery-maker, leaves his wife and child for an affair with a ghost of a fallen daimyo’s daughter after she praises his pottery, while Tobei leaves his wife, Ohama, to hack and slash his way to become a samurai. Genjiro has to exorcise his own greed (in the form of an actual exorcism to send off his mistress), while Tobei rises the ranks and finds his wife amongst the “fallen women” in  brothel — they scuffle in a physical altercation, then embrace in the dirt. In the end, when Genjuro reunited with his wife, Miyagi, all seems well — except that she’s a ghost now, too.
Either way, both men must live with their greed, their impulse, and it was interesting to see the liminal and literal paths we took to get there.",4.0

"I... don't have much to say about this. It's good and I generally really like Japanese film but this one just didn't really hook me.
I like the acting in this. The emotions are over the top but not in a way that feels ridiculous. This film is kinda comprised of two/three stories and I find each of the stories to be interesting. I like the sets and locations of this, the feudal Japan setting is so beautiful. The cinematography and stuff is pretty good and so is the music.
I don't like anthology movies very much and that is what this feels like for the majority of the movie. The middle follows one character for a while and then switches to a different character for a while and everytime it switches I find myself losing interest. I also think this is one of those movies that is really interesting the first time and then loses the excitement the second time around. Like on my second viewing I constantly found myself thinking ""oh yeah then this happens"" and kinda drifting off in my attention.
It is a good film and lots of good stuff going on but personally it just doesn't hold my attention. One of those movies that all of the elements are there and I feel like I should like it but both times I have watched it, I just never got into it.",3.5
"History of Horror
Week 7: <80's Asian Horror
Almost a week has passed since my viewing of Ugetsu, and still I'm at a loss as to how I should start this review. Not because I disliked the film, or because there isn't anything to say about it--both statements are false--but rather because it's hard to put such a haunting, poetic film and viewing experience into words.
Ugetsu has a very simplistic plot, that serves more as a parable than as a traditional film narrative: it revolves around a simple moral lesson about valuing what you have rather than constantly chasing after something better, because you might turn around and find that your quest has lost you what truly matters the most. The characters are similarly broadly-drawn, and any character development they undergo adheres strictly to this moral lesson.
However, many of the things that are typically essential to cinema are not important to Ugetsu: Ugetsu is all about the atmosphere, about making the audience feel things beyond mere involvement in a story or character. It is a ghost story, and not just because it contains a literal ghost; the film itself, from its appearance to the mood it evokes in the viewer, is slightly surreal and incredibly haunting, like a strange dream that begins to fade as soon as you awaken.
Indeed, the cinematography of this film is soft and dreamlike, and uses visual elements like fog and barren trees to create a world straight out of a dark fairy tale. A world in which no one is safe, but the threats don't only come from outside the small, protective bubble the characters build for themselves: it also comes from within themselves, making it impossible to escape their fates. A scene in which the characters sail in a tiny boat through thick, impenetrable fog is especially effective at showing how tiny they are in a big, threatening world--and were it not for their own foolhardiness, they would not be in the boat to begin with, but rather safe among friends on dry land.
The film's ghost is the most interesting character of the film, serving as one of the creepiest and most distinctive cinematic ghosts I've ever encountered. She's uncanny and even frightening, yet strangely alluring at the same time. In another film, the sudden appearance of a supernatural creature after over an hour of stark, painful realism would have been disconcerting, but here, her arrival merely confirms the otherworldly feeling of the cinematography and atmosphere.
Finally, the ending of the film is devastating, but it's the type of tragic ending that is both earned and fitting; I can't picture the film being appropriately wrapped up any other way. It's certainly a conclusion--and visual--that will stick with me for a long time.
Ugetsu is a unique film, the kind of film that gets under your skin and makes you so exited to know that there's films like this out there: that can challenge you and introduce you to methods of filmmaking that are unlike anything else you've seen before.",4.5
"Now these are the type of films that give me a reason to critique work. In Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugestu, I was moved and tossed through a loop, but in the end it was definitely worth it.
I am fascinated by the Japanese culture especially the different eras/periods that they went though. The title of the fim is based on a book, two in fact, called ""Tales of the Moon and Rain"" [I am trying my best not to add any spoilers to this entry.]
The film takes place in the 16th century Civil-War period. These were desperate times of survival, mostly for men who would have the main duty of protecting the family. The protagonist in this story, Genjûrô, has a wife and a child. They are in need of money and his pottery is beginning to sell very well on account of the war going on. It is when a group of bandits come into their small village and demand strict labor upon any man they can find. Luckily, Genjûrô's family gets away just in time. They set sail to a bigger town, so he can sell more of his crafts. To accompany him is a man named Tobei and his wife. Tobei is sort of the dimwitted character that needs a purpose. Though, everything he needs is right in from of him (a wife, friends, food, a decent job, etc.), he has a dream to one day be a samurai. This you can tell is not a good idea, since he is gullible and really bad with his savings. But at least he is helping Genjûrô and his family get by.
It is when Genjûrô's wife has to stay back with the child so that they can travel more cautiously. There have been pirates lurking around and it was not nessecary to risk it. In the town that Genjûrô, Tobei, and his wife sell the pottery, Genjûrô comes accross a mysterious maiden with hikimayu eyebrows, Lady Wakasa, who invites him up to her secluded manor with her and her servant lady. This is probably where I should stop.
The film definitely took me by surprise. I actually thought it was a horror flick at first. Either way, I was not disappointed to find out that is was a fantasy/drama/mystery. It kept me interested the whole way through. I would have to say my favorite character that goes through the change is simply Tobei. His aspiring hope for becoming a true man and brave warrior take a turn.. for whatever you want to look at it. I found him and his wife's story, which sort of breaks off from Genjûrô's in the middle, very touching and heartfelt.

"""Ugetsu"" is a harsh but elegant 'jidaigeki' film set during Japan's civil war in the 16th century, where Mizoguchi addresses the corrupting effects of both war and human nature's inherent evil with his feminist humanism, intricately woven with dynamic camera movement and meticulously precise mise-en-scène.
In the story of Ugetsu, the potter Genjuro and his brother-in-law Tobei flee the war with their wives, Miyagi and Ohama. The men approach the city, pursuing their longed-for success, leaving their wives to fend for themselves with tragic consequences; Miyagi is killed by a bandit, and Ohama ends up surviving by selling herself as a geisha. Greedy Genjuro is seduced by wealthy Lady Wasaka, a noblewoman adorned in Noh theater makeup, who turns out to be a ghost, while Tobei's obsessive desire for success and fame finds an opportunistic path.
The story of Genjuro and Miyagi is a composite of two late 18th-century Japanese 'kaidan' folktale. One tells of a greedy man who, upon returning from the market, finds only the spirit of his former wife at home. The other involves a man ensnared by a serpentine female spirit, who ultimately breaks the spell with the help of a priest, which is similarly executed in the film. The story of Tobei and Ohama is inspired by a late 19th-century French novella (Guy de Maupassant's Décoré!), where a man's pride-driven ambition leads his wife to prostitution.
Exceptional performances are delivered by two of classical Japanese cinema's undeniable stars, Kinuyo Tanaka (Miyagi) and Machiko Kyo (Lady Wasaka). Tanaka embodies the original story's expression of a superheroic and courageous acceptance of life's tragic nature, while Kyo delivers a beautiful portray of betrayal, veiled in distant and coy sweetness.
Mizoguchi's cinematic sense of drama is powerful; the depiction of social realism deepens as the struggle with internal delusions becomes a visible part of the drama's reality. However, the film did not leave an indelible impression on first viewing, although I did find it very good, and am eager to watch it again.",4.0

Segundo visionamento, visto pela última vez há pouco mais de onze anos. Na raiz desta tragédia está a insegurança dos homens face a si próprios. Não me parece ser exactamente correcto afirmar que Genjuro e Tobei querem pertencer a uma outra classe social porque desejam usufruir de mordomias fora do seu alcance. O que impele Genjuro e Tobei a sair da sua aldeia natal e a aventurarem-se em busca do capital é a vergonha que têm das suas mulheres serem casadas com meros agricultores como eles. A primeiro coisa que Genjuro consegue fazer assim que consegue amealhar uns tostões é comprar um traje a Miyagi. É com isso que Genjuro sonha mais tarde: com a felicidade de oferecer à sua esposa um traje digno de uma mulher de uma condição social abastada. Genjuro não pensa em si. De igual modo, podemos interpretar os sonhos de glória de Tobei, um agricultor pateta que almeja tornar-se num samurai, são indestrinçáveis do desejo de fazer com que Ohama seja a mulher de um homem respeitado no seio da comunidade. Miyagi e Ohama são muito mais conservadoras que os seus maridos – tudo nos leva a crer que no entender delas estarem casadas com um agricultor sem ambições é perfeitamente satisfatório.
A guerra vivida naquela parte do Japão fez com que a procura por peças de cerâmica aumentasse. Os agricultores apercebem-se desta necessidade por parte dos consumidores, arregaçam as mangas, e tentam aproveitar esta oportunidade para colher alguns cobres. Genjuro e Tobei são o que hoje chamaríamos de empreendedores. No forno ardente, junto às peças de cerâmica envernizadas, os dois homens colocam as suas almas, como Miyagi aponta a determinado momento. Os protagonistas vendem a alma ao diabo por um punhado de moedas de prata que nunca chegam a ser gastas para satisfazer a vã glória de verem as suas esposas vestidas como mulheres dignas e respeitadas pela sociedade. A frase de Miyagi é sugestiva: ao colocar a alma no forno infernal, Genjuro torna-se num corpo desalmado, portanto, no invólucro ideal para ser possuído por um fantasma.
A Senhora Wasaka irrompe a tela, envolvida numa espécie de casulo esmaecido, no exacto momento em que Genjuro e Tobei conseguem obter algum dinheiro, que é, por outro lado, o mesmo instante em que a unidade da família se desmorona por completo. Recordo que Miyagi e o filho já tinham sido deixados para trás, mas a partir da entrada de Wasaka em cena todos os membros da família passam a estar sozinhos no mundo. Ainda sobre o abandono de Miyagi e do filho junto às margens do lago, é irónico notar como o homem moribundo que a família encontra no barco diz expressamente a Genjuro e a Tobei, Protejam as vossas mulheres, e de seguida, o protagonista abandona o filho e a esposa, selando o destino da última, que morre, com o menino nos braços, depois de ver a sua carne deslaçada pela lança de um bandido.
Voltando à Senhora Wasaka, as cenas protagonizadas pelo fantasma são... assombrosas. Ela surge pela segunda vez imediatamente após uma sequência que retrata um daydream de Genjuro, que fantasia em ver a felicidade da sua esposa ao receber um traje luxuoso. Sabemos que estamos no regime do sonho, entre outras razões, porque a banda sonora assim o indica. Os harpejos sinalizam que as imagens têm um valor de realidade diferente. Quando Genjuro desperta do daydream, lá está a Senhora Wasaka à sua espera. O corte abrupto entre a imagem idealizada de Miyagi e a da feiticeira que irá fazer com que o protagonista se esqueça da sua mulher é poderoso. Sentimos a concupiscência do olhar de Genjuro, que vê em Wasaka aquilo que a esposa nunca poderá ser: uma descendente de uma linhagem nobre, uma donzela virginal que só conhece o toque da seda.
Ao cruzar a propriedade dos Kutsuki, a Senhora Wasaka e Genjuro transformam-se em sombras, indicando uma mudança no estatuto da realidade. Tudo é onírico. As serviçais que acendem as velas que iluminam os corredores da mansão movimentam-se como espíritos, e a luz passa a ter uma qualidade lunar. Finalmente, a Senhora Wasaka seduz o protagonista através de uma fórmula infalível para um homem: a lisonja e a súplica. Wasaka atira-se, suplicante, para os braços de Genjuro, mas o grande plano do seu rosto mostra-nos que é ela quem detém o poder, que é ela que o está a subjugar. Uma leve condensação sai da boca de Genjuro, como se estivesse envolvido por um frio mortal. Quase todas as cenas de Genjuro e Wasaka na mansão passam-se durante a noite. A única excepção é a fabulosa sequência em que os amantes brincam nas margens do rio. Genjuro encontrou o Paraíso ao lado do demónio que o faz viver num plano de ilusão. A luz que reflecte nas águas do rio e que cobre as margens é quase irreal, advém de um sol nocturno.
O troço d’O Conto da Lua Vaga (1953) que começa com a entrada em cena da Senhora Wasaka e termina com o episódio dos amantes a brincar nas margens do rio é fantástico. A acção perde um pouco de força quando a trama se desvia, de novo, para as personagens secundárias, dando-nos a ver o destino malogrado de Tobei, Ohama e Miyagi. Devido a um certo grau de boa fortuna, Tobei consegue tornar-se num guerreiro respeitado. Ele é um farsante, mas os privilégios que conquista são bens reais. Os homens da companhia militar veneram-no, rogam-se perante ele, fazem preces para que um dia possam vir a ter a boa ventura de Tobei teve ao matar um guerreiro glorioso da facção inimiga. Porém, a conquista da glória foi feita às custas da desgraça de Ohama, que começou por ser violada por um grupo de samurais, e acabou por se tornar numa prostituta de bordel. Quanto a Miyagi, conforme mencionado, a mulher é morta pela lança de um soldado faminto.
A última grande cena do filme é o retorno de Genjuro a casa. O protagonista entra no casebre que deixou no começo da narrativa e chama pela mulher e pelos filhos. Tudo o que ele quer é que o seu mundo volte a ser como de antes. A câmara faz um movimento circular, acompanhando o olhar de Genjuro que procura, sem sucesso, a família. Quando a câmara dá uma volta sobre si própria o cenário mudou: no centro da divisão, em redor do calor reconfortante do fogão agora aceso, estão Miyagi e o filho. É o movimento da câmara que nos inscreve no domínio do onírico. O mais desconcertante é que o que agora é um sonho, outrora era a realidade, e na altura o protagonista não a soube valorizar.",4.0
"Me parece muy particular que Ugetsu sea, ante todo, una película sobre la guerra, aun cuando prácticamente no se muestran conflictos armados –al menos ninguno en que ambas partes se encuentren en igualdad de condiciones, pareciéndose más a emboscadas y asaltos de pequeños grupos militares a combates entre estos grupos–, y más aún, una película de guerra de otro tiempo, primero porque el tiempo en el que transcurre la historia es el siglo XVI japonés, y luego, porque también es un film de 1953, ya setenta años atrás. Todas estas aristas acrecientan, como la Luna pálida titular, esta obra fantasmagórica.
Pensándolo bien, Ugetsu es una película sobre fantasmas. Primero, los fantasmas de las ambiciones de los dos hombres protagonistas, uno que quiere hacerse rico vendiendo sus cerámicas, y el otro convirtiéndose en samurái, y en alguna medida cumplen sus sueños, con el primero vendiendo sus cerámicas a una princesa inefable, que lo desea como marido (y a la cual él se entrega), y el segundo robando la cabeza de un general buscado, hazaña hurtada al verdadero ejecutor, a quien también mata. Fantasías hechas realidad, que en su naturaleza ilusionada e ilusa, finalmente se desvanecen, en buena medida por el suelo volátil donde se erigieron, que es la traición a sus mujeres (el primero en el adulterio, el segundo en el descuido que la lleva a ser violada, y luego, prostituida).
Mientras que el segundo hombre, el simulacro de samurái, vive una fantasía que lo lleva a lo más profano de lo mundano, en los placeres de un prostíbulo, que es donde se encuentra con su mujer prostituida –que vocifera con rabia que, pese a todo, igual lo ama–, el primero queda cautivo y cautivado por la princesa fantasma, en su mansión fantasma, cuya dulce voz en su dulce canto es acompañada pronto por el fantasma (desdoblado en grado espectral) de su padre, quien junto a la nodriza de su hija, desean que ella viva el amor que no pudo en vida. Esta fantasía sublime es el nudo más fantasmal de la película, no solo por representar la trama más explícitamente propias del kaidanshu, sino porque representa la transgresión y la traición cuyo costo es que, en su ausencia, su mujer Ohama muere asesinada por un soldado, y al retorno a su casa, él la ve y conversa con ella, interacción que al día siguiente es desmentida por un vecino. Su voz sigue presente en la película en la secuencia final, siendo indecidible si es diegética o no-diegética. En ambos casos, se trataría entonces de una inversión de toda traición o transgresión, porque su voz, es decir su alma desprendida de su cuerpo, explica lo feliz que está de que su marido y su hijo estén a salvo, y que estará tranquila de que todo estará bien para ambos. Su voz suena más dulce que en cualquier otro punto de la película.
Si la transgresión y la traición suelen ser un motor de las historias de fantasmas, en Ugetsu es el nudo que se desarma, en lugar de la venganza, en el perdón, y ese es el gesto más poderoso y amoroso de la película. La venganza tal vez es la que el destino tiene preparada para el marido, que hasta el final comprende que todo es su culpa, por permitirse haber sido arrastrado por las fantasías. Y precisamente en este aspecto, es que Ugetsu también expone su aspecto más político: entre los habitantes del pueblo al que pertenecen los protagonistas y los soldados anónimos que son un peligro constante, así como los comerciantes ambulantes y los compradores, la princesa fantasma es la única en una posición privilegiada, incluso en la muerte. Como alma en pena, intenta reclamar lo que debió ser suyo, expresado en una serie de gestos cinematográficos que indican esta potencia superior, desde la música rica en instrumentación japonesa, con toques fantásticos de occidente, a un montaje mágico al interior de la mansión. De hecho, la mansión es un espacio también privilegiado, no sólo por su correlato socio-político, sino por los recursos lumínicos que son exclusivos a sus secuencias. También la escena de su canto es un segmento excepcional. Pero los pobres, en cambio, sufren, cuando se destrozan sus fantasías, o cuando las cumplen pagando los costos más altos. Por lo que, debo reiterar: el perdón de Ohama es lo más poderoso y amoroso, así como lo más desgarrador, y también hay allí un mensaje muy político, que no debe confundirse con conformismo, sino con una alegría que da por tierra con los afectos tristes que nos rondan, como fantasmas.",4.5

"""Success always comes with a sacrifice of suffering.""
Hmmm......
This is a very interesting movie with two great premises (as it predominantly curs between two tales happening in parallel, which only barely intersect). There's a lot to like.
And yet, I find myself struggling to connect with it.
Mizoguchi was a mentor and friend to Kaneto Shindō, whose films I've been watching earlier this week and obsessing over (especially Onibaba). And yet, while Ugetsu touches on similar themes to those later films, it feels a bit more shallow here. I don't feel that it's quite as rich, or the characters as multi-dimensional as I'd expected. Mostly, the men are just singly focused on one single thing, and the women are simply helpless and scold the men. It makes its point, but feels so... simple.
And while I can understand the emotions displayed on screen, I never really felt them. Mizoguchi shoots most of the film in big wide shots, and I think this is to its detriment. We don't get in close to the actors' faces very often, or linger on those expressions. The camera is mostly objective throughout the movie, which can work sometimes but here just comes off as uninteresting. It's like watching a filmed play.
I know this film is highly well regarded, and I want to like it more. But it just didn't quite live up to its potential for me.",3.0

Şüphesiz sinema sanatının benim için en büyük filmlerinden biri oldu.
Savaş karşıtı, feministik bir film ve hayalet hikayesiyle bezenmiş bir başyapıt
Film Japonyo'da iç savaş döneminde beraber yaşayan 2 aileye odaklanıyor. Ailelerin erkek bireyleri Ganjuro ve Tobeiden biri çokça çömlek satıp zengin olmanın diğeri ise samuray olabilmenin hırsıyla yanıp tutuşuyorlar. Bu hırsları uğruna savaş zamanı ailelerini yalnız bırakan bu 2 adamın ve geride kalam eşlerinin ve çocuklarının yaşadıklarını izliyoruz
Savaş patlak verdiğinde Ganjuro hâla çömlek satmanın derdiyle tehlikeli olan şehre giymeye karar verir. Bunun üstüne karısı bu zor zamanda ailesinin yanında olması gerektiğini, daha fazla para kazanmaktanta beraber olmalarınin önemini vurgulamaya çalışırken Ganjuro eşine şöyle yanıt verir
""Savaş ticaret için iyidir..""

Filmi tanimlayabileceğim kelimelerin başında kesinlikle feminist bi film olması gelir. Savaş zamanında geride kalan kadınların korkusuzca aileleri için her şeylerini ortaya koymaları ve erkeklerin garip hırsları yüzünden düştükleri acı durumları gözlerimizin önüne seriyor film

"""Ugetsu"" to arcydzieło japońskiego reżysera Kenji Mizoguchi uznawane za jedno z najważniejszych dzieł kina. Film ten przedstawia historie dwóch mężczyzn, którzy podczas wojny domowej w XVI wieku w Japonii są uwikłani w swoje własne marzenia i ambicje, zapominając o rzeczywistości i rzeczywistych kosztach ich decyzji.
Pierwszym z bohaterów jest Genjuro, artysta, który marzy o zdobyciu bogactwa i uznania za pomocą swoich niesamowitych ceramik. Drugim jest Tobei, chłopiec marzący o zostaniu samurajem, co prowadzi go do ryzykownych wyborów. Mizoguchi mistrzowsko ukazuje ich podróż przez tajemnicze i niebezpieczne światy, odsłaniając, jak marzenia mogą stać się przekleństwem.
„Ugetsu” jest filmem pełnym symboliki, głębokich metafor i niezwykłych ujęć kamery. Mizoguchi eksploruje tematykę ludzkich pragnień, ofiar i konsekwencji w sposób, który pozwala widzowi zastanowić się nad własnymi marzeniami i wyborami. Opowieść ta jest jednocześnie piękna i tragiczna, rzucając światło na uniwersalne aspekty ludzkiego doświadczenia.
Ostateczna ocena może wynikać z różnic kulturowych, oczekiwań czy preferencji widza. Być może niektórzy mogą uznać tempo filmu za zbyt wolne, a jego głęboką symbolikę za trudną do zrozumienia.
Warto jednak zauważyć, że wartość „Ugetsu” nie leży jedynie w rozrywce czy łatwej konsumpcji. Film ten jest dziełem sztuki, które wymaga zaangażowania i refleksji. Jego poetycka forma i subtelnosc nie zawsze przemówią do każdego widza, ale dla tych, którzy gotowi są poświęcić czas na zanurzenie się w historii i analizę głębszych warstw, może stać się przejmującym doświadczeniem.
Wartość artystyczna tego dzieła jest powszechnie uznawana. Mizoguchi nie tylko stworzył arcydzieło filmowe, ale także pozostawił dziedzictwo, które kształtuje sztukę filmową do dziś.",0.0

"Had this one recommend to me tonight and I’m so glad. Such a universal story even if it’s based on 16th century Japan. The messaging of greed, power, money, love, blindness, and overall patriarchy was well done. All of those themes pretty much seam together with such ease it’s very admirable. Through this story you really get a gaze into people who just want more but overall doesn’t need it. Throughout the runtime it shows you what blindness to what you already have right in front of you. Such a timeless concept with a great story behind it. Really enjoyed the eery horror aspect that they went for. It really fit with how I think the themes really play. I was also really impressed with the camera work for being such an older movie. This definitely paved the way for how some people made their movies in the future. The editing was pretty good but I can see from some reviews people could have been confused with what was going on. Definitely all over the place if you take your eyes off the screen for even a second. However to me I think the level of confusion also is supposed to show you the minds of the two main men in which they were really confused on what they wanted the whole time. Full of delusions that were for some too far gone at the point of their return. Such a sad gripping story that should be viewed at least once.",4.5

"Um belo drama de época, com enfoque em costumes e valores morais. O Mizoguchi parte de situações bem específicas, bem ancoradas num certo contexto social e econômico, e a partir disso fala dos temas mais universais. Não só isso, mas também atinge uma certa dimensão espiritual e onírica a partir dessa base realista.
A encenação, realista e vagarosa, evidencia muito bem todos os personagens e os espaços, com uma quantidade suficiente de detalhes para que possamos acompanhar o desenrolar das ações com poucos cortes. É como se estivéssemos testemunhando aquela história a uma certa distância. A imersão, portanto, é significativa, e é possível sentir o impacto de cada gesto, diálogo e interação na tela. E o filme também consegue criar cenas mais contemplativas (a do lago com neblina, na mansão) e intuir um aspecto onírico e espiritual na maneira em que aborda os temas de ganância, ambição, lealdade e honestidade, através de suaves movimentos de câmera, da trilha sonora atmosférica e pontual e da fotografia, que ora cria planos de sombras e múltiplas camadas, para enfatizar a ambiguidade moral dos personagens e da situação, ora cria momentos com uma iluminação mais chapada e exagerada para conferir o clima onírico pretendido.
O que mais me desagrada aqui é que o filme pode ser mais explícito e ilustrativo que o necessário em certos momentos. É um filme com muita sensibilidade, mas que às vezes sente a necessidade de verbalizar temas que já haviam sido expressos por meio da encenação, o que tira um pouco da imersão para mim.",4.0

"Drawn back to Ugetsu after listening to Ari Aster interview Scorsese about the Film Foundation, and after Hideo Kojima included it among his Criterion Closet picks. It's so different from other classic bushido and bushido-adjascent films in its relationship to class, as Mizoguchi puts us in the shoes of the displaced peasantry near the end of Nobunaga's wars of reunification.
The peasants are driven from their land, raped and ransacked by roving samurai clans, and the men aspire to become rich or powerful enough to escape the misery - but the ghosts of the nobility call out to them, also destroyed by the costly war they themselves waged. Even as they get everything they wanted, there is no escape from the poverty and alienation that ally their treachery.
Also a film that's impossibly beautiful in a very earthy, practical way. The boat scene is a perfect example - it's a perfect image just as you'd imagine while reading a novel. A lone rowboat, cutting through a dense, low-laying fog. Alone on the water, alone in the world - until they're not. And suddenly it's danger and mystery in each pocket of darkness, the frame full of the invisible threats that cloud their minds and judgement.",5.0

Ugetsu was somewhat similar in tone and theme to Onibaba, but I think I preferred its fairytale/folktale storytelling.

However, Ugetsu also has elements of the broader pursuit of happiness and dreams that I really enjoy in movie. My only complaint is that I felt like the two main characters got off too easy, but in some ways perhaps that was intentional because often times in life (and wartime), the people who suffer the most are the innocent, not the profiteers, warmongers, and exploiters.",3.5

"Envoûtant sur tous ses aspects.
Ugetsu Monogatari nous plonge dans la fin de l'ère Sengoku avec un souci du détail et une ampleur de déploiement impressionants, le tout à travers un étrange brouillard. Le monde qu'on perçoit baigne dans une atmosphère surnaturelle, mystique, parfois inquiétante. La musique, la chorégraphie de la caméra et des acteurs, les compositions et la forte continuité visuelle entre les scènes me donnaient l'impression que mon esprit était aspiré dans le monde derrière une image en encre noire, à travers un long tunnel tortueux et fluide tapissé de sensations subtiles et dures à nommer. La scène de bateau!
J'ai beaucoup aimé les sous-titres au centre de l'écran de la bobine de la Cinémathèque, ils renforçaient le pouvoir d'aspiration que l'image avait sur moi en gardant mon attention centrée et traduisaient seulement l'essentiel du dialogue, laissant plus de temps pour absorber l'image.
Je ne me souviens pas d'avoir vécu une expérience cinématographique similaire récemment. Les seules oeuvres qui m'ont apporté des impressions similaires étaient des gekiga artistiques des années 60 (par exemple, certaines histoires de Yoshiharu Tsuge, Sanpei Shirato et Hiroshi Hirata, des auteurs qui étaient à ce que je sache fortement inspirés par le cinéma de cette époque). Ça ma rendue toute fébrile de voir quelque chose de similaire en mouvement.

"I might not be the Mizoguchi lover everyone is and expects everyone else to be but I can't deny the man knew how to make softcore horror movies. Softcore because it's not really a horror movie. But it is truly a haunting, spooky film at its core. Everything feels like a terrible nightmare but the director leaves a certain amount of reality to keep us intrigued.
Mizoguchi cleverly uses those thriller tropes to show human's primal flaws - greed, lust and envy. And it works.
Also shout-out to Machiko Kyô who's again a phenomenal, terrifying femme fatale.
I do have few doubts about the inscenisation. It bothers me how obviously in studio some scenes were (especially the lake sequence) which makes the sound poor and often with a weird echo. It distracts from a story and ultimately, I do think this brilliant narrative deserved a better movie.

"El personaje de Ugetsu mueve a la cámara, rompe con la situación más teatral planteada a lo largo de toda la película. Su persona encarna una ficción, la del cine, que viene a desestructurar la realidad: corrompe el estilo de vida del protagonista, le hace creer que existe algo más allá de su manera de vivir, no solo en un marco de lujuria y excesos, sino también perceptivo, visual.
Ugetsu implica picados y contrapicados, que se traducen en una relación de poder distinta a la que mantiene con su mujer: si su mujer se mantiene junto a él en el plano, con la misma altura, respetuosa, Ugetsu lo mira desde arriba, como si lo poseyera por completo y le perteneciera, moviendo la cámara a su antojo para lograr que la mire, que la desee, manipulando la puesta en escena para hacerlo caer en su ficción, que ya largo tiempo tiene de extinta, ya que ha quedado en el registro de la memoria o del fílmico, como el cine mismo. 
El palacio de Ugetsu marca distancias y espacios hermosos, que se descubren con travellings y no están dados por entero; en cambio, en su verdadero hogar, ya conocemos todo el espacio en un simple pero efectivo plano, hasta incluso hay momentos donde ni un paneo es necesario. Lo simple se acomplejiza, lo excesivo sofoca y nubla. 
Luego de su travesía, gracias a la ayuda de un sacerdote, el hombre finalmente logra salir del hechizo de ese fantasma para llegar a su casa y encontrarse con otro: su mujer aparece sorpresivamente tal como la otra, lo está esperando con comida y con su hijo a salvo, todo parece ideal. Cuando se va a dormir, ella se queda remendando su ropa, mientras de a poco va amaneciendo y, por primera vez, la cámara sube lentamente, dándole a ella un peso más espiritual si se quiere: efectivamente ha muerto, pero seguirá cuidándolo desde otro plano, para ayudarlo a que no vuelva a perder su camino de nuevo.",0.0

"It’s been a very long time since I’ve seen a film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, and I suppose I either did not recognise, or have forgotten the actual extent of his mastery. This is surely one of the best exercises in mood ever put onto celluloid. With an affinity for cinema I have only seen with a handful of other names, Mizoguchi is able to capture this constant dream-like, whimsical, also insidious and utterly haunting atmosphere. Ugetsu is a complete film. Every single facet of its creation supplements beauty, from its screenplay - a nuanced though nonetheless cautionary tale on the allure of greed and ambition, told through a potently lyrical, yet equally cruel narrative, to the lighting which is so intensely meticulous that it alone could make up the contents of this review, to those subtly sweeping camera movements that shift perfectly between compositions, to the simplistic yet genius framing itself, even to the magnificent usage of sound. This is simply one of those films where you can tell that the craftsmanship of its maker has been developed for decades, and that this is the culmination of his seasoned cinematic understanding. The sheer, haunting beauty of this film is almost unmatched in cinema. I think in rediscovering Mizoguchi, I have rediscovered something special.",4.5

Sinopsis/Resumen
Dos campesinos japoneses deciden probar suerte en sendos nuevos caminos de vida, abandonando a sus familias para irse a buscar su suerte a la ciudad. Pero, tras numerosos aviso, el destino les depara su mayor prueba.

Crítica formal
¡Qué difícil valorarla!
Hay secuencias que rezuman claramente maestría, aportando contención y emoción en su justa medida y siempre al servicio de la historia. Por otra parte, hay otras que dejan a uno más indiferente, preguntándose si no había un mejor libreto o no se podría haber dado más enjundia a la escena. Pero sí se puede ser objetivo y ponderar con justicia los logros de la película.
El primero, el ardor que tiene por huir del efectismo y la artificiosidad, optando siempre por escenas orgánicas, de exquisita escenografía y una aproximación natural ante todo. Esto hace que nunca se haga pesado el film: a pesar de sus previsibles recursos narrativos, siempre podemos sentirnos atraídos por su historia, la historia humana.
El segundo, al hilo, es su desinterés por los «grandes jugadores». Donde otros cineastas de reconocimiento y prestigio mayores hubieran optado por contar las historias de grandes hombres y magnificar sus hazañas, Mizoguchi se empeña en perseguir a cuatro campesinos y desentrañar su estatura interior (podríamos decir, espiritual, trascendente). La naturalidad (¡y valentía!) con la que cuenta una historia feminista y de amor matrimonial es extraordinaria (e, inintencionada aunque conscientemente, contracultural).
Esto lo materializa Mizoguchi en el cuidado de las secuencias familiares y la preocupación por transmitir emociones reales, jamás impostadas, con sus actores. Crea así un clima que favorece la suspensión de la incredulidad del espectador desde el principio; no mediante épicas fabulaciones shakespearianas, sino con la naturalidad de la vida. La tonadilla del demonio no parece artificial, sino parte del aciago destino que acaece sobre el pobre Genjuro.

Crítica personal
Creo que tendré que verla más veces para poder penetrar en su calidad cinematográfica. Su sutileza ha pasado sobre mí y no he podido valorarla bien.
En lo narrativo, una fabulilla muy bien contada, aunque a veces se eche de menos algo más de poder. Tal vez es culpa mía por vivir insensibilizado.

Motivo del visionado
Un poco de japos de vez en cuando no viene mal.

Guía parental
Sexo: muy implícito, nada serio
Miedo: un fantasma/demonio, pero nada sobrenatural en pantalla, todo sutil.
LGTB: no
Feminismo/Tratamiento de la mujer: exquisito. Pasa Bechdel justito, pero la historia es en el fondo un canto matrimonial y feminista de los buenos.
Edad recomendada: tal vez 12 ó 13 años para el primer visionado, y de ahí en adelante volver a verla cada pocos años.",4.5
"Mais um filmaço do Mizoguchi.
A fotografia é belíssima e a trilha sonora é fantástica também.
A ambientação também funciona muito bem muito pelo excelente trabalho de direção de arte.
Os personagens são muito bem desenvolvidos e cativantes.
Gostei do uso dos elementos sobrenaturais até por render a melhor cena do filme que é a do exorcismo, embora acho que esses elementos poderiam ser melhor explorados e explicados.
Também achei esquisita a subtrama do irmão do protagonista e da sua esposa,não pelas atuações mas pelo fato de os dois simplesmente sumirem no final do filme.

"An outstanding 1953 historical drama/fantasy film directed by the legendary Kenji Mizoguchi, Ugetsu is a must-watch for all fans of the Golden Age of Japanese Cinema.
This adaptation of two separate Japanese stories explores its themes of greed, ambition, love, family, envy, obsession, and war through the lens of both a ghost story and a jidageki film (period drama), set during the Japanese Civil Wars of the 16th century. With gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, flawless pacing, great acting performances, unique filmmaking techniques, and an intriguing screenplay/storytelling narrative, it is not difficult to see why this movie is a cinematic masterpiece.

"Genuinely had no idea what to expect from this one. The cover of the film looks sad and vaguely mysterious but doesn’t really give you an idea for what the central plot of the film will be so I pretty much came into this knowing nothing. I also was dealing with a tired and teething baby while watching it but, to be honest, it felt like that sort of enhanced the experience for me. Moments that shocked and upset me were left lingering in my mind as my baby cried out for me to pick him up. It was an odd experience, not necessarily one I’d recommend, but an interesting and enriching experience nonetheless. 
Ugetsu really hit me hard. I was expecting to feel a certain amount of removed emotion and sympathy for these characters from a story I didn’t know, from a period I’m largely clueless about, a culture that’s foreign to me, and I language I couldn’t even begin to understand. Somehow, through all these barriers, Mizoguchi’s film spoke to me and haunted me all the same. Sometimes this removal from time and the cultural barrier can be an issue for people, one I’m sympathetic towards but also I think it’s typically overestimated. But period pieces that seem to at least partially rely on your knowledge of a time and place- feels like a greater hurdle. Even films about history’s I’m culturally aware of create this kind of emotional barrier as things are recounted in front of you but Ugetsu sidesteps so much of this and comes straight for your heart. 
Tales about greed are nothing new but every once in awhile one of these stories will manage to become so much greater than its beginnings as a mere fable. What begins as a straightforward story about the dangers of being too greedy (something that wouldn’t be out of place in a children’s story) it quickly becomes so much more involving than a fable typically would be. The characters feel almost comically large at first but quickly become dimensional and layered. The visuals start out almost stately but quickly become obscured or hazy, filled with danger and regret. Mizoguchi starts us off with the notions of a moral lesson with larger than life caricatures and simple messages so we become disarmed as these lessons become increasingly upsetting and more real. 
By the final act of this movie there was a pit in my stomach, I knew where things were headed and I didn’t want them go there. The movie doesn’t really play any tricks on you (though I’m sure some have thought so) it’s very forward about its mystical elements and visually and aurally keeps us aware of voices and worlds beyond our own. However, we are not comforted by these other worlds but are unnerved by them. We can’t be certain they aren’t going to crop up here and we are dreading that they already have. 
A really incredible film that is shockingly intimate without being in your face about it. Gorgeous, layered visuals that are complimented by eerie and atmospheric music/sound. There is a price to pay for our actions but we are also just pawns in a scheme to large for us to comprehend. Can’t wait to watch more Mizoguchi.",5.0
"The best thing about Ugetsu, and Ebert put it best so I’m paraphrasing him, is that by the end of it we’re aware that what we saw is a work of fantasy, a parable of greed, envy, and a surprisingly effective ghost story, and yet the consequences feel as though we could have been witnessing the lives and fates of real people.",4.5

"THOUGHTS
Martin Scorsese and Akira Kurosawa love Ugetsu, and I love Scorsese and Kurosawa, so I should love it too, right? Well… it was pretty good. It’s a morality tale about the evils of greed, temptation and self-gratification. But Ugetsu also has a strong feminist theme as men are depicted as morally inferior despite a much superior position over women in this society. Director Mizoguchi creates a vivid sense of place among the warring villages of 16th Century Japan while keeping all of the stories very intimate and personal. Too, his final shot in this film is incredibly powerful. For one storyline, the film steps out of realism into the mystical, and that didn’t work for me (probably a personal thing). I know Ugetsu is a revered by many as a classic but I can’t got that far with my praise.

"Great fable. From discussion around it I had the impression the focus would be more on the women, but they seem to disappear and reappear as a punishment for the men's greed. I think overall the statement on gender relations is more complex but maybe my expectations were wrong.
Love how simply and subtly this is made. Especially re the sound design. A single infrequent drumbeat for the ethereal river crossing scene. Or the motivations of the men being shown as enticing, even though the clear morality of the priest forbade it. Especially that one sequence where the ceramics seller visualises his wife in a fancy kimono. It almost seems like his ""greed"" is selfless, or at least borne out of love.",4.5

"I kept thinking of Arronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream while watching this haunting fable centered more on ambition than drug use, but with a similar sense of folly and dread at its center.
What was most haunting is how the ghost of Genjuro’s late wife immediately absolves him of any guilt for having left them, playing on the fantasy projected by the potter that calls back to his  earlier imagining of how satisfied his wife would be with some fancy garments he considers purchasing. This call back suggesting we are now living in the warped psyche of Genjuro’s perspective, is stunningly brilliant as he silently navigates caring for Genichi by offering him rice that, is in turn, offered to the tombstone where his mother is buried. We feel Genichi’s sense of atoning for sins of his father and the power women seem to gain over their husbands only after dying despite being powerless in life.",4.5

"O cinema de Kenji Mizoguchi centra-se no aforismo de que uma cena deve ser igual a um corte. Yasujirō Ozu agia de forma semelhante, porém a diferença provavelmente está no tratamento do ritmo do movimento. Enquanto a câmera de Ozu permanecia rigorosamente estática, o estilo de Mizoguchi constrói sua encenação em torno de um sutil movimento de câmera, fluido e sobretudo poético.
Em Contos da Lua Vaga (Ugetsu monogatari, 1953) Mizoguchi realiza uma prodigiosa fusão de acontecimentos reais (o drama de época) com os surreais (a fábula fantasmagórica), sem, contudo, fazer uso de processos fílmicos convencionais para retratar a história. Baseada na série de contos de Akinari Ueda denominada “Ugetsu monogatari”, ela se passa no Japão seiscentista, onde dois camponeses vendem suas panelas de barro para um grupo de soldados em uma aldeia próxima, desafiando a advertência de um sábio local contra a tentativa de lucrar com a guerra. No entanto, a busca de um por ambas as riquezas e uma senhora misteriosa, bem como o desejo de outro de se tornar um samurai, correm o risco de destruir a si mesmos e suas esposas.
Mizoguchi desde o início estabelece uma atmosfera única, através de tomadas longas e movimentos de câmera sublimemente graciosos, o que ajuda a captar essa encenação pictórica do autor. Sua câmera parece estabelecer uma relação de distanciamento para com o espectador, mas adquirindo um tom de abrangência que respeita o contexto da ação, uma vez que o esforço humano retratado assume o caráter de alegoria. Os heróis são ásperos, consumidos pela ambição, mas o estilo do filme é elegante e misterioso.
Mizoguchi é um cineasta mais da mise-en-scène do que da montagem, encenação por esta envolvente, que garante uma imersão hipnótica dentro de um Japão do século XVI. Planos longos são preponderantemente intercalados por planos gerais e travellings, usufruindo dos cenários feudais e demais reconstituições históricas. O cineasta, de notável sensibilidade na abordagem do universo feminino, parece exorcizar esse Japão tradicional regido no seu particular cotidiano, de maneira que, assim como um José Saramago — na literatura —, injeta o elemento fantástico para dimensionar a violência do real.
Para tanto, Mizoguchi é perspicaz em unir a imagem e o som — haja vista a formidável sequência de confrontação dos demônios por parte do protagonista. A cena do lago — que expõe uma textura grisalha e a presença da neblina em seus filmes —, em que surge a aparência espectral de um barco através da névoa e as do oleiro, é de notável sensibilidade estética e, combinada com uma concepção “moderna” da música de filme, adquire uma efeito dramático estarrecedor.
Em última análise, exite em Contos de Lua Vaga uma concepção interessante do tempo e do espaço. Assim, capta-se um jogo de sombras, bem como flashsbacks integrados na ação que materializam a recordação da personagem. Essa diegese adquire uma atmosfera de um sensualismo trágico, que assume a coexistência da ficção e do onírico. Mizoguchi aufere essas dicotomias para implantar sua fábula de homens ambiciosos e de orgulhos feridos, e de mulheres que, por sua vez, transcendem à categoria de mártires, em meio a um mundo estupidamente ensopado pelo egoísmo masculino.",5.0

"""The war drove us mad with ambition.""
This line pretty much sums up Ugetsu monagatari. I was deeply moved by each character's dreams and inner desires. When they speak, you'll hear it somewhere in their voice. Even the dead still keep on dreaming because it is all they can do. As Tobei had said, ""Ambition must be as boundless as the ocean."" Genjuro dreams of being rich and Tobei dreams of being a samurai. They went to satisfy their pleasures and they indeed got it, but not without deception and the sacrifice of others' lives. In the end, it proved that dreams nourished by greed and lies cannot flourish. They speak of both sufferings and ambition, but the former is all they get and the latter always gets shattered. The war has affected them all. It took away not only their dreams, but also their sanity and the people they love.

Mizoguchi has evoked so many emotions in Ugetsu, from the terror of the people when Shibata's army comes to their village, the hardships endured by those left behind, and the consequences of excessive ambition. So far, I like his approach. He could draw you into his characters without much effort.

I couldn't end this review without mentioning Lady Wakasa and Genjuro's haunting encounter. That haunting, haunting feeling is just beautiful. Lady Wakasa's journey through the living world to realize her dream was heartbreaking. May her ladyship find peace.

"Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is a gorgeously shot film. With expertly calculated cinematography, a perfect ensemble cast, and a few smoke machines or two, I'm enthralled by the ways he managed to mesh both psychological, supernatural horror with societal lust for status to craft such a definitively blunt statement on what truly matters in our lives (which, surprisingly, isn't Hikimayu courtesan ghost girls or cheap village stall armour). What really impressed me though was the fact that it wasn't just one source Mizoguchi adapted the film from — it was three.
The title of Ugetsu itself derives from Japanese novelist Ueda Akinari's 1776 anthology book of supernatural tales, Ugetsu Monogatari, whose short stories Lust of the White Serpent and House in the Reeds were merged together to create the main narrative of Masayuki Mori's pottery maker Genjurō who, like Akinari's cautionary tales, unknowingly dooms his simple family life as he's seduced by alluring powers of greed and manipulations of the supernatural. As for his brother-in-law Tōbei, Mizoguchi devised his character arc from French author Guy de Maupassant's 1883 short story, Décoré!, detailing a similar tale of man's desperation for social status at the expense of loved ones, though Kenji did diverge into far more darker implications with his interpretation.
With these three inspirations singled out it needs to be asked — why them? Could just one of Akinari's short stories been enough? Did Mizoguchi need to craft a side plot with Tōbei? Though the works of Aikinari and Maupassant are different tales of different eras, they all possess the same universal themes I detailed not long ago whether it be loyalty, morality, or even the slippery slope between arrogance and regret. Most telling however, is the directorial decision to formulate these concepts around an incarnation of Japan plagued in war with rampant militarism, frantic desperation, and opportunistic greed virtually characterizing each and every denizen stuck within its scorched lands.
Is Ugetsu in actuality a cautionary tale on the destructive outcomes of blind militarism? It seems to be anyway, with each and every pitfall our characters face originating from its chaos. In adapting Akinari's works this message is then tinted in the supernatural, giving it an eerie, almost haunting aura as the restless souls of those afflicted by the casualties of war return to walk again amongst the living but, in a profound (or perhaps deeply depressing) twist, it is not those of the dead who corrupt the lands, but mankind itself. In contrast to the unrelenting, careless brutality of Shibata Katsuie's militia and the film's innumerous opportunistic bandits, the spectral beings of Ugetsu may cause a shock, but they are undoubtedly tinged in sadness and sympathy. Cut too soon from this world, they now become nothing but spiritual manifestations of lost love and lost potential so you really can't help but feel for them, even Lady Wakasa despite how manipulative her actions from beyond the grave became.",5.0
"The first time I watched it, I didn’t take much away from it, except that it was beautifully filmed. This time I noticed some of the themes about war and gender roles that I had read in some analysis of the movie between my two viewings. I’m impressed that a movie can serve as a comment on things like war profiteering and “comfort women”, in response to a war that had ended no more than eight years prior, while adapting short stories published in 1776. The filmmaking is top-notch for sure, but it could also simply be that war never changes.
This movie came out in 1953 and genuinely has the kind of elaborate and flashy camera work that makes the horizons of what passes for stylish today seem like a tiny island in the middle of a lake. I think of the “hidden cut” as something that’s used in over-the-top action scenes today, but I’m almost certain there’s one in Ugetsu that went right past me, because I don’t know how the shot could have been done otherwise (it’s the part near the end where Genjuro returns home, if you know it). The mixture of outdoor shooting with carefully-made sets put me right in the center of the period Japanese setting. Kenji Mizoguchi and crew were able to make a samurai helmet sitting on a table somehow just as menacing as any movie monster, and even the scenes outside of the haunted mansion can be just as harrowing, because Mizoguchi and crew knew that war is hell on earth, no matter what era.
When I try to think of a movie with a similarly epic scope, I’m first thinking of A Touch of Zen, and that movie is twice as long as Ugetsu. So much happens in this 96 minutes that I knew I had to watch it again, and now I understand the acclaim. I no longer think that being a samurai would be awesome.",4.5
"Traiçoeira é a mente humana que sempre encontra seus atalhos ao iludir nossos próprios olhos, cruel é a ganância, essa personalidade universal da humanidade que tanto nos corroeu, e a fantasia, não tendo nada com isso, apenas existe como parte de um folclore marcante, capaz de se untar perfeitamente aos pensamentos humanos, acabando-se assim a possibilidade distinguir o que é crível ou incrível diante de nosso olhos. É por isso que primeiramente Kenji Mizoguchi apresenta e nos leva as ruínas de seus personagens: dois casais amigos e seus filhos, originalmente apenas simples fazendeiros e comerciantes de uma pequena vila durante o Japão feudal, mas que rapidamente encontrariam problemas com uma invasão de soldados dispostos a pilhar e destruir tudo o que vem pela frente, estes seguiriam seus sonhos de subir degraus de suas classes sociais vendendo artesanatos num grande vilarejo, mas suas ganâncias os levam ao caminho oposto, e estes atormentam-se nos labirintos que os próprios traçaram em suas vidas.",5.0
"This meditation on greed and selfishness by Kenji Mizoguchi blew me away. I can’t believe it took me this long to watch a film by Mizoguchi, but now I’m definitely going to dive deeper into his filmography. 
Part ghost story, part period piece, part war film, Ugetsu tells the story of two men who leave their families for their own personal needs. One wants to become a samurai, the other wants to live amongst the upper class and leave his poor lifestyle behind.
I’m finding it hard to formulate words to describe how much I enjoyed this film, from the eerie sound design to Mizoguchi’s wonderful direction, this film exceeds in every field I wanted it to. The characters could have easily been unlikable, but watching their arcs unfold was entertaining and clearly well written. Their motivations both seem to stem from good places, explaining their choices, though not justifying them. 
If you like Japanese cinema at all I couldn’t recommend this more, one of the best I’ve seen in a while.",4.5
"Just another trivial story about men seeking for wealth and fame while home and family stands behind in danger. Showing eternal conflict between feminine and masculine nature with pure, genuine poetry. Directing is so genius and the film eventually becomes so dreamily mysterious that you have no way but to transcend in it.

Mizoguchi certainly is the one who creates his own world integrated with existing problems.",5.0
"Beautiful film parable of ambition, greed and war, and the way these circumstances make two men lose their appreciation for their simple, happy lives and chase dreams that become their undoing. Of course the women and children they leave behind to pursue their goals suffer even more as a consequence.
The highlights and most memorable parts of this film are the men's encounters with female ghosts. In one case, a familiar type of Japanese ghost—a wealthy seductress princess—tries to trap the man with her in endless, possessive, unreal love, until he awakes and escapes. And in the other, the man comes home at last to find the ghost of the wife he abandoned, preparing a meal for him upon his return, caring for him even after she has died.
These ghosts are similar to those in other Japanese films, including Kwaidan.

And just like that ladies and gents, the Oilers move on to the Semifinals for the first time since 2006. I know none of y’all care, but this is truly one of the best nights of my life. 
Anyways.. I picked this movie because I wanted some classic Japanese cinema, and it’s from the director of “Sansho the Baliff” which is pretty high on the Boys Rec list. I love that movie. Now basing on both of these, Mizoguchi is as a phenomenal director. 
You can never go wrong with Edo period Japanese films. Almost all of the ones I’ve seen from that period has been a banger. The era fascinates me beyond explanation. 
  A fantastic story about man’s lust for Money and power. Them stories are always amazing to watch when done well. This was done incredibly.

"UGETSU was my first introduction to Mizoguchi, and it immediately became one of my all-time favorites.
Overall, I enjoy Mizoguchi's subjects (women's duties and oppression in society, the lives of those at the bottom of a social hierarchy, and greed), and those topics are handled here with stunning subtlety, combined with a strong anti-war feeling that is also well-expressed. Mizoguchi, while theoretically a ""period-drama"" expert, was in fact a master at genre-blending studies of human character, and the historic backdrop is enhanced by clever diversions into the supernatural, romance, adventure, and action.
Aside from the main framework, the film features brilliant individual sequences - the photography and performance are both excellent. Kinuyo Tanaka is touching and extremely emotional as always (particularly in her prior performance in Sansho the Bailiff), and she is wonderfully believable - a rare thing for an actress of that era without any obvious ego or formal method. As Lady Wakasa, Michiko Kyo is both wonderfully gorgeous and terrifying.

"Nobility is a phantom.  Men chase their ambitions and greed—with a misplaced sense of what makes someone valuable—at the expense of their wives.
I don’t think this film’s messages are especially interesting or complex in regard to women and gender dynamics, but I did find its more central themes of false nobility to be more thought-provoking.  Genjuro finds his value back in his village, where he can spend his days making his art/pottery, with art as the end rather than as a means to make money or gain status.  However, the romanticization of a pastoral, “simple” life has always to me seemed a romanticization of poverty.  Genjuro “belongs” as a farmer who makes pottery on the side, and will be punished if he tries to improve his family’s standard of living.
There was great use of silhouette and shadows in Genjuro’s ghost story, resulting in creative shots and incredible scenes where the ghost of Lady Wakasa and her servant seem to surround and ensnare Genjuro with darkness.  These scenes give Wakasa power over him, an inversion of the patriarchal power dynamic Genjuro has with his wife.
The film is visually stunning with some fairly interesting themes about value and nobility, but some eye-roll-worthy gender themes (woman becomes prostitute after being raped, and needs her husband to “restore her honor,” which, while still fitting with themes of false ideals of honor/value, is almost insulting to watch; Genjuro leaves behind a simple life with an obedient wife for an enchantress who demands he devote his life to him, an inversion of power that is explicitly presented as a negative) make a viewing of this film tedious at times.  Still, its strengths make this a great movie, and judging the gender dynamics of a 1953 Japanese film adapting traditional Japanese tales is an exercise in stupidity.",4.5

In contrast to the mass appeal of his contemporaries such as Kurosawa, Mizoguchi finds ways to tackle ideas that seem to encapsulate many of the country's concerns at the time, such as the hypocrisy of the Bushido code, the post-war jingoism, and the plight of women. A morally complex, challenging, and deeply effective fable, Ugetsu deserves its place in the pantheon of classic Japanese cinema.
There is something so inventive to the rhythms of Ugetsu, incorporating various frames, sounds, and imagery that feels incredibly fluid. It has a few songs, both eerie to a fault, and there is a theatricality to it all, all of which makes sense considering its an adaptation of a moral tale, with Mizoguchi even opening with text from a scroll. Just how he frames and present his characters is so telling the kind of filmmaker he is, and what he is trying to express. Lady Wakasa enters the scene having an ominous conversation with Genjiro, all in white, and shot from a low angle, an individual who doesn't seem like she belongs, an angelic, otherworldly presence.
A lot has been said about the film's look, the long, extended takes, the black and white cinematography that used light and shadow to depict the relationship between Genjiro and Lady Wakasa. He is able to get so much out of a scene with minimal dialogue, and finds ways to express himself with just his control of tone and sounds. The famous lake scene is eerie, haunting stuff, most of which was shot in a large tank in a studio, but it evokes such a tense feeling, a ride in the river of styx, creating a world of mist and fog.
Though much of Ugetsu's focus is on the two men, and their follies, their ambitions giving way to unnecessary greed, its the women, their characterization that stands out so much here. He explores how their subjugation to patriarchal values and traditions affects not just themselves, but everyone around them. Tobei after becoming a samurai visits a brothel, only to discover his wife has now been forced into prostitution after she was raped by a gang of soldiers. He realizes his foolhardy dream has now been ruined, despite his acclaim and titles. Ugetsu is an evocative piece of cinema, a film that I feel despite my unabashed love for its storytelling, its rich atmosphere and tone, will grow even more as time goes on.",4.5
"There aren't many films that can compete with Ugetsu when it comes to cinematography. It manages to look haunting, but soothing at the same time. A story where the fickleness of the human spirit is laid bare. We think we know what we want, but the cost is oftentimes not worth it. To explain this film is almost futile, this isn't something linear, this is true cinema. Art that needs to be seen to be fully comprehended. The visuals mean as much as the story, if not more. Truly one of the greatest movies ever made.

"""Suffering is always the price of success.""
A few things re: viewing experience. I watched this in two parts (on Sunday and Monday,) and am writing my review on Tuesday. I also had really bad congestion on the first day which was surprisingly distracting.
Overall I really liked it. Maybe my favorite of the month so far. 
The cinematography is excellent, and the mise-en-scéne is put together very carefully, creating these dynamic yet picturesque shots. Fantastic and unique staging, one thing characteristically Mizoguchi being when strong emotions are portrayed, he uses long shots and has the actors turn away from the camera. Even the lighting is beautiful and well-used, especially in the scene were Genjurô returns home. 
The pace, sharply contrasting with the other films I've seen for class recently, is almost too fast. Scenes often consisted of a single interaction, giving it an almost vignetted feel. It was hard for me to get my footing and really soak in what was going on. As with Pather Panchali, once I got into the pacing it wasn't an issue. Lots of slick cuts, and frequently we fade right from one scene to another.
The sound design was really quite haunting. Added a very eerie feel to everything. Distant cries and strange static underscore much of the film. Score and sound design definitely used to elevate the intented response to a scene. 
The acting was really fantastic. I was particularly impressed by the actor who played Ohama, but all of the actors did a pretty amazing job. It really added a lot to my enjoyment. The characters were interesting enough, most had at least one negative element but not in a bad way. It's less about the characters themselves by what the actors and the film do with them.
The plot went by so quickly that I may have missed elements, also I can't really go into detail about the events of the film without spoiling it. The basic premise is that during the war (some early one, not a world war. A civil war maybe?) two peasants set out to find success in the city. Genjurô wants to sell his pottery and make a lot of money. Tobei wants to become a samurai. They each gain much of what they wanted, but it comes at a terrible cost, though the end is optimistic.
That's really the main theme of the film: striving for something you want but losing the good things that you have, as well as being grateful of those things. Romance and gender politics are also present, as well as the evils of war. 
I don't know if I quite makes it to a four and a half but I think it's my favorite film of this month so far. I'd like to rewatch it all in one go, and when I do so I may bump it up. Very good, recommend.

"a rich, multi-layered of greed and thirst for greatness. Mizoguchi's extended takes allow the drama and tension of scenes to flow uninterrupted, heightening their impact. The way the actors use their entire bodies to convey emotions allows for these takes to stay wide, dollying left, right and craning up and down; exactly where the camera needs to be, drawing the viewer into the story.
Very interesting how the narrative provides no easy answers, despite playing out in a seemingly predictable fashion. That predictability here serves only to make the two male leads downfalls all the more tragic. The way the film plays with the ghosts and spirits through magical realism is so potent. Mizoguchi would hold on segments of narrative for so long one would start to question whether what they were watching was real or not, despite there being clear formal and narrative clues to the latter; in particular the leitmotif for supernatural, otherworldly happenings.
Thought the fractured narrative mirroring the breaking apart of the family was very effective. And as we follow these strings as they weave themselves back together for the resolution, it all finishes on one of the most heartbreaking notes I've seen in a film.

However some scenes doesn't really catch me and it didn't really say much. I think there are more things that movie wants to say other than that but because of the runtime they have to cut it.

Disappointing film.",2.0
"This is haunting and tragic, but in a different way than I am used to seeing from Mizoguchi. This one focuses less on fallen women (although there is still certainly some of that with Ohama), choosing instead to follow the two men of the piece, and the consequences of their own foolishness, arrogance and greed. By the end of the film, they are right back where they started, although for Genjuro it means he has now lost his wife.
Unusually for a Mizoguchi (at least the ones I've seen), this has a touch of the supernatural to it. The final scene is Katsuki Manor where Lady Wakasa and her nurse discover Genjuro's deception is truly terrifying, and straight-up horror. This is then wonderfully balanced with the tender and loving scene where Genjuro reunites with his wife and child, only for it to be revealed in the morning that Miyagi had already perished.
Despite the bittersweet ending, this is a nice break from the straightforward relentless tragedy I come to expect from Mizoguchi. By his standards, this is a positively happy conclusion.",5.0

Sansho the Bailiff is one of my all-time favorite films, so I was very excited to explore more of Kenji Mizoguchi's work and have to say that this was pretty great. First of all, I love all the similarities it had with Sansho the Bailiff. For example, the exploration of poverty and those emotional moments with heavy music were beautiful. And I also loved the theme of ambition that propels these characters through the film. But, weirdly enough, I think this film would work better as a short or at least if it had better pacing. I felt like the narrative just moved kind of awkwardly throughout. But all else was amazing.

O recado tá dado. Lindíssimo,4.5
"Complex feelings on this one that i feel will likely improve with rewatches. The first and second act being willing to explore peasant life in all its fucked-up-ness in wartime, especially that of women, is something i give a lot of credit for. It effectively grounds what comes later which never ascends above a level of fantasy, and can even be explained through character perspective. It's well done and the performances are strong enough to carry through. The aspiring samurai meeting his wife again and seeing what she's had to suffer through for his ambitions made me tear up! It's good stuff! Not to mention how fucking haunting the visuals are, screencap city.
Where the complex feelings come in is how long it takes to get to this stuff. The first two acts are good but ease way too slowly into the haunting themes. When they arrive they're interesting, and the soundtrack (Which fucking amazingly blends western classical and Japanese folk with that ROCKIN Sax towards the end) makes them genuinely quite unnerving. There's a pretty solid tone throughout the movie even as it eases itself into the (supposedly) supernatural. But the length of time it takes gives less time to for what should be (in my reading) an unnerving exploration of the haunting effects of war between the clans. It instead becomes more of a stylistic choice, which is fine but disappointing.
The last act is absolutely fantastic though and makes the film entirely worth watching. A really powerful series of scenes with just enough left to the imagination to stick with me and stay on mind for a while. Mizoguchi knew exactly what he was doing with this film i'll say, no doubt in my mind about that.
The effects of war are still explored with solid drama, acting, and direction. The theme of hauntings is also a favourite of mine so might keep this as a rematch list. No masterpiece in my eyes but interesting regardless",3.5

"1st viewing of a 'Kenji Mizoguchi' movie. Ugetsu was made in 1953 and it's way ahead of its time, breathtaking and mysterious. It turns out to be a ghost story, which I was not expecting - the score made this quite haunting in fact with eerie sounds.
I loved the story - focusing on Genjuro and Tobei - both making pots to sell leads to two different stories. Genjuro meeting Lady Wakasa and Tobei fulfilling his goal of becoming a Samurai. However, this runs the risk of destroying their relationships with their wives, Miyagi and Omaha.

If we were contemporaries to these buildings the magic might've been corrupted by reality, we'd be left haunted by the superior albeit imaginary edifices we conjured up in our heads, like a ghost of something greater that never was.
Nonsensical, perhaps, but this film felt like wandering in a forest and stumbling upon the remains of an old house, trying to make sense of the remains and having a pervasive feeling that each creak or wind gust contains a whisper of its hidden past.",5.0
"even though the narrative takes place in the 16th century, the films morals are important across time and can easily be synthesised with our own climate. stories like this are timeless 
there are some moments when the lighting and texture combine to produce this otherworldly mystique, especially when genjurō escapes to lake biwa with the alluring enchantress, lady wakasa in a sequence which flows like a fantasy. there is a sense of wonder, adorned by a fair share of mysticism and low fantasy that make this stand out amid honestly any other film i’ve seen from the 50s besides maybe the seventh seal 
the music, which can get quite atonal and dissonant at times is also very interesting. i think i’d have to watch it again to really take in the sounds and textures

"Ugetsu = U (chuva) + getsu (lua)
Monogatari = histórias
Contos da Chuva e da Lua na tradução literal Ou Contos da Lua Vaga (Japão, 1953) de Kenji Mizoguchi, título oficial, é uma obra-prima onde os contos são as jornadas pessoais de cada personagem. Traz para cada um dos personagens a pungência convencional do cinema de Mizoguchi (na época ele o achou artificial e nem tão forte assim, o tempo mostrou que estava errado). O conto principal é uma bela, sinistra e inesquecível história de dor e redenção com encenação baseada no teatro Noh criado no Japão do século XIV, provavelmente a mesma época em que filme se passa, o que deu um colorido e um estranhamento ideal até o final genial (que Mizoguchi parece ter desgostado) junto com a incrível trilha sonora do Hayasaka (Rashomon, Sete Samurais) propositalmente incômoda pro expectador sentir-se na pele do personagem, mais fantástico impossível.

"“I told you so, but you were too stupid to learn except through misfortune.”
Classic Japanese cautionary tales? Yes please. 
Now I watched this at a screening at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), where they have a program going right now showcasing the cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa, who also worked on the likes of Rashomon, Sansho the Bailiff, Yojimbo, and many more. I’ve seen a couple of those films that he’s worked on before this one, and I have to say that this struck me as the best shot of those I’ve seen. 
Every frame feels painstakingly crafted, using deep focus, clever foreground and background elements, incredibly purposeful lighting choices, and generally insanely good framing to get across additional messages in every scene. And beyond the use of it, it’s just really fucking pretty. I legitimately can think of a decent handful of shots from this film that are beautiful to such a degree that I found myself gasping at their beauty. So yeah, I can see why there’s a whole program dedicated to showing off his work. 
Beyond that, it’s also just a really well made film, with the performances, production design, costumes, makeup, writing, sound design, and every other element that I haven’t yet listed coming together to make a very unnerving experience which really makes you feel like you’re experiencing a great tale of morality. Granted, I saw a 35mm print of the film that wasn’t in the best condition and the subtitles were clearly not as good as they could have been, but adjusting for that technical issue on my end I had the deepest admiration for the skill that went into pulling this film off so well. 
Something that I want to mention in a bit more detail is that this isn’t a complicated film. Like I mentioned already, it’s a cautionary tale of morality, specifically one warning against the dangers of greed in a time of greater, but riskier, opportunity. The characters we principally follow are peasants who are trying to make a living and survive. But when the war provides opportunities for greater profits and illusions of honor to be gained at the risk of suffering at the hands of soldiers looking for villages to pillage, men to forcefully recruit, and women to have, our protagonists think only of the positives to be gained if they get lucky. 
Chasing this foolish dream with no respect for the dangerous situation that a time of war truly is the main focus of this film, which can have its primary theme summarized as “don’t be so ambitious that you lose sight of what’s truly important.” It’s not complicated at all, and it’s quite an important lesson for most-everyone to know, but I’m not sure that it’s straightforwardness is for me.
By this I mean mostly that, while these more simple, stripped down, themes are incredibly effective in their respective stories when used right, I’m scared of not finding much that I haven’t already found in a second viewing, and a part of my scores for films have to do with how much I feel I have yet to get out of a film. Something like The Lighthouse, for instance, I’ve seen 6 times, and every time I’ve gotten more out of it because it doesn’t want to go for a straightforward message, but rather tell a story first and build the message into the story later. Films such as this, where the message is conceived of and then a story is generated to satisfy the components of that message, can feel a bit heavy handed and there’s less room to interpret additional things, even if they’re still super well told and that more singular theme is super interesting. 
So I think my only real problem with this film can be boiled down as me being somewhat spoiled by modern thematic density, which emphasizes themes as inhabiting stories, rather than stories as conduits of themes. It’s a slight distinction, and maybe one that I’ll be more comfortable with as time goes on, but a distinction nonetheless. 
So while I may feel differently on a second viewing, I can’t imagine thinking less of this immaculate film. For another great set of simple Japanese tales of morality, I’d highly recommend Kwaidan, which is something you can easily break into multiple viewings since it’s an anthology film. I was reminded heavily of the style and thematic content by this film, and so if this sounds like it’s good, then check that out too. 
All in all, it’s a great film, and I can tell why it’s so frequently regarded as one of the all-time-greats of Japanese cinema. Check it out and expect beautiful presentation, but not necessarily anything super complicated.",4.0

While I doubt either the film's director or the author of the original source material would likely go so far as I have, I don't think it's a reading too far out of line with the goals of the text. Mizoguchi at the very least makes sure to highlight the power differential between the men and women of this setting, so much so that this disparity seems to be key to the story at hand.
While men stumble into riches and success, riding into town on the backs of their horses, the women of this film make much harder sacrifices, and see no tangible rewards as a result. I'd like to think that at the very least, the sacrifices women make no longer have to be so drastic, but whether or not this translates into every given society on the planet is something I do not pine to discover.",4.5

"Everything that comes from the war cannot be good, and the search for greed becomes even stronger, precisely after the terror of conflicts. The ghostly air is present throughout the work, which can be seen from the beginning. There is no time for family when you are blind by desires and incarnations. A nightmare that simply ended because of random encounters, unexpected things. The entire stylistic choice around melodrama works precisely because it is a picture of family crises, ambition, and transcendence, successfully mixed in Japanese theatrical traditions, which in fact is at the heart of a huge part of Asian cinema.

Tudo que vem da guerra não pode ser bom, e a busca pela ganância se torna mais forte ainda, precisamente, após o terror dos conflitos.

If airlifted and expanded into another film, that half could have made another excellent Mizoguchi feature. Still, as is, the parallel tales of male selfishness yield some of the most extraordinary filmmaking passages I've seen from the director, especially when Genjūrō gets succumbed into the soft, eerie atmosphere of Kutsuki mansion. Sublimely muted ending -- unbearable tragedies occur, but life have to go on -- is a knockout as well.",4.0

"In civil war plagued 16th century Japan, two peasants seek to profit from the ongoing strife around them. Genjūrō (Masayuki Mori), is a pottery maker who abandons his wife and child to sell his wares in the city, whereupon he meets a noblewoman named Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyō) who seduces him at her castle. Meanwhile his brother, Tōbei (Eitaro Ozawa), wishes to be a samurai and leaves his wife to join a clan of samurai. Released in 1953, Ugetsu is a clear allegory to Japan’s wartime experience during the second world war, and is a critique of the greed, pride, and ambition which fuelled Japan’s militarism to the destructive detriment of its people. Appropriately for its subtext, Ugetsu is a ghost story, and a haunting and evocative one at that. Mizoguchi creates rich, almost dreamlike, settings to develop a sense of the supernatural. Most notably is a slow nighttime journey across a lake surrounded by a mystical fog which encircles the boat and creates a haunting and creepy atmosphere. Mizoguchi has great techniques and they’re all on display here, and he is really seasoned in this film in what I consider a masterpiece. Mizoguchi often is overshadowed by his contemporaries at the time, Kurosawa and Ozu, but his talent was just as good as displayed here.",5.0

This movie is going to remain a benchmark and an inspiration for so many aspiring filmmakers and Cinephiles.

The daunting reality behind every perspective in this movie was so hurting and also beautiful. The use of cameras, the use of fogs, the use of bg music, etc was giving a totally different upbeat to the movie.
The representation of the character's life was so lyrically synced with the other plots that it was hard for me to take my eyes away. Watch it till the last sec and you will understand how well crafted it was.",5.0

I think out of this entire challenge so far, Ugetsu is the one I most regret seeing for the first time via streaming at home. This is clearly a work of immense beauty, and watching it I was constantly conscious of feeling like I was supposed to be overwhelmed by what I was seeing. But knowing that something is overwhelming is far different from being overwhelmed.

"Watched this a few days ago so forgive me if my thoughts aren't quite as fresh as I would hope. Overall, I quite liked Ugetsu, though not quite as much as the general film canon dictates I ""should've."" Kenji Mizoguchi's direction is really strong, creating a mix between a dream-like atmosphere and reality. It's rather in the balance of storylines that my interest faltered. Genjuro's journey and new life at Lady Wakasa's house is pretty outstanding, but the interruptions by cutting back to normal life remove much of its power. The constant questions of whether or not she is a ghost or whether it's happening at all are brought down by the reminder of reality. Each of the plotlines are interesting in their own right, but looking at the film as a whole, it doesn't quite rise to the potential that each of them set up.",3.5

"Kenji Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu has one foot steeped deep into the problems and horrors of the real world, poor people suffering the consequences of war in feudal Japan and one foot steeped in the supernatural realm of ghosts wandering to claim the love they never received. More so about how masculine ambitious and desires lead to the downfall of the women in their lives. The men’s personal successes come at the cost of their wives, both suffer a dehumanising fate while their husbands dance in the new found meanings of love and success while forgetting the true meaning of familial responsibilities. With someone’s progress, comes the person who were responsible for it but are never acknowledged. But ultimately their blinding pursuit of selfish desires eventually takes something away from them and forces them to come to the realisation of where they found happiness.
While submerging itself in reality it also has an otherworldly haunting feeling to it in the form of a ghost story. The atmosphere of the interactions with the supernatural is foreshadowed in an earlier scene in a lake covered with mist and the sense of entering into an unknown. When the illusion of what’s real and what’s not is pulled down, the illusion for the character and audience is taken away. My first introduction to Kenji Mizoguchi and I found it be a haunting experience. His visual compositions are gonna stay with me.

"Its handling of fantasy and the supernatural is maybe my favorite stuff about movies.

When Genjuro daydreams of presenting a new kimono to his wife, there's no big dissolve, just the sound of a harp and a cut to their home. The two settings rhyme in their geography and lighting, and Genjuro's back is to us across both realities. There's no flash or gimmick, it just feels good and right.
His shift into Lady Wakasa's ghost world happens with shadows, reflections, swaying reeds and crooked branches. And pacing! One thing about the Sopranos that doesn't get talked about enough is the effect of it's atypical pacing--just that shift from normal TV still feels massive.

"One of the greatest gifts of cinema is based on an apparent contradiction. It immerses us in a dream, an unreal illusion, confuses and deceives us and yet at the same time leads us to an illuminating truth. This is a gift that is intrinsic to art, especially narrative. No matter whether it is literature, theatre or opera. But Kenji Mizoguchi provides more than good arguments that cinema is the most superior art for this discipline.
In fact, the grandmaster adapts other media for this purpose. He interweaves two literary works, one by Guy de Maupassant, one by Ueda Akinari, which also gives the title. Their stories are now interwoven by two couples, poor peasants in 16th century Japan. On the one hand, there are Genjuro and his wife and son. Genjuro dreams of becoming wealthy in the big city, so he busily prepares his pottery for the local market. On the other hand, there is Tobei and his wife. His dream is to become a samurai, but for that he would need all kinds of equipment, which seems unattainable for a poor farmer like him. But when they all set off together to the city to make money with Genjuro's business plans, the dreams suddenly seem to come true.
""Ugetsu"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, as it has three central virtues of cinema in it. Immersive storytelling, craft brilliance, and fundamental truthfulness. For the former, of course, Mizoguchi makes use of the templates in the first instance. From the Frenchman Maupassant, he basically only borrows the motif of greed for rank and name; the humorous punchline is completely omitted. From his compatriot Ueda, he also takes the stories only in fragments and reassembles them, but retains an important core. One of the great virtues of that Japanese classic is its approach to the fantastic ghost stories. It's not about horror, it's about the mystical atmosphere of the sagas. They are so simple and yet vivid and concise that they seem to have been brought from long ago and fit seamlessly into the film world. The concise structure of the stories allows Mizoguchi to cross them, to blur them and to construct a complex, yet in its narrowness always immediately tangible web. Its threads often imperceptibly dip into the unreal, the supernatural, which in its inseparability takes on even more the organic and yet indescribable nature of a dream.
Mizoguchi succeeds in this weaving and condensing through his unique control of the medium. He differs from his no less ingenious contemporaries in that, unlike Ozu, he loves movement and, unlike Kurosawa, he eschews contrasting and fractured expressivity. With Mizoguchi, everything flows. From close-up to half-total, from foreground to background, from room to room, even from garden to thermal bath, to floating fields. All without cuts, at least without noticeable ones. No sensational plan sequences, just an elegant conducting of every single movement, every person, every ray of light. A virtuosity that only Welles or Ophüls can match, but which is even more sublime in Mizoguchi's work because you almost don't notice it. It all happens quite naturally, as if these were unalterable visual counterparts to the simplicity of the old fairy tales.
But Mizoguchi also uses that craftsmanlike finesse to go beyond the legendary, indeed to break with it. For he is, what many neglect, probably cinema's greatest feminist, at least in the first decades of the medium. His films are always about tragic women's fates, about sacrifice, about abuse. Here, too, women are plunged into misfortune by the egoism of men. A subversiveness that is also inherent in the two underlying authors, but is often overlooked, especially in Ueda's case. For Mizoguchi, the pursuit of honour, fame and wealth are inextricably linked to the suffering and ruin of women. Thus the leitmotifs of the epoch, which is thoroughly patriarchal, become misogynistic in themselves. But Mizoguchi goes even further: even the demons and ghosts are women and because of this become victims of men. In this way, he combines the sordid social misery of the prostitute milieu he has studied so much with the supernatural, the fairytale-like. He paints all this against the restless chaos of the eternally raging civil war, which is particularly violent against women. But in doing so, he paints the suffering of the women just as simply and expressively as he does in the stories. Exemplary of this is the terse, even very elliptical, yet nightmarishly disturbing rape scene. Even more remarkable, however, are the refinements towards the end. Then, when Mizoguchi holds the shots longer than expected, subtly changes the light, shifts the focus of the camera, arranges the entire image around the woman. The woman who just sits there, silent, toiling, loving and suffering. These breathtaking moments could be some of the most significant, not only for cinematic feminism, but for cinema in general.
These are all virtues that Mizoguchi's entire oeuvre boasts, often even more opulent, even broader. But ""Ugetsu"" becomes the magnum opus of its creator precisely through its simplicity, through its deliberate concentration of subtle, artful expression. An unrivalled combination of dreamlike sagas with feminist-humanist truthfulness. A work that fully explores the elegance and power of the camera. One that combines image and sound and dream and reality as only cinema can.",5.0
"Rando male film student in 2021:
movies before 1970 are too PG.  
Mizoguchi in 1953: ok, well here’s a really sad and brutal rape scene that will eat your soul and leave you feeling complicit.
Interesting to see how so many male auteurs reckoned with their own masculinity by making devastating pictures about the brutality of men.  We had Fellini with Nights of Cabiria, Lynch with Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and here we have Mizoguchi with Ugetsu (or Life of Oharu, honestly).  I find it genuinely beautiful that a movie in 1953 gave men their due course, that they can be incredibly violent towards women and selfish in their material pursuits.  Yet, it’s absolutely harrowing that we are still reckoning with this sort of violence globally; I say that as a man trying to improve every day. Nevertheless, I find it staggeringly beautiful that films like this explore that collective trauma, even if it hits devastatingly hard.",5.0

"A quite beautiful moral fable about two men whose ambitions for wealth and power lead them to the brink of destruction. 
The tale -- and Ugetsu monogatari means roughly The Tale of Ugetsu -- is set during a sixteenth century civil war in Japan. Two poor men, neighbours, abandon their wives and children in pursuit of advantage: one, a potter, to sell his wares and make a small fortune, and the other to become a samurai. Both act from good motives -- to better provide for their families -- but rashly. Theirs are classic cases of imprudence.
But the story takes an unexpected supernatural turn. This threw me for a time; the tone of the film became unstable, or unfamiliar because unexpected, but gradually stabilized as the contours of the tale came into clearer view. 
There are really only two ways for stories like this to end: death, or salvation. We get a little of both, but primarily the latter, and it is beautifully handled. 
Technically, the film is reminiscent of other Japanese films of this era. Picture quality is not great, but is good enough. Mizoguchi prefers not to get too close to the characters, and I found the mise en scene sometimes a little drab, but overall the pacing and structure is excellent. A delightful film.",4.0

"It's very interesting how Mizoguchi articulates a proposal that reconciles, in a certain measure, a certain thematic traditionalism with a formal inventiveness. Each image, transitioning between a darker aesthetic and a clearer and sharper one, intuitively understands this relationship in which the film is placed, on the threshold between the natural and the supernatural. A game of forces that senses this essence of human tragedy very well, both in its miserable aspect and also when it encounters a greedy and illusory fugacity (and the consequences of submitting to something unreal). With this, the film assumes this relationship between physics and spirit as its central motto, always establishing connections that emphasize this duality (the only way in which the film builds its decoupage recovers this principle). A beautiful (and tragic) study on greed.",5.0

"It is astonishing how much a movie purportedly about the ambition of men is actually about the women. Sure, one can think of the film as being about the time-honored tradition of taking care of the women and how without you, the man of the house, they cannot survive, but I choose not to look at it that way because I want to like Ugetsu.
I choose to see Ugetsu as such because men stepping on the shoulders of women to get ahead is such a prominent critique in modern feminism. And here, there is such callous disregard for the well-being of the wives and it is incredibly believable.
Would the women have been spared rape and death if only there husbands were there? And why have our societies, as far back as the 16th century and centuries before that, been established in such a way that it is the men that can pave their own path in life but the women who cannot make it alone without either expiring or turning to prostitution?
That being said, I am still uncomfortable with the morale of the story. Because it sure feels like it is to appreciate what we have without wishing, and working for, a better life. But are we really meant to believe that these peasants should not try to better their lives? Should they truly be happy staying where they are? To be happy with their place in society? All of that made it seem like a fable created by rich men to try and keep poor ones in their place.
As for the technical aspect of the film, I cannot state enough how quickly stunning cinematography wins me over. And it was stunning in Ugetsu. The shots were carefully crafted, the black-and-white added to the eeriness of the fantastical scenes, and especially to the scene wherein the four main characters come across the man warning them of pirates.

It obviously looks amazing, but even though I liked it quite a bit, I don’t think it’s one that I will revisit or think about a ton, anytime soon.",4.0
"For the most part, for me, this is another film which I love that thrives on intangible factors. But, for this space, I'll try and highlight some some stand-out specifics that contribute. One obvious part is the atmosphere. It is intoxicating. Some beautiful silhouettes, and cracked & rotten scenery filling the frames. And that mist! Why don't more filmmakers utilise mist?? It's so cinematic! These are some of my favourite characters, and situations, from this era of Japanese cinema too. There's something really genuine and engaging about these people, even when the film hits those common moments of theatricality. And finally, well, it's just a thoroughly great story. Finally watched my first Mizoguchi. Looking forward to checking out more.",4.5

"Eerie, arresting, and seamlessly fantastic. Everything from the score to the visuals to the story itself is in a constant flux of real and fantastic. It is mesmerizing and spooky without surrendering to many (hardly any) of the devices and tropes of horror or even traditional ghost-stories. The way the camera moves is spellbinding a helps merge things together in a way that feels like gliding through a dream.
Beautiful and painfully sad.",4.5
"Ugetsu is a very haunting story which is brought to life wonderfully through the cinematic medium. This films creepy and bleak tone is an interesting match to its wartime setting, as it seems the stories contents are all a part of a cohesive darkness and pessimism. There are many themes which are explored in this film, but the film does an excellent job balancing all of them with one solid tale. The 16th century Japanese time period is reproduced amazingly in this film, as everything from the clothing to architecture has an authentic quality. One of the most beautiful parts about this story is the score, which is both wonderfully diverse and insanely interesting. There are moments of very experimental percussion as well as epic themes produced by old Japanese instruments. This film has a disconsolate tone that becomes more intense as the story goes along, Ugetsu is a dark journey.

"UGETSU MONOGATARI (1953)
Absolutely gorgeous morality play based on classical Japanese myth, I was told it was a ghost story and assumed its horror elements were more prominent than they were - not a great Halloween pick in hindsight, but a great enough movie to be worth it.
Mizoguchi's framing and mise-en-scene are stunning and a very clear inspiration for Onibaba and Kuroneko even before the themes, which are similar enough that the three feel like a trilogy; this is not a bad thing, movies about how shit the sengoku period were with a focus on female perspectives are probably the most specific set of things that are My Shit that these movies cater to with aplomb.
Kurosawa's shadow looms over every old Japanese movie I watch - I think Mizoguchi's camerawork is superior, but Kurosawa's editing and ability to draw out performances is something that is decades ahead of his contemporaries and his mastery over transitions is sorely missed here.
Not quite a great horror pick, but a nice breather in the midst of the offal; a supernatural morality tale with an ending that'll stick with me for a long, long time, even if it's a little clunkily exposited between the heartbreaking emotional beats.",4.5

"It’s a film full of masterful film making techniques. Embedded with dark themes of war, fantasy and famine. Perhaps a film that is shown in a film school a lot, and rightly so. 
It is notorious for using the mi se scene extensively. The camera movement is brilliant and almost unheard of, for the time.  
Also works as an effective ghost story, which took me by complete surprise.

"El propósito del cine llegados los años 50 es distanciarse de la construcción de un nuevo arte, y adentrarse en reglas ya establecidas, para poder 'romperlas' desde dentro. De ahí que a final de década nazca la nouvelle vague, que en el '57 Hitchcock filme su obra suprema ""Vértigo"" y que Kenji Mizoguchi decida darle un giro extraordinario e imprevisible al género jidaigeki en ""Ugetsu Monogatari"". En este último caso, el que me atiene hoy, no solo Mizoguchi le da una vuelta de tuerca perfecta (e impredescible a la vez que natural) a un género prestablecido, sino que además lo hace para contar otra de sus historias sobre el patriarcado y el rol de la mujer en la sociedad. Supongo que se puede afirmar, y esto pensando en el crecimiento de la importancia del feminismo durante aquella década, que es un momento en el que el director se da cuenta que las películas que realizó anteriormente pueden empezar a ser consideradas películas obvias y anti-simbólicas. En alguna de mis anteriores críticas lo dije con claridad: ""si X película de Mizoguchi (de los años '40) hubiese salido en esta época, sería la película con temática más prefabricada y obvia en la historia del cine, pero como salió en los '40 funciona a la perfección"". Y es con ""Oharu"" y con esta película, que Mizoguchi lleva la discusión antipatriarcal (con todo lo que conlleva: antibelicismo, estudio sobre las relaciones, el honor de los samuráis) a un terreno muchísimo más simbólico, de manera totalmente acertada.
""Ugetsu"" es, entonces, una película que se da un contexto en el cual el feminismo se empieza a asentar en la cultura general (disculpen por aquellos y aquellas que crean que crearon el feminismo en el año 2018) de manera tal que para tratar una temática puramente anti-patriarcal, es necesario llevarla únicamente al terreno simbólico. Y es por eso que en esta película no vemos a Madame Yuki gritando ""¡¿Por qué he nacido mujer?!"" (lo cual se justifica, repito, por el año en el que se estrena la película) ni vemos a Saoirse Ronan en ""Lady Bird"" decir ""Quiero que seas la mejor versión de vos misma"" (tampoco tenemos a Timonthy Chalmet, lo cual es de agradecer). Y de alguna manera, todo lo simbólico que había en la trilogía de la mujer de Mizoguchi, también se presenta acá de manera excepcional.
Entonces, ""Ugetsu"" se podría comenzar definiendo como un 'truncado camino del héroe' presentado en tres historias paralelas.
Por un lado tenemos la historia de Genjuro, la cual se podría considerar de cierta manera la historia principal. El hombre que abandona a su familia (por el propósito que sea; aunque en este caso incluso se hace un juego entre lo legítimo y la excusa) y de alguna manera se tienta con la idea de tener una vida mejor, dispuesto a hacer lo que sea necesario para conseguirla. Es lo que hoy en día llamaríamos un ""emprendedor"". ¿Qué representa (simbólicamente) la mujer fantasma? Todo se esfuma. Y Genjuro queda solo con su hijo, que termina dejándole comida a su madre muerta. Es el ciclo interminable de la figura patriarcal (no como se la entiende ahora; interpretación totalmente nefasta de mi generación).
La segunda historia es la de Tobei: un campesino que desea ser samurai. Mientras que Genjuro es el 'hombre patriarcal' (eso no quiere decir machista, que no se malinterprete) por definición, Tobei es la persona que desearía ajustarse a su figura idealizada del 'hombre'. Esta historia en sí es uno de los comentarios antibélicos mejor llevados a cabo en el cine. No es casualidad que cuando Tobei se logra convertir en samurai, no es por haber realizado un acto heroíco, sino por haber finjido uno. ¿Tobei quería ser samurai o quería poder adecuarse a su rol en la sociedad patriarcal?
La tercer historia es la de Ohama, esposa de Tobei y hermana de Genjuro: mujer dejada al azar y que de la noche a la mañana se convierte en prostituta. Ejercer la prostitución es de alguna manera la forma de Ohama de tomar consciencia de su posición de mujer en la sociedad que plantea la película.
Por último, tenemos el agregado de la historia de Miyagi, que es la otra cara de Ohama. Cuando es dejada a la suerte, con un hijo, y no logra tomar consciencia del rol que cumple, muere.
La película empieza con Genjuro y Tobei 'dejando' a sus familias para ir a comerciar. Termina con las familias unidas, pero con el coste de haber perdido a Miyagi en el transcurso de la película.
En fin, una película única, donde todo cumple una función en orden del cine.",5.0
"One of the best Ghost stories i have seen. It is deep in its meaning which discusses about envy and greed and love and war and family. In relatively short running time compared to its deeper themes, this is an impressive film. Photographed in breathtaking beauty, it takes the viewer in rural ancient war riddled japan in a journey of two brothers who try to make their ambitions and desires a reality.
Rumored to be drawn on the life of the director’s personal experiences, this film is filled with magical camera movements, great performances, flawless editing, remarkable production and costume designs and great direction.
It is simply one of the greatest films one can see and appreciate the great cinematic works of Japan and more specifically Mizoguchi.",5.0
An ambitious movie about how dangerous ambitions can be,4.5
"This was another masterpiece from Mizoguchi, and while it's not quite on the same level as Sansho it's very, very close.
What strikes me with all of Mizoguchi's film is his profound sympathy for and delicate depiction of female suffering and sacrifice. While the lead character of this film is a man, the film is about his relationships with women.
The men in this film are dazzled by their dreams, which make them lose track of what they actually have.

"Who hasn't felt the pull of the ghost world? Whether or not Mizoguchi and co. consciously endorsed the narrative's warning, disguised as a critique of greed, against becoming discontent with one's lot (there is also the Mother Courage-esque interdiction against war profiteering), Ugetsu seems ripe for all kinds of allegorical readings and misreadings. In my quarantine-inflected depressive slump, something definitely not helped by my having taken up movie-watching as a primary past time, Lady Wakasa's manor becomes a convenient handle for cinema, the cinematic, the world of images, etc. Just watching movies forever, like I've already crossed over...",4.0
"My 2nd Mizoguchi . . . and what a stunner.
I luck out by having only seen the restoration (which must be magnificent, cuz dang the detailed composition in this is mesmerizing).
It makes me understand his themes ala Street of Shame more, and makes me want to watch that one again. Mizoguchi comes off from these two films like a precursor to Von Trier, but with a humanist sentiment.
This one's a thorough anatomy of desire and suffering as some metaphysical element to humanity's existence. It even transcends the border of life and death a couple times here. War, lust, ambition, greed self esteem, fear. All seen as parts of some engine that drives us through our days. But still needs to be handled, steered, maintained and monitored. Fuel for function, but also constantly threatening as fuel for destruction.
Loved all the super low level crawling crane shots. War rarely is portrayed so locally, so private even, so much like a plague of madness and hazards, working its regeneration through other human beings.

"This film needed to be longer; certainly we don't spend nearly enough time trapped in Lady Wakasa's doom-palace with Genjūrō. Dude ducks away from the horrors of the present tense (ironically taking shelter in the numbed-out horrors of the past-tense), but the film's moving too fast (and constantly cross-cutting with Tōbei) for us to get unstuck in time alongside him. We watch his journey from unwilling prisoner to happily forgetting his old life/wife purely from the outside, so it's hard not to feel a little dispassionate/no-fucking-shit when he's jarred back to reality in what-would-otherwise-be a perfect ending. Given Mizoguchi's long history of capturing ruinous patriarchal stupidity on film, you could certainly argue the guy did this on purpose— deliberately forestalling empathy for these losers. Certainly Tōbei is made to look like a goofy dumbass with his military dreams, so there's no real reason to gaze differently on Genjūrō's chilled-out hedonism. Still, those social critiques are so obvious/surface level when compared to the complex network of male-shitiness in Osaka Elegy or Crucified Lovers, that I can't help but feel Ken-G woulda drawn more blood if he'd implicated the audience by tricking us into initially liking these dudes.

"This is a cool morality fable about male delusion and condescension, complete with some real hall of fame cinematography from Kazuo Miyagawa (who shot Rashomon, which sees its stars reunited here). One of the most frequently mentioned movies by directors (and Roger Ebert) as a favourite, Ugetsu is a gift that keeps on giving when it comes to unique scenarios, each practically a discussion question of ethical or civic complexity.
Kenji Mizoguchi is one of the ten or so canonical masters for whom no backlash wave could ever even catch on believably. His style is harder to put to words than Kurosawa or Ozu; many of his films feel like classic tense dramas that could nonetheless break into fighting or tearful waterworks any moment. Here, his approach to an ensemble with thematically inseparable stories carves a path for Altman's best, while the women's slow, quiet escapes from toxic, selfish men presages so much conflict in the oeuvre of Scorsese (who naturally adores this film).
Mizoguchi and Miyagawa are unfairly stacked in skill for shot compositions, with props and water ripples and reed plants punctuating the corners of the action, and usually someone deliberately cutting in and out of the frame during someone else's conversation. Every blocking choice rivets, and you get a Deadwood-like mental map for this thoroughfare in just an hour and a half. That lean runtime also contrasts most of the Japanese art film canon and in some ways contributes to this leaving such a satisfying aftertaste; esoteric and grueling can combine to some of the toughest watches and the most impenetrable.
Another great thing about Ugetsu is that its status as a ghost movie is kind of incidental. It sort of functions as an extra aspect to this class and marriage story, then wraps itself around the margins to amplify ideas of resentment and unfinished business and omens (the things ghosts always are really there for) as the movie reaches its landmark ending.
This is weirdly great fodder for a fairly faithful lowbrow modern studio comedy American remake about rival-frenemy neighbours and/or companies with, like, Jason Bateman.
Our ambitions make us assholes. That's a bold, absolute baller lesson for a pantheon director to include in his magnum opus.

"There is always such a strong sense of mysticism In Kenji’s films that make his film so dreamy, haunting, and bewitching. I don’t think I have ever seen a filmmaker able to closely imitate the atmosphere of Kenji’s films. When it came to such films like Sansho the Baliff I was just deeply devastated (and every time I watch it, it makes me want to cry and tear my arms out) but Ugetsu was a bit different.

"Mizoguchi é um dos cineastas japoneses mais famosos, sendo até dito por muitos, um dos diretores mais ""japoneses"", comparando com Kurosawa e outros. Assim, aqui ele traz a história de um Japão feudal, acompanhando a vida de dois casais tentando enriquecer em meio a miséria. Sua abordagem para a narrativa parte de um olhar tradicional e sobrenatural, criando um sentido bem ilusório da imagem.

Do mesmo modo que acontece em outras obras do diretor, a relação do espaço com as personagens aqui é de extrema importância. Com isso, ele traz um aproximação bem íntima do espectador para com o cenário e ambientação atravéz, principalmente, de seus planos sequências (sem cortes), expondo uma relação de tempo muito continua com o físico e com as emoções das personagens. Assim, ele trança uma ligação muito forte entre o carácter sentimental e o material da cena, gerando uma nova noção de realidade ali presente.
Buscando essa nova perspectiva sobre a imagem, Mizoguchi desafia a percepção de seu espectador por meio de um transe psíquico, prendendo o público junto do personagem em um cenário imersivo. Toda essa visão, combina na narrativa em si, uma vez que, as personagens nós são mostradas, os homens principalmente, como figuras muito cegas e gananciosas, alienadas a um objetivo egocêntrico, não enxergando o que está em volta, fracassando como maridos e com sigo mesmos.
As mulheres nos filmes do diretor sempre tomam um papel e um simbolismo muito central, aqui se percebe ainda o destaque, principalmente na resiliência a elas colocadas em meio ao sofrimento que passam, mas as protagonistas caminham mais a margem da história, nem sempre presentes fisicamente mas com um peso dramático que move o todo.
Isso tudo é transposto dentro de um cenário bem cultural e tradicional, mas com uma certa mística quase sempre presente, que se mescla de forma bem orgânica e funcional na narrativa. Dessa forma, o cineasta, estipula quase que um jogo de realidades, mas sem perder o foco naquilo que ele mais comenta em sua filmografia, a relação da felicidade, ou a busca dela, em meio a miséria.",5.0

Apparently this was made as by Mizoguchi as a way of expressing his regret for making pro-war propaganda films earlier on in his career.

"Based in the Warring States period of 16th century Japan, Ugetsu also occupies a kind of fairy-tale world of ghosts and rapid rises and falls in fortune. The central characters are peasants, rather than samurai, and the war is a chaotic backdrop to the men’s rash attempts to better their condition.
With a relatively simple plot, Ugetsu gains its classic status through the execution, and the cinematography plays a major part. There are some moments where the lighting and texture combine to produce this perfect otherworldly mystique and then the music, which becomes quite unnerving at times.",4.0

"++some very cool shots: opening and final shots (technically and thematically), fog on the lake, candles being lit in the manor, transition from the hot spring to the field, sudden camera motion when wife is attacked on the beach, subtle pushes and pulls in long takes throughout (I'm remembering one in particular in the manor
++the eerie, mystical atmosphere was pretty compelling and unique, fantasy elements incorporated well - built powerfully into returning home to a ghost
+the theme of short-sighted ambition (often masculine) and it's consequences on those most vulnerable (here, women) when the drive is there and the blinders are up is a resonant one
--however the movie has a fable-y lightness to it with morals clearly stated and obsessions put bluntly, heavy-handedness aside despite the admirable message and impressive camerawork facilitating a mood which advanced it, limited by thin characters - in a similar vein certain things were strangely jumped over (though obviously cast as horrific, the aftermath of rape and falling into sex work was papered over super quickly)",3.5

Like a good Twilight Zone episode it has a distinct style. What on paper is a simple story, the cinematography elevates it to a heavier story, especially in the ending. 
I was at times a little confused as to what was going on, this is in part to a little of jumping around between the parallel stories. It also has a dreamlike quality but instead of feeling ethereal it felt confusing for me. The female characters are there to be part of the morality tale, and the fable while visually striking is surface level. 
With the castle scenes you can tell there’s something off, the boat scene and the ending are the highlights. I wasn’t affected too much by it, I think because of the period setting first, and the dialogue/metaphors were a little too on the nose.",4.0

"I strongly strongly feel that Ugetsu demands a rewatch as it was fantastic yet I was ever so slightly underwhelmed. I see the blueprints for a masterpiece, I have never witnessed such a well crafted crafted atmosphere, splicing a paranormal touch to a mystic feel, intertwined with an incredible narrative looking at our temptations of greed and power and how they are often false idols. Matched with not only a beautiful use of the craft to capture the atmosphere as I spoke about but also just smart, and very possibly revolutionary in its own small ways.
So I will be rewatching soon because I see no reason for this film not hitting me full on. I paused the film a few times in the middle and shit, I'm watching in the middle of the day etc. I'm sure there's a lot of variables that threw the experience off but I will very soon return to it.",0.0

"After I finished this, I turned it off and thought that it was pretty good, kinda weird and kinda depressing, but pretty good. Then I sat there for five minutes and realized holyshitwhatthehelldidijustwatch????????
The story's simple - two guys try to get rich and it backfires. It focuses mostly on Genjuro, who leaves his wife and kid at home while he goes to sell his pottery. He seems to forget they exist when he starts obsessing over another woman. This was frustrating, especially because of how much he loves his wife and goes out of his way to do nice things for her. This was part of a larger, more complex character arc, but I still wanted to yell at him. 
The other guy, Tobei, really wants to be a samurai and his wife thinks he's an idiot. His wife is right. The samurai in this movie were not portrayed favorably at all. To put it mildly, they abuse their power in all the worst possible ways. They're a constant threat to all the inhabitants of Tobei's village, and they're what makes this film so damn hard to watch. 
It's sort of a strange mix between 1500s(?) wartime politics in Japan and the supernatural. The supernatural bit isn't scary, but it's unsettling. The music is kind of indistinct, but there's always one instrument or one note that feels a little out of place, and during these scenes, it's not totally clear if we're supposed to be creeped out or if we're just supposed to accept it. It's a lot easier to handle than some of the samurai bits, but it's definitely eerie. 
This is my first Mizoguchi film, so I'm not sure where this stands among his other works. It's pretty slow and not super uplifting, but it's got this indescribable quality to it that makes it impossible to stop thinking about yet it evades full comprehension. Sort of the feeling I get after watching Parasite. I want to watch it again, but I don't know whether I can handle it. I'll at least give it a few days to sink in more.",4.5

The scenes at Kutsuki mansion felt at times like I was watching a horror film, the atmosphere was so unsettling.
Machiko Kyō gives the standout performance of the film has the enchanting spirit Lady Wakasa, and with her final scenes in the film she feels as scary as most horror villains. The entire cast is doing a good job in the film, especially the female cast members who do a lot of the heavy emotional lifting. Mitsuko Mito and Kinuyo Tanaka both give emotional performance as wives suffering for their husbands bad decisions.

Ugetsu is one of those ""everything"" films, it's funny, upsetting, uplifting, tragic, action packed, slowly paced, there is something here for everyone, and it is a rollercoaster in a way only the best films tend to be.

"My favorite thing about this Kenji Mizoguchi masterpiece is the pace, which makes it more accessible to modern audiences. Every scene counts and it has to with a run time of 1 hour and 37 minutes. Mizoguchi is able to explore themes of love, lust, betrayal, and greed as well as implement elements of Jidageki, horror, and fantasy. The cinematography is also stunning; many wide shots resemble traditional Japanese Woodblock prints. Additionally, Mizoguchi and Kazu Miyagawa (cinematographer) make excellent, but sparingly, use of the telephoto lens. Mizoguchi is able to put this all together and have the plot constantly move forward and engaged the audience.
Takeaways: Great use of deep focus. Excellent acting. Great score and great use of score to heighten emotion; great timing as well. Fast pace. Noh theater.
Influence on Future Films: There is a chase sequence where there is excellent framing and deep focus used for comedic effect emulated in Marvel movies.",5.0

"Kenji Mizoguchi matches two worlds that we may think are completelly opposing but, paradoxically, can only exist side by side in ours. Both, intrinsic creations of human beings. The first one is the war, showing how the lifes and personalities of four characters are affected by It. The second one, the fantastic, magical or unreal part of our history that has been walking with us through all these years and has taken different forms like inherited beliefs or legends, but always remaining essential for us to live.
The filmmaking is the same as usual, but the inserts of fantastic elements in a Mizoguchi movie, not very common in his films, is blended in a way that enriches those two worlds, making the one presented here unique among his other ones.
For what I have seen, this might be his best one, do not miss It. A true masterpiece.",5.0

"The first Mizoguchi film I saw, Sansho the Bailiff, was a big turning point in my journey with Japanese cinema, one of the first ones I really connected with emotionally. Can Ugetsu do the same?
I wish I could say yes, but this one stopped just short of being a similar transcendent experience, yet I don't want to call it the end of my story with it just yet. I think on a rewatch, this will move up, maybe WAY up.
Ugetsu tells of a potter (Genjuro) and his family and friends in a small village during unsettled times. A neighboring warlord is rampaging across the country, burning villages and conscripting men as he goes. Genjuro and his little cohort manage to escape the army when it comes through, but get separated shortly thereafter. His friend Tobei dreams of becoming a famous samurai and pursues that with his portion of Genjuro's sales, leaving his disapproving (but wiser) wife Ohama behind. Genjuro's wife and son he abandons on the shores of the river feeling they'll be safer that way (which is so very stupid I almost couldn't take it).
Then the movie takes ghostly turn I wasn't expecting as Genjuro happens upon a mysterious mansion and ends up drawn into a relationship with the Lady there. I was still so angry with him for leaving Miyagi and their son behind that I couldn't really go along with much of this, plus not expecting there to be an otherworldly element threw me off. I think on a rewatch and knowing how it ends, all of this will play better for me.
I did like the resolution, which had a bittersweet quality that I loved. That's why I think a rewatch would move it up a lot. For now, this is how it ranked on Flickchart:
Ugetsu > The Woman in Black
Ugetsu < Seven Psychopaths
Ugetsu > Freaks
Ugetsu > Face/Off
Ugetsu < The Shootist

"A return visit to the only Mizoguchi I had seen before the last two years. The examination of the woman’s role in Japanese society continues here, the fate of these two women being perhaps a good deal harsher than I would have liked. The camerawork is a departure from the gliding movements that so diligently scope out the space in films such as STORY OF THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUMS and LIFE OF OHARU. The movement is subtle, e.g., gliding through the weeds slowly as it follows escaping villagers. It struck me more as a study in light and dark. The ending of the film packs an emotional punch.",4.5

"Some of the simplest shots are astonishing in how much poetry and beauty they convey. 
Goddamn am I tired of being reminded how much sexual violence there is in Japanese arthouse films. The Ballad of Narayama (the original) and Kwaidan managed to make it through without any heavily implied rape, why did this need it? Oh, speaking of...
Mizoguchi was a Whedon-style fake-feminist asshole, by the way. He directly recommended against the Japanese Directors' Guild giving actress Tanaka Kuniyo being given a directing assignment she'd prepared hard for, a move that could have negatively impacted her career if they hadn't just given it to her anyway (at a time when there were very few female directors. Compare to Ozu, who vouched for her personally.) Tanaka never forgave him, and never found out why he did it. Any speculation is thus unfounded. That admitted, let's be real here. Mizoguchi's actions mirror a tiresome pattern among male creators in positions of power who feel their dominance or control over their female associates threatened. 
For all that Mizoguchi is touted as a feminist, any analysis of Sansho the Bailiff and this film will reveal how all their female characters' suffering is used to comment on their male leads' stories. Those that do directly spotlight women often indulge in misery porn, which could just as easily be read as another form of fetishization rather than a display of empathy and solidarity. This is not to say that the positive aspects of Mizoguchi's work, such as the reform-inspiring impact of Street of Shame, should be disregarded, any more than the positive influence of Joss Whedon's should be. But just as Whedon fired an actress for being pregnant among other examples of shitty behavior, Mizoguchi's actions and the attitudes they reveal should be taken into consideration when engaging with him and his work.
Also, if I'm being honest, I haven't particularly liked any of the other Mizoguchi films I've watched or tried to watch since Ugetsu. But for all its faults, Ugetsu is still very good.",3.5

"Ugetsu parece ser uma fábula medieval japonesa. Seus personagens, sua narrativa e seus arcos dramáticos são bem delineados e esclarecidos, trazendo mensagens específicas de moralidade. Na obra de Kenji Mizoguchi os dois homens protagonistas se envolvem em pecados como luxúria, ganância e soberba, desviando-se de seus objetivos primários e causando o sofrimento de suas esposas. Fantasmas e maldições convivem em tempos de guerra num Japão do século XVI. A câmera de Mizoguchi adota um estilo fluído de movimento que lembra o cinema clássico hollywoodiano, e me falta conhecimento para saber qual deles influenciou o outro.
Os protagonistas de Ugetsu enxergam na guerra uma oportunidade para fazer dinheiro, contando com as habilidades em cerâmica de Genjuro. Entretanto, quando os perigos do conflito chegam em sua vila, suas prioridades parecem se inverter. O esforço para salvar e posteriormente vender as cerâmicas os distancia de suas esposas, que tentam sem sucesso tirar os esposos de seus caminhos maliciosos. Genjuro sonha com riquezas, Tobei com a vida de samurai. Nenhum deles prioriza o bem-estar de seus entes queridos.
Ugetsu é no fim das contas um filme de mensagem simples e personagens bem delineados, com uma narrativa que passa sua mensagem sem maiores dificuldades. Não é uma experiência arrebatadora à primeira vista, mesmo que conte com alguns visuais bastante memoráveis, como a travessia pelo rio enevoado. A identidade visual de Mizoguchi é impressionantemente polida, mas sua fábula distintamente japonesa não me arrebatou. Diferenças culturais, talvez?",3.0

Escrevendo agora, algumas coisas que me vêm à cabeça:
Guerra trás o pior das pessoas. Final é de enterrar os mortos e reconstruir. Lembrar os mortos.
Ciclo e vida. Aceitação e tristeza.
Condenação da ganância, claro.
Gostei que os desejos e transformações dos personagens são muito claros e sem grandes elaborações individuais. A questão passa a ser mais a passagem disso para um filme.
O que mais me impressionou é como esse filme é forte, como ele consegue tocar…
Acho que o filme tem muito isso de uma ilusão. O fantástico é isso: os espíritos que enganam. E é uma ilusão de que devemos ser “mais do que somos”. O ponto parece ser uma aceitação da vida no momento e não uma ambição desenfreada que impede essa vida. Trata-se de um certo tradicionalismo de Mizoguchi (eu acho), que, se de um lado, implica numa aceitação do status quo, de outro busca criticar a ascensão individual e a ambição pessoal como valores. O valor real da vida está na família, no trabalho em si (e não pelos seus frutos como riqueza) e na aceitação do mundo como é. Acho também muito interessante como o sofrimento é uma forma de aprendizado. Mas, ao mesmo tempo, esses erros têm consequências reais (morte da esposa).
De novo, sem dúvidas, um dos meus filmes favoritos agora.",5.0
"Much stronger Mizoguchi for me than Sisters of the Gion, benefiting greatly from an intimacy (perhaps purposefully) omitted from that one. 
The samurai raiding the village is one of the few times I can think of (Come And See being another obvious example I can remember) where the terror of the villagers about to lose their lives is communicated perfectly, and that’s perhaps due to Mizoguchi’s seeming anti-authoritarian stance. These samurai are not noble warriors in the service of great leaders—they are scoundrels, murderers, thieves and rapists, as most armies have been throughout history. 
Genjuro’s fate hurt. Beautifully done.

"Cuentos de la luna pálida de agosto es una obra maestra audiovisual de uno de los más indiscutidos maestros japoneses de la historia del cine: Kenji Mizoguchi. Esta película, adaptación de un kabuki clásico, narra la melodramática historia de dos campesinos, Genjûrô (Masayuki Mori) y Tôbee (Eitaro Ozawa) que, ansiando alcanzar la utópica felicidad para ellos y sus seres queridos, se embarcan en una epopeya de tintes fantásticos movida por un pecado: la codicia. Mizoguchi traza dos líneas argumentales correlativas con una maestría asombrosa (es sabido por muchos que esta es su obra cumbre), elevando el uso del maquillaje a lo más bellamente artístico, al igual que en el kabuki tradicional, y empleando claroscuros que rozan en calidad las más laureadas obras de Caravaggio. Se trata de un cuento crítico, profundo y sincero, que retrata la situación de un proletariado ignorante y trabajador que se vio avasallado por el shogunato y sus respectivos samuráis imperantes en aquella ya lejana sociedad, haciendo que los más humildes fueran conducidos a tomas de decisiones desesperadas por el bien familiar. No le pongo más nota (8,5) porque no he llegado a conectar con sus personajes, en especial, con Tôbee, añadiendo que el final me ha dejado más bien frío, no obstante, dejaré que Mizoguchi me cuente este cuento por segunda vez.

That beauty is undercut by the intensely physical acting present in many of the scenes, showing the brutality of war and precarious positions our characters find themselves in.

"A gorgeous depiction of greed, war, and the suffering that these things bring. Set during a civil war in 16th century Japan, we follow the lives of peasants as they attempt to reverse their fortunes. Our protagonists are weak and desperate, but their anemic attempts at clawing their families out of poverty make them as much understandable everymen as they are gullible fools.
We see human beings at their most depraved; bands of soldiers loot and rape villagers, men frantically attempt to improve social status through glory and wealth, and forsaken souls gravely cling to the corporeal world due to their unfulfilled dreams. It blends fantasy and reality in the fashion that only vintage Japanese films can, drifting between uneasy paradise and desolation. Although only a small portion of the film delves fully into the supernatural, there is an ethereal quality to the camera movement and editing that permeates every frame. This is best characterized by the mesmerizing trip across a misty river, a small wooden boat drifting through the ominous fog.

The camera work is patient and steady. Cuts are infrequent, and  we are treated to a litany of clever sequence shots where the camera moves deliberately and elegantly from one figure to the next. Because the images are presented in patient and thorough fashion, it allows us to fully absorb in the misery or occasional fleeting joy that we are witnessing. Mizoguchi's camera gazes intently at the bowed bodies, the hunched forms beaten down by sometimes self-inflicted and sometimes unforeseen misfortune.
Although Genjuro's (Masayuki Mori) desire to carve out a destiny of his own is a understandable, we see firsthand the disastrous consequences of his greed. And although this premise is well worn, it's the agonizing repetition of the downward spiral, and the vividness with which it's realized that makes Ugetsu a classic.",5.0

"I first encountered Kenji Mizoguchi's UGETSU when I was a sophomore in college, sometime around 2005. While I had been interested in film for years already, college really helped expand my horizons. I was just beginning to take classes for my film studies minor, and my school library was stocked full of Criterion DVDs. I was in heaven.
I was unfamiliar with Mizoguchi at that point in my life. I had no knowledge of his silent films, or early social dramas like SISTER OF THE GION and OSAKA ELEGY (something I have remedied in subsequent years). But UGETSU was one of those rare films that immediately became one of my all-time favorites. I was in awe of Mizoguchi's craft, and it made me hungry for more.
UGETSU came at the peak of Mizoguchi's career - he won the Golden Lion three years in a row for THE LIFE OF OHARU (1952), UGETSU (1953), and SANSHO THE BAILIFF (1954), a trio of masterpieces that showcase a consummate artist at the height of his powers. For this reviewer, however, Mizoguchi never topped UGETSU, a haunting, supernatural love story that is as beautiful as it is tragic. The film is a combination of Japanese ghost stories, one about an aspiring samurai who forsakes his family to pursue his dream, leaving his wife to take up prostitution to make ends meet. The other is a potter fleeing war with his family, who is seduced by a mysterious noble woman who turns out to be a ghost. Released eight years after the end of WWII, UGETSU is as much a cautionary tale as it is a medieval legend. Weary and plagued by war, these peasants give in to lust and greed, seeking a better life but ultimately waylaid by their own desires. Mizoguchi explores their fate through mesmerizing long takes and a quiet, eerie atmosphere, awash in fog and foreboding. Pay close attention to where he places his camera - unblinking, never judging, but always displaying a deep compassion for its characters humanity. The first time I saw UGETSU I wept profusely. Yet even in its tragedy, Mizoguchi finds a strange and otherworldly beauty. Its use of the supernatural almost feels more metaphorical than literal - representing a man always chasing dreams rather than paying attention to what is right in front of him.
UGETSU is a masterpiece. Not just one of the finest examples of Japanese cinema, but one of the all time great films ever made. Mizoguchi's craftsmanship remains unparalleled, providing a deep and powerful exploration of human folly that achieves an almost mystical status. Like watching an ancient folktale being born right before our eyes, it remains one of cinema's most uniquely beautiful experiences.",5.0

"86/100
A haunting, devastating tone poem that uses the divide between fantasy and reality to investigate man's treatment of woman. I know, a film from the '50s that actually gives a damn about women, it's shocking! Flawed, certainly- the sexual politics aren't perfect, as there's a lot of grossness to a female character being raped immediately after her husband leaves her, even if it's more thematically justified than, say, Janet Leigh being raped in Touch of Evil to forward the plot; and I think the film would have been both bolder and more affecting had the film ended about five minutes before it actually does, at what for me is the emotional apex of the film. But there's such sheer power to moments like the cut from the farmer basking in the sexuality of his emotionally removed female ideal to his abandoned wife hiding from marauders, that any misjudged beats are easily forgotten.",4.5
"10 films away made me realize just how superior the Japanese cinema is over the cinema of the rest of the world. In the fifties, cranking out a ninetyish minute 16th century ghost fable with artful dignified black-and-white photography and an amazing interesting score was no big deal for these masters of craft, who for me call to mind the old masters of Italian painting.
One of their greatest tendencies was a penchant for moralizing and thus not making pointless films. After this and Street of Shame (1956), Mizoguchi is far from being one of my favorite moralizers: his voice is too preachy and simplistic. Yet in another testament to the greatness of Japanese cinema, I'm still likely to seek out and consume a great deal more of his films. The Japanese set the bar so high that watching below-the-bar films is still worthwhile. Meanwhile, after disliking my first Fellini yesterday, it's probable that I'll avoid his work for a good long while.",3.0

"Ugetsu is a parable warning against the dangers of avarice and masculine ambition told beautifully through Mizoguchi's trademark long takes and detailed period setting. It's a ghost story, but instead of obvious scares it entices you with subtle mystery, especially through the character of Lady Wakasa. She is a strange creature, with her pale, veiled face and highly painted eyebrows, but she is still undoubtedly beautiful. Her ethereal, sensual power over the protagonist is not difficult to understand. The characters are more real and well-defined than Mizoguchi's other films, which allows us to explore the film's morality in a depth rarely seen in cinema. We can understand and sympathize with these characters, but we also condemn their actions. This is a beautifully shot gem that's unfortunately slipping down the Sight and Sound critic's choice list. This film deserves to be placed alongside Seven Samurai and Tokyo Story in the pantheon of Japanese cinema.",4.0

That's sort of what happened, but the middle part where everything goes terribly is really dark, and that scene where noblewoman learns that he's married is legitimately terrifying. That scene alone makes the whole movie.
P.S. I love how the Japanese have this really realistic ghosts, that everyone can tell is a ghost. That's pretty cool.",0.0
"Mizoguchi's biggest strength is that he is a strong filmaker who knows how to make his scenes have impact. I also think that's his biggest drawback. I know part of this is due to his films being period pieces, where emotions are often exaggerated and there is always a parable to tell. However, his scenes weigh too heavily on the viewer. He very effectively sets us up for soldiers coming at the beginning, and along with the exciting score, I was constantly on edge waiting for something unfortunate to happen. There are also moments where things get confusing in the cacophony. Mizoguchi treats his peasants relentlessly, taking away from them, teasing them, only to banish them like a whimsical god.
If we ignore the intensity of the film though, it's quite a set piece. It is truly something that exists in the time period it is set. War and bandits roam the earth disrupting the lives of poor peasants who just try to survive. Some, like the men, dream of grandeur and their hubris leads to their ruin. I actually found the spiritual aspects of the film quite enjoyable, like the lone wares seller whose boat they encounter, or the meeting with the priest. The lady in the manor was quite a terrifying presence. That part was perfectly executed, with the viewer falling for her trap just as easily. The wannabe soldier serves as comic relief in the background, but also has an interesting reunion. One thing I admire in Mizoguchi's film is his strong female characters; they're really the driving force and soul of the films. I also found interesting parallels to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, with peasants in danger from bandits, visiting other villages and having transformative experiences there, but in the end the only survivors are the villagers, with a final pan to them hard at work in the fields. Like in Sansho the Bailiff, you can expect a touching reunion at the end, filled with sorrow but with the new foresight of the author's message of anti-greed. (Though I must say, those kimonos were beautiful)",4.0
"A beautiful war torn ghost tale presented by the Cinefamily via the Greg Proops Film Club - one of my favorite nights in Los Angeles. Proops begins the night with a stream of conscienceness talk about just about everything, that usually ends up landing around the movie of the night. Funny, insightful and ridiculous. Love it.
The movie -- it’s on the top ten lists of tons of critics and I see why. Mizoguchi spends his story telling capital pulling you into the common people’s experiences in war torn Japan. It feels all the more significant today when I see the news about Syria. It follows two couples and their bonehead husbands - each ignoring their wives pleas to drastic effect. It’s beautiful, haunting, lyrical, flat out overwhelming at times. By the time the ghost arrives to seduce the businessman husband, I was caught up, believing everything that was going on.
The war and what it did to the people, the loss, the pain, the hunger - is drawn deep and wide in the ghostly girl and her haunted home. Everyone is cursed - but Mizoguchi finds a way out of the horror of war, giving hope in humanity, despite the bummer ending. Mizoguchi movies are best watched in a half full movie theater with Greg Proops as your fateful guide.",5.0
"A haunting rumination on war and greed from the great Kenji Mizoguchi, Ugetsu features the director's trademark roaming camera and strong female characterizations.

I think my main reservation was that the first and second halves of the film don't come together quite as well as I personally would have liked, even though I liked the film's transitions between fantasy and reality, which heavily imply meta-filmic aspects as well.",4.0

"A brilliant and lyrical film about two rural couples torn apart when a nameless war encroaches upon their village. The men's dreams are shanghaied by the glamour of war--one is a potter exploiting the bustling economy, the other a poor fool who wants to be a samurai. The women stress simple domestic pleasures, to no avail. The terror of the approaching lawless armies on the defenseless town brings to mind the experiences of Japanese peasants in the first half of the century, or of the Vietnamese in the next decade. Mizoguchi brings a touch of cursed grace to so many of these scenes -- the compulsive abandonment of the wives, the desperate stoking of the kiln, the meeting between two boats on a fog-shrouded lake, and a ghost story that blends mysticism, romanticism, and military activity far more naturally and less histrionically than in Kurosawa's Throne of Blood.",5.0
"This is a dark, dark film. It's overwhelmingly sad and a reprieve, to my cynical disposition, never comes. Every man in the story is narcissistic and impulsive and yet the wives stand by silently, dealing with the repercussions. The whole film's theme is represented by a single scene where a wife, baby clinging to her back, is mortally wounded by a greedy man and then tragically stumbles while, in the background as illuminated by a beautiful deep focus, local citizens and samurais stumble similarly, but affected by liquor and spirits rather than the wife's contrasting pain. It's a tragic shot and a lucid condemnation of man's inherent impetuousness. But you don't hate the men for putting their poor wives through this; you just pity them. Pity their myopia, pity their plights, pity their instincts. It's an essential story, but it's also riveting and beautiful in a meditative way. There are several shots, like the one I described above, that are arresting: the boat scene, the ghost's exorcism. Ugetsu is based on ancient folklore but is as modern as it gets.",4.5

Siento que como defendía Kurosawa, Mizoguchi opta por enviar mensajes sencillos con su cine, pero es magistral la capacidad de convertirlos en puro lirismo, esa delicada atmósfera en la que los sentimientos se saben leer y valorar. Es destacable el aura fantástica de una de las dos tramas que vertebran el film y como la puesta en escena te empapa de terror. Aún así, Ugetsu funciona de forma irregular pues una trama es muy superior a la otra, por lo que no puedo valorarlo más hasta un próximo rewatch.",3.5

"I knew this was supposed to be a masterpiece and a landmark of cinema but I wasn't prepared for how much this destroyed me emotionally. What Kenji Mizoguchi has crafted here is an absolute masterpiece, technically marvelous (the famous scene on the lake is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in a film, and more than a little reminiscent of Murnau's Sunrise) and emotionally devastating. On one hand, it's a ghost story, but in Japanese culture, the ghost world does not seem to be played for horror as much as it is in western culture; rather, the ghost world here is much more melancholy. All of the spirits introduced in the film are not introduced as scary, per se, either--rather they are separate entities with entire histories and tragedies attached to them. The film can be seen as merely a ghost story, but beyond that it is both about the folly of climbing the social ladder and an important feminist story about how men's desire for success can destroy women's lives. The performances are powerful, the direction is lyrical, the story is haunting, and the ending more emotionally resonant than expected. Absolutely incredible.",5.0
Wonderfully creepy and often surprisingly morbid ghost story. I can't wait to see more of Mizoguchi's work.,5.0
"Haunted, in the most subtly effecting manner, Mizoguchi's film moves with the precise determination of its own ghosts. There's a deliberateness to the way the film unfolds, mirrored in Mizoguchi's strikingly careful compositions, that takes the time to establish the emotional and historical contexts of its characters before methodically setting about its business as an ostensible ghost story.
Beyond its superficial fable-like moralizing - I mean this in a decidedly underogatory manner - the film also loans itself to more materialistic readings. Genjuro and Tobei's movements away from their families are initiated by the lure of accruing increased capital and the material glories that attend being a famous samurai. Genjuro's ensuing enthrallment at the hands of Lady Wakasa can be seen to manifest the alienation of being subjugated through one's work to an abstract ghostly presence. The film's conclusion, with both Genjuro and Tobei returning to their original states, albeit modified by the film's developments, posits a stabilization with the return to a more direct relation to the products of one's work.
The film's gender relations are decidedly more complicated. While offering a critique for the manner that economic and militaristic pursuits negatively impact the domestic sphere, the film maintains a dramatically conservative view of sexual agency and gender relations. The caveat, of course, being that it's a film located within a particular historical and cultural context - two if you count its period setting - and, as such, can't be expected to operate extra-temporally.
These concerns, however, are often silenced by Mizoguchi's visuals. His use of chiaroscuro and framing, especially in regards to situating characters against natural backgrounds are sumptuously ethereal.",4.0
"This movie is slow to get going, and I got pretty impatient at the beginning, but as it continues, I was drawn into the story and in the end, I found it an extremely haunting story (no pun intended). Watching these two men abandon their women to pursue their own dreams and happiness is tragic and heartwrenching, and their reunions are equally tragic. A very well done movie.

"Awfully matter-of-fact and unsparing in depiction of the selfish core of man, stating more about Japanese traditional society than it probably means to. It rides the zinger pretty hard on both counts, dumping the garbage on both of Mizoguchi's women - one is forced into prostitution by her husband's fanatical ambition, the other forced to survive while awaiting her myopically greedy, philandering better half - and punishing their men with a future lifetime of moral echoes. Because they have no control over the civil war that engulfs their village, these characters are at the mercy of a film that seems to carry an even weightier agenda by suggesting that control over one's own fate is not man's to possess. A very disquieting contrast: Even if you're decisions are good, you are still a slave to the inhumanity of human nature.",3.5

In the beginning, the cinematography is more confined; however, it could be the case that the constant concealment of faces/figures in shadows alludes to the inevitable loss of individuality afforded by war. On one hand, it would have been interesting to view certain scenes through a more colorful lens (here, the costume design would surely shine), but I believe the black-and-white palette acts as more of an achievement vs. a deterrent. The constricted color palette creates an atmosphere/tone that is both bleak and ominous; in characters' actions vs. inactions, it permeates itself. In select scenes, the contrast created between light and dark is stunning; by comparison, the same scenes projected in color would probably not have been as impactful. The sound design is particularly haunting and complements the cinematography.
What's in a theme? There is so much to dissect here. Ugetsu begs the ultimate question of correlation vs. causation, specific to human behavior and war: Do war climates indirectly cause amoral/immoral behavior, as well as acts of desperation riddled with impulsivity? Or, is it rather the case that some people are born predisposed to impulsive/destructive proclivities, and the war environment only elicits one's undercurrent behavioral profile; the correlation between nature vs. nurture is further exacerbated? Secondary themes include the exploration of art for art's sake vs. art for the sake of security vs. art for the sake of commodity; the motivation for military enlistment (the obligation to serve and protect vs. the desire for accolades and bravado); and the exploitation of female suffering for the sake of male character development (while we indirectly witness the implications of female suffering, we directly witness their effects on the male characters).
While Ugetsu does a great job showing the central themes, the telling of such is sometimes heavy-handed; when supporting characters succinctly deliver the film's ""big ideas"", the storytelling comes across a bit inauthentic. Still, Ugetsu maintains an overwhelmingly organic and irrevocable insight into the human condition's penchant for praise, pleasure, and pain.",4.0

"Intro to Film discussion post: Think about the film's cinematography. How is it different from mainstream American films?
Some of the most noticeable camera movements that Kazuo Miyagawa, the cinematographer of Ugetsu, utilizes in the film are long takes and tracking shots. Contrary to mainstream American films where dramatic emphasis on the actor's movement and quick change of shots are predominantly used, the cinematography in Ugetsu creates a sense of fluidity and a dreamlike atmosphere.
In the scene where Genjuro encounters the mysterious Lady Wakasa for the first time at the market, the camera remains static for an extended period, capturing Genjuro's shock in the frame and allowing the audience to absorb the mysterious and eerie aura of Lady Wakasa. A combination of long shots and tracking shots are also used to make the suspense and apprehension linger. When Miyagi and her son hide from the soldiers, the camera follows the two in the shadows and shifts the focus to the soldiers, further building the tension of the impending danger. In another scene when Lady Wakasa figures out that Genjuro has a family and is trying to escape from her, the slow camera movement captures her ghost-like creepiness of Lady Wakasa. It shifts the focus to Genjuro's terrified face.
The film also often utilizes high-angle shots to provide an omniscient point of view to the audience. Its purpose is to make the audience feel like they are watching a mysterious and fantastical tale portraying 16th-century Japan. This shot captures the settings such as the market, the village, and Lady Wakasa's house. As the camera looks down at the characters from an elevated perspective, it establishes a folktale-like narrative in the film.",3.5

A timeless tale of caution in the face of greed, war & love. Captures all of the charming elements I love of mid 20th century Japanese cinema. Beautiful set design, a folksy/mystical story, fantastical quality & above all an entertaining watch. It also has one of my new favorite opening credit sequences. 
My favorite scene was by far the crossing of the lake moment when all the main characters attempt to get their pottery across the other side of the lake. The beauty of the water’s movement underneath the rowing oar + gray cloudy skies shifting above is breathtaking. It meshes perfectly with the emotional resonance of the scene, a shadowy hope and a misty fate. It alludes to the suffering and hardships the characters will face in the future. 
Another one of my favorite scenes was when Genjuro comes stumbling out of the manor. We get a Tarkovsky-esq shot of him stumbling onto the ground through some bare branches. Vibeeee

"Kenji Mizuguchi's tale of wartime love, greed and self destruction is elegiac and beautiful. There is something hauntingly simplistic about this wartime parable infused with a ghostly folk atmosphere, that makes it a real standout in the jidaigeki canon. No one tells ghost stories like the Japanese, and Ugetsu is the perfect example of it.
The film begins with pastoral richness, Kazuo Miyagawa (Of Rashomon fame) sweeps his camera over the village like a farmers hoe until we focus on the four primary leads of this story. I won't expound on character, as this ruins a natural inclination to delve into and experience Mizuguchi's elegance in unfolding this naturalistic fairy-tale.
There is some truly beautiful imagery in the film, and re-watching it again was like experiencing the remnants of a forgotten dream surface in my mind like a fertile steaming hot spring. Gutted feudal estates jutting from marshes like decomposed skeletons, fog strewn marshes echoing with the resonant drum beat of a charnel apparition, and a pair of wooden clogs amongst a beach filled with animal bones are just a few of the grim but beautiful tableaux's on display in the film.
In summary, Ugetsu is a haunting and languid tale of men and women swallowed by greed. Humanity reduced to withered struggling husks or tragic ghosts still consumed in the afterlife with earthly desires, lusts and regrets. It is a deeply poetic and richly crafted fairy-tale about mortality as ephemeral and delicate as a lovers Kimono lost to time.",5.0
"wow. every scene near water was so beautifully lit ~from them floating across the foggy lake to genjuro and lady wasaka in a dream state of bliss. my eyes shot open when genjuro is undressed, showing the shimmering wet script covering his back, bordered by two deeply shadowed beings. 
such a treat to see in 35mm my goodness",3.5
"I may have met my match. With this movie my flaws as a “critic” are ousted, because I recognize Ugetsu as an absolute game changer but can’t begin to conjure a perfect appreciation for it. There’s too much going on here that’s meant for more experienced eyes to catch. Do I just spout my honest opinions here or pretend to act like I know what I’m talking about? I guess I should evaluate what I hope to accomplish with these reviews before coming to a definite answer. I’m currently writing these for the fun of it, and because I like judging things, but I also can’t stand knowing that I have a lot to improve upon without being willing to improve upon it. I mean, sure, movie opinions are subjective, but knowledge still leads to better understanding. It’s the same as being a voter.
Anyways, here are my current, lazily articulated thoughts. I liked the settings and sound design a lot. The story was seamless but the frigid pace wasn’t working for me for whatever reason, and while the way it was structured is complex and apparently groundbreaking I still felt like it was a moral I had heard many times previous. Another thing I admired was the atmosphere of it all (which I guess kind of encompasses setting and sound, haha), it made the second half into an especially unsettling affair. And, my most basic complaint yet: I wish the movie wasn’t in black and white because at times it had me a little bored. Sorry not sorry. So yeah, that’s about it. Maybe I’ll do some research and revisit Ugetsu sometime in the future but for now I don’t think I want to sit through it again.
Also, at the theater I went to they were playing Meiko Kaji before and after the movie ended! The composer and lead actress in Lady Snowblood! I wonder if I was the only one in the theater who knew that. Needless to say I felt pretty cool. 6/10.",3.0

"Emotionally haunting supernatural melodrama about the ways that war poisons the minds of men -- told through the eyes of a potter and his brother-in-law/aspiring samurai. One pursues financial stability at all costs, overlooking the toll on his family. The other aspires to the respect owed to a warrior of great esteem. Neither are ready or prepared to pay the cost their obsessions require.
Mizoguchi flips this film so nimbly on its head during the final act when we realize this story wasn't about the men at all -- but the women who struggle and survive in the shadows of masculine hubris and failure. The director even creates compassion for the supposedly ""evil spirit"" that's possessed our protagonist's soul.
A quiet movie with disquieting themes -- only Mizoguchi could make so much beauty out of suffocating inhumanity.",4.5
"At the beginning of the film I assumed that the story would be your typical tale about greed. That those that get greedy eventually get burnt. As the film went on I realized that this isn't quite the case. There is a nuance to it that makes it different. Is it really that greedy to want a little bit more, when you have so very little? The men's actions weren't so much driven by greed, than by their desire to better their lives for their wives and children. Did they deserve the consequences they received? Perhaps, perhaps not. But this nuance makes the story all the more interesting, and tragic.",4.0

I personally see guilt, lust, greed, and consequences as big themes in this film, and they all come so naturally through such an interestingly crafted story.

"I couldn't get enough of the haunting score and the dreamy atmosphere. The whole film gives the impression of watching a storybook come to life, evoking feelings of impending doom and desire. The inventive camera and lighting techniques were strangely noir-like and expressionistic, which was interesting to see within a 16th century period piece.
However, I didn't see the dramatic purpose of telling the story of two brothers as opposed to one man. Both of the brothers go through extremely similar arcs - their desires are extremely similar, the lessons they learn as a result of their misfortune are also extremely similar. One brother is not a foil to the other brother, and neither of them engages in any kind of conflict with the other (in fact, they rarely even interact with one another). By the end, I was left wondering why Mizoguchi decided to tell their stories side-by-side given the characters are - for all intents and purposes - duplicates. Maybe I'll have to give it another watch.",4.0
"Caught the new digital restoration with a special (recorded) intro from Martin Scorsese. I still don't really get why this is typically regarded as Mizoguchi's best film--Sansho the MF'ing Baliff, people!--but those water scenes are pretty magical.",4.0
"The most famous and acclaimed film from the post-war Japan is an interesting and exhilarating story about family, love, pride, illusion and the role of woman in society. Handled with a incredibly powerful camera work, Mizoguchi's masterpiece is, in my opinion, more interesting by the technical aspects than by it's story.
If there is one thing that I'm particularly interested in films, it's the portrayal of female's psychology and Ugetsu sadly failed in this aspect. Of course I'm not saying these womans are completely unbelievable, but they are rather representation of ideas than real womans. No woman is so decided about what she wants as those two womans are; if they were, we - men - would have no trouble at all trying to understand them. However, the importance of a woman in the men's life is well depicted as the only thing capable of changing the foolish that follows every men. Yes, I know Mizoguchi tried to make that end different and I would certainly like it best, but it is certainly believable and admirable in this final cut.
Kazuo Miyagawa was, at that time, probably the best DP in Japan. Mizoguchi's dream-like atmosphere fit perfectly with Miyagawa's ability to shot long takes and to work with little artificial light. The whole film has that great sensation one has when reading a classic tale.
Most important by the historic moment than anything, Ugetsu was not only a great piece of filmmaking but also an important ethical message to the Japanese people. It's values are prized even today and the impressive country we know nowadays has in every part of it's post-war history a little touch of this beautiful film.",4.0

"Primavera, junto a la orilla Norte del lago Biwa, en territorio Omí, se sucede quizás una de las fábulas escatológicas más importantes de la historia del cine. Con matices de guerra y los estragos de una tardía moralidad, perdida una vez más, por la ambición desmedida.
Puede que verla en la actualidad y más todavía en la posteridad, sea algo injusto para las intenciones de entonces. Lo más lógico es que para el común denominador esto sea un chiste mal contado y aburrido, pero que en realidad, sea todo lo contrario. Justo ahí radica la genialidad de Mizoguchi, autor de una atmósfera tan atrapante, fascinante, sugerente... cuando los largometrajes no tenían más de 50 años, o al menos los estaban cumpliendo, cuentos de la luna pálida de agosto ya derrochaba masterclass en visión y producción.
Las atmósferas aplicadas a través de la cámara en este cuento del género fantástico son una absoluta voladura de cabeza y es que, parte de llevar aquello a la consciencia es notar que no es el camino de la tecnología lo que permitiría acercarse a la grandeza de la puesta en escena, sino justamente el talento innato o adquirido del director japonés, el ojo técnico o la sensibilidad que lleva a pasajes con profundidades de campo dramáticos, oníricos y místicos que pocos han podido conseguir incluso hasta hoy (recordar entre muchas escenas extraordinarias, la secuencia prodigiosa de una balsa en las tinieblas del lago Biwa). Además, los sucesos diegéticos pujan amarrados de una línea musical percusiva que escarapela, y que claro; no es solo ajena a la modernidad, sino que lo es a todo lo occidental.
Finalmente, no son muchos los relatos que terminan tocando fibras de esta forma, pero sobre todo, que relatan una historia con tantos matices, variantes o recursos cinematográficos. En cualquier caso, Mizoguchi en los tempranos 50s del siglo pasado, ya hacía lo que muchos siguen averiguando, incluso con todo el soporte pecunario y los recursos teconológicos del ahora.",4.5

Progress: 17/52
Category 17: Criterion Sight And Sound
A dreamy and wonderful aesthetic countered at best by guys wanting to make their family's lives better by abandoning them against their wishes, at worst by the brutalities of war. The pan over from a hot spring into the poster shot of the film of a nice picnic against the river and a dead tree is something incredibly romantic in what's presented, but depressing in the reality of it being a man who abandoned his wife and family.",4.0
"Ugetsu begins with a slow pan over the tiny village our characters inhabit. We are introduced to Genjuro, his wife Miyagi, Genjuro’s sister (Ohama), and her husband (Tobei). Even though the story eventually expands out of this village, it never feels overwhelming or thin. The camera always stays close to the actors and their expressive faces. The movie maintains a close, intimate, and personal feel throughout its running time. The story begins with Genjuro setting off to a nearby village to sell some of his pottery. We are also introduced to Genjuro’s and Miyagi’s son, Genichi. The family is living a meager existence, but they all seem relatively happy. It is clear Genjuro cares for his wife and son. Tobei shows up offering to pull Genjuro’s cart, but he has another reason for going to the city, he strongly desires to be a samurai. Due to Tobei’s comic nature, it is obvious to Genjuro that Tobei is not cut out for this and is clearly a fool. Genjuro even berates Tobei for having too much ambition. This is the main moral of the movie. As Genjuro will eventually find out, greed can blind us and make us forget what in life is truly worth living for.
Later on at the large village, Genjuro is able to sell his pottery for a good sum and Tobei is embarrassed by some other samurai. They both return home and Genjuro gives his wife a kimono. His wife then pleads with him to prepare for the upcoming war that will take place between two warlords. However, Genjuro has become consumed by greed at this point. His personality shifts and he becomes focused only on making pottery for his next sale.
The narrative takes a dramatic turn as soldiers ransack the village. Genjuro, Ohama, and Tobei are separated from Miyagi. Tobei abandons his wife to become a samurai, Ohama ends up as a prostitute, Genjuro is seduced by a ghost, and Miyagi is killed by a random soldier. In an echo of the forced labor Japan practiced during WWII, the soldiers round up random people and force them into slavery. Every actor is capable of pulling off all of the necessary emotions for this material. Masayuki Mori as Genjuro is a standout as he capably portrays his character going through greed, lust, fear, and ultimately redemption. The other actors all keep the material grounded. There are some incredible sequences throughout the latter half of the movie.
When I first watched Ugetsu, I was not aware of the supernatural elements. The atmosphere and sound design during the sequences with Lady Wakasa is simply amazing. When she asks for Genjuro’s hand in marriage, a demonic voice pops up and gets louder and louder as Genjuro grapples with his decision to forsake his previous marriage or live a life of luxury. There is also the dream-like bell that signals what you are experiencing may be unreal.
Eventually all of the main characters return home after they realize that they are unsatisfied by chasing their ambitions. Unfortunately, all of them have to learn this the hard way. Tobei’s wife is turned into a prostitute and Genjuro’s wife is murdered. After going through this trauma they all return home and realize the importance of each other. The film ends with Genjuro at peace as the ghost of Miyagi ascends to some type of afterlife and praises him for his redemption.
The way the film handles violence is very interesting. We don’t get very many details about the civil war and none of the soldiers are humanized in detail. We only see the effects of the war on the main characters. This emphasizes the idea that no matter what the reason for violence and war, innocent people will always be hurt. This also relates to another main idea in the movie: that it is mainly women that suffer due to the ambitions of men. The civil war is due to a dispute between two male warlords and this ultimately causes the death of the two main female characters. Their fate is also due to the greed of their husbands. Mizoguchi seems to be suggesting that greed is the root of war.
I also discovered that the film may draw on Mizoguchi’s personal life. Apparently his father made a terrible business deal and lost all of his money. Mizoguchi’s sisters ended up working as a geisha. This background makes the film even more tragic, especially in regards to Ohama’s fate.
The film deals with the grand themes of greed, envy, lust, and war, but never feels like it overreaches. Mizoguchi’s roving camera helps keep the film engaging and the cinematography is simply outstanding, especially during the lake scene and the sequences at Lady Wakasa’s manor.",5.0

"Most of my time in Mizoguchi land recently has been spent checking out the lesser traveled side-streets in his filmography: war-time propaganda films, semi-obscure silent movies and occupation-era polemics, always looking for that Mizoguchi touch, closely watching for hints of his development as an artist. So returning to UGETSU was nice, like panning for gold and remembering after a while you've got a solid chunk just sitting in your pocket. As much as I enjoy watching practically any of his films out of duty as a card-carrying auteurist, I got the sensation watching this for the 5th or 6th or 7th time of ""Oh, right... THAT'S why I like this dude so much"" and with more experience of his body of work, it just makes it all the more striking how unique UGETSU is within it; there's nothing else that feels like this in any of the twenty-something other movies of his I've seen; the peculiar way it approaches existing in a hybrid space of historical fantasy and historical fiction. The actors and general tone of the story is all very theatrical as Mizoguchi preferred, but there are often rapid, disorienting shifts between the movie's two modes that are striking. The sets, lighting, and production design are so precisely detailed so as to be immensely grounded and authentic; other times, their blatant artifice is thrown in the viewer's face. Mizoguchi's staging is, at times, rather raw and direct, apparently taking influence from Italian neo-realism for scenes like Ohama's death; then, he'll bust out the crane and execute some extraordinary, otherworldly long-take that upends the very ground beneath the audience's feet. But as the movie goes along, when these moments come gets more and more disrelated from the supernatural aspects, as the fantastical and the realist collide and become inseparable. I've always loved how it takes about half of the film's total runtime for the movie's supernatural aspect to reveal itself, with no real hints ahead of time that that's where we'll be going.

The acting is very good (for the 50s), the emotion is depicted very well as it pertains to its plot, which is a family being displaced and separated due to the Japanese civil wars in the 1600s. There is a mix of fantasy to it, like ghosts and curses, though it isn’t executed well, but can’t blame them due to the technology and effect limits. I was very focused into this movie, even the moments of pure dialogue is very intriguing. Practical effects are relatively simple, fading into the next scene and all that jazz.

これがマーティンスコセッシのオールタイムベスト10の一角か。宮川一夫の撮影が人間国宝級だからかな？好きすぎて自分で復元版監修しちゃってるもんね。

◉海外での評価
雨も月も、東アジア文学におけるミステリーと超自然現象の重要な要素だ。
「比類なき野心に満ちた記念碑的作品」「上田の名を語り継ぐ至高のファンタジー」と称される『雨月物語』は、内紛に引き裂かれた16世紀の日本を舞台に、欲望、愛、欺瞞に引き裂かれた登場人物たちが織り成す。
陶芸家と農夫が、美しく魅惑的なファンタジーと残酷な現実の厳しい真実が融合した背景の中で、それぞれの野望を追い求める。
1956年のアカデミー賞で衣装賞にノミネートされた「雨月物語」は、ロジャー・エバートによって、黒澤の「羅生門」と同様、日本映画を西洋の主流観客に紹介するのに役立った重要な作品のひとつと評価された。
◉足るを知れ映画
野望を追うことで、今あるものを失うように物語は導かれる。
夢を追いかけろ、そうすれば幸せになれるという話とは明らかに違う。
ここでは、より現実的な結果や、基本的に、手に入れるはずのないものを追い求めたときにどうなるか、そして、すでに持っているものに感謝することを教えてくれる。
結局、どちらの男も自分の人生と周囲の人々にダメージを与え、場合によってはそのダメージは永久的なものになる。
溝口健二の『雨月物語』は、人間の野望の悲劇を描いた、忘れがたい美しい超自然ドラマなのだ。
◉あらすじ
暴力的な紛争や食糧不足のために治安が非常に悪い地域と時代で、人々は生きるためなら殺人もいとわない。 
しかし、そのような状況にもかかわらず、通りすがりの人々から警告を受けた主人公たちは、一貫して家族を放っておく。
そのうちの一人は、映画のある場面で妻から逃げ出し、新しく手に入れたお金を鎧や武器につぎ込む。 
なぜなら、彼は最終的に侍になることに執着しているからだ。
一方、もう一人の主人公は、ある女性宅で陶器の大売出しをしている間に、完全に脇道にそれてしまう。

マーティンスコセッシが選ぶオールタイムベストの一角は、美しいものが不気味に描かれるホラー風味ファンタジー。
→女の顔や、屋敷、能弦楽など。美しいが、不穏で不安で不安定で不気味。雨と月、というのも日本的で美しいが、本作の後味と重なる。
女に褒めてもらいたい、
成功を目指す道は、堕落の道である、
足るを知れ、ということか。
→本気で欲望に向き合わなければ堕落はできない。かと言って、人は落ちきれない。足るを知るところに落ち着く、ということだろう。坂口安吾に言わせれば。
""夢""とは言い得て妙。
それを超自然現象的でありながら、現実的に帰着させてみせたような一作。

"Solilóquio pré colesterolização mistelântica:
(A)notam-se similaridades no que diz respeito a temas fulcrais da moderna cultura japonesa. A ambição como vontade disruptiva da máquina imperiosa, tradicionalmente impulsionada pelo dogma sobrenatural, hoje talvez pela moralidade social, dois combustíveis que caem nos mesmos débeis princípios.
Trata-se de um anti-shonen, devido a uma suave mudança de sentido valorativo do sonho, e quem gere essa seta entre o bem e o mal? Uma tal força mística superior, um narrador omisso. Mas os protagonistas comportam-se de forma idêntica, (aos de shonens), ingenuamente, incessantemente, cegamente buscando a glória.
E outros magníficos assuntos originalmente trata, como a salvação no reino dos sonhos, [que é o mesmo que estar morto, (Mugen Tsukuyomi)], ou a vertente cíclica da realidade, pois não dizia o chefe da aldeia:

~~~~~~~
i do enjoy watching men being punished for their mistakes in the most devastating of ways and the moral lessons being greed corrupts absolutely and reject senseless ambition while embracing contentedness/minimalism. that being said movies under 90 minutes should not feel that slow.
Pros:
• i love the score of this film
• the building of tension in this was delightful. i was stressing bad on multiple occasions
• loved all the women in this - their performances absolutely slayed 😳 special shoutout to Machiko Kyō for Lady Wakasa's intensity and sensuality. gave me major Mae West vibes without the duo losers of Hayes and Breen
• the absolute brutality of that scene of him finding his wife in a brothel and him trying to convince her that he can restore his honor. wow... now that's cinema!
• some really delightful transitions in this and wonderful camera movement
Cons:
• i really absolutely hate the trope of using a woman's suffering to punish a man but I can feel the director's hatred of men so strongly that I almost forgave him
• a bit slow but that seems to be the vibe of all the Japanese masters lol
For when I inevitably forget:
• the side eye on these women is so powerful
• pirates on a lake is such a funny concept to someone like me who has never seen a lake that you can't swim across
• fail husband wannabe samurai i am praying for your downfall in a most powerful way... not like that 😞
• ugh... can i get one Japanese classic without rape?",3.5

"While the ghost story is a bit cheesy by today's standards, I found nearly everything else to be very impressive from a storytelling and technical standpoint. The story focuses on two poor farmer families, but virtually everyone in the film is suffering from the soliders to the pirates to the royal ghosts lingering in our world. Contextually linking this film to WWII provides even greater insights of the film's framing of war's toll on the Japanese people. While it is a ghost story, the real horror is the suffering of normal people during times of war. While I didn't find Ugetsu as philosophically engaging as other Japanese films I have seen, I still found enough to ponder on as the credits rolled.
With a 4k version on youtube, I was able to watch Ugetsu in sharp clarity, as it should be. From the misty boat ride to the delirious Genjuro flailing around the palace grounds, the movie features beautiful scenes paired with perfectly eerie sounds to create quite an unsettling mood.
Overall a great film, especially if you take into account its age. Looking forward to watching Sansho the Bailiff in the near future.",4.0

"One of the many unfortunate cases of a movie about a social issue losing quality with social progress. I don’t really know what else I can say about it - it’s generally well made, with the cinematography being its best aspect, but the screenplay felt almost campy to me because it’s tackling now-oversaturated subject matter in a now-oversaturated way.

"Ugetsu consistently shrouds our view with lighting shifts and hazy fog, reminding us that our visions are not inherently clear. The story is a great cautionary tale of greed, specifically male greed, but its greatness lies within its masterful directorial expertise.",4.5
"So much of the armchair academia surrounding Ugetsu seems to talk it up as this timeless parable about war and fair enough, it's presented as a period piece and ""life during wartime"" is unfortunately a fairly evergreen topic-- but what often gets lost when talking about films like this one in textbook terms like these is the emotional truth of it all. The harrowing fact is this film was made less than a decade out from the final throes of WWII and, more importantly, the bombing of Hiroshima-- unlikely, I'd imagine, to be treated as some academic object to audiences in 1953.
That's all to say the film isn't simply some reflective meditation on the ""corrupt hearts of men"" or ""the women at home"" but a fairly haunting and immediate reckoning with some fairly recent horrors-- and if it's a fairly quiet film its subject matter is anything but.",0.0
"Amazing how well this film creates it's desired atmosphere through incredible sound design, which achieves perfection in the closing scenes.",4.0
"A tragedy of ambitious men whose greed leads to suffering of their helpless families. This may be the first Mizoguchi movie to really move me- with a haunting spiritual horror element that makes the entire Noh aesthetic suddenly click for me. I’ve yet to see a Japanese film so steeped in traditional Japanese culture like this that does not lose me in its aesthetic foreignness- Ugetsu transcends cultural divides and allows even a westerner such as myself to “get it”. Not just the themes, but the sounds and the mentality. It’s a one of a kind film as far as I’m concerned- a real masterpiece. 
Formally it’s beautiful- not just the famous boat scene which has long stuck with me as an all time great cinematic image, but the scrolling cameras, the wide shots, the way the spirits so seamlessly shift from eerie foreign beauty to demonic horrors. I didn’t get Ugetsu when I first watched it several years ago- today it rattled me. I don’t think I will forget this one anytime soon.",5.0
"""This is probably what Ibsen meant when he wrote: “Life is a contest between the phantoms of the mind” – a remark which, I think, goes a long way towards explaining why Ibsen’s realism has so much substance, and why the tensions between his characters have such depth. Against this richness, the realism of many so-called realistic films appears thin, for the very reason that these films do not take seriously enough into account the phantoms of the mind. Since phantasy is an essential part of the total world, we crave, however vicariously, to make up for its loss. And so, if we cannot have a fullblooded realism, we can at least supplement our normal fare with a relish of vampires and flying saucers. Mizoguchi, however, does not appear to be inhibited by such an impoverished realism. The conventions he uses – of the fable – allow him to create both a world of actuality, in which such urgent problems as the fear of war and the lack of money are made vivid and true, and a world in which the phantoms of the mind are given full play. In doing so, he reminds us indeed that these two worlds are interdependent.""

"Um filme que beira o inclassificável, um melodrama realista e fantástico de Mizoguchi de ecos expressionistas, como sempre tudo que envolve o corpo e o espaço é a chave de sua encenação diante da observação direta, mas que naturalmente suscita de forma inquietante as camadas da alma de cada personagem. O plano se preenche e conhecemos o mundo de cada um daqueles indivíduos. E aqui, muito além do mundo concreto que lhe rodeia, seus anseios, seus sonhos, as expressões mais profundas daquilo que guardam somente para si. Contos da Lua Vaga materializa o pânico, o abandono e o terror, mas também a satisfação, a ilusão e o prazer ludibriante com intenções muito mais do que cínicas, porém sim trágicas. Um mundo erguido por forças invisíveis que tornam o futuro incontornável e, como se não fosse o bastante, ainda lhe dá a devida lição sobre si mesmo e sua imensidão inalcançável.
Essa última imagem é o perfeito exemplo das palavras de Jean Douchet: ""Isto traduz-se esteticamente no conflito entre a beleza sensível, imediata, óbvia - beleza pictórica - de cada imagem de Mizoguchi e a realidade que muitas vezes revela ser atroz, impiedosa, infernal. É por isso que quanto mais a imagem é bela e parece escapar através da sua magnificência à influência do mundo objectivo, mais esta beleza mascarará a presença deste último, mais restritiva do que nunca.""

Это был очень занимательный опыт. Я не могу сказать, что мне фильм понравился сюжетно, да и в целом не могу сказать, что он мне понравился на сто процентов, но, во-первых, я осознаю в каком году вышел фильм и для того времени он потрясающий, во-вторых, у него, даже по современным меркам, много интересных фишек. Например, в фильме много изобретательных визуальных образов и отличное визуальное повествование. Или, как другой пример, у фильма потрясающее оформление звука. Даже по современным меркам он звучит очень круто и содержит в себе множество клёвых звуковых эффектов погружающих тебя в эту историю.
Да и, в целом, для того времени и история хорошая и снят фильм хорошо, и каст справляется с ролями достойно. Претензий к фильму у меня нет. Он интересный.

"my first mizoguchi. i enjoyed the expressive lighting, and there were some nice scene transitions, but coming off the high from a print of kurosawa absolutely doin' it to 'em, this did very little for me. the men suck, they're stupid, i get it. there's not a lot these women can do but stand by their man and die, or whore themselves out and live. the moral calculus of the picture is perhaps too zen for me. that's fine. but on neither a story, character, nor direction level did it move me much past ""there was the expressive lighting"", which tells me something... idk, heretical opinion, I'm uneducated, maybe I'll come back to this review in 5 years and smack myself, but this is my truth",3.0

"Mizoguchi and Miyamoto unfold the action through long crane shots which evoke traditional Japanese scroll paintings. Flawless production design creates the mirage of a fully-fleshed medieval world, while the performances embrace the superstition and cruelty of that era. There’s so much to love here, aesthetically.
Dramatically, less so. We’re introduced to a lot of characters at once and denied a close-up or moment to truly bond with any of them until later on. Both twists are very foreseeable, and the first is revealed without tension or emphasis: someone just tells the protagonist, up-front, that things at the mansion are not what they appear… 
Still, the lightning in that house is genius. The way the characters step in and out of the shadows, the way the maids flit through the candle-lit hallways, and the way the Sanskrit characters seem to glow on his exposed skin… it’s gorgeous to behold. 
The moral to the story is didactic - don’t chase greed or ambition at the expense of your family, and don’t treat women as they have been treated for millennia in Japan - but it hits hard. UGETSU is a great tragedy.",4.0
"Ugetsu is a wonderfully directed masterclass in storytelling, which for me is so nearly perfect. It's gut-wrenching and heartbreaking all at the same time and nearly all of it could have believably happened. The only detractor for me is the reveal of Lady Wakasa being some form of siren-like hellspawn. The film felt very grounded throughout and the conclusion of that subplot came out of left field but apart from that this film is about as good as it gets and now I can't wait to dive into Mizoguchi's filmography.",4.5

"Literally mind blowingly beautiful. I’ll write a better review later
BETTER REVIEW:
Okay I honestly don’t think a B&W movie has ever actually made me emotional. Maybe the last time that happened was The Apartment but this film about two married couples dealing with greed and the destruction of their daily lives in wartime made me tear up twice. The story just draws you in and it doesn’t waste any time. Any reservations I had at the beginning totally vanished and I got so into it that by the time it was nearly over I felt like I could’ve sat through another hour or so. 
It’s gorgeous. The lighting, the cinematography, hell even the way the camera moves (so smooth!!) just scratch an itch. The actors are incredible and the costumes are great too. The soundtrack works perfectly, sometimes it builds momentum, sometimes it’s trance inducing, sometimes it’s eerie. And this film gets pretty creepy too. 
I remember seeing this on the letterboxd top 250 and never having heard of it before and wondering when i’ll ever get around to watching it, it just seemed so out of the way of the rest of the films I try to watch. And admittedly this is for a religious studies class where we spent a lot of time talking about ghosts in Japanese culture, and I figured if I don’t watch it now, it’ll be a long time before I ever feel like it again. And I’m glad I did! But I seriously recommend this to everyone no matter what their interests are right now, what a great example of how old films can be just as exciting and worthy of your time as modern films.",5.0

"Wow this really is cinema, the message of what happens when you let greed and power influence your choices in life and how it can lead to your downfall and actually losing what matters most. Yourself. The sound design was amazingly exceptional and ran the emotions of the whole film for me it was very eerie almost similar to a horror film at times but also beautiful 🤩",4.5
"After seeing Kwaidan and Jigoku, I was excited to see what I heard was one of the most significant and subversive takes on the mythological ghost story sub genre of Japanese film, and I was pleasantly surprised at how lucid and focused Ugetsu is in its delivery. I somehow never had heard that the story is mostly about wealth, specifically commerce under duress from war time. This constant reaffirmation that putting food on the table is the penultimate struggle of the human experience fully amplifies the film’s ominous tone, one that tells you not to always trust your senses.
I was blown away by the final conclusion of the film seeming to say the afterlife is nothing more than the mirage of our fatal escapism. The longer that the camera held on Ohama during that second to last scene, the more thoroughly impressed I was by the spectrum of emotive thought that Ugetsu provided me with.

"The interconnectedness of souls are such an important concept to me and this movie forwards that.
The relationship between men and women is cyclical by nature and through will of powers ahead of our own biology. The shittier the man the shittier the woman.
I enjoy the way capitalism is the villain here. How greed overtakes the will of those who otherwise are good and honest workers.
This is one of those “eat the rich” scenarios that isn’t vapid or completely lost in translation. You feel bad that the poor wish to be wealthy through cheap means. The emphasis on tradition here works twofold in that case.
Kinda reminds me how much modernity killed the drive in people. Now we have those who want to be rich for nothing which I’d say is equally as bad as wanting to be rich through deception. And somehow its ok to want to be like the very group you demonize. 
Go figure.

"Much more closer to Yoru no onnatachi than Utamaro o meguru gonin no onna, despite the latter being set in Feudal Japan. For here we are not talking about time periods, all three stories are universal – thus timeless; but Ugetsu monogatari probably serves as one of the most poignant portraits of post-war Japan that I have yet to see, and yes, I include Yoru. This film claws within your skin in unexpected ways, the suffocating atmosphere of loss and despair. War is always good for business, as Genjūrō says, until it takes all from you. War and the capital, dehumanizing forces. And Mizoguchi always cares the most for the people who always suffer the most at the expenses of men's greed and ambitions, the women. The women who were deprived of their dignity (the comfort women of WW2), who were killed, all who suffer. It's a ghost story, its a love story, its a heartbreaking story; its everything and more. 
This is what the elevated horror auteurs want their films to be. They aim at their depth, but they never reach it. Because Ugetsu isn't just the depth of the content; its the mise-en-scène, the staging, how the actors move in it, how they exists in the frame, how ethereal it is, how every piece of light throws it shaft onto a piece of information, or a piece of poetry. The ghost of a wife picking her sleeping husband's sandals. Furthermore, Mizoguchi is like Bashō, or like Griffith, he is open to the beauty in the movement of the water, the tide and the reflecting sun. Then, he orders the images, the transitions... From a stanza to another stanza.

"Honestly one of the biggest surprises I’ve come across. I obviously knew this would be good simply due to the fact that it’s just outside the list of top 100 foreign movies on Letterboxd at the moment and because I’ve seen Scorsese mention it in the past but this actually blew me away. The way that Mizoguchi directs this is insanely modern for a film released in 1953 and the way that his narrative manages to successfully blend war and fantasy tropes to craft a cautionary tale about greed is just masterful. The movie follows two men, one who wants to use the turmoil of the war to make more lucrative deals on his pottery and another who incessantly wants to become a samurai and explores the effect their greed has on both them and their partners while mixing in some supernatural elements here and there too. The sound design was also amazing at adding to these otherworldly elements and was consistently strange throughout which created a nice foreboding feeling about everything going on. I also adored the cinematography and thought the camerawork was so layered and dynamic at all times that it was almost more of a struggle to look away than to stay interested for the most part. I could go on and on about so many little parts of this film because pretty much everything worked for me but realistically this was just so modern and well executed that it really took me by surprise and had me more invested than I expected. For 1953 (and even by today’s standards) this is a masterpiece in filmmaking. So glad I checked this out and it’s available fully subtitled on YouTube for free if anybody fancies doing the same.",4.5

Success always comes with a price in suffering.
Ugetsu follows 2 couples whose lives r uprooted due to a civil war and r forced to leave their village. Something within the husbands of the 2 couples awakens amidst the violence of war that leads them to forsake their own families and wives as they pursue a dangerous journey into the masculine dreams of vanity, arrogance, desire, and greed that will leave them stranded within their own delusions of power.

"Captivating, intoxicating cinema. 
I’m reminded of that Godard Quote where he says that Jerry Lewis is more of a painter than a filmmaker. The same is true of Mizoguchi (although this is the only film by him I’ve seen). Each shot is focused, above all, on composition. There are a couple nifty camera moves (off the top of my head, when Tobei first crawls towards and prostrates himself before the samurai), but these moves are only to shift from one composition to another or to keep a composition in the frame. I mean, my goodness, those shots of the boat on the lake look like a Winslow Homer painting. 
At first, I was disappointed that the movie kept going past what I thought would be a haunting, ambiguous ending. I was saddened that it made things explicit unnecessarily. However, I ultimately found the coda very affecting.",4.0

"Obra mestra, arte superior
O filme se negocia a todo momento com a poesia, o mistério e a percepção entre o real (concreto?) e o inventado (abstrato)
Os dois personagens são movidos pela ganância, e a incapacidade de deduzir sonho de realidade, e exatamente o movimento da história
Cinematograficamente, Mizoguchi brinca com sobreposições e capta os personagens em longos planos, afim de revelar a unidade de cada um, e principalmente, o ponto que envolve cada um, exatamente, o seu sentimento pessoal e o que os pertencem; por exemplo, a cena do barco e as fumaças que revelam uma sensação própria.
Também é um filme para pensar a moral do Japão antigo, seja no formato da arquitetura, da divisão de classes, e da ascensão pessoal
O conto é maravilhoso, mas Mizoguchi eleva o mesmo em uma condição ainda mais bonita
O olhar de Mizoguchi para entender o indivíduo como exercício do seu trabalho, e esse, como meio de dignidade, ressalva muito bem o pensamento japonês
Além disso, o fantasma da Lady Wakasa, ser a incorporação de uma aristocracia - envolta de mistérios, sempre escondida e vivendo de um heroísmo derradeiro - é de uma sensibilidade genial. A forma como ele conduz essa personagem, o tom poético, profundo....
Uma cena, um plano. Um mestre da narrativa

Aliás, deixo minha menção à cena mais tocante e rica do filme (quase sua síntese, no que diz respeito a projeção cinematográfica): quando o samurai é decaptado, a forma como acontece, sem revelar qualquer tipo de impacto, sendo filmada apenas com o intuito de comunicar uma ação de honra.

"Hay dos escenas que son las que considero hacen que está película sea una muestra de lo mas alto que puede llegar el cine como arte.

Una de dichas secuencias sería cuando el protagonista está en el mercado comprando sedas, de pronto la cámara corta de la tienda a una especie de entrada con vista a un campo y el cielo. Entra en el encuadre dentro del encuadre la esposa de nuestro protagonista y camina hacia nosotros. El esposo la ve. Ella se acerca y se prueba las sedas, luego se va. Vuelve a cortar al plano original. Este plano me conmueve especialmente pues refleja el corazón de nuestro protagonista, quien realmente ama a su esposa, pero lastimosamente llega ahí mismo la tentación en forma de la princesa que le compro unas cerámicas.
La otra secuencia sería el final cuando pro fin nuestro protagonista llega a casa. No hay nadie en el interior. La cámara hace un panel siguiéndolo hacia afuera. Vuelve a panear hacia el interior. Ahora está la esposa de nuestro protagonista prendiendo fuego. Me dolió muchísimo este momento. La imposibilidad de poder verla de nuevo. El poder del cine que los reune a pesar de la muerte.

"Don't be greedy, now!",4.5
"hm. hard to put into words. japanese cinema from this era feels hard to separate from the 2nd world war and its aftermath, where every tragedy can be configured as analogous to war and all confusion experienced by the characters a side effect of a country whose reconstruction is overseen by an opposing force. Ugetsu is very direct in its themes, less interested in the particular politics of war and instead focusing on its relationship with the working class. Our two ""heroes"" only manage to rise above it thru conforming/collusion or pure fantasy, only to be pulled back down when they become dissolutioned with what they've gotten for themselves. I really love how this one seemlessly flows into a ghost story, specifically in how tragic our ghost characters are without having any kind of epic stories for themselves; they were simply unlucky humans like the rest of us. The war gets in the way of living. I don't love its commentary on the suffering of women during this period, even though it's considered theoretically feminist by some. There's like a whole subgenre of ""feminist"" cinema that's built around womens suffering without having much else to say, other than it being unglamorous, and idk! sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. Here's its like... leave your woman alone for 5 seconds and look what happens to her! shame on you! i don't know if the men getting thru to the end fairly intact is clever commentary or just a sign this movie is from 1953, but it left me feeling a bit mixed. Also that subplot with the brother-in-law wanting to be a samurai felt a bit rushed. every second this thing is a ghost story is great tho and the direction and overall look is fantastic, definitely an interesting movie. I love watching stuff like this and having reservations about random bits or underlying themes and still busting out 4 stars or whatever because this website is made up and nothing matters. ghosts are real",4.0
Not as compelling to me as other movies that recount Japanese folk tales,3.5
"Didn't expect that double plot twist! Ugetsu is one masterpiece that will make you want to explore the world of 時代劇; it's a good starting point. This play being set in 戦国時代 provides a canvas for various shades of passion, greed, lust, sorrow and destruction that awaits at the end. This is a motion picture to the truest sense of the word - everything seems to be in moving - the people, the backgrounds, the lights and the plot itself, but rather in a more 'realistic' way than how movement is captured in for example Kurosawa's Seven Samurai or Rashomon. The music blends so well with the scenes and adds perfectly to the pathos of the play.

really conflicted with this movie. It has moments where its genuinely really great but for the first hour it doesnt really capitalize on any of it.

"Um conto que segue exatamente o que é possível esperar a partir da sua premissa e ao mesmo tempo consegue trazer emoções surpreendentes no decorrer do caminho.

Ambos são casados e acabam fugindo da vila que vivem em busca de realizar a ambição deles, carregando junto as esposas e o filho de um deles. Durante a jornada, o vendedor de potes, Genjūrō, abandona sua esposa e filho para não expô-los a perigos. Tōbei, o samurai, segue com a sua. A partir dessa decisão, uma série de consequências cairá sobre aqueles quatro indivíduos.
Mais uma vez em um trabalho de Kenji Mizoguchi, há destaque em como as mulheres carregam os fardos das decisões e ganância dos homens. Tanto Ohama quanto Miyagi sofrem consequências por serem deixada de lado pelos maridos, mesmo ambos realmente se importando com elas em uma primeira instância. É ainda pior no caso de Genjūrō que, enquanto sua esposa está morta, é seduzido por o espírito de uma jovem mulher que foi morta entre esses saques na guerra e promete casar com ela, abandonando ainda mais a família que deixou para trás.

"Vandaag herbekijk ik de Japanse filmklassieker Ugetsu van de beroemde Kenji Mizoguchi (die echter altijd een beetje in de schaduw staat van zijn tijdgenoten Akira Kurosawa en Yasujiro Ozu). Mizoguchi zit qua stijl trouwens een beetje tussen die tijdgenoten in: minder spektakel en actie dan Kurosawa, maar wel méér dan bij Ozu.
Ugetsu ademt de sfeer van de Japanse folklore en cultuur, met een flinke dosis mystiek. Er zitten zelfs enkele horrorachtige elementen in, maar je kan Ugetsu zelfs met de grootste moeite niet omschrijven als een horrorfilm. In plaats daarvan is het een fraaie fantasiefilm met enkele bijzonder menselijke thema's als liefde en oorlog.
De film bevat veel fraaie cinematografie en uitstekend acteerwerk van hoofdrolspelers Machiko Kyo, Mitsuko Mito, Kinuyo Tanaka en Masayuki Mori. Ik kon de aandacht er niet de hele tijd bij houden en de nogal bijzondere, vaak atonale Japanse muziek ging op een gegeven moment wel licht irriteren, maar toch is dit een prima film van Mizoguchi.",4.0

"""Success always comes at a price, and we pay in suffering.""
I always try to get to at least one Japanese horror film every October. This one is set during Japan's civil war and also has a ghost story towards the end. Had I known that, I probably would have chosen a different film because the majority of this story is about two families trying to survive during war and get separated. The two men are both potters that are making a huge profit selling their pottery during all of this. Genjūrō only cares about becoming rich and living a life of luxury with his wife and young child, but his brother in law, Tōbei, is obsessed with becoming a samurai. After the families narrowly escape their village being ransacked and destroyed by the army, they decide to go to another village to sell pottery. They take a boat but are met with a dying man, who warns them of pirates. So Genjūrō makes his wife and child stay behind for safety while he, Tōbei and his wife go to the next village. Once they make a lot of money there, Tōbei runs off to buy samurai armor and joins a clan. His wife goes off looking for him and ends up getting raped by soldiers and turns to a life of prostitution to survive. Meanwhile, Genjūrō is seduced by a wealthy noble woman who buys his pottery and invites him to her house. He then enjoys a life of luxury with her and forgets all about his wife and child who are hiding from troops and struggling to survive. However, this noble woman is not what she seems.
So the film branches off into two stories and many of the elements reminded me of the anthology horror film Kwaidan. The ghost story especially was very similar to that and probably borrowed from the same folklore. I certainly wasn't sure where the samurai story was going but the lesson was more of the same. These two men are blinded by their greed and possessions and lose sight of what's important while their loved ones suffer. In the end, they both learn their lesson the hard way and suffer different consequences. It's a decent film but I found the horror elements were done better in Kwaidan. The overall story was still good and worth checking out but I was hoping for more scares, rather than a historical drama.",3.5

"Annual October Horror Watches 2023
Ugetsu is an undeniable feat in filmmaking, especially in context of the period in which it was made. I've been eyeing Kenji Mizoguchi's film Sansho the Bailiff for literal years now, as something about title always seemed to draw me in, but I never really got around to it, so this is my very first experience with the director, and there's something quite timeless about this work. There's almost a Shakespearean quality to its vision of the ghost story, the way in which the plot is woven is so similar to the Bard's work that I would've believed you if you told me this was a Japanese interpretation of some more unknown play. The characters split up in this interesting and fragmented manner, plot-lines and the people within them just pop in and out of the narrative until their ways intersect. They even talk in this very soliloquy-esque fashion where they wax poetic about their goals and problems in life, every line of dialogue in this fairly brief film is meticulously placed and very efficiently direct about what it's trying to tell to the audience, to the point where it's almost unrealistic, but at the same time, that's what keeps it from aging.
However, the cost of becoming timeless is the simplicity of this film. While there may be some very intriguing ideas and twists here and there, it mostly stays in a somewhat generic tale of apparitions and greed, and while they may not have been as tiring back then as they may be now, it doesn't change much about the experience I had with this movie. While it is hard to deny the sheer quality filmmaking at the core of Mizoguchi's film, I never really got super invested in the narrative, and it left me a bit cold in terms of excitement or provoking my thoughts. Aside from some very beautiful and well-composed cinematography, there isn't a lot that stunned me about it, you know? There are some terrifying scenes (ones which are enhanced by a great use of sound and music), yet the exploration of greed as a cause of despair is inherently devoid of subtlety, which made me appreciative of the craft but not necessarily an avid enjoyer of it. It's a ridiculously precise and impressive work of cinematic storytelling, as I said before, most of its technical elements are timeless, the acting, visuals, sound, music, story, editing and pacing are all about as good as anybody could want them to be, but I watched it more passively than actively, which frustrates me, because (to repeat it a third time) it is undeniably good.",4.0

It was: fine. I'm sorry I didn't like your pottery movie more, Gampa.
It feels shallow to just say ""Kuroneko outsold"", so let me elaborate on that a bit more. I think this film does a very good job at conveying its message - that war is inherently evil and will lead to destruction, even if you are the one who appears to be benefiting from it. It is a flawless movie in this regard. War very literally seduces you away from your moral compass to promise you riches and base pleasures while slowly luring you away from that which can actually love you in return and towards your own death. But for a ghost movie, it's simply not ghostly enough. There is a lot of eerie ambience, true, and there's certainly enough Joyce Carol Oates-type horror (the wanton cruelty of man, the subjugation of the female body) even in the lack of Stephen King-type horror (goblins), but we make it past the halfway mark before we get any hint of the supernatural. Obviously, this is considered a cornerstone of Japanese cinema, and I'm here on my damn computer and eating Oreos or whatever, but I don't know. I would have liked to see more yokai and such",3.5

The compositions are stunning, hardly showing their age, and particularly shine when portraying the barren wastelands of the war torn countryside, the eerie sea and the haunting veneer of the Kutsuki mansion.

Still I really had a good time with Ugetsu, the writing is strong in its dramatic and suspense work and while I wish the direction was just a little bit more psychical to really highlight the contrast between the desperation of survival and the sensuality of the fantasy Kenji Mizoguchi's camera nonetheless centerstages the performances and the intensity they bring to their roles, their body language alone during the first half really adds to the anxiety as they move with such force and speak with such unhinged volume you really come to understand what a miracle it is that they are still alive and if nothing else despite the somewhat jarring ending and the awkward transition into the fantastical Ugetsu does remain a cohesive piece throughout effective in its demonstration of how greed, selfishness and escapism can undermine our humanity in times of desperation.",4.0

MILD SPOILERS AHEAD
Ugetsu is one of those films that I really resonated with. I had a hard time connecting at first, l be completely honest, but by the time Miyagi had bought his armor and began his journey down the rabbit hole of killing a man and becoming a samurai, I was hooked. 
This movie is good, if you’re looking for an interesting foreign film, I highly recommend it. Mizoguchi’s tracking shots are ever present here, and very much so welcomed. This, additionally, displays a kind of destruction of the woman in feudal Japan, showing the exploitation that underwent. You truly feel for the women in this movie. The men, on the other hand, are a different story. The two leading men in this peace are kind of idiots. They do stupid things only for monetary gain and push away their wives all for money, and when one of their wives dies while he’s away CHEATING on her, I knew that the men in this movie were not meant to be looked up to.
In short, watch this movie and enjoy it :)

"Ugetsu benim okumayı çok sevdiğim Japon korku öykülerine benzerliğiyle öne çıkar gibi olsa da esasında her çağda insanlığın başına dert olmuş zayıflıklarımızla ilgili. 1953 yapımı olmasından sebep hayli düz bir anlatıya sahip olsa da gerek set tasarımı gerek oyunculukları halen taptaze ve bir savaşın gölgesindeki köyün iki ailesine odaklanıyor.
Burada özellikle not düşmeliyim ki filmdeki erkeklerin hemen hepsi fırsatçı ve gözlerini para hırsı bürümüşken kadınlar da hep önceliği ailelerine veren bir şekilde resmedilmişler. Öykünün yazıldığı ve filmin çekildiği dönemleri düşünürsek bu tarz bir tasvir normal. Zira Savaş sonrası Japonya'sı büyük bir yokluk ve sefaletin ardında gizlenen derin bir anlam arayışına da sahipti ve çoğunluk bunu mal mülk sahibi olmakta bulmuştu.
Bu insanı içine çeken açgözlülük ve hırs girdabı filmin de temel derdi aslında. Hani elinizdekinin kıymetini bilin, daha fazlası hep daha fazla acı getirir gibi söylemler ailelerin yoldan çıkan erkekleri üstünden anlatılıyor hep. Bunlardan birisi cenk edip meşhur olmak uğruna türlü badireler atlatırken aslında iyi bir yüreği olan çömlekçi içinde hayaletlerin de bulunduğu tehlikeli bir maceraya çekiliyor.

"Na superfície, é um conto sobre a natureza corrosiva da ambição que—como não há filme não contemporâneo—com certeza diz muito sobre o Japão de sua época, traumatizado pela guerra e tudo mais. No entanto, o que mais chama a atenção aqui é a busca de Mizoguchi, em seu domínio de mise en scène, por capturar algo de intangível, etéreo, no registro dos acontecimentos narrativos. Numa rejeição tipicamente realista da montagem e sua emotividade impositiva, a composição de planos em profundidade de campo, combinada com uso hábil e sutil de planos-sequência, resulta em imagens que estimulam um certo encantamento, como se paulatinamente entrássemos numa espécie de devaneio. Além disso, é também marcante a escolha de não se retratar nenhuma violência de modo gráfico; todos os atos violentos são concluídos no extracampo e nenhum sangue é derramado explicitamente em cena.
Com isso, toda a expressividade acaba se concentrando nesse contorno esotérico que as imagens vão adquirindo, e ainda mais quando a trama introduz o elemento sobrenatural. Então, ao que o espectador se rende cada vez mais ao efeito encantatório de ""Contos da lua vaga"", suas imagens começam a se transformar em algo a mais do que retratos de sujeitos e paisagens: elas se tornam os planos em que se revelam as almas atormentadas.",5.0

the editing, which follows Mizoguchi's one scene, one cut rule, creates profound effect in its montage and juxtapositions of imagery. a scene is often defined as a place where an incident occurs, but in terms of storytelling, a scene is also a mini story with its own point. Mizoguchi creates many scenes following the latter definition in the same location, showing his efficiency and subtlety in storytelling. its truly awe inspiring and is an ability only matched by Ozu, tho he does have his own methods in achieving this high level of art @(・●・)@
♪(*^^)o∀*∀o(^^*)♪
this is a fable that ultimately ends with a hopeful outlook but it is not without its pits of despair. not to mention how unnerving the supernatural elements are weaved in seamlessly. i think there was no greater moment of shock in the film than the moment Lady Wakasa realised Genjuro's betrayal. every single scene with her was just enchanting, her spirit seemed to have taken over the camera and editing with how everything was able to mesh together like a ghost wandering through dew soaked grass
watching this for the third time has made many moments all the more poignant and disturbing, usually some how at the same time.  i think ive gained more empathy for Genjuro and Tobei. yes theyre selfish idiots but the mistakes they make are all too human and sometimes those mistakes result in permant consequences. Mizoguchi of course can never go without his tragic woman and all three cases - Lady Wakasa, Ohama, and Miyagi, just show the different facets of suffering, always taking the brunt of the world

"64/100
My first Mizoguchi! I can say I'm pleasantly surprised by his directing style, as it's really good, with a lot of scenes featuring a bunch of extras in the background that are obviously hard to direct well, yet he manages to do it all seemlessly (although I do have to say that Kurosawa is better when it comes to crowds, just watch The Hidden Fortress if you don't believe me). There's plenty of visually arresting scenes here too, like the fog scene with the boats, for example, and the pacing is really great as well, never letting me become bored with the film. Unfortunately the story itself isn't necessarily the greatest in my opinion, so the movie could only compensate with the visuals (which it kind of did, but only up to a point, hence the not-so-extraordinary-but-still-good rating). It's not a bad story or anything but it's also not typically the sort of stuff I'm really interested in seeing, be it by Mizoguchi, Kurosawa or even Stanley Kubrick. And there's definitely some aspects that feel dated just enough to lose the full intended effect here, despite the movie overall again aging quite well for the time. I'm definitely gonna check out some more Mizoguchi (actually wanted to watch Sansho the Bailiff but it was too long so I dropped it for this, but maybe that wasn't the best decision) because his style is close (yet different enough so you can realized who directed what) to Kurosawa's, and I love Kurosawa's style. This is a pretty good movie in my opinion, though I will say I'm not as crazy about it as many people seem to be.",3.5

"Sight and Sound’s Greatest Films of All Time watch challenge #172 - (film =90 out of 264)
Having now seen everything that didn’t make the top 100 on the Sight and Sound list, I return to the top films with Ugetsu, tied for 90th place with Madame de…, which I have already seen this year for this challenge, and The Leopard, Yi Yi, and Parasite. Ugetsu tells the story of a pottery maker, his brother, and their wives as they are all forced to flee their village when bandits come to raid. The potter dreams of wealth and his brother dreams of glory, both ignoring their wives insistence that living safely together is enough. Forced to separate, the four of them go on their own small adventures, paced excellently in the 97 minute runtime.
Mizoguchi was highly regarded by Akira Kurosawa, and seeing this it is plain to see why. Mizoguchi’s film blends fantasy and reality, bouncing back and forth between the two brothers with changes in the lighting and blocking of the scenes to match. The potter, easily won over by wealth and luxury, ends up dealing with the ghosts of a lost mansion. From the moment the lady of the mansion is shown the line is blurred. No others acknowledge her and she speaks with no one else. The potter himself becomes lost in a few flights of fancy prior to being lured to the mansion, imagining his wife adorned in fine garments. His brother, however, has his story blocked out completely differently, being more akin to samurai film, with the camera moving to best showcase his thoughts as he worms his way into high the high status of a samurai general. The way the dreams end, the reality of their choices, is hard-hitting. Mizoguchi repeats his lighting and blocking and camera moves at just the right moments to lead the audience to a conclusion wordlessly, communicated through vision alone.",4.0
"A ghost story and period drama that examines what happens when men give into temptation, glory and greed in pursuit of heroic fantasy and/or wealth; certainly a fitting story for post war Japan.

A world left in ruins as the consequence of war; and the broken bodies and spirits of the innocent women that war leaves behind.

Quase que na estrutura de fábulas, as histórias mostram dois homens comuns do Japão feudal se afastarem de suas famílias e ocupações tanto em consequência da guerra mas, principalmente, por consequência de si mesmos. A esposa de Genjūrō, Miyagi, diz que os homens mudaram com a guerra. Mas o quanto as atitudes deles são consequências da guerra ou o quanto a guerra é consequência das atitudes deles?
Mas, se são os homens que fazem as escolhas erradas, são as mulheres que sofrem mais. Seja na guerra, seja nessa fábula de Mizoguchi.
O sucesso sempre vem com o preço em sofrimento.
Ao seguir irresponsavelmente seu sonho em se tornar um grande samurai, Tōbei deixa sua esposa, Ohama, sozinha tanto física quanto financeiramente. Não tarda que o pior aconteça.
Os estupros seriados, os sequestros de mulheres e sua transformação em prostitutas (as ""mulheres conforto"", como eram conhecidas) de forma coercitiva é um dos mais chocantes crimes de guerra do Império Japonês, e que até hoje o país reluta em reconhecer.
O filme a todo momento mostra a violência brutal com essas mulheres. Mais do que o abandono de Tōbei, a desgraça de Ohama é sobre a desgraça de toda uma geração de mulheres escravizadas e violadas repetidamente por homens e pelo Estado. Mizoguchi, cujo filme anterior é considerado pró-guerra, parece aqui pedir desculpas não por si, mas pelo seu país, ao mostrar tão verdadeiramente e brutalmente o que essas mulheres sofreram.
Um erro para um homem, talvez, mas para uma mulher, muito pior.
Genjūrō se perde na ambição material de dar uma vida confortável à esposa Miyagi e ao filho pequeno. No começo, ele negligencia seu filho, sua esposa e depois a si mesmo no esforço de não perder suas cerâmicas quando sua vila é atacada. Mas o mais cruel de tudo ocorre quando conhece a misteriosa Lady Wasaka.
A figura mítica e trágica do filme, Wasaka é a personificação do espírito feminino puro e ingênuo. Apaixonada por Genjūrō, ela lhe apresenta o mundo dos prazeres e do luxo, e ele rapidamente esquece de sua mulher e filho. Quando cai em si, é quase que tarde demais: Wasaka também está desgraçada por ele, enquanto Miyagi deu seu último suspiro pela sobrevivência do filho.
Aqui, a figura sobrenatural não é vilã, e sim vítima do sistema patriarcal. Wasaka é vítima da guerra. Miyagi também. Wasaka morreu jovem, ansiando por conhecer o amor verdadeiro. Miyagi morreu no desespero, ansiando pelo retorno do marido. Ambas amaram e confiaram em Genjūrō, que falhou com elas. Porém o erro dele reverbera bem mais forte e doloroso sobre essas mulheres.
Este mundo é uma residência temporária, onde vamos chorar até que a madrugada venha coberta pelas ondas.
Esteticamente, o filme é uma obra de arte. As cenas da viagem de barco sob a densa névoa e as passagens de Lady Wasaka pelo mercado são hipnotizantes, poéticas; um contraste com as cenas brutais de invasões, pilhagens e assassinatos perpetrados por samurais.
Um dos grandes pontos altos do filme é a trilha sonora, onde ritmos típicos do Japão embalam letras profundas, que parecem já antever as desgraças que decorrerão ao longo do filme.
Por fim, Contos da Lua Vaga é um filme maravilhoso, poético e brutal que é uma crítica forte ao Japão feudal e seu tratamento desumano a mulheres, mas é também uma fábula atemporal sobre o sofrimento feminino em um mundo ainda ditado por homens, onde os erros dos mesmos recaem em dobro sobre elas.",5.0
"A mixture of social realism and otherworldly fantasy, Kenji Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu takes place during a time of civil war in sixteenth-century Japan.
Two brothers, one consumed by greed, the other by envy. In a time when the land is savaged by marauding armies, they risk their families and their lives to pursue their obsessions
Suffering is an innate part of life for women in Mizoguchi’s cinema, and in the world at large—that much has not changed since the time of this film’s release. Man’s drive for glory has dire costs for the women they leave behind, take for granted, or victimize, with consequences in Ugetsu that echo into the afterlife. Mizoguchi considers a woman’s fate to be the symbol of human cruelty, and his films emphasize the pattern of male ambition at a woman’s expense.
Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu tells their stories in one of the greatest of all films -- one which, along with Kurosawa's Rashomon helped introduce Japanese cinema to Western audiences.The heroes are rough-hewn and consumed by ambition, but the film style is elegant and mysterious, and somehow we know before we are told that this is a ghost story.",5.0

Y qué bien haber podido verla en mi eterno verano en barcelona porque qué maravilla de película. Creo que se ha vuelto una de mis favoritas. No me esperaba para nada ese lado de fantasía con la princesa Wakasa, a veces subestimo las pelis antiguas y siempre me acaban dando en toda la cara con sus genialidades y sus planos . No sé porqué pienso siempre que todo lo innovador en el cinese está haciendo ahora cuando el cine ha sido innovador en sus formas y narrativas desde que se creó.
Todo esto para decir que la peli me ha impresionado mucho. Aunque mi historia favorita es la de la princesa de la muerte (esq ojjjj con todo el tema de que la muerte está cerca, cómo en el pueblo no se atreven a subir a la colina, cuando ya ves que cuando entran por primera vez a la casa está derruida por fuera y sospechas algo pero luego se te pasa hasta que ves que está todo en ruinas ajjj qué peeeeliculon joder), el ascenso al poder y la gloria del hermano me parece igual de fatástica.

"Ugetsu é uma obra-prima. Um dos melhores, se não o melhor filme que já assisti.
À vista disso, é um filme muito denso e completo, que lhe entrega: drama, suspense, emoção, ação, aflição, empatia, e uma valiosa mensagem, a qual o filme todo transcorre sobre.
É uma obra rica, uma história fantástica, um roteiro muio bom, que foi executado de uma forma genial –
• A cinematografia é elite, segmentos e planos de câmera impressionantes para a época [destaco a cena do barco], cenários muito bem detalhados.
• A sonoplastia é bem simples, mas tão efetiva e poderosa, utilizando o som de fundo correto na hora certa.
• A já mencionada diversidade cênica, traz uma riqueza imensurável para a obra. Cenas de canto, ação, alegria, tristeza, tensão, drama, melancolia... Puro suco do Cinema.
• Elenco muito talentoso, com o destaque sendo a Machiko Kyo [Lady Wakasa], a qual performou sua personagem de modo sublime [aliás, o detalhe das manchas em posição de chifre em sua cabeça, foram geniais, haja vista a natureza da personagem e da metáfora representada na obra].

"“Simply be aware of the difference between reality and dreams.”
Unfolds like an eerie, ethereal dream—a testament to Kenji Mizoguchi’s mastery of cinematic storytelling that transcends the boundaries of time, reality, and genre. Considered a masterpiece of Japanese cinema, ‘Ugetsu’ is a poignant exploration of ambition, desire, and the illusions that often blind humanity to the essence of existence.
Derived from two tales in Akinari Ueda’s “Ugetsu Monogatari,” the film revolves around the intertwined destinies of two couples in civil war-torn 16th-century Japan. The men—driven by dreams of wealth and glory—embark on journeys that pull them far from their humble realities. It is in these ventures that ‘Ugetsu’ unfolds its spectral narrative, moving fluidly between reality and fantasy, embodying the uncanny essence of traditional Japanese ghost stories, with cinematography that is nothing short of exquisite, with each frame a hauntingly beautiful painting. Mizoguchi’s celebrated long takes, characterized by fluid tracking shots, give an almost balletic rhythm to the narrative, creating an immersive experience that seizes our attention and emotions. These visuals, coupled with the evocative use of sound and silence, invoke an otherworldly ambiance that is simultaneously captivating and disconcerting.
The performances, led by Masayuki Mori and Machiko Kyō, are imbued with a nuanced emotional depth. Their exploration of the characters’ ambitions and follies is both intimate and universal, giving the film a poignant resonance that lingers long after the credits roll. More than just an aesthetically arresting ghost story, at its core, ‘Ugetsu’ is a profound social critique. Through its haunting narrative, Mizoguchi dissects the human condition, revealing the destructive consequences of unchecked ambition and greed and exposing the harsh realities of war and the socio-economic disparities amplified in its wake.
Yet, Mizoguchi doesn’t descend into cynicism. Instead, he offers redemption through the power of self-realization and love. A profound message, conveyed through the spectral narrative, gives ‘Ugetsu’ an enduring relevance that transcends its historical setting. It’s a piece of cinematic art that seamlessly blends genre and form, leaving you entranced by its beauty and moved by its powerful message. An ode to the transcendental power of storytelling.",4.5
"Very entertaining, and extremely well directed. I'm not leaving this movie with any new morals, but there is a lot to be learned from the mise en scène.
The beheading into Tomei's spear kill was a very cool shot concept. Also of note were several crowd shots where we track our main characters while extras stream through multiple layers of the frame. Impressive.",3.5
"I really appreciate what this film is saying. It talks about the way in which women are treated by men. When talking about a subject like men treating women poorly it could come off as attacking all men. This film never feels like that. It criticizes the way in which men will leave their women and children for reasons of greed, lust or glory. Men seem to ignore the women that genuinely care for them and try to attain things for completely selfish reasons. I believe all of the stories this film tells as I have seen plenty of similar things in my own life (not me but other guys). The only real reason I feel like I can’t give this film a 9 or a 10 is due to the parts of the film where characters stories split up. I feel that it will spend too much time on one character and ignore the others for too long to the point that I forget what was even happening with the other characters. To me the points were I was most invested in the film are when all 4 main characters are all together. Still this is definitely a great film and I definitely need to see more Mizoguchi.",4.0
I am not very familiar with Japanese folklore but this worked on me way more then I expected it to. Adore the haunting and eerie atmosphere of the whole thing.

"The influence of Japanese movies from the 40s and 50s is one of my favorite influences, I love these movies
Movies made from the most poetic side of cinema, movies created by people born and with the talent for this
Kenji Mizoguchi is one of the great filmmakers in history and Ugetsu is probably his best work, at least the most recognized.
Ugetsu is a story of a group of people who, out of ambition and necessity, make horrible decisions that worsen the situation experienced by war and hunger at this time.

"""War is hell and men are fools""
Admittedly, it took a little time to get truly immersed in the feature but when it eventually got to the point where I started to understand it, I came to realise just how unique and interesting it all is. It's an intriguing drama that has infusions of horror and mysticism and the third act really makes an impact but I also feel as though it should've ended several scenes earlier, with a sense of hopelessness as the main character lies down in his ruined house in the company of the ghosts of both his wife and child.",4.0

"Potpourri #2, 3/5
I really appreciate what a straightforward morality tale this is. I think the most affecting part, to me, is when Genjuro says, “this is paradise” when he is in the deepest immersion in his depravity. This movie doesn’t show people deciding they don’t want the “bad things;” it shows people getting the “bad things,” absolutely loving it, and then deciding it’s wrong, Tobei by seeing the consequences of his actions, and Genjuro by finally understanding the insubstantiality of that existence.
Fumio Hayasaka’s score recalls his work for Rashomon, in that it opens with a shō, but uses a lot more traditional instruments, for textures that are sometimes discordant by Western standards. Machiko Kyo’s song and dance scene during the wedding is really cool. The pirate omen scene is cool. The kiln scene is tense.
This movie moves at its own pace, but that’s okay.",4.0

I said it before when I watched sansho but mizoguchi’s writing is so modern and feels so similar to films that were coming out at least 20 years later, and even those would feel more modern when compared to other films of their time. His sense of character is so powerful and digs so deep into their intentions and emotions and its astounding how much clarity and power he can give to a story that seems simple at the surface and deeply poetic in its depths.

"Genjūrō sowing: Haha fuck yeah!!! Yes!!
Genjūrō reaping: Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck.

A fascinating folk tale - one which I've been meaning to watch for ages, and which distinguishes itself from similar Japanese films from the same period through the use of fantastical elements which are realised wonderfully.
The image of the boat going through the fog towards the beginning of the film looks fantastic, and feels in some ways like it bridges the gap between the grounded prologue and the more magical elements of the rest of the film. I especially loved the music, which at times is downright creepy (e.g. during Genjūrō and Lady Masaka's final scene) and really highlights the film's spectral qualities. I think ordinarily I might have been bothered by the juxtaposition of these elements, but in the context of a fable, it really worked for me.
Although the general story beats and the theme of greed aren't especially novel, this film places them in a really interesting context alongside some indelible imagery, which makes it a winner for sure!",4.0

Logicamente que essa cobiça se torna infinita e egoísta a medida que os personagens possuem seus desejos.
Esse culto ao material, objetos mais importantes que laços familiares, mais importante que pessoas.

"This is a pretty important movie for me, as it served as one of my introductions to foreign cinema a few years ago. I thought it was great back then, but I fell in love with it this time. I appreciated so many more qualities this time: the eerie sound design, the level of detail with which this feudal world was evoked, the desolate wintry look of the landscapes. Ugetsu tells a timeless story of the human condition, namely how our greed and ambition and lust blinds us to what truly matters to us, and how the arrogance of men causes suffering for women. But what truly makes the film special is how it heightens these elements, placing them in a spectral dreamworld. I was blown away by the formal mastery of the film, it was nonstop beautiful compositions and haunting imagery (the boat ride through the fog, the picnic by the glimmering lake, Miyagi sowing in their ruined house as drawn breaks). The heightened nature of the film also allowed me to accept things that I usually dislike (theatrical performances, blunt dialogue) to be perfectly natural in this folkloric world. The film ends on a truly universal note, a lesson may be learned yet we can’t undo our mistakes, and all we can do is learn to live with our regret.

"“the world is a temporary abode.”
delusions of grandeur will uproot, torment, extinguish.
often, people disguise their desires as a calling, a signal that cannot be denied. what’s important to recognize, in foresight, is how these desires effect everyone… while it’s true that “you live and you learn”, this idiom rejects critical thinking. that said, being intentional and rational during wartime isn’t exactly a “walk in the park” (idioms galore), it’s a walk into an abyss with no end date, or permanently night, in the words of mgmt.
this film is majorly about the suffering of women at the hands and minds of men who wander from their “post”. men who believe that life has a fixed solution. “if i just get (x), then i will always have (y).” humans are not gods, we have power to change, but change is constant whether or not we are active in it. and change can produce highs and lows. sometimes dramatically high highs and low lows
both miyagi and ohama are wise to the failings of man. they hold the power to see what is already great. what keeps them safe, alive, communal, is not money, but the presence of their husbands and their fellow villagers. to rebuild after a devastation, all (alive) will be needed.
as it all comes to a close, ohama said, “i told you so… but you were too stupid to learn except through misfortune.”
tobei and genjuro’s misfortunes are the icing to the misogyny cake— abuse lands a direct blow to both women, the men are relatively unscathed. though i will admit genjuro had a rise and fall that promoted actual growth of character.
this is the perfect scenario to deter someone from making their hobby and passion their way of profit.

"I'll start by saying yes, the pace is meandering, and the themes are pretty customary to the Japanese ghost story genre. BUT the visuals are stunning, following a well defined style, and the way that Mizoguchi treats his characters reflects the moral compass of the film. Nowadays, most people are turned off by black and white, but though I love colored films, there is something so classic about the colorless landscape. It also lends to Mizoguchi's aversion to violence because even beheadings can be PG if there is no blood. The respect with which he handles violence against women is also commendable considering a lot of directors don't have the decency to respect women this way in the modern age. The long shots he loves so much emphasize their pain without making it a spectacle, as with Ohama after she is assaulted in a temple. You feel with her the horror of her situations. You even feel bad for the ghost woman that is tossed aside by Genjuro. It is also clear in Ugetsu that the horror of Japanese films lies in the fear of the other and a reflection of national anxieties whereas Western horror is obsessed with the self and the horror of the body. The anxieties associated with civil war in Japan are manifested in the husbands' betrayal of their wives. You can also see how the film manifests social consciousness in regard to post WWII relations with America in how Genjuro returns home to find what he loved is lost forever both because of outside forces and his own actions.

"Similar to the ghostly aberrations which beckon our main protagonist towards a world of unbridled satisfaction, the very nature of what has continually been enticing and manipulating our actions (temptation towards greed) throughout human history will continue to seep through the lineage of our species; at least for as long as people continually have something of themselves to prove or sell within the present moment. What’s fascinating me regarding what I felt the film was getting at in terms of ghosts and ominous premonitions of the future was that the main two protagonists (one in particular) continually reside mentally within no particular place in time at all. Even with the imminent threat of Civil War bringing about the potential collapse of each one of their family units, nothing more pressing is occupying their minds besides what financial opportunities the war shall bring. Days and weeks appear to slip by without a hint of linear stability, which only heightens as the crazed fantasies of the two of them become more elaborate. All events which transpire are fleeting in a similar manner to which dreams flow. A variety of shot compositions elicit feelings of dread regarding how the natural world (trees being most prominent in shots) is what stands at the forefront of our subconscious fantasies, their roots feeding us desires from deep within the Earth’s core. The protagonist prescribed to speak with the living dead is metaphorically a walking carcass himself. The other one daydreaming of becoming a respected samurai furthermore feeds off of the dead as a form of symbolic, cannibalistic lineage-making.
But each character can never truly live within the present moment if so caught up within their own imaginative musings. More specifically, the man who yearns to be a samurai overlooks the very tenets of Bushido loyalty and righteousness. Living by codes would mean living on despite hardship and heartache at what has gone and what will become. It means loyalty to those you’ve devoted your life to as well. Each character strives towards ideals which are not only rude in practice, but quite literally unreal. Considering this movie came out in 1954, it may very well be allegorical of the feeling of all things seeming unreal in the aftermath of WWII; when many felt that to live within their own prideful and highly sensual fantasies was a way of escaping the horrors. I’m to also assume that many family units were eviscerated in the process, presenting another historical connection to the narrative of this film. I can also imagine why the film has a fable and moralizing-like facet to its telling, which is both because it’s taken from notable fables written in the past and because these fables do not need more narrative complication to convey their rather cynical message. It does end on a more hopeful note than what I was expecting it to, yet that final shot seemed to be of grave importance to the future generations of farmers and dreamers whilst time continues to push on (it ends on a grave, I’ll just say that).",4.0

A beautiful and haunting ‘ghost tale,’ a concise work only a master could stuff so full. Perfect flow and high drama performances make this an exemplary theatric piece, but wide natural images engulfed in an apparition of smog and delusion makes it a fairy tale. An extremely forward thinking use of sound, utilizing small pieces sparsely laid in the mix to create constant atmosphere, and instrumentation used in its bursts to completely alter what we see, or what we believe to.
Was shocked by its ending, refreshingly optimistically in a sense, and gives a natural and earned shot of hope after a heavy and bleary eyed run where it seems nearly impossible. This Mizoguchi guy really had something huh",4.0

"Whilst perhaps a tad bit too slow for me, I will say that I was very impressed by Ugetsu. A drama set in 16th century Japan about a group of peasants? Not exactly my cup of tea - and when my only real reference points for Japanese period cinema are Yojimbo, which I didn't love, and the first half of Rashomon, which I was too distracted to watch all the way through; my hopes weren't high.
Thankfully Ugetsu was amazing.
A fable as old as time, two men in a small farming village get the feeling of 'grass is always greener' and try to find better lives for themselves, as a rich pottery maker and a Samurai. Their drive to achieve these ambitions leaves their wives abandoned and horror ensues.
I don't know that the takeaway from Ugetsu was supposed to be 'if you try and climb the class ladder, you will fail, therefore stay in your place' but that's what it felt a bit like - I did enjoy the social commentary nonetheless, even if it didn't exactly lead to a Marxist revolution.
The cinematography was of course beautiful, all four of the main cast (as well as all of the supporting actors, like Genjuro's child and Lady Wakasa) did a fantastic job, and I'm so glad I watched this in a theatre rather than trying to force myself to do it at home. If you struggle with sitting through slow, foreign-language films as I do then don't watch this on your laptop.",4.0

"Film #22 of my chronological journey through the history of world cinema
This was the Mizoguchi I was expecting for Life of Oharu. Right from the jump the camera work stands out. He utilizes movement and still shots so well. The other thing apparent from the beginning is how fantastic the music is. He uses mostly traditional Japanese music, and it really accents the films themes perfectly. He really is fantastic at communicating so much through song and music. Outside of the pure filmmaking aspects, this was also a phenomenal story. It's based on a traditional Japanese story, that I would credit here if I weren't writing this in an airport. Either way he does a phenomenal job adapting it for the screen, and he really does a good job accenting what the essence of the story really is. I was originally kind of bummed after watching Life of Oharu so I'm glad I now feel a renewed sense of optimism heading into Mizoguchi's remaining notable films.",4.5

"Precisamos valorizar de onde viemos, com quem vivemos e quem nos ama. Nesse clichê cafona levado ao máximo Contos da Lua Vaga se constrói dentro de um Japão rural e no meio de uma guerra civil horrorosa acompanhamos duas famílias sendo separadas pelos ataques mas, especialmente pela ganância dos homens da família.
Mas se apenas esse aspecto fosse colocado, seria apenas mais um filme sobre famílias tradicionais e as consequências das guerras no século 16. Mas Mizoguchi constrói uma fábula a partir disso. Mostra como o homem pode ser envenenado pelo próprio anseio de ser o que não é. Pela busca incessante pela ascensão social, financeira, colocando o ego a frente da sociedade onde vive. 
E Contos da Lua Vaga vai além. Além mesmo. Apresenta esse enredo pra mostrar os fantasmas que rondam esses homens, o fogo que queima dentro do forno, do desejo ardente pelo que não pode ser. E com uma ambientação belíssima, vemos sombras, fantasmas, questionamento sobre religião, prazer. 
O filme é uma obra prima em forma e conteúdo. Ele brinca de realismo mágico sem medo de aprofundar os mergulhos nas questões mais humanas. De vida e morte. De ser ou não ser. Mizoguchi conta uma história Shakespeariana profundamente japonesa - humana.

With its collocation of hazy spiritualism and stark, violent human terror, Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is a resplendent and quietly devastating anti-war tale that relocates the then recent trauma of Japanese involvement in World War 2 to the feudal-era, unpicking the waste and futility of endless conflict through a classic ghost story. An exploration of honour and mor(t)ality, the film straddles an otherworldly realm but posits that the real horror and devastation is here on Earth, as the desperation of men to fight, to survive and to be valorised leads to unimaginable torment.
Ripe with a poeticism that is accentuated by Miyagawa's staggering cinematography, Ugetsu has a timelessness that allows it to connect the disparate threads of its dislocation, bringing into sharp, harrowing focus the cruel, unforgiving effect of war, particularly on those who exist on the periphery of the battlefield.

"Ugetsu is read like a fable where greed and envy are frowned upon. The message is simple but effective. The characters are charming and interesting, and the movie oscillates between dramatic and comedic moments with some twists along the journey. The war consequences are evident in the torment of the men of the story that create these fantasies to save themselves in any way possible. It also displays how innocent women and children suffer in war.",4.0
"What I found so impressive was the focus on women in this film. They are the ones that are realistics because they are the ones actually living in the world. The mens’ heads are in sky where they don’t have consequences for their actions, for their greed. It’s the women who are affected, it’s their lives that are taken. I don’t feel that the suffering we watch is one that belittles the women but makes you confront their reality and require empathy.

"This is becoming one of my favourite films ever.

The four main characters are incredibly rich, each with their own ambitions anchored by the two husband’s greed and envy. Their realities all so different from one another, they slowly
blend into fantasy. Each journey is harrowing and spectacular, with all travelling through a ghostly path.  
And some of the most fascinating filmmaking is in these fantasy sequences. The crane shots, the dissolves, the blocking that obscures a lot of integral images. There’s also the unbelievable use of sunlight and candlelight in these scenes. Kenji Mizoguchi tells this story so economically with beautiful restraint and excess when needed. To manageably tell one story is a feat in itself, but to follow four protagonists, including a detailed story of Lady Wakasa and the subtext of post-war Japan all in a 96 minute film is downright extraordinary. There’s a trove of memorable moments in this film that cause awe and impress even this many views in. I come back year after year with new perspectives and new pieces to understand.

Showing us that maybe we, modern civilization, have chosen to stay with Lady Wakasa, amongst the fantasy and the dead, refusing to acknowledge that in the living word, our bodies are slowly and eternally rotting.",5.0

"Film yang diadaptasi dari buku karya Ueda Akinari, yang sekaligus terinspirasi dari salah satu cerita pendek Guy de Maupassant.
Kenji Mizoguchi dalam film ini menggabungkan beberapa cerita yang bersintesis, meski ada unsur fantasinya tetapi tidak menghilangkan segi sejarahnya. Kita dipertautkan hubungan masa lalu tentang kejamnya perang dan bagaimana konteks itu terendap dalam melankolia mistis (alam gaib). Genjuro seorang pembuat gerabah harus menghadapi kondisi yang beringas, yaitu perang saudara di Jepang pada masa hidupnya. Berbeda dengan dia, saudaranya lebih berambisi memilih ingin menjadi prajurit. Sebuah kesia-siaan ketika ia mendapati istrinya yang mengalami pelecehan oleh prajurit perang, dan membuat dirinya sadar jika perang hanya merusak kehidupan. Sedangkan Genjuro terperangkap dalam dunia gaib. Saya memahaminya sebagai dunia fantasi, di mana Putri Wakasa yang sudah mati kembali memunculkan dirinya ke dunia untuk menikmati sebuah kenikmatan yang belum ia rasakan layaknya seorang manusia, yaitu cinta. Putri Wakasa pun mengambil alih dunia Genjuro agar ia bisa bersama menikmati hubungan cinta dunia. Dalam kehidupan manusia, cinta adalah salah satu materi yang akan melengkapi hidup manusia. Itu tergambar dalam kitab-kitab dan ajaran kearifan para orang-orang bijaksana. Saya teringat salah satu anime yang diangkat dari manga yang berjudul Ichiro. Ichiro yang bisa melihat hantu, ia sering dimintai tolong agar dirinya bisa menyelesaikan misi yang ingin capai si hantu sebelum hantu tersebut kembali tenang dalam dunianya. Saya melihat film ini, dari segi fantasinya mirip dengan anime tersebut, cuma perbedaannya Putri Wakasa yang langsung turun tangan untuk menyelesaikan keinginannya. Bisa dikata dalam beberapa keyakinan budaya manusia, memiliki perihal seperti yang tergambar dalam film ini, bahwa dipercayai ketika orang mati yang belum merasakan keseluruhan atau kekompleksan dalam hidup manusia, ia akan memanifestasikan dirinya agar keinginan tersebut bisa dicapai. Entah saya belum mendapatkan kiasan lainnya dibalik kisah hantu yang Kenji hubungkan dengan sejarah. Namun, saat Genjuro terperangkap dalam dunia gaib, istrinya harus mati ketika ia berjuang sendiri melawan para prajurit yang kelaparam setelah melewati masa krisis perang untuk merebut nasinya untuk anaknya. Film yang memilukan, setiap menonton film yang menggambarkan efek dari perang.",4.0

"At the risk of repeating myself, I am always concerned that art from the 1950s will feel like a sanitized photobook of the real world, rather than an honest representation of any people or concepts. This film coarsely depicts the naivety and miscalculations of 2 ambitious villagers during wartime who don't grasp the scope of their collateral damage until far too late. The depth of each set location, the variety of dissolve and pattern transitions between scenes, and the dim lighting choices toward the end add complexity. I am not expecting to see graphic material or even a hint of effects, so a lot is riding on the physicality of these actors. My favorite Mori performance, and I also found that Mitsuko Mito really showed the full arc of Ohama emotionally.",3.5
"The ambition of hope is a dangerous thing. Not hope itself, we all need that in some way or form. But when desperation creates an ambitious hope, it becomes a very dangerous thing. Especially when such a form of hope presents itself to frail souls who have never experienced much “hope” to begin with. 
The tone of this incredibly elegant piece of cinema is set up wonderfully, not just by its foretelling ominous score but by also the integral dreams and desires that are shared by our main characters. And the lengths they will go to transcend these dreams into reality despite their blinding power.
Ambitious Hope.
This is an enchanting mysterious fairytale just as much as it is a tragic Shakespearean story of the human condition, blinding grasping at the poisonous branches of survival. We witness our four characters sticking together amid war and personal endeavors. But, what we are seeing, is their torment and distress subconsciously betraying each other at every turn. 
There is much devastation here, the devastation that is handled beautifully in this personal sprawling story. The devastation comes from the war and the misfortune of our characters, but yet it is shown in a different way which is refreshingly rare. The war itself in this tale is like an echo in the background, a myth on the mountain, but its effects and impacts come rolling into the path of the character like destructive waves with reactive effects.

Never have war, domestic drama, and ghosts ever blended together this hauntingly surreal that it feels like a tale Guillermo Del Toro would have adapted into a more ghoulish and gory result like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, but Ugetsu shows how the experience of the everyday and the supernatural can be so indistinct and make you feel like you're lost in a dream that preys on all the hardship, guilt, and longing through wartime and destitution.",4.5

"More of a morality tale than the ghost story I was expecting. I feel like the 2 fame/fortune seeking family abandoning husbands got off easier than they deserved.

An additional highlight was the wonderful use of sound to create a haunting and uneasy atmosphere.",3.5
Creepy-deepy atmosphere. Really makes you THINK.,4.0
"This movie basically already had me won over before I turned it on because I love these Japanese folk horror stories.
Ugetsu has a really unorthodox but effective horror score. There’s wailing voices and what sounds like a wailing saxophone or something, there’s a lot of wailing in general. It’s very ghostly. It can get almost comically spooky.
There’s also this pounding deep drum that beats out this thunderous, repetitive death march that really helps add to the sense of impending doom of the surroundings. Like Kaneto Shindo’s horror classics Onibaba and Kuroneko, Ugetsu takes place during a time of war. There’s death, destruction, and uncertainty everywhere, you really get the idea that you can never let your guard down.
Having seen a number of these Japanese folk horrors now, if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s that you should never make love to a ghost. It just never works out. Ugetsu is a great monkey’s paw tale. Be careful what you wish for. It’s just unfortunate that sometimes we have to learn our lessons the hard way.",4.0
"What a film. This is a gorgeous piece of cinema. All the actors throw their whole bodies into their performances, whether that means clawing at the ground with their toes or diving straight through walls. There are so many moments of tension you can barely catch your breath and each place that the characters travel through feels distinct and fully realised. The tying up of loose ends in the final act of the film has slightly less momentum than the rest of it, but the final quiet scene makes sense of that as the time for ""being in a story"" for this small community seems to come to an end.
Folk horror is one of my favourite ever things, when done right, and this tale of moonlight and rain absolutely pulls it off. Here grimy materiality meets ghostliness as the audience becomes unsure if what they are seeing is real even when it is rendered so vividly. Machiko Kyo brings so much to her short time on screen. The way that she manages to be physically dominating without ever rising to her full height is really masterful. In fact the entire cast does a lot of really amazing acting while huddled on the floor.
To the extent that these stories warn against the pursuit of riches at the expense of one's community I am totally in. Miyagi using all her weight to try and pull her husband back from yet another of his suicidal sales ventures is heartbreaking. However I find the idea of ""becoming a fallen woman"" as a consequence of your husband's negligence much less compelling. There is a fantasy here that if you were just a nice, hard working little farmer no soldiers could ever assault your wife, along with the belief that this assault is a defiling of her honour that you should regain by working hard. This parable feels much flatter than the rich depiction of the precarity of these people's lives which Mizoguchi provides in the rest of the film. I would have loved to see a more nuanced depiction of Ohama's life without Tobei, or at least something other than a return to a peaceful status quo marriage for them at the end.
This reservation aside, I found this film really impressive, moving and intriguing. This was my first Mizoguchi but it will not be my last.",0.0

Ugetsu is wonderful. I literally have nothing negative to say about this film. Every performance is wonderful. The set pieces are immersive. The cinematography is wonderful. There are so many shots in this film that just left me in awe. One with the villagers needing to flee their village due to an attacking army party. Seeing the villagers escape in long reeds and shadows was so well executed. Towards the end, there is a scene where the room completely changes as the character leaves the room and circles the outside. Just amazing.
I personally hadn't seen a Mizoguchi film before and cannot wait to see more. How he blends war, relationships and spiritual elements while still being concise and human is truly a talent. On top of that blending anti war, greed, ambition, and loss in the mix takes the film to a new level. Seeing Ugetsu reminded me of seeing my first Kurosawa and my first Ozu.
All in all, Ugetsu is a near perfect film that I cannot wait to see again. I highly suggest to all to see this film and as always remember this is just my initial impression.

Genjuro, at the film's conclusion, thinks he has found comfort with his wife and child. The arrival of other villagers reveals to him that she has been murdered while he was living with Lady Wasaka – the domestic bliss for which he is at last so grateful is only a mirage.

"Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu is a haunting and allegorical ghost story set during feudal Japan with some beautifully staged cinematography and some effective unsettling sound design.
The narrative is engrossing as we follow two entrepreneurial potters in Genjuro & Tobei try and sell their wares while raiding samurai threaten to bring their humble world tumbling down around them. Tobei seeks glory in the form of becoming a celebrated samurai whilst Genjuro seeks wealth. Midway through, the narrative becomes interwoven with the supernatural as Genjuro (the main protagonist) becomes infatuated with wealth and the mysterious Lady Wakasa. It's at this point in the film that captivated me the most as the Lady Wakasa's enchantment of Genjuro risks destroying the life with his doting wife and son whom he inexplicably neglects.
The direction from Mizoguchi is simply masterful and along with Miyazawa's cinematography we are treated to some breathtaking moments. The eerie boat journey over a misty lake being the highlight for me.
Ugetsu might not be the scariest of ghost stories but it's most definitely one of the most engrossing. I loved revisiting it and think it would make a perfect double bill with Kaneto Shindõ's Onibaba.",4.5

Gosto muito das inserções de algo mais mágico/fantástico invadindo qualquer suposto realismo como a ideia ali da ""fantasma"" que me parece muito natural na cultura japonesa, sobretudo com as figuras dos Yokai, em paralelo a isso ele capta muito bem a natureza com seus planos longos, o que não deixa de ser uma força implicita e de constante presença para com os personagens, igualmente a ""fantasma"" para o Genjurô.",4.5

This is the tone and tenor of Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu. A powerful cautionary tale about war and the warring desires in our hearts. Every aspect of this film is masterful. The blocking and framing amplifies the action on screen. The soundtrack is primal and haunting. Telling a story set in feudal Japan gives the merger of the material and the immaterial worlds more weight. Mizoguchi is one of the greatest storytellers of all time.

Kenzi Mizoguchi has with Ugetsu a film that incorporates bits of the samurai movie, bits of a supernatural thriller, but overall there's something about it that almost reminds me of a 'Made for TV' movie. And I say that pretty much unironically as it being the greatest one never made. Usually a 'Made for TV' movie is a movie, if not totally from a woman's point of view, with a female point of interest and perspective and in touch with and such. Ugetsu is a film really like that to me, where its main male protagonists share as much, if not less than, emotional weight with the female characters.
There are really three pivotal female characters in the picture, and all are realized and performed with beauty, total emotion and connectedness with their characters. Miyagi (Kinuyo Tinaka) is the wife of a clay-potter and mother of their little baby during civil wars in 16th century Japan, and they get torn away from each other as her husband (Rashomon's Masayuki Mori) tries to sell ""his"" precious wares in the city, keeping her away from potential harm. Ohama (Mitsuko Mito) is the wife of a peasant Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa) who's only ambition is to be a samurai, to the point of foolish abandon of everything including her.
While the two wives end up estranged from their husbands, Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo) invites the potter to her abode, where the temptations overwhelm him and upon her insistence he takes up with her as a new husband to her. But what he doesn't realize is that she's really an evil spirit of a once powerful and not despondent clan, and he has to choose between her and his suddenly remembered wife and child. So, in a sense, to say that this narrative resembles a 'Made for TV' movie almost says that it's lesser material, but I mean to say it really as a compliment.
Ugetsu is a film that tells its stories, at their core, in a way that goes beyond their time of being filmed in 1950s and set in the 16th century medieval times. It's a tragic story, but one that Mizoguchi always goes through with some level of hope, even when things seem at their bleakest. For example, when the finally-made (by accident) samurai Tobei finds his wife again, now a common prostitute, he becomes completely taken aback and shocked and regretful. But Mizoguchi doesn't try and judge either side, but just lets his camera stay, intensely in its way, on these torn and shattered characters, where escapism breaks immediately when the simplistic but cold reality of their lives comes back to them. This is something no TV movie, let alone Lifetime or such, could ever grasp.
In fact, part of it being such a satisfying artistic success is not just the acting, which is overall impeccable, but how Mizoguchi lays on atmosphere without it being too direct. There's suspense and danger drawn in the style when the rebel forces raid the village early in the film, for example, but it's not made overly complicated. The images speak enough, with the succinctly Eastern music, to do the job enough. And sometimes he does add some subtle touches, almost poetic to a degree, like when the couples are on a boat trying to flee from the dangers on shore—the first shot showing them at sea is truly extraordinary to me, with the fog laced in a very meticulous, powerful way.
There is also another scene that is really special to me, which is towards the end of the film. It comes before a certain sad twist, but before it Genjuro has finally reunited with Miyagi, and as he sleeps Mizoguchi just stays on her for a minute or so, not for anything specifically for the story, but somehow this little moment of serenity—perhaps a dream or perhaps not—really struck me; few directors would think to do this unusual move.
Ugetsu is also, aside from it putting in some spooky elements not quite like kabuki, is a great story of people in conflict, with themselves, each other, and how the women show the side of strength and weakness and how it ends up influencing the men around them. It seems like it starts with the typical 'women should stay out of harms way, with the children, women don't want the men in any danger, always afraid', but it's more than that. It's got so many things that end up happening in a well-timed 96 minutes, and it's very likely one of the director's masterworks. Ugetsu is a fine example of a relateable portrayal on human connection through film, that could potentially still be as relateable as today as it will in another seventy or so years.",5.0
"Probablemente verla como una serie de 3 temporadas de 20 capítulos no me haya hecho muchos favores, pero con falta de tiempo los destrozos son inevitables.
A pesar de todo, creo que Ugetsu plantea movidas muy interesantes. Para ser del 53, hay reflexiones bastante chulas sobre la guerra y lo que más convence es su tono fantasioso y los tres frentes con los que toca el conflicto: el escapismo (con la obsesión del dinero y una vida mejor), la idealización del problema (si no puedes contra ellos, únete) y el “vigilantismo” socialmente aceptado (como nexo entre tramas y contexto de época).
No voy a pretender ser un experto en cine o cultura japonesa, pero todas las pelis que he visto de Mizoguchi tienen una sensibilidad especial que me mola bastante. Quizás sea la lente de época tan diferente que dan sus múltiples personajes femeninos protagónicos –aunque esto es más en Street of shame que aquí– o la narrativa casi de cuento que suele plantear. Sea como sea, sus pelis –creo– tienen otro caminar extrañamente relajante que hace que los temas que toca se sientan diferentes.

"In the 1950s, three Japanese filmmakers (Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi) changed the history of Japanese cinema. They offered some of the most influential films that will later be seen by other films in the future. Many mainstream audiences are familiar with Kurosawa because his work has influenced some of their personal favorites (particularly “Star Wars”). But out of the three, Kenji Mizoguchi was one filmmaker I never knew much about until I saw his 1953 film “Ugetsu.” There have been so many films I’ve watched where the second viewing is better, and this one is no different.
Set in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, “Ugetsu” centers around two peanuts who are trying to pursue their dreams. The first one is Genjuro (Masayuki Mori), a potter who’s consumed by greed. The other one is Tobei (Eitaro Ozawa), Genjuro’s brother-in-law who’s desperate to become a samurai. They both live in a farming village with their loved ones. Genjuro has a wife named Miyagi (Kinuyo Tanaka) and a son named Genichi (Ichisaburo Sawamuro). Tobei, on the other hand, has a wife named Ohama (Mitsuko Mito), but no children yet. Their lives take a different turn when Shibata Katsuie’s army is invading their village, forcing themselves to evacuate. Later, Genjuro drops off Miyagi and Genichi on the shore and heads over to another village with Tobei and Ohama to sell his pottery. Once there, Tobei abandons Ohama by stealing some money from Genjuro and buying armory for himself. In the meantime, Genjuro meets up with a mysterious woman named Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo) and her female servant, in which they invite him to her mansion.
Thanks to its unconventional black-and-white cinematography, this is one picture that works beautifully on an artistic level. The real standout to this film is the scenery, which features an iconic scene that takes place on a lake. Once our main characters are riding on a canoe together, they come across another boat full of dead bodies, except they find a mortally wounded passenger who warns them about protecting their loved ones. The scene is chilling, but the way it’s filmed is so surreal. One thing you should know about “Ugetsu” is that it’s a period drama with a mix of fantasy. It might be a huge spoiler when I’m getting down to the fantasy elements, but I will say that it does a very nice job with its tone and interweaving its two storylines. Other than the fact that it deals with anti-war and spirits, neglect is one way to look at this film. Because we see how these two central characters, Genjuro and Tobei, have chosen work over family, and along the way, they’re faced with some real consequences. Even the pottery that Genjuro makes is presented as an important motif to the story.
While many critics have mentioned that Martin Scorsese’s “Silence” goes into the works of Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa, it’s also clear that he might have taken certain elements from Mizoguchi’s work. After all, Scorsese has considered “Ugetsu” to be one of his favorite films of all time, while Roger Ebert has called it “one of the greatest of all films.” As for me, I would consider this movie to be essential. “Ugetsu” combines tremendous filmmaking, strong performances, rich atmosphere, and an interesting story all together. To this day, it captures a cinematic power that movie lovers will indulge in. 9.5/10.",5.0
"Contos da Lua vaga - 1953 - Japão - visto no dia 13.04.20
Filme impressionante. Preciso ver mais longas japoneses: A forma como eles abordam os assuntos, é algo incomparável, peculiar e fascinante. Óbvio quando é bem adaptado, mas nesse caso, a obra é de uma qualidade incrível: A fotografia remetendo a cada momento, destacando cada situação e o psicológico dos personagens e o ambiente é genial, como os personagens são bem desenvolvidos: Os 4 tem uma dinâmica incrível juntos e separados, os atores são formidáveis, principalmente Masayuki Mori, Sakae ozawa onde vc sente cada dor, desespero, sonho, desejo de cada personagem, mergulha-se na sua luta diária pela sobrevivência e lutando contra a pobreza. Tema central penso é a ambição cega e desmedida do ser humano que insiste com uma ideia e deixa de lado o mais importante: A família. É o filme vai mostrando as consequências dos
atos de Tobey e Genjucho em relação ao seu redor e a família.
O mais impressionante é o realismo que é abordado todos os assuntos, crueza dos acontecimentos e a sua simplicidade em contar os fatos. Fala da pobreza, da fome, idealização de um sonho de herói sustentado por Tobey que
ver a função de samurai um emprego para sair daquela vida miserável junto com a sua família, Gentucho sonha em lucrar máximo de dinheiro possível com as suas vendas e não se preocupando com a segurança sua e da sua família.

graças aos maridos na qual ficam desamparadas elas sofrem as conseqüências ruins por causa dos companheiros mais preocupados com bens materiais.
Essa vejo como crítica do diretor (Kenzo Mizoguchi) que inclusive um dos responsáveis por divulgar cinema oriental para o mundo, ele mostra o materialismo e sua ambição exagerada pode gerar. Alem de uma das histórias mais interessantes do longa: mansão kitsuki e o lado sobrenatural explorado foi muito bom: realista e brincando com público se realmente aquilo era ou não, se era espírito ou não, além dessas perguntas, ficamos mergulhados naquele lugar sombrio, macabro, bem real, tonalidade sufocante e misteriosa,
que senhorita assustadora incluindo a enfermeira.
Figuras já quando apareceram são esquisitas, e depois ao desenrolar mostrando
as figurantes, o lugar dá para sentir que aquilo é uma cilada,
uma ambição conquistada fácil demais para ser verdade. O que vem fácil vai fácil. As cenas com
genrujo fugindo no desespero ,o casamento esquisito
,os belos cenários do local, e sua suposta conquista são uma das melhores partes do filme, incluindo depois as
ruínas que de repente aparecem e nos surpreende dizendo: como é possível? Jurei que aquilo tudo era real...
Eu tbm pensei. E além de mostrar o lado espiritual, o Budismo como a resposta para se regenerar e se reerguer em momentos de crise. O fim
simboliza o recomeço ao começo que sempre foram, onde a tentativa de se tornar alguém maior foi destroçada, mas aqui eles encontram o conforto com a família, com seu trabalho, habilidades e experiência e
isso não tem preço. É um filme moral mostrando que quem ignora a família e vai atrás de riquezas pode encontrar caminhos tenebrosos na jornada, inclusive o sobrenatural e a morte. Filme favoritaço dos diretores Martin Scorsese e Andrei Tarkovsky, a obra foi premiada com Silver Lion do festival de Veneza, ganhou uma indicação ao Óscar, na categoria de Melhor Figurino. Grande filme ainda mais levando em conta o ano que foi produzido, mas para mim faltou um detalhe: Para se tornar perfeito, faltou falar
mais da guerra civil, a sua história no século 16
que ficou depois em segundo plano (na verdade sempre foi mas poderia render cenas a mais, melhores) e se
contasse mais do passado da garota
(Mas tbm perderíamos a aura de mistério da Lady Wakasa que a atriz Machiko Kyô foi sensacional nos nuances, detalhes, até o figurino da personagem) e claro as músicas que compõem o filme é sensacional. Grande Obra de arte atemporal.",5.0

It’s a wonderful mix of supernatural, horrors of war, greed, lust, eroticism and human nature. The ending shot is etched in my mind, and sent in shockwaves of terror inside me. Couldn’t wait to explore more of Mizoguchi.",5.0
"I must admit that while I would say Japanese cinema might be my favorite in terms of world cinema, and especially during the golden age of Japanese cinema, that largely comes from my great fondness and appreciation of Akira Kurosawa’s work. Which I’m sure isn’t that much of a disservice, but I am a bit ashamed I haven’t really explored further outside of Kurosawa’s work in exploring more of this era of cinema. The Criterion cover of Ugetsu has always intrigued me, and it wasn’t until this sale that I’ve gotten my first taste of Kenji Mizoguchi. Glad to say, I really enjoyed this one! And I should have seen this sooner! A mix of morality play and ghost story, Ugetsu is what happens when you let greed and lust consume you in a haunting, yet fascinating exploration of the human psyche, thanks to a really engaging story, solid performances, excellent sound design, and Mizoguchi’s fantastic directing. I’ve read that Kurosawa was a huge fan of his work, and I can definitely see the influence. In particular Mizoguchi’s use of the camera, as I can see a lot of similar ways Kurosawa used his, notably with how his camera moves and is blocked similarly to Mizoguchi. Of course there are differences, Mizoguchi puts more emphasis on how his camera moves elegantly and sweepingly from one place to the next, as well as his use of long takes. Still, pretty neat seeing how one master influence another, and definitely eager to see more of Mizoguchi’s cinema.",5.0

"My first Kenji Mizoguchi film and I am blown away! As someone who already adores 40-60s Japanese cinema such as the works of Kurosawa and Ozu, I'm ashamed it took me so long to get to this.
Although it took a very long time to get me engaged, it all paid off! There were multiple points throughout this film where I considered turning it off and honestly didn't get why this was such a big deal. However, the last 45 minutes really shocked me in the way everything comes together to create what is honestly a beautiful work of art.
The haunting nature of the films last 45 minutes was genuinely palpable and fantastic. I was glued to my screen and found myself completely engrossed in a film which I had shortly prior found entirely dull. The music and general sound design are both wonderful and perfectly capture the films dark message.
It feels a little asinine to recommend this on this app seeing as I am possibly one of the last people to see it but it really is worth sticking through the dull first 50 minutes as it will really capture you by its climax.",4.5
A simple fable about not being greedy. This felt older than the 1950's for some reason. I enjoyed it but it felt a bit barebones,3.5
"Very good. It moves very quickly, even in times when not much has happened. I was shocked to look down and see I hit the hour mark in the movie. This is a well-crafted story of greed and abandonment, and it's a story of how family and the ones we love need to come first. The ending shouldn't have shocked me, but I didn't realize it would do that kind of twist twice in a row.
Several lines in this really resonated with me, but the general theme that we should be content with where we're at and not focus on things like money or what luxuries we can give is something that's really helpful for me right now. Tobei's character shows that getting caught up in ""proving yourself"" can sometimes prove that we're worth LESS than initially though.
This is a marshy, foggy masterpiece that blends romance with traditional ghost storytelling",4.0
"P.S./// К моменту создания фильма ""Сказки туманной луны после дождя"" Кэндзи Мидзогути уже был старшим представителем японского кино, которого горячо почитали Акира Куросава и другие режиссеры молодого поколения. А в этой изысканной истории о призраках, фаталистической трагедии военного времени, основанной на рассказах Акинари Уэда и Ги де Мопассана, он создал трогательный шедевр своего искусства: длинные дубли и размашистая камера ведут зрителя через увлекательное повествование о двух деревенских жителях, чья погоня за славой и богатством уводит их далеко в сторону от их верных жен. Перемещаясь между земным и потусторонним миром, ""Сказки туманной луны после дождя"" раскрывает важнейшие истины о разрушительных последствиях войны, бедственном положении женщин и гордости мужчин.",4.5

Esta película es una de mis favoritas, y ahora que la veo a comparación de dos de las películas anteriores del realizador, me doy cuenta de que en términos de producción, fue una de las más ambiciosas, pero atmosféricamente, una de las mejor conseguidas. Mizoguchi dilata el tiempo para la creación de su propia convención fantástica, casi como harían posteriormente Masaki Kobayashi en su mítica Kwaidan (1964) o Kaneto Shindô en su espectral Kuroneko (1968). Mizoguchi, un maestro de la puesta en cámara, no se limita en la búsqueda de más encuadres y esta vez, busca planos más cerrados y expresivos. Y vaya que le sentó bien.",4.5

However, it definitely benefits from a second viewing. And for a 90 minute film, a lot happens. Gotta say this is one of my favourite black and white Japanese films.
It tackles themes of greed by examining them under the lens of tragedy; with the characters having to overcome failing marriages and poverty. All of this, mixed in with elements of surrealism and the supernatural. As an added bonus, I'd say this has one of the eeriest film scores I've ever heard.

"Here's a film that bent the frame of what people thought cinema was capable of at the time it was released. I imagine it changed the way people comprehend stories through film just as Chaplin made surreal stories you could invest in beyond the conventional melodrama of the silent movie era. This is a directorial revolution that blurs the line between realism and dream almost seamlessly. 
 
This isn’t to say it does all of this as successfully as what I believe later films that were influenced by this were able to achieve. Tarkovsky sited this film as a major influence on him – particularly in sequences where the camera spins in a continuous unedited circle only to reveal complete changes in the scenery to disorient your perspective, you see how and why this was a revelation to him. 
 
Fascinating this film was released at the same time “Tokyo Story” was. Both of these films show what is possible with film in diametrically opposing ways. “Ugetsu” has a fluid and dream-like motion that is relatively nonstop in its dynamic shifts; whereas Ozu was reliably still, intentionally static, and strove for balance in all aesthetic aspects. 
 
This film is a historic accomplishment that made important impacts on cinema that still resonate today. It’s emotional resonance as a piece is far from perfect in my opinion, but overall, this is a remarkable film because of what it subsequently influenced.",4.0

"Ugetsu (1953) is a period drama that presents the story of two brothers, Genjuro and Tobey, during the Sengoku period. When they leave their village to sell pottery, they are quickly tied to a series of supernatural events.
This mystical and sinister movie is one of Kenji Mizoguchi’s best-known works internationally. It was also the first one I was introduced to and makes for a great entryway into his filmography. It’s quintessential Mizoguchi — it features a story about women who must operate within the social restrictions placed on them, opposite a story focusing on men who are governed by gluttony and enterprise.
There is so much to take away from Ugetsu, including: the cost of ambition, the difference between the supernatural and reality, the weight of art, the role of women, and the cyclical nature of history.
The power of ambition and its destructive nature was a theme that really stood out to me. Both brothers are driven by their yearning for money and social status, but it’s these desires that also result in their downfall. In Ugetsu, we realise that there are dire consequences with unbridled ambition and one should find a balance in this area of life.
Another theme that piqued my interest (that I soon found repeating in later Mizoguchi films I watched) were the roles of the women in this story. We are, again, presented with strong women in Ugetsu. There is Lady Wakasa who seduces Genjiro and Ohama, Tobei’s wife, who is left behind in the village. Both are complex and make for interesting character studies. They illustrate the limited options women in feudal Japanese society had available to them.
Ugetsu is an examination of desire, ambition, and greed, and what happens when they are all pursued in these unrestricted ways. It’s a haunting watch that should be up high on your list of films to watch when it comes to Japanese cinema.",4.5
"Ugetsu really shows off just how good Mizoguchi is as a director even if the story I think is kinda weak. Mainly how one of the two parallel plots takes a backseat to the other, both in overall screentime and in relevance to the main supernatural themes. Despite this, the mood Mizoguchi creates in this is remarkable. It is ghostly, subtly sorrowful, and really beautiful.",4.0

The first 30 minutes are tension-filled and thrilling, but the movie starts exploring the line between this world and the next as it slows down, turning into a haunting ghost story.

"""The art of Kenji Mizoguchi is to prove that real life is at one and the same time elsewhere and yet here, in its strange and radiant beauty.""
Godard
""The vivifying impulse in Mizoguchi’s late films is towards
wholeness and unity, and this is expressed in stylistic detail as
surely as in overall movement. It is an impulse that necessitates
the maintenance of a certain emotional distance between artist
and material, the purpose of which is not to deny or diminish
the emotional intensity inherent in the action, but to place it in
a wider context, a context both spatial and temporal. An event
in a Mizoguchi film is never felt as isolated. We are not allowed
to respond simply, with the immediate emotional reactions
the event might provoke: we are encouraged to view the event
within a cosmic perspective. If this sounds mystical (and we are
perhaps too ready, in the west, to distrust mysticism, or confuse
it with mere vagueness), it can be pinned down in the concrete
detail of Mizoguchi’s mise-en-scène (...)
Ugetsu: Miyagi, trying to return home with her child, is attacked on a mountain path by three starving outcasts (perhaps
deserters) who steal the rice-cakes she has been given. When she
protests, one of them drives a spear into her. Her little boy still
on her back, she staggers on, supporting herself on a stick. Here,
there is no cutting: the scene is a classic example of what the
French call the plan-séquence, the “sequence” organized within
a single shot. But the preservation of spatial reality within the
image, and the preservation of the spectator’s distance from the
action, are again crucial to the total effect.
For the great majority of directors, the temptation here would
be to go for impact: one “could invent a breakdown of the scene
into twenty or so shots—close-ups of the men emerging from
the hut, of Miyagi’s frightened face, of the spear driven in, of the
screaming, terrified child, of the woman in agony, of the men,
showing their callous indifference—which could be immensely
powerful in its force and directness. Mizoguchi’s long take holds
the spectator at a distance throughout, preserves the unity and
continuity of the action, and preserves the sense of environment
of the action situated in a real world governed by the realities of
time and space. We are not asked to respond simply and directly
to the physical horror of a spear entering a woman’s belly, but to
an event existing in a context. The detachment with which the
camera compels us to watch the action makes the emotion it
evokes much less immediate and overwhelming, but also much
finer and deeper: we are free to contemplate the scene’s wider
implications, to reflect on the events that have preceded it and
its likely consequences.
The organization of the complex action over a large area
within a single take is remarkable: one would call it virtuoso
did not the word carry connotations of display, the technique
here being self-effacing in the extreme. The staging has many
of the features one thinks of as characteristically Mizoguchian.
The camera position is slightly above the action, in the interests
of clarity: from it, we can see not only the path and the hut, but
down into the valley below. The path crosses the screen diagonally. As Miyagi walks along it, the child on her back, the men
emerge from the sides of the screen, eventually surrounding
her—our minds are led back to the parallel scene of the rape of
Ohama. The men steal the food, one of them wounds Miyagi,
they disappear down the slope. Miyagi struggles to her feet and
staggers on; the camera tracks with her, revealing the stick she
takes to support herself, which lies at right angles to the path,
hence making another diagonal to the frame—all the composition’s main lines point outwards to the world beyond the screen.
As Miyagi and the camera move on, we can see the men again
in extreme long-shot in the valley, quarrelling and fighting over
the meagre bits of food, their movements providing a strong if
distant visual counterpoint to Miyagi’s. The pain of the woman
is placed in a context of universal disorder and suffering; our
the ghost princess and the seaweed gatherer
horror at the men’s indifference is qualified by a sense of a world
in which human beings starve to death and are degraded to an
animal-like struggle for survival.
The total effect is to universalize the
action, to suggest that the narrative we have watched unfold is
at once unique and typical.""

"Kind of a rough start, but the story becomes really engaging with it's second act, when the main focus of the narrative lies on the immoral choices of our protagonists, and their subsequent consequences. I really dig how the supernatural aspects are woven into the plot later on. They're only set-up by subtle hints beforehand which makes the whole reveal so interesting. Also the ending twist is just perfect, and gives the movie a much needed emotional note. My only real issue with the film is it's B-plot. The story of a farmer trying to cheat his way to fame and fortune as a samurai, fits the narrative thematically, but is just not as dramatic and investing as the other plot and slows down the pacing considerably. Still, ""Ugetsu"" has aged really well and the cinematography as well as the haunting score are almost on par with Kurosawas works.",3.0

A lot of people on this site tend to look at this film as a ghost story, a horror film. But to me, this film is, first and foremost, an anti-war film. War is not the focus, but the undercurrent. Ambition, greed, selfishness, glory, hubris, and human suffering are the focus. I am not sure Mizoguchi specifically made those parallels to Japanese militarism and atrocities during WWII, but if he did, this is the best anti-war film I've watched. I especially love how at the end of the film, the director didn't focus on Genjūrō's own disillusionment; but instead, it is Miyagi and her regret and dying wish for a happy family reunited that carried the moral weight of the entire film.

"Las palabras alagadoras no me alcanzan para describir esta obra del director japonés Mizoguchi.
La historia de dos hombres, Genjuro y Tobei, esclavos de un corazón ambicioso, dispuestos a cometer actos insensatos para hacer fortuna. Ambientada en el Japón feudal, siglo XVI, ellos parten hacia un nuevo pueblo (a causa de una invasión de parte de un grupo de Samurais a su pueblo), para hacer dinero. Ese pueblo es retratado con un lugar de tentaciones, en el que los de corazón ambicioso caerán en la ilusión, y los de corazón sensato caerán en la infortunia.
Mizoguchi deja al descubierto la codicia de los seres humanos, expone la crueldad de aquellos samurais que supuestamente dicen tener honor, como los personajes tienen que pasar por la miseria para darse cuenta de su desgracia.
Es una obra muy espiritual, rebosa de una atmósfera hipnótica. La cinematografía, decorados, dirección, iluminación y música, te mueven del sitio y te transportan a un lugar en el que no hay escapatoria, realmente no quieres estar ahí. Sientes una sensación de malestar, descontrol, locura y temor, que te mantiene enganchado. Una obra espiritual, conectada al corazón humano, habla por si sola. Una experiencia inolvidable.

"Ugetsu, 雨月物語 (Contos da Lua Vaga depois da Chuva) - Japão - 1953 - Direção: Kenji Mizoguchi, é um dos maiores filmes do cinema japonês e da história. Está na lista britânica Sight and Sound como uma das grandes obras-primas de todos os tempos.
Mistura entre realismo social e fantasia, Ugetsu se passa durante a guerra civil do Japão no século XVI. O arrebatador conto de Mizoguchi versa sobre aspectos inerentes à humanidade, aparições espectrais e o destino dos tolos e iludidos.
Trata-se de um imenso trabalho poético, que evidencia e lamenta o sofrimento vivenciado sobretudo pelas mulheres em tempos de conflito, por meio da subjugação sociopolítica e cultural.
A história dos personagens vendedores de cerâmica Genjuro e Miyagi foi inspirada em duas de nove histórias de uma coleção de 1776 do autor Akirari Ueda, chamada “Ugetsu Monogatari”. Outros personagens importantes foram criados a partir do conto Decoré!, do escritor e poeta francês do séc XIX Guy de Maupassant.
Tomado por sentimentos anti-guerra, Mizoguchi usa grande parte da primeira metade do filme para investir na experiência camponesa durante a guerra, provavelmente se valendo de sua própria experiência tentando sobreviver no decorrer da Segunda Guerra Mundial. Cabanas modestas e habitações de repente se tornam prisões enquanto soldados pilham e estupram pelo caminho.
O filme dispõe de um conjunto de técnicas de filmagem já do cinema moderno, com travellings e diversos movimentos de câmera, mas claramente se vale de um tipo de filmagem típico do início do cinema japonês, que é a câmera fixa juntamente com uma ambientação da arte clássica Noh/Nōgaku. Ela decorre do desejo do diretor em explorar elementos formais e temáticos do teatro tradicional, que muitas vezes envolvia contos de fantasmas e espíritos malignos.
As músicas, predominantemente executadas com flautas Noh, tem uma qualidade tão impressionante que possibilitam até uma certa nostalgia daquela fantasia nipônica.
Como diz o diretor de cinema e crítico Mark Cousins, o cinema japonês do início do séc XX é o que de fato há de mais clássico na sétima arte, porque carrega os verdadeiros valores da tradição clássica da arte, tradição essa que valoriza a ordem e o equilíbrio e características universais da condição humana.

"Mizoguchi's famous ethos for his flowing long takes inspired by traditional Japanese scroll-painting was « one scene one cut », but his long takes are not at all obsessive like the elaborate Hollywood ""oner"" or the much slower but no less and often even more complex « plan-séquence » or sequence-shot of auteurs like Tarkovsky or Bela Tarr, or the famously fixed camera angle of his contemporary Ozu. If anything, Mizoguchi's long takes, despite or perhaps precisely because of a reputation for meticulously detailed staging and timing, feel naturalist through and through.
They're almost like the most logical extension of how camera pans first became a component of cinematic language: at first the practical need to follow certain events like races or parades, and then the storytelling desire to follow character and action in absolute continuity through space and time. And so Mizoguchi's camera follows, unscrolling and revealing both the setting and the story together at once by almost always maintaining a distance and rarely going in for close-ups, and he never forces the long take too much - « one scene one cut » in essence, but really ""one scene two or three cuts connected by near-perfect continuity so as to give the impression of one continous take"" in practice. The result: a stunning sense of graceful flow and immersion, where the masterful artistry of the hand behind the marionettes is almost entirely « invisible ».
But that's only in the ideal situation. Unfortunately for ""Ugetsu Monogatari"" (""The Tale of Rain and Moon""), my biggest problem with it might simply be an unfair complaint due to the technological limits that Mizoguchi was working with (especially compared to the filmmakers he inspired like Rivette and Angelopoulos who worked in later eras). But alas, this is me trying to be truthful to the perspective of this pair of eyes looking back from 2022 -
Ugestu (1953) contains within it a very unfortunate paradox: because Mizoguchi's naturalist long takes are so effectively immersive, they also make one aspect of the film painfully obvious - that so much of it is shot on studio soundstage, even the acclaimed shot of the four characters on a boat wading through the fog on Lake Biwa. The soundstage is not itself a problem, as there are plenty of films that take deliberate advantage of the nature of the stage to compliment their own style, like Kwaidan (1965) or Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985), or even more extreme examples like Perceval (1978) or Dogville (2003). The problem, here, is that Ugestu seems clearly intended to be a totally naturalist presentation that gradually lets its supernatural elements seep through, unsurprisingly surprising its characters and its viewers alike. This is of course my personal interpretation and assumption, but it's certainly supported by Mizoguchi's reputation for meticulously accurate detail when it comes to set design, props and costumes, etc. To put it another way, I don't think the stage-like nature of so much of Ugetsu is intentional, because Mizoguchi seems like the kind of character who would be utterly appalled by something like Sofia Coppola's stroke of metatextual genius to throw a pair of sneakers into Marie Antoinette's shoe collection.
It's no surprise then that my favorite moments in Ugetsu were all the ones that seemed to be filmed on-location (or who knows, perhaps these moments simply had such ingenius set design and lighting that they totally fooled me): the beautiful boat-through-fog sequence may be tragically on-set, but the shot of boat launch just before it and the scene of wife and child left by the lakeshore just after both seem to be on-location, and here the distant sky and hills and wild-grown reeds and barren trees all lend so much more character to the scene setting than the studio set sequences. (probably beyond nitpicky here but you can definitely see very direct and frontal fill light being applied to the actors' faces in this lakeshore scene, which is another indication to me that this is filmed under the constraints of real location) Or how about that famous shot which pans (almost) completely seamlessly from a pair of lovers at night in the hot spring to them next day enjoying a picnic by the lakeshore? I found the second half of this shot to be much stronger than the first. Or the shot where noble manor does turn out to be a mere illusion after all - it must be on-location since you as the camera pans around and cranes up, the sun shimmers over the distant sea.
And the final scene of the film is perhaps the best example of all. As husband returns home to the village, the scene is split into two shots: 1) exterior and on-location, as the camera sweeps through the now abandoned village, and 2) interior and on-set, as husband circles through his former home looking for any signs of life. It's a perfect pair, because the total naturalism of the 1st shot's long take through the landscape establishes the reality, and then the stage-like quality of the 2nd shot, coupled with its astonishing 360 degree spin (which is not a full 360 spin but two 180 sweeps, from right to left and then back from left to right), actually seamlessly bridges reality and fantasy.
But elsewhere, like in the village raid sequences at the beginning of the film, the stunning sense of real-time and real-space brought by Mizoguchi's long takes only made it all the clearer that many of the spaces in the film are not, in fact, real spaces. It's an unfortunate feedback loop: the naturalist long takes reveal the stage, and the stage, in turn, greatly dampens the effect of these long takes.",3.5

"There was no such thing as therapy in 16th Century Japan, men had NO choice other than going out and doing stupid things.
In all seriousness, this movie is completely amazing and it's filled with a wide array of haunting imagery and rich emotion. Definitely to watch more Mizoguchi films.
Without even peeling back the unexpected yet very compelling layer of fantasy to the story, Ugetsu is about two men's reckless desires and blinding ambitions that pull them apart from their families, a desire which is in turn ill-advised, for consisting of profiting from the tormented victims of war; in the end bringing all kinds of spiritual and physical consequences.
From Wikipedia:
While writing the script, [Kenji] Mizoguchi told Yoda ""Whether war originates in the ruler's personal motives, or in some public concern, how violence, disguised as war, oppresses and torments the populace both physically and spiritually ... I want to emphasise this as the main theme of the film"".",4.5
"I think the only thing more impressive than how timeless the themes and the execution are in this movie, is the fact that it's adapted from an even older story book from 1776. I haven't read this book, but I can tell that the narrative here gave amazing material to work with, and the translation to the visual medium could not have been made more hauntingly and beautiful. These picturesque shots on top of a terrifying score give the tales so much life, and really carry the weight of greed in full. What a beautiful film, a true chill-giver.",4.5

"When Genjuro sees the kimonos he’d like to buy before doing the delivery, we enter his perspective. The first time Mizoguchi uses a POV. And it pans with the slow feel of a waltz. Reminded me of Scorsese’s use of it in Raging Bull…
Cue the music, cutting to a shot as Miyagi appears in silhouette, delighted at the kimono. From his perspective until the camera moves to an OTS of Genjuro. As she disappears out of frame we realise what we just saw was not real, was a projection. & it’s the first time in this film where the lines between reality and fantasy cross. It comes as a moment of genuine emotion for Genjuro - misplaced desire as Miyagi has already told him she’s content with their lives already - but his desire has an immediate impact on the tone of the film which of course becomes irreversible. Out of nowhere, the women from the Kutsuki manor arrive, waiting to take him back and he follows without question. Close ups drenched in light, shots of shadows moving through long grass - his and our reality will never be the same again.
That first night at the Kutsuki manor is apex filmmaking. The punctuation of each cut, the way the camera moves slowly and in sync. The very selective frames and blocking. Everything is masterfully accomplished to conjure a tone. You’re settled into a new perception, into a dream.
Nothing is more terrifying than when Genjuro has to leave. It’s like the spiritual anecdotes I’ve heard from parents and relatives growing up. Parables about how a spirit can ensnare you. Because of all the work done to immerse us into a dream - this switch hits because it wakes us up to the nightmare. And of course, the return home is an extension of this, as it should be a return to reality - but Genjuro’s desire is still modifying the reality he experiences. (Or is it Miyagi’s desire?) Blocking the reality of what has occurred until again, an outsider points out to him. And it works on us so powerfully here too because we want to believe it’s true even though the initial panning around the house already showed us it wasn’t. Our desire for a better outcome allowed us to believe everything we went on to see, or to want for it to be true.
The thing I loved so much when I first saw this film was how it snatched me into the spirit world. Through a character’s internal flaws and desires, we see their reality affected in ways they themselves aren’t aware of until it’s too late. A great personal reference for having a film that delicately balances between reality and fantasy/dream/spirit worlds.",5.0

"Pot maker Genjurô is a selfish sod who is also easily seduced by ghosts, while his friend Tobei dreams of being a Samurai, yet both learn that greed and aspirations beyond your station leads to misery, or they do for the women in their lives at least. Admittedly I'm being a little flippant and there's a lot more to this, but I found myself oddly distanced from the film, something which was also the case of The Life of Oharu, as once again I found myself fascinated by the setting and the story but didn't care about the characters, or at least the male ones who received the majority of the screen time. There's some strong imagery, and I loved the sound design, especially during the scene when Lady Wakasa's deceased father sings and later on when Genjurô discovers that Lady Wakasa and her maid are both ghosts, that's an incredible moment, but the best I can say is that it was an intriguing film that I didn't really connect with emotionally. 7.2/10",3.5

"Zum Ende der kleinen Mizoguchi-Retrospektive noch die beiden berühmtesten Werke von ihm.
Man kann schnell erkennen warum das so ist: Sowohl in Ugetsu als auch in Sansho nimmt Mizoguchi seine realisitsche und niederschmetternde Themenvielfalt (Abhängigkeiten aus sozialen, ökonomischen, hierarchischen und patriarchalen Gründen) und projeziert sie auf 2 Grundpfeiler der FIlmgenres.
In Ugetsu ist es der mystische Horrorfilm, den Mizoguchi uns in der Thematik von 2 Nachbarsfamilien von niederem Stand im Japan des 16. Jahrhunderts näher bringt.
Fantastisch sind die Nebelschwadenszenen auf dem See und die langsame Vermischung zwischen Träumen und harter Realität.
Typisch für Mizoguchi, müssen die Frauen wieder unter den Männern leiden - aber auch typisch für Mizoguchi, dass er dies nicht als polemische Kritik formuliert, sondern als systemische.
Die beiden Männer des Hauses, versuchen sich an ihren Träumen, aber auch mit Fleiß udn Ehrgeiz aus de niederen Stand zu befreien, sie werden geradezu von ihrer Umwelt, von den Unrechtssystemen dazu gezwungen.
In beiden Filmen lässt Mizoguchi auch noch eine kleine aber deutliche Kritik an der Sinnlosigkeit des Krieges miteinfließen.
Auch diese beiden Filme waren fantastisch, der Grund, dass ich keine 5 Sterne sondern nur gute 4 vergebe (wie auch bei seinen Gegenwartsdramen) ist, dass ich die Thematik dort genauso gut fand und für ein geradezu umwerfendes Filmerlebnis fehlt mir in seinen Filmen etwas das auf und ab.
Auch Ugetsu und Sansho sind eine pure Abwärtsspirale, nie hat man das Gefühl es könnte mal noch oben gehen - man startet ganz unten und hört erst in der Hölle auf - eine Leidensgeschichte.",4.0

But, what I believe Mizoguchi shows us is some of the perennial issues that plagued Japan in terms of identity; financial and cultural aspirations and contestation with sovereignty (either from intra-disparate groups or struggles toward and against westernization). Mizoguchi tends to provide sweeps of feudal Japanese landscapes and aerial shots that drop into the scene—this is an ethnographic undertaking of a wabi-sabi aesthetic. blah blah blah blah blah i love the movie and what hasn’t already been said? mizoguchi was a fucking revered and a master of his craft.",0.0

"The Criterion Challenge 2021: #38 - Kelly Reichardt's Top 10
This movie was eerie from front to back, and not because it’s in a war setting. It’s horror plays on the selfishness of man, and even when you achieve the riches you desire to give you happiness, you beg for more and begin to lose sight of yourself, as a personality and as a human being.
In a pretty short run time, we go through all of that, and man some of the shots here blew me away, I’m thinking about the one early on when the wives are paddling the boat in the foggy ocean as our two men are eager to either be a samurai or rich from the pottery business, booming from wartime seasons. There’s many ethics at play at the struggle of needing money to survive, who we screw over by working for this, and what consequences we may face from making one too many wrong decisions. In this case, women are serious collateral damage, and the cast ranging from wives to hallucinatory images were all fantastic and visually memorable.
Just really impressed by how ominous in tone and presentation this was. Immaculately framed and paced, a lot of room to chew here.",4.0
"The black-and-white photography and eerie sound design do most of the heavy-lifting in terms of atmosphere (the cinematography itself doesn’t particularly stand out as anything special) and though I love a tale about how men are generally selfish and don’t have their priorities straight (abandoning their “loved ones” for their own glory), the storytelling here feels so distant.
It’s a war story that becomes an entrepreneur story that becomes a ghost story that becomes a tragic cautionary story—and I don’t think any of those elements are powerful or intimate enough. It’s a semi-beautiful piece of art that doesn’t do much for me.",3.0
"This is a film I’ve seen before - I was not overly blown off my feet by that viewing but I have been significantly impressed with Mizoguchi’s previous work and did think originally that the film was on the cusp of the Masterpiece level anyway so I’m really looking forward to this
Really nice woodblock drawings making up the background for the opening credits
Mizoguchi’s most trademark shot - a really long rolling tracking shot with occasional blocking to start the film - goes from a landscape to our leads outside their house (Mori and his wife Tanaka) and I even think it descends a little down a crane
I’m not sure why but my sound quality is really bad here for whatever reason
More tracking shots as Mori and his buddy Ozawa carry some supplies across a River
Really great movement of the camera as Ozawa attempts and dramatically fails to become the vassal of a great daimyo - high angle on him as we are looking down at his patheticness
Such elaborate mise-en-scene in Mori’s pottery business
Many will of course recognize Mori from his role as the murdered samurai in Rashomon - I believe Kyō who plays his obscure object of desire here was his wife there as well
Only 11 minutes in and something already feels different about this compared to the other Mizoguchi films I’ve seen before it - yeah I was probably wrong at first
Fantastic shot of Mori in medium-close making some pottery as it spins with Tanaka slightly further in the background away spinning it - incredible blocking as well
Powerful flute score - or whatever the Japanese equivalent of the flute is
Great one of Mori and Ozawa sort of lying down asleep by a kiln I think?
Stunning shot of Tanaka running in to go get her son from the soldiers - the same kind of shot as the famous lying-down shots from Stromboli or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
A beautiful Japanese village set - always greatly framed by Mizoguchi
Oh God; the chaos as the soldiers assault the village and rip all the people from their homes
Really great tracking shot through a forest of our protagonists, their wives, and all of the other villagers escaping the horde - we then follow it up with an even better one as they make camp
Study of obsession here - Mori rushes back to the village even after its occupation by all of the enemy soldiers (who will kill him if he is found) to retrieve the pottery he was working on, and of course the later pursuits by Mori of Kyō and Ozawa of noblehood
At 23 minutes you get the magnificent sequence of the 4 of them (5 if you include the son really) crossing the river in the fog - a gorgeous cinematic moment; I love the way the tip of the dinghy slowly approaches the camera
A warning from a dying man on another boat they encounter to stay away from pirates, for if they encounter them, they shall lose everything
And the sequence ends as they disappear back into the fog…
Rolling tracking shot of the two men on the boat as they have taken their wives to the shore
Incredible - a crane shot long take to start our next scene of the two seeking their pottery in the town they travelled to
We cut to them and then crane away from them to get a higher angle before cutting away and getting ANOTHER descending crane as Kyō approaches for the first time
Really strong blocking in a shot in an armory that Ozawa travels to to acquire weapons and armor to try to convince a daimyo to take him on
Another really well-directed scene as Tanaka (or it could be Mito to be completely honest, I can’t quite tell) gets kidnapped by some soldiers and assaulted - a fantastic low angle shot with 3 levels of depths of the soldiers’ legs as they stand over her - I wrote a minor essay on this scene in my original review that I’ll mostly paste and maybe revise here
Here’s what I wrote:
Again; Mizoguchi and Kurosawa are wildly different in their depiction of gender relations; Mizoguchi here displays these men as nothing short of vultures preying on a defenseless woman, something Kurosawa (who idolized Mizoguchi in fact) would never dream of doing; look at Rashomon, where the samurai’s wife tears down her honor by giving in to Mifune and demanding he kill her husband, or Seven Samurai, where the peasant girl is seen as something of a prize for the young samurai and his taking of her is celebrated by all the men, or Ran, where Mieko Harada (who is very good) is just too easy to hate as a scheming character who will do anything to get ahead in the world; it’s just wildly different; right after this scene, we see her own unhappiness at her husband giving more attention to his efforts to become a samurai than her; Mizoguchi just cares more about the concerns of women it seems
A really nice one as she (it is Mito since she talks about Ozawa) stands among many of the grasses and the building she was abducted at as it all frames her around it all
Beautiful shots of brush and grasses
Tracking shot of Mori’s POV as he looks inside of a fabric shop
The music seems to reflect us descending into Mori’s fantasies as he looks at all the fabrics and imagines being able to buy it for the woman he loves, who is Kyō
The famous closeup shot of Kyō holding up her veil - Letterboxd backdrop
Another great shot of the 3 of them (he, Kyō, and her old assistant) walking to her manor
Shadows of the three of them as they walk - Murnau
Another fantastic tracking shot inside the manor - ends with a long shot of him, the assistant, and a tree on the edge of the frame that resembles the famous shot of him and Kyō next to the other tree outside
Wow - more servants shot in the gaps between the shojis; previously unseen - mystery - what is this place?
More Murnau-like usage of shadows
Again; I will emphasize that I clearly, it would seem, was wildly incorrect on the first viewing; I’d be surprised if given by increased appreciation for Mizoguchi’s approach that I might not think this is a Masterpiece
A haunting score - the best bit is the sheer bareness of it; just an occasional ding. Compare this to Herrmann’s very elaborate scores for Hitchcock - I’m not saying either is better but sometimes less can be more
More astounding blocking here as Kyō pours out some tea for Mori and the silhouette of one of her servants can be seen on the left side of the frame - immaculate composition here
Again with the shadows behind curtains and shojis
A really nice dissolve to a high angle shot from the ceiling looking into the courtyard specifically emphasizing the barren tree
The camera movement as Kyō walks around the room doing her dance - spectacular and at the end of it her face just disilluminates as the candles around them go out and we follow her gaze to the samurai armor owned by her late father
At 54 minutes there’s the absolutely transcendent movement of the camera from inside her house, over to it being blocked by a shoji where we dissolve to outside and eventually come across Mori and Kyō at a hot spring
He follows it up with basically the same damn camera movement as we catch the shot of the two of them at the picnic with the tree in the distance - oh and we also surely cross the Masterpiece border I think which we had not done in the first viewing
More strong camera movement and obstruction of the frame as we return to Tanaka and the son in hiding as the farm they are in is ransacked by more raiders
Another rolling tracking shot during this sequence
Tanaka is running down a hill away but comes again into the company of some brigands who steal much of her stuff - funnily enough they fight a lot like Mifune and Mori do in Rashomon (meaning they’re total shit) - long take as well, no cutting here
We even go briefly into deep focus as she walks past the camera and it still tracks her and we can see some of the brigands fighting eachother now - to be fair I think one of them may actually be Ozawa who has come to rescue her in Mori’s absence
A great shot tracking Ozawa in closeup as he is prone along the ground trying to sneak into a samurai camp
There can be no doubt that with this film Mizoguchi transcends from a brilliant mover of the camera to a pantheon mover like Renoir or Murnau
Ozawa actually kills an enemy general and brings his head to his favored daimyo and the daimyo still doesn’t believe he actually killed him but takes him on as a vassal anyway - a really nice tracking shot of his own new retainers following him on his horse
Stunning arrangements of prostitutes in a brothel that Ozawa enters
A really great sequence as Ozawa is faced with the consequences of his actions - he sees his wife working in the brothel as she just abandoned herself to that work after getting raped by the soldiers earlier
Ozawa is fantastic here as just an absolute pathetic, self-absorbed loser of a character - maybe the film’s best performer actually but I’ll need to think about it
They were warned earlier not to let pirates threaten their wives and that has surely happened to both of them (Mito’s rape and Tanaka has been attacked a few times herself as well) because of their own pursuits
Checkerboards on the walls at the manor sort of resembling wallpaper
Punishing score as his marriage tattoos are uncovered to Kyō as she discovered he is already married despite having just married her as well - a brutal and harsh scene to watch
He panics and begins flailing about with his katana - a great shot as he makes his way to the courtyard and passes out surrounded by the jagged branches of the tree out there
He wakes up and there’s a great shot of the ruins of Kutsuki Manor surrounding him as he discovers Kyō was an illusion - this one particular piece of the wreckage even seems to be crushing him - the weight of the world holding him down
A crane shot as his world continues to fall apart as he explores the ruins - genius
He goes back to his true home and finds it completely abandoned and torn apart not unlike Kutsuki Manor - in both his fantasy and real life he ends up short
A really transcendent and similar shot to the one before as he walks back out of the house and goes back around it again - the camera continuing to track him through the walls as he goes around the house - and he goes back through the front door and this time finds Tanaka waiting for him, and he repairs his relationship with his wife
For a director so obstinately focused on female stories it’s a bit odd that his best film (and it is easily his best, Oharu doesn’t even touch this one though I still need to watch his final 4 films) is predominantly about the actions of men, though they do have a disproportionate effect on the dependent women around them which Mizoguchi does not forget to portray
Stunning shot of the night turning to day as light can be seen coming to pour through the gaps in the wooden walls of their house - unbelievable cinematic moment (aren’t there so many in this film?)
A genuine heartbreaking moment as one of Mori’s friends comes over to his place and informs him that Tanaka was actually killed by the enemy soldiers - this actually really impacted me as I had genuinely forgotten this from the first viewing 3 months ago but it explains the dreamlike segment with him finding Tanaka in the house after walking around it earlier
A cutaway to Ozawa and Mito as Ozawa throws away his armor and his ambitions of becoming a samurai for her
Finally, Mori gets back to work at pottery, only now he has to form the ceramic and keeps it spinning too - a nice montage of him at work as we get a voiceover from Tanaka as she too has become a spirit of the dead not too unlike Kyō - she sounds different now, changed
Final tracking shot raising up from Tanaka’s grave over the long open fields of Japan as the film cuts to black
Silver Lion (tied for 2nd Place finisher) Award at Venice - Mizoguchi stayed in his hotel room praying all night before the awards ceremony in fear he could not work again if he did not win an award
You note in Mizoguchi’s earlier works (I’d probably note Osaka Elegy as the big exception) that Mizoguchi often holds back his abilities as a director possibly due to his reverence for the source material, such as the women of his life he so admires. This isn’t terrible, being a reserved director can work well and Chrysanthemum and Oharu in particular are both Masterpieces and The 47 Rōnin is extremely close to that level, but you do get a feeling that Mizoguchi can just do more, and in this film it feels like everything else he’s done previously is just him as a larva building up in a cocoon and here he finally breaks out of that and morphs up to another level as a visual artist. I’m not sure why it didn’t happen earlier, he worked with DP Kazuo Miyagawa for the first time on this film and he clearly has an impact but I’m not sure it’s just that - I think there’s more here coming specifically out of Mizoguchi himself

"Ugetsu Monogatarai has been frequently considered one of the great masterpieces of cinema, certainly one of the great works of art from the early era of Japanese neo-realist cinema. More importantly for the fantasy genre, it was one of the first kaidan eiga (ghost story films) to be made, or at least the first to gain major exposure in the West. It won director Kenzo Mizoguchi the Silver Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1953. In both 1962 and 1972, Ugetsu Monogatarai ranked on the Top 10 list of Best Movies of All-Time held each decade by Sight and Sound magazine.
Ugetsu Monogatarai was made not long after Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon, which revolutionized Japanese cinema. There and in his subsequent films, Kurosawa had created the school of Japanese neo-realism – with his use of black-and-white photography, crafting tales usually set around feudal times and with much emphasis placed on the raw visual poetry and the naturalistic realism of the settings. Ugetsu Monogatari buys into the lyrical realism and feudal dynastic background that Kurosawa had established. Indeed, Saka Ozawa’s over-the-top acting in the role as the scruffy wannabe samurai seems closely modelled on Toshiro Mifune’s performance as the bandit in Rashomon.
There is a beautiful formalism to Kenzo Mizoguchi’s direction. The marriage scenes could almost be taken out of Noh theatre in their exquisitely mannered ceremony and the images of Machiko Kyo (who also played the raped wife in Rashomon) as Lady Wakasa moving through the house in her elegantly aloof formal makeup.
Contrary to many kaidan eiga, Ugetsu Monogatari is realist through and through. There are no overtly fantastical appearances – rather the ghosts appear as normal people and mortals have no ability to tell the difference. That said, the scenes with Genjuro confronting Lady Wakasa with symbols painted all over his body and the nurse ranting and weeping, trying to wield guilt, as Lady Wakasa fearfully backs off, are extraordinarily charged (and superbly scored with wailing traditional Japanese string music).
There is also an excellent scene near the end where Genjuro returns home and enters the empty house and then passes on through and around to come back in again, during which this second time around we see the wife sitting over the fire cooking in the foreground. It is a beautifully subtle moment that leaves you unsure whether you missed something the first time or whether she made a ghostly reappearance, something that not even the rewind button manages to dispel.
The story’s theme of the humble peasant who abandons his wife in order to move to a position above his station and is haunted for doing so is a theme that has run through a number of other kaidan eiga, including the ""Black Hair"" segment of the superb ghost story anthology Kwaidan and the oft-filmed Yotsuya Ghost Story – see Ghost Story of Yotsuya (1959) and Illusion of Blood.",4.0

"As enthralling as it is mournful, Ugetsu explores wartime and its damning effects on women, but at its most fundamental it's a tale of greed and hubris. Though caught in desperate circumstances, what are we to make of men who are indifferent to the suffering of their wives, instead intoxicated by the appeal of riches and glory? The film's answer is ultimately complex, even as its sense of morality is clear from the start. This doesn't make the film's final conclusion any less grueling, however, although it feels fitting as some form of karmic retribution. Ugetsu lends these men an empathy that seems unusual for the morality tales the film is based off of, condemning their lack of filial piety while also recognizing their suffering. It's so tragic that, by film's end, the intoxicating allure of the supernatural no longer feels menacing but understandable, preferable even.",5.0

"Great score, great imagery, great production design.
Meh story.
Poor characters.",3.0
"A film made in 1953 with such a meticulate use cinematography to depict it's nuanced nature is almost unbelievable.
The emotion in sequences such as the one when Genjuro returns home is incredible. The use of tracking to depict the supernatural subtly showing itself in amidst of normality is subtlety that, along with the music, proceeds to depict the tragicality of it's story through the unfortunate realization and acceptance of the fate his wife found herself fulfilling.
It's as if every tracking shot, every lighting choice, and every way the camera frames everything, along with the amazing use of music, amounted to an extremely consistent symphony of visuals that perfectly capture anxiety, unpredictability, fear, and sadness, as if we could feel war itself driving every choice the characters make, situations they find themselves in and the atmosphere that they reside.
It's a film that primarly depicts the overwhelming ambition and frustration that comes with war. Every second of it is filled with an uncomfortable feeling of pending compromise, as the characters (in this case the men in the story, the ones that are put in such position during war times) eventually lose themselves in search of trivial and egocentric goals that are filled by such pressures of war.
A sequence I particularly enjoy quite a bit is the one where one of our characters is being chased by a ghost that provided him with every pleasure he wanted. The camera serves as the agressor, destiny itself, slowly walking towards him as he anxiously moves around the frame.
Light becomes progressively scarce until he finally exhausts himself, and we cut to an intimidating frame of the three's silhouette, framing him as if his attempts to escape amounted to nothing.",5.0
"I wouldn’t say this is what I traditionally think of when I think of a horror movie. It’s not “scary” but with its subject matter and set design it feels certainly off putting and even otherworldly at some parts of the movie. The main thesis of the movie is mostly about over militarization and how it effects everyone in a negative. This is illustrated by the main characters being taken prisoner by the military. 
The way they illustrate the point as well is subtle and well done with it being shown not told. They also sprinkle a lot of sound effects throughout the movie which normally wouldn’t work in a film like this but builds a ton of tension here with it feeling incredibly stressful at points. The last twenty minutes as well are just a fucking trip, PERFECT Ending for a movie like this and amazing throughout the rest of the movie as well.",4.5

"classic folktale of Feudal moral teaching in a frame of moving picture
The story is about a folktale of merchant families' life in Japan during the civil war period who wished to have a better quality of life. Genjuro, a father of one and the husband of Miyagi, was a poor craftsman who make various kinds of pottery to sell in nearby town. He was accompanied by Tobei, husband of Ohama, who had a great ambition to become a samurai. One day, the males came back from town with silver coins and fancy clothes as souvenirs. After a small celebration of successful effort, Genjuro suddenly changed into a man with an ambition for wealth, therefore he started working harder, making more and more pottery despite of disapproval gesture shown by his wife. Thus, he ignored his wife warning about a rumour saying that groups of soldiers who were going for war heading to their village's location and might get there by the next day. With all the great risk facing these two man's ambitious acts, the five of them managed to escape with their potteries by taking the lake route using a boat. But they were not safe yet, bad omen showed up in a form of a dying man who managed to escape pirates, telling them about his misfortune in that foggy lake. At this point, the party decided to drop Miyagi and her son at a nearby shore.
In the town, all our three protagonists got separated and played by their fate, leading to misfortunes that laid in their future. Tobei followed a group of samurai, escaping Ohama who tried to stop him and soon got lost. She then encountered a group of soldiers, got raped and soon ended up in a brothel to strive for money. Meanwhile, Genjuro, whom his love to his child and wife, suddenly got blinded by an enchanted ghost of a young princess who had died in a war and stayed in a ghostly manor for a long period. While her husband lived in a charming illusion of the evil spirit, Miyagi struggled alone in hunger and died later, leaving her son in the care of the village chief. When the remaining protagonists had finally realized their mistakes, only regret and guilt remained in their hearts.
Adapted from an Edo literature titled Ugetsu Monogatari, The Tale Of Ugetsu, this film is a story of humankind who tried to chase mundane happiness by living their ambitious dreams. From its narrative structure, this film can be seen as a moving picture of classical drama which incorporated characteristic aspects of what makes it classical. The plot is developed in a structuralistic way--the common triangle structure of conflict. it is also based on a moral teaching influenced by Buddhism religion as a common belief during that age which sees greed as a poison that leads one to suffer. Another characteristic of Japanese classic drama is the appearance of ghosts, especially women ghosts that are depicted as evil figures.
""There's always a price for an ambition,"" is a meaningful quote by Miyagi to convince her husband. Written in a three-act structure, this film is full of classical wisdom about how to live in a wisdom way with gratefulness, challenging the ancient problem about one's desire in a materialistic world that has not changed in modern society.",4.0
"In my opinion, a truly fascinating anti-war jidaigeki about the pain and suffering that comes from greed, military ambition, and so on. The movie contains many breathtakingly beautiful shots, such as the one on the rowboat coming through the mist. A masterful approach to mise-en-scene throughout that makes me want to study all the various shots. Although, I think the Criterion version makes the dark parts too dark, I wonder what the film would look like on 35mm. To me, it also seems like a post-war criticism of Japan itself. Particularly the subplot with Ohama and her becoming a comfort woman of the military, just like the Imperial Army did.
Overall I think it is a wonderful tale of militarism, greed and arrogance that shows that the blessed life the characters wished for they already had at home. And they only realised it once they lost it.",4.0

""Success always comes with a price in suffering.""",5.0
"This film has some excellent individual sequences and an interesting supernatural element, as well as many technical strengths, but it’s largely an extremely direct and simplistic folk morality tale that impressed at times, but dragged at others.
I felt like my main problem was that so much of the film felt so “obvious,” right down to characters literally stating aloud what lessons they have learned from their foolish mistakes. It was hard for me to get invested in characters like this, particularly in the big subplot about a man obsessed with becoming a samurai for the wealth and glory—but at what cost! This thread just felt underbaked to me, as it tries to depict women’s suffering from men’s greed and arrogance, but felt to me more like it’s actually just using that suffering as a cheap plot device to give the man a wake-up call.
The main story, on the other hand, is a lot more interesting, as it involves the “ghost story” aspect of the film. There’s a fair bit of mystery and interesting conflict introduced here, and it’s told in a pretty great way most of the way through. This story has a much better ending and provides most of the film’s great scenes.
Despite my lack of interest at times, I think it was still worth the watch, just not quite up to the expectations I had from reading others’ impressions. Having enjoyed Mizoguchi’s much more fleshed-out The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum significantly more, which shares themes to a certain degree, I think this was just not as much my style and would have benefitted from more time to actually make me care for its characters.",3.5

"Ugetsu is immediately impressive for its cinematography headed by Kazuo Miyagawa under Kenji Mizoguchi's direction. The vast network of dolly tracks laid and relaid to capture all of the smooth shots around the small village where things are initially set, and through the forests. Ugetsu could easily be a silent film, Mizoguchi's visual storytelling is so strong. It would require a few extra translucent camera tricks for the images of Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyō) or a high volume of intertitles, but Mizoguchi could have pulled it off, even in 1953.
His vision for Ugetsu is almost aggressive. The camera is ravenous, taking in as much action and emotion as possible. The acting from his core group of five actors is heightened in body and voice. The story, coming from a collection of 18th century stories by Ueda Akinari, leans on the existence of supernatural forces. Ugetsu has a footing in sincere drama with a concrete backdrop of unruly civil war and human greed. From that foundation, Mizoguchi launches into the sky.
The small, intimate scale of the farming and pottery businesses that Genjūrō and his wife Miyagi (Masayuki MOri and Kinuyo Tanaka) run is a humble beginning for the vast moral drama that unfolds. Against the wisdom of a town elder, Genjūrō and his buddy Tōbei (Eitaro Ozawa) churn out tons of clayware to take financial advantage of the destruction of the territorial war going on around them. Their greed puts their families in danger, as MIyagi and their son accompany the men on a boat that Tōbei's wife, Ohama (Mitsuko Mito), must steer for them.
Despite their wives pleading to temper their ambitions or avoid higher and higher risks, Genjūrō and Tōbei's insatiable desire to grab hold of everything within their reach, much like the movie's insatiable search for every morsel of cinematic beauty and resonance. When the deceased Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyō) shows up and captures Genjūrō's attention, she takes greed to a whole new level. Her own greed to recapture what she never had while living is the most selfish act in the film and it poisons what little hope there is left.
Tōbei and Ohama become equally depraved in one way or another. Mizoguchi uses the stripped-back period setting and the contrasting supernatural element to move the story from zero to one hundred inside the tight running time (94 minutes) and then to bring it back down again. Just as the presence of ghosts and curses took Genjūrō to the brink of self-destruction, so does Miyagi's passing and her presence after death guide him to redemption. The control with which Mizoguchi lands the story almost back where it started after a massive detour is evidence of his ability to set sights. He never lost focus on his end goal and Ugetsu remains as sharp throughout as it has in the 58 years since its release because of it.",0.0

I expect most of my quibbles will disappear upon rewatch, but I will say that for a film concerned with the mistreatment of women, I’d hoped for a bit more internal life for its female characters. It’s fitting that this is often described as a story about men and their wives, because that is how they are viewed first and foremost in the story, I think occasionally to the film’s detriment.
With that said, there’s a large handful of images - the ruins of a palace, sandals on a beach, a woman with a child on her back crawling as men fight behind her, and of course the entire lake sequence - that will stay with me, and the score is one of the most elegant and unsettling I’ve ever heard.",0.0

"Además de ser una máquina del tiempo y del espacio, el cine brinda la inestimable posibilidad de hacer un viaje por las emociones humanas en diferentes vehículos, incluido el cuento, que se expresa, en el caso que nos ocupa, con hermosa e inquietante fantasía y el más crudo costumbrismo. Esta fábula filmada por Mizoguchi se caracteriza por una gran riqueza formal y conceptual. Formal porque son muchos y variados los planos y las secuencias capaces de conmovernos por su esmerada ambientación, su vistosa coreografía, su llamativo vestuario, su delicada fotografía y su banda sonora penetrante. Conceptual porque aborda numerosos temas, entre los que destacan la ambición y la lealtad conyugal, desde un punto de vista normalmente moralista. Es un relato muy bien hilado, basado en los cuentos de Akinari Ueda y Guy de Maupassant, un relato que mucho abarca y que también aprieta, familiar, fantasioso, con misterio y suspense, que se desarrolla en un Japón del siglo XVI en plena guerra civil, en el que el áspero y trascendental paisaje casa perfectamente con las elementales emociones en juego, normalmente deudoras de acusados e injustos roles de género. Emociones muy presentes para el espectador gracias entre otras cosas a la lenta y rítmica percusión y a los fuertes latidos y quejidos de la banda sonora y a la talla minuciosa de la luz, recursos estos con los que, entre otros, Mizoguchi es capaz de crear secuencias electrizantes que ponen los pelos de punta. En sus noventa minutos de duración representa un complejo retablo de emociones expresadas con elemental crudeza o con una sensibilidad espiritual alucinante que la convierten en una obra maestra que visita el paraíso y el infierno y transita por los caminos que los unen con una humanidad desbordante.",5.0

Ugetsu paints a flowing portrait of how greed and desire can corrupt men and plight the women they supposedly love. It follows in the tradition of great portrayals of folk stories in a cinematic setting like Onibaba and Kwaidan which I both love to death. This offers up a somber lesson on masculine identity and pride and just how damaging it can be. The movie flows effortlessly never lulling into itself like I think Sansho does. I can definitely see the influence this had on many filmmakers when it comes to layering such important and universal themes in simple narratives. You can always see what's coming but the execution always keeps you engaged with the characters and the world.

"[originally posted to IG on August 18, 2020]
Lead by the three-headed, six-winged titan of Akira Kurosawa, Yasujirō Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi, Japanese cinema rose from the ashes of a devastated postwar Japan and soared to sublime heights during the 1950s, a decade that, similar to Mizoguchi, does not get the widespread artistic reverence that it deserves. While Kurosawa was the most influential of the three, and Ozu the most innovative, the outspoken Mizoguchi created some of the most political and socially critical films of the first half of the 20th century, filling his movies with powerful themes that still resound today.
In 1936, with his incredibly talented writing partner Yoshikata Yoda, Kenji Mizoguchi created two of his most acclaimed films: Sisters of the Gion and Osaka Elegy. Fiercely anti-patriarchal, these two stories address male hypocrisy, female subjugation, and the plights of sex workers. The films not only shed an empathetic light on (non-forced) sex work, but they also argue for the rights of sex workers, asserting that those performing it should be treated with the same dignity and respect as any other person or profession – a claim that’s still seen as one of the more radical aspects of feminism in the 21st century, and must have been brain-meltingly subversive in the 1930s.
The former two of these themes continue in Mizoguchi’s fantasy-drama masterpiece, Ugetsu, a haunting ghost story steeped in anti-war messages. Based on two short tales from Ueda Akinari’s 1776 anthology, Ugetsu tells the story of two couples attempting to make a living amid the many civil wars in 16th century Japan, as roving bands of samurai terrorize the countryside.
Genjūrō is a potter who believes he can make a profit from all the upheaval, and his occasional assistant Tōbei dreams of becoming a samurai himself. While selling their wares in the city, Tōbei runs off with his share of the profit to buy a suit of armor and weaponry in order to fulfill his militaristic aspirations, eventually becoming a high-ranking samurai through underhanded opportunism, and Genjūrō falls in love with a noblewoman who purchases a few pieces of pottery from him, although there may be more to the woman than meets the eye #SheDead. As both men blindly chase their own lusts and ambitions, their wives (Miyagi and Ohama), abandoned and alone, are forced to fend for themselves against the violence of the endless waves of enemy soldiers sweeping through their villages: conditions entirely absent of the glory or the lavish intimacy their husband’s impulsively disregarded them for. Genjūrō and Tōbei are far from being outright cruel men, but in the circumstances, their blithe passivity is just as detrimental as the actions of the sadistic samurai.
Like the film’s director (and screenwriter), Ugetsu’s cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa does not get the wide recognition today that his astounding filmography should have earned him. A frequent collaborator with Mizoguchi, Miyagwa worked with each head of the titan in turn, as well as many other of his country’s most celebrated directors throughout the 20th century, and, along with those directors, is directly responsible for a substantial portion of Japanese cinema’s most breathtaking images. Though his name is not mentioned nearly as much as his Western contemporaries, within his field Miyagawa is considered one of the most influential artists to ever step behind a camera, and his exquisite deep focus photography served beautifully for Mizoguchi to harness those immersive spaces and turn each frame into a story in itself with his insightful and intuitive staging.
The technical mastery and artistic vision are intoxicating to watch in Ugetsu, where the camera’s gliding, ghostlike movements give the film’s atmosphere an ethereality, contrasting with the texture-filled compositions that leap off of the screen, lending each scene weight and immediacy: superbly communicating the story’s blend of folkloric fantasy and real-world trauma.

"For some it is an allegory about post-war regret in Japan following WWII. For others (specifically Robin Wood), it is a feminist film (as well as discussion about the progression of reasons to create art; parallels between pottery and filmmaking reveal themselves), and others still find it to be a film discussing the battle between holding onto the past and moving towards the future. Personally, I see it as a film about losing sight of what you have in the pursuit of worldly thing (fame, stature, wealth, beauty), and only realizing that mistake when you have lost what is truly valuable and irreplaceable.

Having already sampled the works of two of the ""Three Masters"" of Japanese cinema -- Kurosawa and Ozu -- I finally got around to a Mizoguchi. And, whelp, it might be my favorite. In some respects, the rapidly-paced Ugetsu stands in contrast to the mammoth Seven Samurai, and the slow-flowing Tokyo Story (both of which I adore). But in at least two important ways, they're aligned: dedication to human characters, and sureness of directorial hand.
Ugetsu is a folktale imbued with a deep naturalism. That might make it sound boring, but make no mistake -- coming in at a lean-ass 96 minutes, it's as gripping and dynamic as Evil Dead II.

"it's funny that so much social stratification can be compared to people being guided and haunted by the ghosts of powers long gone, yet still in the thick, polluted air of our world, because, with a film like ugetsu, it takes that metaphor in as many literal and figurative ways as it possibly can. the whole of it is only aided on by very misty lighting and many wide shots of feudal japan distilled into busy streets and war-torn rural lands. so much melancholy is present that gives way to full-on sadness with drips of anger at how a country driven by the brutality of war and the profits that reap what so many characters here sow
but it's not just profits, and it's also not just brutality from war; it's full-on negligence of what one has been given in their life without the fullest appreciation of the world that could've been possible for them. it's heartbreak at periods of history that signify the downfall of rulers, and how those very rulers seep into your life to fill that void when everything seemed limitless and the possibilities were endless, until all that was left were choices that bound your cruel fate in the cruel society you were molded by",4.5

I definitely should rewatch this though—I had the wrong expectations about it, and I'm pretty sure this film felt worse than it actually is for that.",3.5

"Un peu mince d'un point de vue narratif (ce n'est finalement pas grand chose d'autre qu'une fable morale assez simple), mais en même temps, maudit que c'est beau.

"Like the 2001 film ""Pulse,"" which I watched Friday night, ""Ugetsu"" is an atmospheric Japanese film about the imminence of the spirit realm and the afterlife's extension into the so-called Real World. Of course Mizoguchi's dark fairy tale isn't really about ghosts, which is why it works so well, and why it ends up being truer to life and more emotionally exhausting than most horror movies, ""Pulse"" included. Instead it's about the age-old question of how and whether normal people can overcome their own frailty when faced with the collapse of nearly everything around them. Mizoguchi's hypnotically lush depiction of the chaos of medieval Japan anticipates ""Andrei Rubalev"" over a decade later, and even ""Hard to Be A God"" a full half-century later. The castles, villages, and marketplaces are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying, exactly the kinds of places ghosts might be lurking. The really scary thing is that the ghosts aren't really external to the main characters—who are, poignantly and importantly, towards the bottom of the the social order in feudal Japan; the people whose humanity barely figures into the calculus of the people above them—and are an expression of wants and desires that are buried inside of nearly everyone. And the worst monsters in this movie aren't even the ghosts, who, as it turns out, are just as in need of love and attention as the living. ",4.5
"Más que el Mizoguchi moralizante, me interesa más el cineasta observador, su mirada, y la capacidad de este para llenar la pantalla de una imaginería –casi inherente a la cultura nipona– y belleza sin parangón. No es tanto la fábula, sino cómo se muestra ante la cámara, desnuda y tan cruda como la época en que se desarrolla la acción.",3.5

"""In 16th-century Japan, a farmer, Genjurô, and a potter, Tobei, abandon their jobs and their families to meet glory. As the imperial armies collide, one is seduced by an evil and beautiful princess, the other aspires to the heroic stature of the samurai.""
Love, war, peace, poverty, wealth, greed, ambition, desire for redemption, courage, cowardice, beauty, death, tragedy.
All this in one of Kenji Mizoguchi's best movies, if not his best movie, in which human urgency is told, the search for a better life, full of riches and satisfactions, the desire of the two protagonists - the movie is based on from two stories that are intersected - to overcome the limits and realize the potential that they believe to glimpse in themselves, and the inevitability of the existential tragedy and, above all, the false appearance of looking for a vitalistic and social redemption in fictional values, who with formal beauty or the peasant wrapped between his deep reality and the fictionalized reality of the heroic samurai, without grasping the importance of real life, or at least, the people who surround existence, with also the harmful cost of losing them, such as the two wives of the protagonists, invested by the choices of their husbands, one forced into prostitution and the other killed by some soldiers.
The movie is visually captivating. To a frank and raw realism, Mizoguchi combines lyrical and imaginative moments that go even beyond the supernatural (beware of bewitching ghosts). A sequence like that of the crossing on the boat is impossible to forget for its figurative power.",5.0

"Eine der größten Gaben des Kinos beruht auf einem scheinbaren Widerspruch. Es lässt uns in einen Traum eintauchen, eine irreale Illusion, verwirrt und täuscht uns und führt uns doch zugleich zu einer erleuchtenden Wahrheit. Dies ist eine Gabe, die der Kunst, vor allem der erzählenden ureigen ist. Ganz gleich ob Literatur, Theater oder Oper. Doch Kenji Mizoguchi liefert mehr als gute Argumente dafür, dass das Kino die überlegendste Kunst für diese Disziplin ist.
Tatsächlich adaptiert der Altmeister dafür aber andere Medien. Gleich zwei literarische Werke verwebt er hier, eines von Guy de Maupassant, eines von Ueda Akinari, welches auch den Titel gibt. Deren Erzählungen durchwandeln nun zwei Paare, ärmliche Dorfbewohner im Japan des 16. Jahrhunderts. Zum einen sind da Genjuro und seine Frau sowie sein Sohn. Genjuro träumt davon, in der großen Stadt vermögend zu werden, weswegen er eifrig seine Töpferwaren für den dortigen Markt vorbereitet. Zum anderen sind da Tobei und seine Frau. Dessen Traum ist es, Samurai zu werden, wofür er jedoch allerlei Ausrüstung bräuchte, welche für einen armen Bauern wie ihn unerreichbar scheint. Doch als alle gemeinsam in die Stadt aufbrechen, um mit Genjuros Geschäftsplänen Geld zu machen, scheinen die Träume plötzlich wahr zu werden.
""Ugetsu"" ist in jeglicher Hinsicht ein Meisterwerk, da er drei zentrale Aufgaben des Kinos meistert. Immersive Erzählung, handwerkliche Brillanz, und fundamentale Wahrhaftigkeit. Für Ersteres bedient sich Mizoguchi natürlich in erster Instanz der Vorlagen. Vom Franzosen Maupassant entleiht er sich im Grunde nur das Motiv der Gier nach Rang und Namen, die humoristische Pointe streicht er völlig. Von seinem Landsmann Ueda übernimmt er die Geschichten auch nur fragmentarisch und stellt sie neu zusammen, behält aber einen wichtigen Kern bei. Eine der großen Tugenden jenes japanischen Klassikers ist nämlich dessen Herangehensweise an die phantastischen Geistergeschichten. Es geht hier nicht um Horror, es geht um die mystische Atmosphäre der Sagen. Sie sind so einfach und doch plastisch und prägnant, dass sie wie von alt hergebracht wirken, sich nahtlos in die Filmwelt einfügen. Der knappe Aufbau der Erzählungen erlaubt es Mizoguchi sie zu kreuzen, zu verwischen und ein komplexes, jedoch in seiner Schmalheit immer sofort greifbares Netz zu konstruieren. Dessen Fäden tauchen dabei oft unmerklich in das Irreale, das Übernatürliche ein, was in seiner Untrennbarkeit noch mehr die organische und doch unbeschreibliche Natur eines Traumes annimmt.
Dieses Verweben und Verdichten gelingt Mizoguchi durch seine einzigartige Kontrolle des Mediums. Er unterscheidet sich von seinen nicht weniger genialen Zeitgenossen darin, dass er im Gegensatz zu Ozu die Bewegung liebt und im Gegensatz zu Kurosawa der kontrast- und bruchreichen Expressivität ausweicht. Bei Mizoguchi fließt alles. Von Close-Up in Halbtotale, von Vorder- in Hintergrund, von Raum zu Raum, ja von Garten, zu Therme, zu wogenden Feldern. Alles ohne Schnitte, zumindest ohne merkliche. Keine aufsehenerregenden Plansequenzen, bloße eine elegante Dirigierung jeder einzelnen Bewegung, jeder Person, jedes Lichtstrahles. Eine Virtuosität, an die nur Welles oder Ophüls heranreichen, die bei Mizoguchi aber noch erhabener ist, weil man sie fast gar nicht bemerkt. Es passiert alles ganz selbstverständlich, als wären dies unabänderliche visuelle Gegenstücke zu der Einfachheit der alten Märchen.
Mizoguchi nutzt jene handwerkliche Rafinesse aber auch über das Sagenumwobene hinaus, ja um mit ihm zu brechen. Denn er ist, was viele vernachlässigen, vermutlich der größte Feminist des Kinos, zumindest in den ersten Jahrzehnten des Mediums. Seine Filme handeln stets von tragischen Frauenschicksalen, von Aufopferung, von Misshandlung. Auch hier werden die Frauen durch den Egoismus der Männer ins Unglück gestürzt. Eine Subversivität, die auch den beiden zugrunde liegenden Autoren eigen ist, aber besonders bei Ueda gerne übersehen wird. Für Mizoguchi sind das Streben nach Ehre, Ruhm und Reichtum unlösbar mit dem Leid und Verderben der Frauen verbunden. So werden die Leitmotive der Epoche, welche durchaus patriarchalisch ist, an sich schon misogyn. Mizoguchi geht aber noch weiter: selbst die Dämonen und Gespenster werden bei ihnen zu Frauen, die Opfer der Männer sind. Dadurch verbindet er das schmutzige soziale Elend des von ihm vielstudierten Prostituiertenmilieus mit dem Übersinnlichen, Märchenhaften. All dies malt er vor dem unruhigen, vor allem gegen Frauen gewaltvollen Chaos des ewig wütenden Bürgerkrieges. Das Leid der Frauen zeichnet er dabei aber wiederum genau so simpel wie ausdrucksstark, wie er es bei den Erzählungen tut. Exemplarisch dafür die knappe, sogar sehr elliptische, aber dennoch albtraumhaft verstörende Vergewaltigungsszene. Noch beachtlicher sind aber die Feinheiten zum Ende. Dann, wenn Mizoguchi die Einstellungen länger als erwartet hält, subtil das Licht verändert, den Fokus der Kamera verrückt, das gesamte Bild um die Frau arrangiert. Die Frau, welche einfach nur da sitzt, schweigt, schuftet, liebt und leidet. Diese atemberaubenden Momente könnten ein paar der Bedeutendsten sein, nicht nur für den filmischen Feminismus, sondern für das Kino überhaupt.
Dies alles sind Tugenden, denen sich Mizoguchis gesamtes Œuvre zu rühmen weiß, oft sogar noch opulenter, noch breiter. Doch ""Ugetsu"" wird gerade durch seine Einfachheit, durch seine bewusste Konzentration des subtilen, kunstvollen Ausdrucks zum Magnum Opus seines Schöpfers. Eine unerreichte Verbindung traumhafter Sagen mit feministisch-humanistischer Wahrhaftigkeit. Ein Werk, welches die Eleganz und Kraft der Kamera voll ausschöpft. Eines, welches Bild und Ton und Traum und Realität verbindet, wie es nur das Kino kann.",5.0
"Com diversos fade outs, Kenji Mizoguchi opta por uma estrutura capitular, onde as cenas se concatenam em elipses muito bem dispostas. Assim, fica mais fácil de trabalhar com os núcleos que a obra oferece. Diante desse acerto formal é que Mizoguchi me envolveu nas outras diversas camadas que o filme tem a oferecer, desde seus fantasmas até os seus dramas.
Particularmente, o plot envolvendo fome, guerra, a sobrevivência e a ambição dos protagonistas me deixaram mais absorto que os fantasmas ali presentes. Ainda assim, achei incrível o modo que o diretor opta por inseri-los na trama, porque, graças a progressão das elipses, eles surgem organicamente, ao ponto de que me parece que sempre estiveram lá. Desde a saída de Genjurô e seus amigos a neblina que os cerca traz esse elemento fantasmagórico que os permeia durante todo o longa.
E na camada mais dedicada ao sobrenatural, o que me marcou foi o fato de que as criaturas espirituais fazem parte da jornada de autodescoberta e redenção, do reencontro com os princípios dos personagens, criando alegorias morais dentro da narrativa. Por isso, eles não seres malvados (nem benevolentes), pois mesmo sendo fantasmas, possuem tanta humanidade psicológica quanto os personagens de carne e osso. Esse equilíbrio na representação também ajuda a articular a moralidade que Mizoguchi busca defender, sendo clara e ao mesmo tempo profunda, levando em conta toda dubiedade intrínseca a natureza humana. A ganância, a traição, a guerra são horrores que surgem das nossas vontades, e nem sempre podemos deixar as vontades acima de outros tipos de bem-estar. É preciso uma reconexão entre lar, família, terra e cultura, que é ampliada graças às discussões metafísicas que Contos da Lua Vaga se propõe a realizar.",0.0

"Horror which transcends its category in a war movie setting and a traditional ghost story. Scenes seem mundane, but slowly evolve in the supernatural to depict war trauma and the struggle to survive as a farmer. The approach is way more anti-conservative jidai-geki than most of them, most comparable to Kaneto Shindos ""Onibaba"", although much more open in terms of topographical landscapes and more outwardly supernatural. But morality, in both cases plays an important part to make a statement about war in general, second world war in specific and the tragic experiences of ordinary people who try to survive. In means to adress the many traumas of second world war, japanese directors maybe found the most powerful way to do it. A trauma so recent can't be directly depicted and generate an audience who mainly wants to forget. So they get an analogy, which tries to push some buttons and at best draws parallels. The manipulative shift from natural to supernatural in ""Ugetsu"" maybe is just this: The realization that this is not 500 years ago, but ten.",0.0
"Week By Week, Decade By Decade... Part IV #11: My first Mizoguchi. I loved the ghost story elements of this, as well as the kind of fable/parable nature of it. Some very beautiful and haunting compositions as well. It's a depressing film, highlighting the lust and greed of men, especially during wartime, but I think comes to a relatively hopeful conclusion with both central men realizing the errors of their ways and vowing to change their behavior -- however unfortunately in both cases, it's too late for the damage to their loved ones to be undone.",4.0
