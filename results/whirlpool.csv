"Hokum and psychobabble. Also really nice to see Richard Conte playing something different than a cop or gangster for once.
Not the best Preminger (even at Fox) but his most fun (in a guilty pleasure sense), as the serial masochist director and best Mr Freeze (why were they both Austrian???), again torments Gene as his victim, but this time psychologically. The cruel irony of this, is the hidden mental issues Gene battle with, the bipolar depression, the postpartum and issues with her severely disabled child.
The notion of psychology caught on after the Second World War in the US, with the influence of Freud's theory and its use in advertising, however psychology and psychological damage/repression in noir always does seem to go to far (also if you are Hitchcock as well) and this is no exception, however this goes way beyond ""far"".
Here we are lead to believe hypnotism can steal a record (the right one in fact when they all seem to be white label when in storage), drive a car across town after telling them directions to the house and memorizing them (as well as the layout of the inside of the house), then be used in a murder and cover up a robbery of $60K. I mean if hypnotism cannot stop people from smoking today, how come 74 years ago it was so potent to do that? If this dude was so good at hypnotism, couldn't he just brain wash Mrs Randle with his Prof X mental ability.
I mean would it have been cheaper and easier to just hire someone to rob/burn the house down and then kill? I mean there just seem to be so many moving parts for this all, I mean being able to lineup getting the operation to ensure this is in sync with the threat of being exposed, training her hypnotically. Also if he was having a gall badder operation, that means alcohol would be an issue, as booze inflames a gall bladder and gives a great risk for a UTI, so is it the right idea to be social and have a few martins before the operation.
Also was this common practice in the 40s/50s of shrinks recording sessions on vinyl, or just Fox films like this and Nightmare Alley as well.
And I think the final issue I have this with this is the police don't seem to care that Gene is a klepto who may be the culprit for a number of outstanding thefts in the area, but the police don't seem to bothered about that.",3.0
"A psychological melodrama from Otto Preminger that isn't afraid to go full on with its dafter elements. It's a film that sees themes of past guilt and trauma wound around a ludicrous narrative involving hypnosis and murder. I've seen Giallo that are more believable than this! Whirlpool begins with a high class lady stealing from a shop, only to be saved by a slimey hypnotist, who seems to want to cure her. Before long she's the chief suspect in the murder of one his former patients, and its really not difficult to see what is going on. The film is carried off well by the director and cast. Gene Tierney's blank expression somehow makes the material more believable - but its José Ferrer who delivers the standout performance as the hypnotist pulling all the strings. He's almost a cartoon villain at times and even comes with his own superpower. It's slow moving and low on mystery and suspense, but still utterly involving in It's own way with plot strands involving the destruction of a marriage and a plan for murder converging together and nicely climaxing with a superbly satisfying conclusion. Whirlpool is absurd and ridiculous, but somehow works in spite of it.",3.5
"[previous review]
Born into hereditary wealth, Ann Sutton was raised to prioritize outward graciousness and the appearance of serenity over all else, learning to cover her feelings and fears with a hard, gracious shell, one so beautiful people fall in love with it, and don't even notice the woman it conceals. Hiding the dangerous, shameful version of herself propels Ann through society, securing her a respected, loving husband, regard from her neighbors and peers, and the authority that women of a certain class carry with them, no matter where they go.
Ann lives her life in response to the direction of others.
""Put your napkin in your lap, dear.""
""Little girls should be seen and not heard, Ann.""
""Oh no, Ann, not him — why, we don't even know who his parents are! What about that nice Bill Sutton? His family is good, and he's got prospects.""
""Ann, don't cry.""
""Oh, but you must visit us in Nice this summer, it's just what you need.""
""Come see me tomorrow, I can help you.""
To each directive, she gives a grateful smile, obeying with the kind of ease born of decades of instinctive, contented obedience. She loves Bill because he's shaped a comfortable life for her, one in which the commands are expected, easy to obey and, most importantly, make people admire her. He makes her fit; helps her keep that stunning, hard shell in place over everything she is.

Nothing hurts me.
David Korvo has never had anything. He grew up poor and ignored, a strangely distant little boy, with a stillness to his face that unsettled adults and irritated children.
Left alone, David watched. He saw his father turn his talents (empathy, connection, hypnosis) into a sideshow diversion for his social superiors, putting on a fake turban and an even faker accent for their pennies; saw his father's shame mix with gratitude for the indulgence of those who favored him with their attention; with their money; with their patronage. And he saw the way they looked at his father when his father wasn't watching: the way they laughed at him, mocking his accent, and his clothes, and his manner.
(But they paid him, so David's father kept his mouth shut and took it. David resolved never, ever to be like his father.)
For David, the gifts (tricks, grifts) he learned from father are weapons. He uses them to make precise cuts in those who would mock his father (mock him): those who treated him like an outsider; who would have spit on him, had the opportunity presented itself. David uses the blades of his voice and talents to slice away at the wealthy women in his thrall, seizing control over not only their purses, but also the minutiae of their lives.
They sleep when he allows it; see people only with his permission; go to parties at his suggestion, and at his suggestion alone. And they're grateful for it all.
Every word David Korvo speaks is calculated to further strengthen his authority over another, wrapping them in his rich, hypnotic web to such a degree that it's only David that matters; securing the control that ensures his access to the world to which he's always aspired.
They call him a quack and dismiss his gifts, but he amuses them, too, just enough to bring to parties; to show off like the latest bauble in a string of charms. It makes David's skin crawl to hear the laughter in their voices (to feel the mocking in their eyes), but he opens his mouth and they stop, for a moment. He opens his mouth, and one of them is his: his to use; to ruin; to despoil. Because he can.

Your soul can undress in front of me.
When David and Ann meet, it's desperate and it's perfect: a man who lives to control others, and a woman who doesn't exist unless she's told what to do. He is doom in a slick suit with graceful manners, but she doesn't care: because she's sleeping again; because he tells her she's ok; because he'll keep her safe.
Even Ann's suspicions disappear as quickly as they burst into life, assuaged by a single word from David. She doesn't need to believe what he says, only to be told that she's wrong; that he's right; that she's being silly. The moment the words pass his lips, Ann is relaxed again, as trusting and grateful as ever.
But Ann is David's doom, too. She's too perfect — too easy; too willing. He gorges himself on her malleability, abandoning his discipline in favor of volume and expediency. In David's head, there's even a shared future for them, one in which she is his, body, mind, and soul, and does his bidding with a grace so stunning that everyone falls at her feet. The blood dripping from her hands; the pockets full of stolen jewelry; the mind full of David's words (David's will) — all of it remains unseen behind Ann's polished, charming armor.
(David loves her, more than a little bit. For Ann, gratitude and love have always been almost the same thing; what she feels is close enough to love to work for David.)
NB: Please be aware that I love this movie more than anyone else alive. In other words, YMMV. You should totally watch it, tho.",4.5
"The opening shot looks mundanely common but the space and flow into the department store include two moments where what our eyes are trained to see suddenly shift and we follow something else. Perspective becomes misdirection, which moves from the mise-en-scene to the narrative level, a story about the literal control of sight and thus the mind. Routinely dismissed compared to the other Premingers of this era, perhaps because of absurdity of the plot (which is not that different from Gene Tierney's magical entrance in Laura ), but beloved by Godard and Rivette as well as The Cinema McManhon. Perhaps it's because of all the Preminger films it sparks the closest that the film's visual structure is the core essence of the film, and all the ideas surrounding the performance styles and even the narrative itself deviate from this visual idea. It's a film built around deception—of images, of the past, of one own's self. The way Tierney blanks her face in this film is simply an incredulous image; she goes from a character whose eyes seem constantly moving, her face an expressionist canvas, to what seems to resemble a body snatcher; an absolutely lifeless face in which you see the camera driving into her as Richard Conte does, trying to rescue the woman who was.
Meanwhile, this becomes the greatest supervillain narrative ever constructed with Jose Ferrer's malicious performance, a character who always move against the camera, a disordering function in a world where psychoanalysis hopes to bring rigor and structure. Ferrer's manipulations are pulled through his voice, one that sounds just similar enough to Conte's but with a forceful magnetism to make him his opposite. The scene in which he messes with the two glasses is the rare kind that so deliberately messes with expectations of allowing one to see the psychological motivation of any action depicted on screen, only slowly paying off in the second part of the narrative (another great payoff: the simple shot of the police captain's wife's portrait as he makes the phone call near the end; communicated without emphasis).
Preminger's camera swings around, changing and reshaping the power structures of this fight for the soul of a young woman, but in the end, one of the most powerful edits I can ever recall climaxes the narrative. As Tierney slowly remembers with the help of Conte, Preminger frames her in the direct middle of the frame, and then abruptly cuts to a shot of Conte in the exact same position of the frame. It's confusing for a second, it seems as if the two have switching places, but really it's a moment where this husband and wife are finally together, seeing eye to eye and becoming truly one. It's an astonishingly simple visual idea in a film filled with complex emotions, all delivered through a phrase I hate, but I can't help but use: pure cinema.",4.5
"Spoilers ahead.
Cleverly disguised as merely a twisty mystery, Otto Preminger's Whirlpool also manages to include some rich commentary on gender roles, and perhaps even some criticism of traditional American marriage.
From the first moment we meet her, Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is malleable and agreeable to a fault. Though she uses initially employs her instinctive class defenses when questioned by a mere store security man, she quickly returns to form when among those she considers her own class, immediately allowing Dr. Korvo (José Ferrer*) — a man she's never previously met — to take complete control of her situation, speaking for her as if she isn't there, and not allowing her a word in her own defense.
When she returns home, Ann illustrates her very traditional position with her doctor husband Bill (Richard Conte), hiding the fear and shame of her afternoon behind empty conversation about the evening ahead, and disappointedly lamenting her inability to help him with his books: ""if only I were brighter, and you could talk to me about your scientific problems."" His response, too, is telling: offering no reassurance about her intelligence or support, Bill instead says ""Just stay as you are — as you've always been: healthy and adorable."" Later, Korvo, too, indulgently refers to Ann's ""stupidity.""
The next night, her position and relationship are presented in the voice of observers, reflecting the same impressions Bill and Ann hold proudly. ""The greatest kick I get when we go to a party together,"" Bill muses, ""is when people stare at you and say, 'Who is that lovely girl?' 'Why, that's Dr. Sutton's wife! She's very devoted to him.'' Their shared pride in being described this way confirms that Ann is the perfect wife, submerging her own identity and needs beneath and into those of her husband.
It also appears that crying, despite being a vividly, distinctively feminine activity, is something Ann has learned is not pleasing to men, and thus should be controlled. So, when Korvo half-jokingly laments her tears of relief for making him look bad, she immediately dries her tears and puts on a smile, getting just the approval she was seeking: a ""that's better,"" followed by, ""thank you."" Virtually the same conversation occurs with Bill later, when they first see one another following her arrest. Her eyes begin to fill with tears, and Bill instinctively says — the first words he's said to her since finding out — ""Please, don't cry."" Obediently, Ann assures him, ""I won't."" Again, she gets the ""thanks"" she's been taught to expect for her automatic compliance.
None of these things has to do with hypnosis — in fact, all but the last conversation with her husband take place either before Ann's first appointment with Korvo, or reflect realities that had long existed by the time he appeared. The strong suggestion, it seems, is that upper class American women are obedient by nature: their gender and class training has made them that way. All David Korvo does to his many female victims (he is, as he smugly tells Bill, ""an experienced man"") is simply position them to lean a bit further than usual into those well-learned lessons and behaviors.
Korvo is a monster, certainly, but in the context of the film, it's only because he harnesses the same feminine compliance so many use to their own advantages, to achieve goals other men find unacceptable. Their own manipulations (Bill's for example, or those of Ann's father) are ""normal"" and therefore not only acceptable, but almost expected, but what David does? That's beyond the pale. It's David who is the problem, not the training of which he's successfully learned to take advantage.
Alongside all of the social commentary, the screenplay by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt also offers a hell of a sordid little story, painting Korvo as someone whose ease at manipulating women has been used to ends so nefarious the only ones anyone is willing to talk about involve money. The fact that the first thing Korvo does with Ann after he's ensured that his hypnosis can compel her into basic action is to tell her to take his hand, at least suggests he has a whole lot of other things on the menu, something Ann confirms with her stricken realization that ""[Korvo] must have made me do things! Horrible things!""
Even this is given wry comment by Hecht and Solt in David's sanguine assertion that no one, under hypnosis, can be compelled to do anything against their natural moral inclinations. This explains, in his mind why Ann, with her long history of thievery would steal records on Korvo's command, and also allows David to cling to the belief that her transgressions stopped there. After all, anything intimate with Korvo would go against his perfect wife's carefully honed conventional morality, and therefore couldn't possible happen, even under the pressure of hypnosis. Right?
(The blinders carefully donned by 1950s Americans were used to cover many, many inconvenient truths.)
TL; DR: I'm mad at all of my LB friends who haven't demanded that I watch this. It could not be more perfectly tailored to my very specific, messed up fictional power dynamic-related needs!
*Could Korvo's odd manner and sandpaper-dry wit be more obviously an inspiration for Ferrer's kid's performance as Albert Rosenfield 40 years later? It's uncanny!",4.0
"This Otto Preminger noir from 1949 hasn’t dated as well as some of his other films. The female murder suspect in this is ably played by a very glamorous Gene Tierney, but she is poorly served by a script that requires her to be either simpering or confused as she puts up with various amounts of nonsense from her husband, her blackmailer, and the detective.
There’s no real attempt at suspense as the script gives all the information up front – we know what’s going on, so the foolish husband’s short-sightedness is just frustrating. The ending also makes little sense and feels rushed. They spent a long time setting up everyone to be in the same location but then there is virtually no pay off. We’re just told what we already now and ‘The End’!
This film wouldn’t get made today – the female roles are poorly written and wouldn’t get to the first notch on a Bechdel Test. The cast are all good, in particular Jose Ferrer as the evil mentalist, and Preminger’s direction is solid if not memorable. Though I did like the opening shot as the camera pans around the department store before picking up on Tierney.",2.5
"Really dug this slippery film. What a complex, at times ambivalent view on its intertwining issues of mental illness and marriage. Great, great performances from Gene Tierney and José Ferrer. Supremely graceful camerawork and editing that smartly uses misdirection to its advantage. I wrote about the film for my newsletter. ",3.5
"Another 40s film reflecting Hollywood's newfound fascination with the mysteries of the mind (hypnotism, therapy, psychological disorders).
Let's talk about José Ferrer first (and wasn't Miguel the spit of his dad). It is a great piece of casting as he makes a marvellously charismatic villain without being over the top. He has this wonderful mellifluous voice and I couldn't help thinking that his character's vanity is pricked when - minor spoiler! - he hears Mrs Randolph saying on the recording that his once-thrilling voice now disgusts her (or words to that effect).
And what about dear darling Gene Tierney, one of my favourite Hollywood faces. She is beautifully expressive when she needs to be but utilises that porcelain-doll face to great effect when under the influence of hypnosis. And is there anything as gorgeous as G.T. when she has a couple of unshed tears sparkling in her eyes?!
I know Richard Conte is occasionally accused of being a bit wooden (not unjustly) but I have a real soft spot for him and I felt that his stiff, gentlemanly demeanour works well here, especially as a foil to Ferrer's smoothly villainous Korvo.
All in all it's a great example of the psych-noir-melodrama type film. And yes, it may be preposterous in its plotting but that's somewhat par for the course in this kind of film, and is highly entertaining nevertheless.",3.5
"“You need treatment.”
Gene Tierney in the vinyl storage closet, a scene from my fantasies come to life.
Ann Sutton (Tierney) is free, white and kleptomaniac. Also, “healthy and adorable.” When she gets caught up in a blackmail and hypnosis confidence scheme, she goes along with it, so she can sleep. The problem is, all those hypnosis sessions lead people to think she’s stepping out on boring husband Bill (Richard Conte). And the square-headed police chief (Charles Bickford) somehow thinks this frail, confused woman has the strength to strangle a lady with her bare hands.
A bit silly and hollow in how it discusses psychoanalysis and hypnosis in the same way that Spellbound is. A bit of fluff, but Hecht’s script snaps along nicely, especially all the lines given to José Ferrer as the truly evil conman whose rapist energy is off the charts. Said script also features a man being mind-read about his recent suicide, having the cuts on his wrist pointed out in mixed company, and him exclaiming happily: “This man is marvelous!” So it’s a mixed bag.",3.0
"I guess Otto Preminger needed to repeat the Laura dose twice at making another murder mystery turn complex character-study of love affairs and lie-consuming souls, one with cast-recycling Dana Andrews coming back as the main morally questionable leading man in Fallen Angel and now was Gene Tierney’s turn here in Whirlpool, a sort of kleptomaniac-female Noir that soon turns murder mystery by one cryptic swing of glooming events.
BOY, if I though the last Noir I’d seen had a LUDICROUS plot, let an investigative thriller with hypnosis and sleepwalking involved as main key elements, speak for itself!
The entire premise eradicates subtlety by the outset when having José Ferrer as David Korvo running the poor Tierney’s Ann fate into an unavoidable and uncontrollable path of doom caused by her own repressed psychological and emotional baggage. If the plot doesn’t grab you immediately, Ferrer senior most surely does, playing this hypnotist conman with Sherlock Holmes abilities and some hypnosis specialties, a cunning manipulator hidden behind all the charm and passivity.
He’s this movie’s equivalent from Laura’s Clifton Weber’s Lydecker: too obviously a MONSTER that you can’t process how a guy so fine and polite could be the mentor of such horrendous plan and actions; making a poor emotionally disturbed woman becoming his crime accessory, again, VIA hypnosis. Though I sincerely don’t know which is weirder, that or seeing Richard Conte playing a pleasantly sympathetic good man and not a despicable villain in a Noir movie?!
Suspense of disbelief aside, there’s something very gripping about Whirlpool that outdoes its plot’s unraveling, which if you put it in comparison with both Laura and Fallen Angels – at that point Preminger’s best Noirs; is the one most convoluted plot-wise and way to drowned out for it to make any ounce of suspense that everlastingly thrilling. But the defining light of its charm is found around (and once again) in Gene Tierney herself at the movie’s epicenter.
She carries a helpless countenance next to a provocative sensuality; there is always a strange ambiguity about her fragile character. Her truth is concealed under seven keys of screwy in the head and you never know what to expect from her other than follow her through this psychological therapy via life-threatening experience, in which the actress conveys with imposing stance. Whenever she is hypnotized she appears to become a lynx with mechanized movements.
Her instincts are nothing other than her own subconscious getting controlled by a tamer – which makes great dramatic connection to the fact that only by allowing Ann to be understood by an acceptable loving husband that she’s able to find her emotional and psychological freedom by the end. Making the story be less about hypnotic shenanigans and more a good character drama of learning to be whole, not just by accepting who we are, but the path to accepting those we love as well.
However, where I think Whirlpool overlaps itself a bit in its own detriment, is in the over-focus on the concept logic being conveyed to the audience constantly in the narrative, rather than let it play out next to the firm grip of its execution and let it slide naturally. Gene’s presence surely helps and the movie looses flair whenever she’s not onscreen (which is great part of the second-half), but the other great diva that elevates the movie beyond its undercooked material is Preminger himself!
The man just had great hand for evocative dramatization under superb conveyed elegance: his virtuous blocking; the precise conjunction of scenes that never feel anything other than lyrical; the small long takes that you barely notice just took place, conveying precision information (the body reveal is an AMAZING sequence) – that must have fascinated a young Spielberg to so often borrow that technique for himself; anchored under the subtleness of its actors movements on the scenery.
Whirlpool can be convoluted when heavily tries to dramatize its own ludicrousness, but it goes to show how a masterful filmmaker can make a defining difference when putted behind such odd-beat material, but directing it with a conviction of a potent melodrama that makes its graceful actors slide under a floor of evocative luxury and elegance that any Noir movie could’ve wished for itself!
(José Ferrer is looking DISTRESSFULLY alike Miguel here, which almost made me think they were the same actor!)",4.0
"(...) Comparando os diferentes filmes de Preminger uns com os outros, percebemos menos a persistência de certos temas dramáticos que de certos tipos de situações, adequados para estudar certas reações, observar certos gestos: a virtude dramática da droga em The Man with the Golden Arm, como, em Angel Face, da obsessão criminal ou, em Whirlpool, da dominação hipnótica, é de provocar certas manifestações psicológicas. No entanto, a independência que os filmes de Preminger estabelecem sem adornos entre o elemento dramático (a intriga, a narrativa) e o elemento psicológico (os gestos, os movimentos, as reações) nos convida a avançar ainda mais a análise. Se o romancista, se o roteirista aplicado se preocupam em mesclar esses elementos e apoiá-los um no outro, justificando por algum elemento psicológico alguns desenvolvimentos dramáticos que, por sua vez, autorizam outras notações psicológicas, tudo se passa, ao contrário, como se Preminger desdenhasse esses jogos de construção e visse na intriga apenas a ocasião de provocar gestos que por si só retêm sua intenção. Falei anteriormente de manifestações psicológicas e não de psicologia: trata-se de instantâneos, não de um estudo da evolução das personagens.

(...) Quem nos mostrou os homens?
Há alguns anos, vi um filme cujo título era Whirlpool. É preciso dizer, nada descobri nesse filme. Foi isso, aliás, que me desconcertou; encontra-se sempre alguma coisa. Era o primeiro filme que eu me sentia incapaz de nomear. Nenhum sentido, nenhuma referência. Um homem, uma mulher; eles se mexiam, e seus gestos não exprimiam nada. Eles falavam e as palavras não significavam nada, o filme era pleno de silêncios. Atrás de um vidro fiel, vi silêncios se mexerem; eu estava impelido ao vidro como se costuma se impelir ao que é transparente, ao que é evidente. O filme era assinado por Preminger.

"“I hope your marriage will give you something to live for, if only a divorce.” – David Korvo
I love Gene Tierney and quite like the ”often” underrated Richard Conte but it’s undoubtedly the fabulous José Ferrer who gives the most intriguing and scenes stealing performance here. The plot seems a little unfocused at times and lacks a clear central character. Whirlpool is probably the weakest of Preminger’s Fox Noirs but still and an entertaining and well crated movie.",3.5

"gene tierney my darling, i am so sorry that you are considered to be so underrated.
”you’re a bit smug, and rather stupid mr. korvo.”
clock him again for me gene PLEASE! the scene when she went to his hotel had me crying tears because she kept rejecting him and gagging him left and right. this was a very entertaining noir, i rather enjoyed it a lot! just something about gene tierney starring in a film noir to get you so excited to sit down and watch!
gene plays a wealthy married woman who is also a kleptomaniac. rescued from scandal by a hypnotist named david korvo, he continues to meet with her with her hope that he can cure her. he takes control over her mind and her actions, he then frames her for his crimes. definitely my kind of noir!! the score was also magnificent, i am always very fond of noir scores, they really hook me.
“please don’t cry”
”i won’t.”
that scene is actually heartbreaking because in the beginning of the film she wants desperately to confess what happened to at the store to her husband but then decides not to because she doesn’t want to make things hard for him. then we get to this scene in the police station and even after all that has happened she still wants to remain composed for him. it breaks my heart actually, it shows how much she loves him and how scared she is to lose his love.
but OH. MY. GOD. did i feel like i was going to lose my mind watching this… the feeling this movie put me through was very similar to how i feel when watching gaslight (1944). every time a new piece of “evidence” planted by korvo turned up and kept making the defence harder for gene’s character i wanted to rip my hair out. but i guess when you have that feeling that is how you know the film is rather good. i loved the last 17 minutes so much! one of my favorite parts of the whole film!
gene tierney really shines in this just as much as her other noirs. her piercing performance in the confession scene just shows she has an incredible capability to play these roles like no one else can. gene looked as gorgeous as ever as well, i will never get tired of watching her serve face! i understand why after the murder they sort of slowed down gene’s screen time, and although it did not change my attention span, i do think the second half needed more gene!! this film is definitely up there on her filmography, and it could even be put up with some of her best like leave her to heaven and laura. this film deserves more praise!",5.0
"It's been said many times by many people: Gene Tierney was and is so incredibly underrated as an actress. She was a marvellous performer, and it's such a shame that sometimes that is overlooked for whatever reason, including her breathtaking beauty. Her performance in this is definitely up there with her better-known hits like Leave Her to Heaven and The Razor's Edge.
Also, Preminger and Tierney? A perfect director-actor match.",3.5
"worked considerably better for me this time because i was prepared for the story to shift away from gene post-murder. this & leave her to heaven are are best work i'd argue. the scene where she sees her husband for the first time after the murder (""please don't cry"" ""i won't"") is so affecting. she is so confused. and she doesn't want to crumble in front of her husband, she wants to be seen as faultless. it's kind of heartbreaking.",3.5
"Otto Preminger's career post-Laura seems inherently tied to said film, the director understandably looking to recreate the same level of success by taking similar ideas, themes and actors, shuffling them around and adding new plot elements or narrative devices.
After appearing in Fallen Angel, Dana Andrews is replaced by the other half of Laura's main cast, Gene Tierney, in what at first glance seems to slot nicely within that period of Hollywood in the 1940s when psychoanalysis, or 'dollar-book Freud' in the words of Orson Welles was all the rage at the movies, with many thrillers of the time relying on far-fetched plots involving dreams and repressed memories that must be teased out and resolved before the final act. Preminger's Whirlpool stands out as somewhat different however; it still has a ludicrous plot that defies logic at every turn, yet by pitting one type of analyst against another through the two lead actors it almost seems to satirically mock the very psychobabble of its narrative.
Tierney is well cast as a woman with repressed daddy issues that have also seeped into her marriage to a hard-edged husband played by Richard Conte, another genius bit of unconventional casting that uses Conte's rough-and-ready tough guy image to bring out a real feeling of distance in their relationship. Tierney's blank facial expressions give very little away, which is key to the ambiguity of Preminger's world-view; a lot of questions are asked, some are never answered and the moral ambiguity of the characters remains constant. I liked how even secondary characters like the cop, played by another returning actor, Charles Bickford are fleshed out and given backstories that make their presence in the story warranted.
The direction is much more restrained than in Fallen Angel, often reverting to more conventional shot/countershot camerawork but still has plenty of brilliant pans, dolly shots and long takes that constantly reframe the scenario. The shot where Tierney wanders into the home of Theresa Randolph is straight up gothic horror, I was expecting Vincent Price to leap out from a curtain at any moment. It wanders into heavy melodrama far more than noir but makes some revelatory statements about marriage and self-worth in the bourgeois household.",3.5

"Tres Preminger tardíos
No es que Otto Preminger abandonase nunca, en el fondo, el cine negro —¿qué son, en el fondo, Anatomía de un asesinato (Anatomy of a Murder, 1959), Tempestad sobre Washington (Advise & Consent, 1962) y, sobre todo, aunque visualmente parezca muy alejada, y a pesar de que Françoise Sagan no fuese precisamente Ross MacDonald, Buenos días, tristeza (Bonjour Tristesse, 1957/8), aparte de las más evidentes El hombre del brazo de oro (The Man With The Golden Arm, 1955) y El rapto de Bunny lake (Bunny Lake Is Missing, 1965)?—, pero la fama de la inolvidable Laura (1944) e incluso de ¿Ángel o diablo? (Fallen Angel, 1945), las más míticas —y quizá también las únicas algo románticas— de sus películas, ha hecho menospreciar injustificadamente películas tan magistrales y perfectas como Vorágine (Whirlpool, 1949), Al borde del peligro (Where The Sidewalk Ends, 1950) y Angel Face (1952), que me parecen tres de las mejores de este director siempre infravalorado (y hoy tan injustamente olvidado) y tres obras maestras del género.
Las dos primeras en orden cronológico completan con Laura —más que una trilogía— un fascinante retrato de la actriz que encarna a sus protagonistas respectivas, la simpar e insondable Gene Tierney; la tercera se centra en otra encantadora actriz, la dulce e inocente Jean Simmons, que en manos de Preminger se revela sumamente inquietante. Aunque en todas ellas les den la réplica actores enérgicos y con inconfundible personalidad (Richard Conte y José Ferrer en la primera, Dana Andrews, Gary Merrill y Tom Tully en la siguiente, Robert Mitchum y Herbert Marshall en la última; como Andrews y Clifton Webb en Laura y de nuevo Andrews y Charles Bickford en Fallen Angel), son obras dominadas por un rostro de mujer tan atractivo como misterioso.
Si la Ann Sutton de Whirpool es claramente víctima de una maquinación hipnótica, no hay quien esté a salvo del peligro que representa Diana Tremayne en Angel Face, mientras que la Morgan Tyler de Where the Sidewalk Ends es un paradigma de normalidad —hasta en su fascinación por los tipos dudosos— que casi la hace vulgar (es probable que el personaje careciese de interés si lo hubiese interpretado cualquier otra actriz de la época, incluso la conmovedora Linda Darnell de Fallen Angel). Pese a estas divergencias o gradaciones, pueden establecerse reveladores paralelismos entre las cinco películas negras de Otto Preminger: desde la fuerte relación de la protagonista con su padre (Tom Tully y el diametralmente opuesto Herbert Marshall) que une Where The Sidewalk Ends y Angel Face (y empareja ésta un apunte de Bonjour Tristesse), o al menos con una figura paterna (el Dr. Korvo de Whiripool, el Clifton Webb de Laura), hasta el detective encarnado tanto en Laura como en Al borde del peligro por Dana Andrews, pasando por los problemas psíquicos que (en grado muy diferente) padecen las heroínas de Vorágine y Angel Face, aunque varios de los hombres no estén precisamente a salvo de perturbaciones más o menos graves (Ferrer en Whirlpool, Andrews en Where The Sidewalk Ends, como antes Waldo Lydecker en Laura).
Esto permitiría caracterizar el cine negro de Preminger como perteneciente a su variante psicológica, y situarlo en la región del género fronteriza con el melodrama, asiduamente frecuentada en los años 40. Pero en Preminger se trata de un dramatismo que, al rehuir el director todo enfatismo, adquiere la naturaleza de una indagación, de una investigación que corre a cargo del propio cineasta —cuya perspectiva distanciada y ajena a la tentación expresionista predomina sobre cualquier punto de vista subjetivo de los personajes—, más que de los detectives, cuando los hay, o los psiquiatras que a veces los suplantan. Esto hace que resulte inadecuado clasificar como policiales incluso las películas protagonizadas por un detective (las de Dana Andrews), profesional no excesivamente brillante en Laura, decididamente turbio, obsesivo y delictivo en Where The Sidewalk Ends, y que Whirlpool escape a las convenciones del subgénero conyugal en el que sin duda se sitúa de partida (el ilustrado por Rebeca, Sospecha, Luz que agoniza, Secreto tras la puerta y tantas otras de ese decenio).
La comparación —a la que abundantes factores en común incitan, desde Mitchum en adelante— entre Angel Face y Retorno al pasado (Out of the Past, 1947), de Jacques Tourneur, revela de nuevo el dominio de la visión y el estilo de Preminger sobre los rasgos característicos de cada productora: más tiene en común Angel Face (pese a ser RKO, igual que la obra cumbre de Tourneur) con las restantes películas negras de Preminger, producidas todas por la Fox.
Se trata, evidentemente, de películas de autor que se sirven del marco de referencias, del territorio de ficción que brinda el género, y que en cierto sentido desbordan, tanto cuando se centran en pasiones y rencores privados (Angel Face, Whirlpool, Laura, Fallen Angel) como cuando tangencialmente tocan el tema del hampa o del crimen organizado (como sucede, excepcionalmente, en Al borde del peligro).
Hay que reconocer, por otro lado, que el estilo (la manera de ver y de contar) de Otto Preminger parece incompatible con el suspense, aunque sea, en cambio, consustancial al misterio, a condición de que termine por disiparse; es evidente, en cambio, que la estructura episódico-ambulante del cine negro se presta como pocas a la presentación sucesiva de multitud de personajes que se encuentran y desencuentran constantemente, y no precisamente por azar, sino por causas casi siempre racionales y deliberadas (véanse las idas y venidas de Dana Andrews en la noche de autos que ocupa buena parte del metraje de Where The Sidewalk Ends), y al ejercicio de desvelamiento de las apariencias —casi siempre muy engañosas— al que ha sido tan aficionado este cineasta, empeñado como Hitchcock o Lang (cada cual a su modo) en demostrar que las cosas y las personas no son como parecen, y que todo el mundo —hasta los de aire más inofensivo e inocente— guarda o disimula algún secreto.
Obras maestras de una concepción sumamente original (sin precedentes e inigualada) del relato cinematográfico ya perfectamente madurada, de un rigor expositivo sólo comparable a su afán de claridad, las películas de Preminger avanzan imparables como un tren en marcha desde el momento mismo de su arranque hasta el de su clausura, habitualmente disgregadora o disolvente —recuérdense los finales de Anatomía de un asesinato o Tempestad sobre Washington—, tendencia que alcanza su culminación en el sorprendente y brutal cierre de Angel Face.

"One of the later entries in Tierney's series of portraits of the emotional and psychological costs borne by women whose looks and (surface) pliability draw men seeking a repository for their egos, fears and unacknowledged desires. She's as incisive as usual---most of her best roles require her to be simultaneously reserved and achingly vulnerable, in movies that fixate on her beauty while requiring her to interrogate and push back against that very fixation in order for the movie to work, and Tierney maneuvers adroitly through those tensions each time.
Whirlpool isn't quite at the same level as the more celebrated films in this group, including the other Tierney-Preminger teamings, partly because the script pounds home, via a big dose of prime but muddled post-war Hollywood Freud, themes and ideas that are delineated less obviously in Laura, Leave Her To Heaven, etc. And as Gene's psychologist husband, Richard Conte can't hit the depth of characterization or comfort with dark psychic corners that a Dana Andrews brings to the party. (José Ferrer's fun as a duplicitous hypnotist, but things might have come off more vividly if he'd played the spouse.)
Still, it's solidly entertaining, Preminger's taut direction bridges over some of the implausibilities, and there are expert supporting turns by Charles Bickford, Barbara O'Neill and the wonderfully flamboyant Constance Collier.",3.5

Oh my soul, what a stressful film! Gene Tierney’s performance was magnificent and demonstrated her immense skill as an actress.

"Psicoanálisis contra hipnosis en una historia de culpabilidad burguesa. Marx contra Freud en un sentido mucho más profundo que El último tango en París.

En Laura había un cuadro también como pieza central del enigma y aquella película acababa con un disparo desesperado sobre un reloj. Aquí es el penúltimo en el que vemos no un cuadro, sino un disco analógico hecho pedazos por el impacto de una bala.

"I thought that maybe I broke through my struggles with film noir with Nightmare Alley. Whirlpool was mentioned in one of the featurettes on the Criterion disc and it sounded like something I might go for. I did not, although it does make a good pairing with Nightmare Alley with those analyst sessions recorded on vinyl.
Let's see how many things I can find that would only be found in late 40s, early 50s Here we get the story of Ann (Gene Tierney), wife of a successful psychiatrist, but secretly, she is a kleptomaniac due to some repressed childhood father issues (oy vey). After she is caught stealing some jewelry by the store detective (what a job), it looks like she is in some deep trouble. Luckily for her, she is saved by David Korvo (Jose Ferrer), a man who only seems to want to help Ann, but, of course, he has some mysterious intentions involving hypnosis (of course). After Ann is accused of murder, it's up to her husband and detectives to get to the bottom of what is truly happening.
So many eye-rolling moments for me here. Not only do we get the old hypnosis trick, but we get self-hypnosis as well. Ferrer tries his best to save the day, but I really began to lose interest in the film once the hypnosis-murder plot took over the story.
But it looks like others like this one much more than me, so, as always, you should seek this one out if it sounds like it is up your (nightmare) alley I suppose. I didn't see where it was streaming anywhere; I found a copy at my local library. I'm always surprised about the vastness of my library's DVD collection.",2.5
"To Preminger, the most notable director of faces since Griffith, a genre as internal, as psychological as film noir could only have appeared as the fertile soil capable of producing that auspicious moment to aid in his escape from the clutches of Darryl Zanuck. He made five noirs over the ten-year period, from 1944 to 1953, forming a series of films defined as much by the expressive potential of Gene Tierney's face as they are Dana Andrews' wracked guilty conscience. Within this twilight world, these fraught faces occupy a moral discourse layered like an onion, but perhaps also a kind of physics—of bodies placed under tension and bouncing off one another. It is between these two extremes, the moral gaze and an amoral physics, that the best of Preminger's noir work plays out. In this sense, his perspective is that of a lawyer: a camera that interrogates characters' subjectivities, their actions folded in space to form the central mystery (the court case), the ultimate goal thus being to establish the 'real' course of events. But what always colours these state of affairs is the ""web of connections, an architecture of relations,"" in Rivette's words, that the defendant finds themselves ensnared within. Whirlpool and Where the Sidewalk Ends themselves create a diptych within the larger series by the manner in which Gene Tierney in the former and Dana Andrews the latter situate opposite sides of their respective crimes. Preminger's opening statement—""power determines guilt!""—casts the shadow of dusk over the proceedings. Tierney in Whirlpool finds herself unknowingly manipulated by hypnotist José Ferrer into being blamed for a murder that he committed; Andrews, the violent cop, kills a suspect and unwittingly frames an innocent man who can be placed at the scene of the crime. These power relations comprise the web, the architecture, that Preminger's directorial perspective animates with such affecting visual ideas as the powerlessness expressed in somnambulant Tierney or Ferrer's self-hypnotism and the absolute power his gaze, lit up in the mirror, contains. The high valence of these visual ideas brings us to the core of Preminger's early cinema, which is his genius as a designer of mise en scène understood and formulated as an instrument for such expression.",4.5
"Viewed on TCM
In Whirlpool (1950), Gene Tierney plays Mrs. Ann Sutton, the wife of Dr. Willam Sutton a revered Doctor of Psychiatry, played by Richard Conte.
We meet Ann when she is stopped by the department store security for shoplifting. During her interrogation, she is helped by David Korvo, a noted hypnotist, played by José Ferrer.
Feeling she is unable to seek help from her husband for her compulsion to steal, David Korvo offers his hypnotic services.
When Mrs. Ann Sutton is falsely accused of murder, who will believe her?
Whirlpool (1950) is not a perfect film, but José Ferrer's performance as the sinister David Korvo is very worth your time.",3.5

Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), the kleptomaniac wife of a distinguished psychoanalyst, is caught shoplifting at a department store.

Soon after, Ann is contacted by Korvo again, so she's sure he wants to blackmail her - but he isn't asking for money ...
Whirlpool is a film noir directed by Otto Preminger, based on the novel Methinks the Lady... by Guy Endore.
This movie reunited Preminger with his leading lady from Laura (my review), Gene Tierney. And Tierney is great as a devoted wife with deeply seated problems, expertly navigating between keeping up a perfect façade and hiding her vulnerabilities. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with José Ferrer delivering an outstanding performance as the smooth, smug, cold, charismatic and calculating David Korvo.
Whirlpool's very well filmed, and its story is meticulously crafted, the script smart and the central mystery strong, despite some plot holes. Unfortunately, it also moves somewhat slow and lacks tension in its second act, and its subject matter could've been explored in a more compelling way.
However, Whirlpool still makes for a great film noir, thanks to a very good script, and, especially, its cast.
And here's my ranking of Gene Tierney's films.",3.5

"Whirlpool is a difficult film that should not be handled by every Tom, Dick and Harry: cold and enigmatic, without subject or psychology, with no realistic basis other than the beauty and truth of the characters’ expressions and movements. When you come so close to the evidence of cinematographic essence, you risk getting burned. Commercial failure, loss of inspiration, even madness, lie in store for the purist filmmaker or critic.
– Luc Moullet
If Deleuze was right that Hume's great contribution was the notion that relations are external to their terms, then Preminger is an even more extreme empiricist than Hume -- not just relations, but terms themselves are external to their terms. An exercise to show this: Preminger prefers reframing a master to analysis by cutting (you would too if you were this good at it), but when he uses shot-reverse shot, pay attention to how that dyad is altered over the course of a scene by the blocking of the actors in the master. In this film in which even less is resolved than in the fake resolutions of most noirs, irresolution is a science based on the rigour of form.
Which all amounts to a psychoanalytic critique of bourgeois American ego psychology, before Lacan had even begun holding his seminars. Preminger bent the truth when he called himself a Wiener, but this must have been because he knew that in reality (the reality that is more real than reality, the reality of Preminger films), he was from the city of Sigmund Freud, Arnold Schoenberg and Hans Kelsen.",0.0
"The Fourth Summer of Scam
If I've ever seen a film where a central hypnotism angle wasn't used as a cheap, lazy plot device then I don't remember it.
Whirlpool comes perhaps as close anything I've seen to shaking off that feeling for me, perhaps due in part to having a master like Otto Preminger overseeing it. He doesn't try particularly hard to evade the silliness of it all but what he does correctly is pack this with incident and memorable little moments, as well as a cracking story with plenty of splinters to look out for.
José Ferrer is brilliantly smooth as the hypnotist money grabber, Gene Tierney handles all her character changes superbly, and Richard Conte dials down his usual dominating presence well. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, which seemed like Preminger backed himself into a corner, but this more than filled a viewing hole.",3.5
"A hugely enjoyably if rather outlandish crime drama centred on a beautiful young woman married to an eminent psychiatrist. Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) has managed to keep her kleptomania hidden from husband Bill (Richard Conte) but this secret is threatened when she is apprehended by a store detective. Before further action can be taken, a white knight comes to her aid. Thus begins a liaison that will have dire repercussions.
As Ann, Tierney makes for an excellent blank slate, someone who has everything she needs: a loving spouse and an affluent lifestyle but also a compulsion that she cannot begin to understand. While Conte is interesting casting, I’m not sure he totally convinces as a middle-class shrink; he looks a little uncomfortable in the role. Presumably, Preminger chose the actor – who was better known for playing hoods – as a way of throwing doubt on his character but I never once thought he was anything but on the up and up. The same can’t be said of José Ferrer’s character, however. David Korvo is the fellow who so gallantly helps Ann at the start of the movie. He’s a therapist, too, or at least he claims to be but then again, Ann’s husband never managed to cotton on to her psychological issues, let alone begin to decode them – unlike Korvo, who identifies them immediately and offers to solve them for her.
Anyone that tries to enjoy this film from a perspective of logic and plausibility is embarking on a pretty fruitless task. The storyline is predicated on so many unlikely plot twists that it’s frankly ridiculous. For instance, Ann wears a scarf that has her name embroidered on it, purely so she can be implicated in a crime scene. And Ann’s lack of agency might not be looked on favourably by some. Although it lends itself well to the main narrative imperative it also undermines her ability to stand on her own two feet. And as with many movies of this era, she’s more of an enigma than a real person, and once her malaise becomes clear, there’s a scramble to get to the bottom of it, by others, not by her.
None of this matters because the central conceit is so delightfully audacious and carried out with such utter conviction that it’s hard not to get swept along with it. In any case, I don’t think Preminger is especially interested in water-tight plotting or absolute authenticity. This is entertainment, goddamn it! Whirlpool = melodrama + thriller + gothic horror + malfeasance, elements that Preminger satisfyingly blends – while directing the action and the actors with a devastating simplicity that is almost certainly anything but.",4.0
"100 Films by 18 Directors: Otto Preminger
After a female kleptomaniac falls in with a seedy hypnotist with a reputation for swindling money from female customers, the table is set for disaster. What makes matters even more concerning is that the kleptomaniac's husband is a renowned psychoanalyst who is treating the hypnotist's chief critic. After the critic winds up dead with the kleptomaniac in her home and the hypnotist laid up with gall bladder surgery, things do not look good. The audience knows she is innocent and immediately suspects the sinister hypnotist. But how can it be proven? How can his alibi be overlooked? Did she kill her and make it seem like she did not? Is she not all that innocent? A film noir that hooks you in with this compelling web of a mystery, Whirlpool is a rather unique one due to the hypnotist angle that really spruces up the classic ""possibly innocent person accused of a crime"" trope that so many crime films take. Plus, in the hands of director Otto Preminger, how could it really go awry?
In exploring Preminger's filmography, it is apparent that Whirlpool is deeply his own. So many times, he seems to deal with these characters who are under scrutiny. Films such as Laura, Fallen Angel, Where the Sidewalk Ends, Angel Face, Anatomy of a Murder, and Bunny Lake Is Missing, exemplify this. In particular, Where the Sidewalk Ends and Bunny Lake Is Missing feel similar to Whirlpool. Nonetheless, each time, a crime has occurred. Somebody has been accused of the crime immediately. The likely alternative suspect has an airtight alibi and now, the protagonist or main suspect has to undergo the questioning and skepticism that comes with being the chief suspect of the police. Each time he uses this same setup, however, Preminger adds a twist to it all. Either it is a missing kid who nobody believes exists (so not really a suspect here, but nonetheless, somebody who must be believed), a cop covering up his own crime, a guilty man found innocent, a man trying to evade detection, or more, every film has its twist that makes it unique. Yet, at their core, is a film about somebody fighting for their innocence or for the truth they want to be believed to be accepted. Whether or not they are telling lies or are truly guilty is where the films diverge and where the films become truly fun to watch.
With Whirlpool, this twist comes via the hypnotism. Where are inclined to believe that Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is innocent of murder. Yes, she steals compulsively and lies to her husband William (Richard Conte), but she is no murderer. Or could she be? If David Korvo (Jose Ferrer) is truly a scoundrel, he is the likely suspect but the fact that he is in immense pain in the hospital makes him an unlikely suspect. It is in this intrigue that Preminger creates a film that keeps you guessing, playing with what the audience believes they know, what they believe to be logically possible, and what truly occurred. Though we know she is telling the truth, it is in this gray area about the true limits of hypnosis that the film is able to really mess with expectations and current beliefs.
Furthermore, as the film plays out, Preminger sprinkles in elements from whodunnit novels in how intricate the murder is set-up and the instances that led up to Ann being there. Especially similar to Where the Sidewalk Ends in how the film goes detail-by-detail in exploring every claim made by Ann or David in their defense, the film demonstrates its attention to detail that turns seemingly innocuous or odd moments into crucial ones that cement the fates of the characters. It is a film that, as such, demands attention in how it silently goes about setting up its suspects and revealing what truly went on, before it slowly evaluates all of those moments or brings their true meaning/implication to light.
As with any noir, the films cinemaotgraphy is often quite stylish, but the part that really struck me with Whirlpool is the focus on the eyes. This is especially apparent in the hypnosis scenes as the eyes of Ann and David are the only part of their face that is not shadowed. With the rest of their face shadowed and their eyes given a low-key spotlight, the shot manages to focus the audiences attention right where it matters: the eyes. It takes away the periphery and zones in on this element, namely because it is a scene in which hypnosis occurs. Thus, the eyes are incredibly important to the scene. Furthermore, the films use of shadows is similarly strong, especially in the climax. As the guilty party hides in a corner of a home staring at the investigation going on that it sure to implicate them, they peak around the corner and dip further back into the darkness of the corner to hide themselves from sight. A thrilling scene in its own right, this styling and utilization of the set piece to create additional tension is what cements this film as yet another strong work by Preminger.
What holds back Whirlpool, however, is how it is far less grounded than many other works by Preminger. Not only is the plot a bit too much in regards to its rather insane twists and solution, but the film's finale just gives the film a bit too much in the convenient/contrived department. The protagonists are extremely fortunate in showing up when they do and only doing so in order for them to have an encounter with the guilty party, to the point that the film feels overly plotted and not natural enough in its conclusion. Until this climax and third act, the film remains rather grounded in fact and tries to show some possible limitations of hypnosis (one can only commit acts they would normally commit). However, once we see somebody self-hypnotizing, the aforementioned convenient timing, and the overly melodramatic final encounter, Whirlpool really takes it to another level. No longer as grounded and panicked as it was initially, the film seems to crumble under the need to make its villain pay for their crimes.
In saying that, however, Whirlpool is yet another strong work from Otto Preminger. In line with his typical crime-focused narrative and thematic endeavors, Whirlpool features a strong cast, great intrigue, and terrific visuals. While its ending may be rather lackluster, it is hardly enough to undo what was such a strong film until that point.",3.5
"Cult Movie Challenge 2017: Film Noir Week
Film Noir is one of the few themes where the two challenges I'm doing this year overlap, and I inadvertently picked two films that star Richard Conte - and also possibly two films that aren't exactly the most obvious examples of noir. Whirlpool is a mystery film with a few noir trimmings - partly because Otto Preminger seems intent on reminding the audience of his noir hit Laura by reuniting with Gene Tierney and (somewhat shamelessly) prominently featuring a portrait of a dead woman while her voice plays from beyond the grave.
Sadly the best part of Laura (Vincent Price of COURSE) doesn't return, but Jose Ferrer gives a wonderfully charismatic villain performance here that makes up for his absence. The blurb on the back of the DVD describes him as a ""sinister hypnotist"" which is a phrase that I'd rank highly on the list of ""things that make me want to watch a film"", and he's absolutely worthy of the description. The film isn't ever quite as good when he's not on screen, but it's a solid, well-written story that has a couple of excellent surprises, even if at least one of them stretches belief a little.",3.5
"Gene Tierney plays a beautiful kleptomaniac married to a successful psychoanalyst who appears more vulnerable than she in fact is. She comes under the influence of a calculating and dangerous hypnotist played by Jose Ferrer, who not only wants to fleece her financially but also has a strong desire have her in some weird way where he can win over her husband, whom he seriously resents for his successes and recognition in his work. Aside from his glaring professional and personal inadequacies which he conceals with his smooth delivery, he turns out to be quite dangerous.",4.5
"The concept is stretched out thin through a disproportion story with overdramatic twists and turns, but I appreciate the performances, particularly José Ferrer. The script has some very odd and imprudent sentiments towards mental health and morality. Despite all this, I love how the camera is used deceptively as if the cameraman himself is misleading the audience for the sake of a red herring. This sort of experimentation with perspective is a small stroke of genius and really fits the mold of the noir genre. Too bad the 'hypnosis' hook is so damn weak, but the upside is that there's no obvious culprit and will leave you guessing until the end.",2.5
"Os filmes de Preminger, como todos os filmes interessantes, mostram que o cinema é um meio exclusivamente narrativo. A liberdade, a invenção, para um cineasta, não consiste em questionar essa estrutura narrativa nem em querer libertar-se dela, mas em tê-la esquecido depois de a ter aceito. É precisamente por ser, como já foi dito e repetido, a arte do tempo e a arte do espaço que o cinema não pode ter qualquer liberdade face ao tempo e face ao espaço. Uma boa história, como vimos, é a que melhor leva em conta o tempo e o espaço. Nesse sentido, toda boa história é realista. Os filmes de Preminger também são realistas.
Apologie d’Otto Preminger, par Jacques Lourcelles

Um crítico como Jacques Rivette, representativo do discurso sobre a mise en scène, fará então o elogio da composição cênica de Preminger como sendo “a criação de um complexo preciso de personagens e cenários, uma rede de relações, uma arquitetura de conexões, um complexo animado que parece suspenso no espaço”. Em poucos momentos o elogio é tão justificado quanto na sequência em que a protagonista de A ladra (1946) executa o roubo sob hipnose. Por sua localização na trama e pela forma como é conduzida, a sequência torna-se uma verdadeira alegoria da encenação no cinema. A personagem é hipnotizada e usada como ladra por um criminoso; seus gestos têm a elegância de ações planejadas, mas também o distanciamento sinistro de algo que age não por vontade própria, e sim por forças externas. Se toda encenação resolve-se, em última instância, na presença de alguém perante a câmera, a exploração das intenções secretas ou desconhecidas é possível unicamente neste quadro: é através da superfície que o interior deve ser compreendido. A solução de Preminger é registrar o processo com a abstração dos motivos típica dos sonhos e a atenção à dimensão concreta do espaço que é exigida no palco. Tudo é reduzido a formas simples, com praticamente nenhuma ornamentação no cenário ou nas ações. Movimentos são lentos, ruídos são pontuais. Além da atmosfera insólita, essa moderação cria uma base sobre a qual percebe-se mais intensamente cada perturbação. Sobre as paredes lisas, sombras são projetadas e deslocadas, explorando o volume da cena e amplificando os gestos da atriz. Gene Tierney abre uma porta, desce uma escada, entra num carro, acende uma luz, e todas essas ações, banais na maioria dos filmes, adquirem um magnetismo particular, sendo reenquadradas por uma câmera que evita a todo custo o exibicionismo, e acompanhadas por uma montagem que segue estritamente a divisão arquitetônica da casa. O que se demonstra com isso é que a sucessão de eventos não-dramáticos é capaz de sustentar, por uma observação cuidadosa e pelo controle da angulação e do ritmo, uma progressão quase melódica, e que não sugere a imposição, mas sim a descoberta. A virada final reposiciona o filme num registro mais ligado às convenções do filme policial, mas durante alguns minutos temos a impressão de que encaramos a mise en scène num estado purificado.",5.0
"A bit more ambiguity surrounding the first third would have really pushed this over-the-top. Everyone is very good, José Ferrer standouts as the manipulative and menacing Korvo. I do wish that both he and Tierney weren't sidelined as much in the second half of the story. With her locked up in jail and him confined to a hospital bed, I did feel like the movie sort of stagnated until the conclusion. But Preminger is more than able to sustain suspense and anxiety throughout, and although not one of his top tier film noir, definitely better than most.",3.5
"A manipulação mental é uma monstruosidade. Mas existem outras forças em jogo neste filme de Preminger, a começar pelo desejo de posse, pela avareza, pelo medo de se abrir a quem é confiável. Lembrei de Singularidades de uma Rapariga Loira, de Manoel de Oliveira: ""O que não contas à tua mulher, o que não contas ao teu amigo, contas a um estranho"". Pena que esse estranho é um vilão poderoso interpretado por Jose Ferrer.",4.5

Entretanto, as coisas começam a tomar outros rumos quando Ann rouba um artigo de luxo em uma loja, e acaba sendo confrontada, iria acabar sendo presa se um cara chamado David Korvo, que se identifica como um profissional renomado da hipnose, não estivesse presente para salvar a pele dela.
Mas a pergunta é: essa bondade toda é apenas gentileza de David ou existem outros objetivos por trás dessa atitude? E é justamente dentro desse questionamento que o enredo se sustenta.
Depois de ter sido salva por David, Ann com certeza ficou muito grata pelo o que ele fez, e começaram a se encontrar, pois ele prometeu que iria ajudá-la em questões pessoais como a sua insônia e outras questões psicológicas. O que ela ainda não sabe é que David é um oportunista e que iria se aproveitar dela para conseguir concluir seus planos maquiavélicos.
O filme tem um enredo inteligente, no entanto, confesso que há momentos que não me prenderam tanto assim, mas de um modo geral é um bom filme, com um elenco muito bem escolhido e com boas interpretações. Merece ser conhecido!",3.0
Psychoanalytical mumbo jumbo but quite fun,3.0
"Like most films from the heyday of psychoanalysis and hypnosis themed plots, one's willing suspension of disbelief level needs to be raised, but Whirlpool is a very fine noir melodrama, with a great villainous turn from José Ferrer.",4.0
"Otto Preminger is capable of making ""Advise & Consent"" so I can stick with him; its never a bad film, but they carry low impact a lot of the time; he's kind of nice even when he's being nasty like his hearts not in it; but Ben Hecht and Jose Ferrer make this a good story. Ferrer is a proto-Hannibal Lecter, and this film feels a precursor to many 60s psychothrillers; close enough that it was on Hitchcock's radar? I could imagine it, so perhaps this is the B-movie version. I'm trying not to slight Gene Tierney because she reminds of a kitten and who wants to be nasty to a kitten; she's being asked to carry Marnie-esque weight through the movie. Richard Conte looks uncomfortable in a bow tie but this is Ferrer's show; the last time I saw a psychiatrist this bad was in a James Ellroy psychopath novel; Lloyd Hopkins had an adversary messing with people's minds and getting them to do bad things. It feels like a long film but the villain was unpredictable, charming and forceful; its a good combination. I wasn't surprised that this was Preminger, and the film needed a sick mind in charge....like Hitch.",3.0
"Y Manuel Puig decía algo que siempre me pareció muy productivo y que sin duda lo fue en la construcción de su propia obra. Decía Puig que el inconsciente tiene la estructura de un folletín.(...)
Ricardo Piglia
Lo que quiero decir es que esta película es extraordinaria no a pesar de su trama enrevesada sino por ella misma, porque la precisión de la forma va cerrando una trama que es como una pesadilla. Todo, de alguna manera, es verdad, porque es inverosímil. Es tan verdad como un cuento de hadas. ¡Y entonces llega el momento del hipnotizador ante su espejito! Qué maravilla eso.
Bueno, estaría bien decir más.",5.0
"Preminger é sem dúvida alguma; o diretor que quanto mais eu consumo, mais se torna intraduzível sua forma. Trata-se de um verdadeiro enigma cada um de seus filmes, e não digo enigma em um sentido narrativo de seus mistérios ficcionais, mas um enigma formal: o mesmo enigma que assombrou Jacques Serguine na década de 50 ao ver esta obra nos cinemas e não poder descrever a obra pois dela nada havia descoberto, mas ao mesmo tempo não conseguia esconder que havia sido impelido para película e seu belo secreto. Pensando hoje, chego a uma possível e provavelmente não definitiva hipótese; de que o que há de tão belo no cinema de Preminger não são suas tomadas estendidas que vão até o limite para explorar os cenários e sua personas antes de efetuar o corte, mas sim o que as move: um desejo de registar aqueles corpos de uma maneira em que eles não precisem dizer muita coisa, porque essa câmera que os observa será capaz de expelir ao espectador seus interiores.
Aquele cinema que parece não possuir nada demais, que aparenta ser filmado apenas com um didatismo banal em mente, mas que em suas sutilezas de composição; nos absorve inteiramente para dentro de sua película.",4.0
Leave my girlfriend Gene Tierney alone!,3.0
"A pretty far fetched noir in the broad, mechanical, who-did-what-and-how sense, but really wonderful in the moment-to-moment details between characters. Tense, beautifully photographed. Gene Tierney gives a god-level performance with her eyes and her face, playing a woman whose reality begins slipping away when she’s suspected of murder. She’s dealing with some traumas of her past, some pressures of her present, and her future is being poisoned by an evil fucking pick-up-artist with a penchant for hypnosis (great stuff from Jose Ferrer). Meanwhile, her loving, psychoanalyst husband is struggling to uncover the truth as it plays out on a few different levels. There’s an over-reliance on headline science of the time, but this excels when it’s about a husband and wife learning to actually communicate with each other.",4.0
"Preminger is a king of Entertainment. Sure, it might be pretty shallow entertainment, save for a number of plot holes deep enough to sink the Titanic, but he delivers. Otto brings on the thrills.
Upon release, Whirlpool must have felt quite scandalous. José Ferrer's occult sleazeball character delivers some lines that are so delicious they will still make you snicker. The rest remains eminently watchable noir fare. Preminger gets good performances out of his cast, Gene Tierney being especially impressive.
The weakest link is the script: if Dr. Korvo is supposed to be wickedly smart, how come his plans are so... dumb?",3.5

"i don't know. i don't know what happened. i can't remember anything... i'm dreaming all this!
i actually watched this prior to men but i had so many thoughts about that film that i had to get them out first, i am so sorry gene tierney. this is a better film though! the story is kind of absurd in theory but the graveness with which preminger plays is makes it really effective- a mystery in form that's really not about the mystery (it's so clear to the audience what has happened, and preminger doesn't bother trying to hide it- he wants us to know) but about why the men around her even view such an obvious scenario as a mystery to begin with. that's the point- why don't they listen to her? why does she hide herself so fircely, what is she so afraid of? it isn't literal violence, it certainly isn't murder, but it's danger all the same. she can only be Wife but doesn't know how, and the film quietly questions that cage. ferrer is the standout performance as korvo but tierney's face proves to be remarkable for more than just her astonishing beauty, and preminger demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the limitations of cultural imagination, and a genuine empathy to her wanting for more.",3.5

"To me Whirlpool (1950) was a slow grower, and I question the intensity coming a little too late to make a lasting impression, but there is no denying how great and reliable Gene Tierney was in her role.",3.0
"Mixed feelings about this. It's competently done. If Gene Tierney and Richard Conte are not great, they're adequate. José Ferrer and Charles Bickford are excellent. The plot is a little screwy. There's an interesting feminist subtext though. Ann Sutton's (Gene Tierney) problems stem from being stuck in a paternalistic society where she's expected to be attractive and undemanding. I haven't formally created a list of contemporary 1950s films that are slyly critical of the mid-century middle class American Dream, but I would put Whirlpool on it as well as films like Cause for Alarm and Bigger than Life.
While I keep seeing Whirlpool classed as a film noir, it seems more like a conventional drama--and I tend to be expansive in my definition of noir.",2.5

"Se o estilo de Premminger, tomadas longas de travellings que se aproveitam da organização espacial que contorna seus personagens, implicam necessariamente em uma atenção presente, isto é, sem o desvio de flashbacks ou lapsos temporais (são antes retomados pelos próprios personagens em cena), a hipnose, sendo o apagamento e substituir de uma memória por outra, entra em choque com esse sistema. Pois tudo o que vemos é o presente, as suspeitas de que Ann é uma criminosa não existem por parte do espectador, a hipnose é mostrada logo de início, todo plano de Korvo é apresentado em tela. Se no final Korvo colapsa ao usar desmedidamente a hipnose em si mesmo é resultado do desenrolar natural do filme.",4.0
"The kleptomaniacal society wife of a psychoanalyst falls into the clutches of a scheming hypnotist when she is caught shoplifting and is manipulated into being framed for the murder of his prior target who was planning to expose his crimes. This semi-noir film is interesting for the first half while the always lovely Gene Tierney is under the hypnotic haze of Jose Ferrer. There's plenty of psychobabble in the Freudian vein as to the root causes of her unhappiness and desire to take things to fill the emptiness within. But things start to fall apart after she is framed for murder and her husband, who is somehow allowed to partake in the homicide investigation, rushes about piecing the puzzle together for the lazy detective who is ready to accept things at face value. It all leads to a silly and unsatisfactory happy ending that feels rushed and tampered with by the pious morality policing of the Hays Production Code. Ultimately, this doesn't feel like an essential entry in anyone's filmography, but it's diverting enough.",3.5
"Otto Preminger's Whirlpool made its first mistake by centering on a truly preposterous idea: a villain who hypnotizes women into committing crimes for him. Maybe in the realm of horror such a story would work, but certainly not in the hard-boiled arena of film noir. Whirlpool's second mistake was that it unsuccessfully attempted to blend melodrama into a crime thriller. So not only does the audience have to deal with an unbelievable story, it has to contend with sub-par storytelling. I expected more from Preminger, honestly. But Whirlpool is a disappointment through and through. The one stand-out part of this film is José Ferrer as the hypnotist David Korvo. He is a delightfully smug bastard who knows that he's smarter than everyone else around him. He is a plotter, a schemer, a manipulator who knows how to cover all his bases. And that's another reason why Whirlpool fails: in the last scene Korvo stupidly confronts the heroes with a gun. For such a genius mastermind, this scene completely betrays his character and feels insulting towards the audience. This film isn't just a misfire. It's a complete disaster.",2.5

"Jose Ferrer looks and behaves like an Iago – perhaps Iago also had the ability to hypnotise. He self-destructs like Iago as well, too clever for his own good. In any case, Colombo would have sorted him out in the first five minutes. Like Spellbound this study in perverse psychology seems quaint now, but it’s done with such style that it’s hard not to get caught up in it.",3.0
"Another banger Preminger noir. Gene Tierney is so excellent, confused and beautiful and so unsure of everything that happens. Finney is a bit weak as a villain, but the story beats are well perfect. Preminger knows the to shoot a fucking film.",4.0
"Adapted from the 1946 novel Methinks the Lady... by Guy Endore the film deals with shoplifting, insomnia, hypnotism and murder. Although there are some questionable and at times unconvincing parts to this thriller I found it entertaining with good performances from a strong cast, including Gene Tierney and Jose Ferrer. Well-directed by Otto Preminger.

"Preminger stays close to medium shot, wide shot, etc. for a bulk of the film but then he surprises viewers with a few dizzyingly disconcerting experiments in depth perception changes & paranoid close-ups.
In the film, Gene Tierney learns the hard way what every teenage girl knows: you should never trust a strange man you meet at the mall. And this is especially true when it's Jose Ferrer saying creepy things like ""your soul can undress in front of me,"" and ""I can make you sleep,"" just shortly after they've met.",3.5
"Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is the wife of prominent psychoanalyst Dr. William Sutton (Richard Conte), and she has a problem that not even he knows about; she's a kleptomaniac. (or kleptominerac, as Barney Fife says it) After stealing a brooch, she's brought into the store's office for questioning. In sweeps Dr. David Corvo (Jose Ferrer), whom the manager knows, coming to her defense. He slickly gets her out of her jam, which gives him the opportunity for what he was really after; blackmail. Corvo forces her to get to know him, during which time he offers to cure her by hypnosis. But really, it's just another part of his evil scheming.
I thought this was pretty good, with an interesting story and good performances (also including Charles Bickford as the policeman investigating the case, who spends more time with Conte than anyone), with Ferrer being the standout. I liked the confident swindler type he played here, and I'm sure he enjoyed the variety of scenes and situations his character was in. Barbara O'Neil was also good as a character who wasn't on screen for long, but was pivotal to the story.
Other than running a wee bit longer than it probably needed to, this was good stuff!",3.5
"Otto Preminger is either a great director or a hack, depending upon who's judging him. Best known to many as Mr. Freeze in the television Batman, Preminger ended his career with a long string of flops. He was unfortunate in having directed his greatest film, Laura, early on, but that romantic melodrama is hardly his only good film. In fact, Fallen Angel, Angel Face, and Anatomy of a Murder are almost just as good. When Preminger strayed away from crime, as with costume dramas like Forever Amber and Saint Joan, his usual command eluded him.
Whirlpool does not represent Preminger at his best. It often titters on the edge of silliness, but it finally satisfies, primarily because of a terrific performance by Jose Ferrer. The film opens as Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is nabbed for stealing a piece of jewelry from a ritzy Los Angeles department store. David Korvo (Ferrer) gets her out of the spot by revealing she is the wife of a distinguished psychiatrist (Richard Conte) and has an account with the store. When Korvo arranges to meet Ann for lunch later, she naturally assumes he is a blackmailer and writes a check for $5000, only for him to tear it up.
Korvo, you see, is just a kind soul who wants to help Ann overcome her kleptomania and insomnia. Although he calls himself a doctor, Korvo is a con man who uses hypnotism and astrology to wheedle his way into the beds and pocketbooks of wealthy, susceptible women. My kind of guy. Theresa Randolph (Barbara O'Neil), a former patient/lover/victim tries to warn Ann, but she trusts Korvo. When Ann rejects his romantic overtures, Korvo frames her (with the help of hypnosis) for Theresa's murder.
Sleepwalking into Randolph's house, Ann is caught near the body by security guards. And where is good old Korvo, you ask. The clever boy is undergoing a gall-bladder operation at the time of the murder. I repeat: my kind of guy. But Lt. Colton (Charles Bickford) is sympathetic to Ann's plight, and he and the shaken Dr. Sutton set out to prove Korvo is framing Ann despite his ironclad alibi.
Pauline Kael once called Whirlpool ""a real stinker,"" but the film's loopy, baroque plot -- with several significant gaps in logic -- makes it fun. Otto knows how to pace the film, frame his shots, and move the camera when necessary, as with a dreamy swoop during Ann's sleepwalk.
The miscast Conte is stiff and unbelievable as a psychiatrist, but the often pompous Bickford gives a sensitive performance as the cop whose beloved wife recently died. With her breathy, upper-crust voice, Tierney is a limited actress who nevertheless managed to be more than adequate in seven or eight films, including Laura. Her vulnerability, which later manifested itself as mental illness, is appropriate for conveying Ann's confusion.
Ferrer steals the movie as a slimier variation on Clifton Webb's wonderful Waldo Lydecker from Laura. The best of Ferrer's many fine moments comes when Ann refuses to hold Korvo's hand during hypnosis and he progresses from disappointment to self-disgust to anger in seconds.
Ferrer's reputation has dimmed since the 1950s, in part because he never appeared in a film considered a true classic other than the magnificent Lawrence of Arabia. Yet he always gives good performances and appeared in several watchable films. I highly recommend Mike Peros's biography, which reveals Ferrer as a complex, fascinating man.
While I agree with Fran Lebowitz that there is no such thing as a guilty pleasure because there is no reason to feel guilty about something pleasurable, if guilty pleasures did exit, Whirlpool would be at the top of my list.

"Une partie de l’équipe de Laura (1944) se réunit et essaie de se surpasser, mais ils essaient bien trop fort. L’énigme est fastidieuse, la drive encombrée et la gimmick de l’hypnose (cue eyeroll) très difficile à apprécier. La musique est toutefois somptueuse et certaines scènes, notamment la scène centrale du crime — aussi gothique que moderne —, sont envoûtantes.",3.5
"A potpourri of toxicity served up by a mesmeric José Ferrer, entrapping a kleptomaniac socialite in a somnambulistic nightmare of murder & deception. Themes of hypnotism& persecution may have been better served by Fritz Lang, but Preminger's no slouch, creating a slow-burning intensity that reaches a head in the thrilling final scenes. Not as daring in its camerawork as Fallen Angel, but more consistent & compelling.",5.0

"Otto Preminger's Whirlpool is a superior film noir that has a great cast, truly gorgeous cinematography, entertains throughout and is beautifully played and directed, all of which almost (but not quite) makes up for it's ludicrous hypnosis plot. José Ferrer, in one of his first screen roles, is deliciously smarmy and evil as astrologer/ hypnotist (never trust those involved in pseudoscience) David Korvo, pulling doctor's wife Gene Tierney into the vortex of his schemes, as he tries to frame her and at the same time cover his own tracks. However although I found it possible to suspend my disbelief for most of the film, the ending lets it down, being just too far over the top while ultimately still being fairly unsatisfying. The film is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's Spellbound (which itself has many of the same problems) although some of the convolutions of the plot wouldn't be out of place in an episode of Scooby-Doo.",4.0
"The direction is so tight and the mood so well-controled that I can look over some of the more convoluted plot-points and just take this at its word. Performances are all top-tier, especially Jose Ferrer. I feel like the hypnotism angles would've worked a little better for me if Val Lewton had been involved in some way. Still, this is quality in its depiction of lingering marital issues being brought out against a climate of extreme skepticism of the inherent benefits psychoanalysis.

INSUBSTANTIAL MEMORY REVIEW #6
NON CANONICAL DISCOVERY ALERT! One of the most fascinating script structures I've ever encounterd. A marital diptych. First *deranged* half follows mentally ill wife as she gets herself framed for murder. Second *methodical* half follows the hyper rational husband as he puts together the pieces. Portrait of a marriage fractured through a procedural. One or two dumb contrivances, and you gotta be down for a totally absurd sci-fi deployment of hypnotism-as-plot-device, but truly Ben Hecht wuz god. Makes a weird double with Kramer vs Kramer.",4.0
"Wow. Perhaps topped Laura as my favorite Preminger thus far. The noirs he did with Gene Tierney for Fox have such beautiful sets. Fitting because they're partly high society dramas as opposed to Preminger's more blue collar Angel Face and Fallen Angel. But they're just as dark. In Preminger's world the homes of the wealthy house ugly men who are bitter and jaded about that fact. Men who are also ugly on the inside and need attention so bad that they will play god when they don't get things exactly the way they want them. I have so many thoughts that I genuinely can't even explore them eloquently yet. I think I just love watching these legendary writers tackle stories with characters whose only ambition seems to be more happiness, doubly so when they can't seem to tell what that they actually want, other than ""more."" Perhaps my favorite part of noir is all the pimps hiding in plain sight, whether literal pimps pretending to be people's boyfriends and ex-husbands, or guys like Jose Ferrer's character here, who are so morally and spiritually bankrupt that they pimp themselves out for a little bit more, wasting a perfectly good chance at life in the process. And while I enjoyed Jose Ferrer's performance I would've loved to see someone like Tyrone Power get to take the part on, and attempt a more evil look at the sort of conniving con man he played in Nightmare Alley. There's a lightness and charm to his performances, whether it's sincere or not, and I feel like that sort of thing would have taken the Ferrer part here to another level. There's also something more twisted about someone as good looking and charming as Power throwing those gifts away to manipulate and abuse people. Perhaps I'm just getting a little tired of watching these old stuffed shirts. If I'm going to be watching someone be evil, couldn't they at least be charming? My only other nitpick here is that it perhaps goes a little broad in its use of hypnosis as a plot device, when they could've gone deeper had they used a womanizers charm instead of hypnotherapy. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. And all the thoughts about selling out in the most morally destitute of ways I had during. There's a certain spot that can only be scratched by the seedier film noirs. And another that can only be scratched by the melodramas. And while I can't put together a detailed explanation as to why yet, this one hit both spots. And im sure I'll be back again soon.",4.5
"A primeira cena do roubo e do flagra já imprime tão bem o ritmo que se tem pelo resto do filme. Sempre existe uma quebra do que você acha que vai acontecer, do que você pensa que é importante. A primeira mais notável é a da suposta chantagem que não se concretiza. Existe algo de mais mirabolante em curso. O detalhismo, o olhar muito incisivo sobre objetos, cenários, a forma como a câmera dança acompanhando a movimentação dos atores me lembrou muito algo que poderia ser do Hitchcock, mas de alguma forma, o Preminger me parece um diretor que deixa as coisas mais emocionais e simples. Todo o dilema do marido entre a razão da profissão e o o sentimentalismo da relação marital é algo que denota como ele consegue aliar bem um domínio técnico com a manipulação dramática das cenas. É de cair o queixo ver o vilão se auto hipnotizar para continuar a fazer o mal e vê-lo sucumbindo tendo ao fundo a voz gravada de sua vítima. Dessas coisas que chegam a impactar mais que a beleza monumental de Gene Tierney, o que não é mesmo pouco.",4.5

"Interesting premise. I wish there wasn’t constant music throughout, dictating how I was supposed to feel. I like deciding for myself thank you very much!",3.0
"I know I reference blocking too much, but I get immense pleasure out of watching a movie whose director excels at not only positioning the actors to compose a compelling image, but also to build the visual subtext of their relationships to each other and progress the story they're telling. Otto Preminger (abusive bastard that he was) with his ""objective"" approach was a supreme master of this - he had to, with all those medium and long dolly shots in lieu of relying on editing. Visually almost all of his pictures are just a delight, and Whirlpool is no exception. That in this case the wanna-be Hitchockian mystery is borderline ludicrous prevents it from being a ""good"" movie (the miscasting of Richard Conte doesn't help), but did I still enjoy it? Very much so.

"There's a real gem hiding in there, I just wish they would have brought it out. The whole premise is terrific material for an enjoyable noir, but they do not fully utilize its power. The main issue is the writing, I guess. They made everything follow orders. When a person has a chance to simply speak up and say something that would help, they don't. When we need a husband to be angry and vindictive, he'll be that, even though it doesn't fit his character at all. It is a movie where the story is more important than the characters. Which is the case with most noirs, true, but you always secretly hope to find another one that goes the extra mile. Whirlpool did not go that extra mile, but it is a movie that undoubtedly understands and respects the genre. I enjoyed it very much and I would most certainly want to see this again someday.

"Far from the greatness of Laura, though reminiscent of it.
It tries to have this psychological dimension more grounded, in a web of suggestions that has Gene Tierney at its core again, and that eventually hits a dramatic and thematic peak in front of the portrait.
It's interesting that MacMahonism kinda rejects the obvious framing of the portrait, making it some kind of an anti-The Woman In The Window, to a point where Preminger's auteur footprint is reduced to specificities.
There is an underlying darkness lurking in the intents of the villain's actions, but one that Preminger never allows to fully take control of the film. Wish it did, tho.",4.0
"Jose Ferrer is delightfully menacing in this and Gene Tierney is spectacular, of course. I probably would have been more impressed if I believed in hypnotism or if we didn't know what Ferrer was doing to our poor girl and so the did-she-or-didn't-she angle was stronger (since we the audience know what happened the whole can-they-prove-it-or-not angle lacked a lot of tension for me).",3.5
"Has its moments early on, but a plot that quickly turns ridiculous and a stiff formality to the whole thing pretty much ruins it. Plus Richard Conte is essentially wasted in a role that could have been played by almost anyone.",2.5
"Although no large portrait of Gene Tierney is hanging on the wall of Dr. Sutton's house, he, like Waldo (in Laura), praises an image. When Dr. Sutton tries to help Ann, in fact, he is not helping a real person, he is merely trying to save his illusory, perfect image of Ann, just as Waldo tries to establish his own version of Laura as the most ideal and original one.
Anything can violate the image, so it must be properly protected from being distorted. Any possible sign of expression, desire, or anger is enough to be interpreted as autonomy. This is the greatest threat to the creator of the image because an individual cannot live as part of another person, only a fabricated image can exist as an extension of its creator.
To prove their power and subjectivity, Dr. Sutton and Waldo need to keep Ann/Laura as an image and the ending of the ""Whirlpool"" illustrates this point. In this film, the police release the woman by handing her over to the husband, which seems to be a happy ending is actually exposing and ironic. Ann had already found her voice and managed to tell her story, she does not see herself as an image and showed she is a ""self"", even if she has to play the role of being an image, but to guarantee the husband's false power and control and to observe the patriarchal order, the authority returns the wife to her place; in her husband's arms, but with all that we have seen, who can say she will stay there forever?",4.5
"Gene Tierney, I loooveee yoouuu dearly ta-tapi Whirlpool rada keterlaluan gullible.

"Noir #5 of 14
When I hear the name of Otto Preminger, I do not automatically think film noir, but this 1949 film sits squarely in that genre. Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt adapted the screenplay from a novel, Methinks the Lady, by Guy Endore, but following statements Hecht had made at the time about the UK's involvement in Israel, UK prints of the film credited him under the pseudonym Lester Barstow.
We first meet Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), the wife of psychoanalyst Dr. William Sutton (Richard Conte), when she is stopped by a store detective for shoplifting. Smarmy society hypnotist David Korvo (José Ferrer), sees this happening, recognises Ann, whom he has never met, and intervenes to prevent the police being called.
Korvo pressures Ann into seeing him for treatment for her kleptomania and, at a society party she attends with him, she has words with one of his ex-patients and ex-affairs, Theresa Randolph (Barbara O'Neil), who is now a patient of her husband's and who warns her that Korvo is only after her money. Theresa ends up murdered and when the police arrive, following an anonymous tip off, Ann is there, cannot remember what has happened, and has several key factors that point to her guilt.
While there are strong elements of melodrama in the film, the plot thread that involves hypnosis and its effects on the subconscious make this a more interesting film than other romantic melodramas of the time. Preminger has enough skill as a director to distract you from some of the more implausible plot twists and manages to generate good tension and suspense as the story moves into its third act - though I never really expected to see Ann in a straight jacket in an asylum or headed off to the electric chair.
The film contains some classic noir elements - there are several shots of eyes in a mirror, Ann's night-time drive to Theresa's house under the influence of Korvo's hypnosis is shot from jarring angles and the exterior and interior shots involve classic noir use of light and shadow, and thoughout the film the characters' shadows on walls give a hint as to what is going on emotionally, from gentle shadows to stark expressionist shadows on white backgrounds.
This is not one of the greats but it is a very interesting use of hypnosis, psychoanalysis and repressed memories in a noir context.",3.5
"#NOIRVEMBER 2
some very good lighting in Whirlpool particularly when it touches on Gene Tierney's well-sculpted face and gleaming eyes. largely focusing on a person's state of consciousness through hypnosis and psychoanalysis, it is not surprising that a case of trauma, mental disorder, and childhood/daddy issues propel the story forward. it builds up rather well and the mystery behind the characters' intentions is subtle yet heavy. unfortunately, the last few minutes seem too eager to wrap itself up that it has become quite ridiculous and unbelievable.",3.0

Não é preciso ir muito além para obter tal percepção, pois se fosse analisar sua história imaginando ser moldada por outra forma, o resultado final sem dúvidas não seria agradável.
O macmahonismo opera agressivamente. A grandiosidade do trabalho se apresenta mais no modo da encenação, do que propriamente no conteúdo isoladamente.
Grande exemplo é como a presença de Anne é mostrada. Há toda articulação unificada que encanta os olhos de forma transparente. O modo como a atriz olha de baixo para acima algumas figuras, transmitindo a sensação dela ser uma mulher frágil, singela e de pureza total, e tal sensação sendo fortificada pelo tamanho dos olhos da atriz. Seu caminhar sutil e que soa calculado também é uma característica de uma pessoa frágil, com medo do que possa acontecer.
E o belo se encontra na dualidade das sensações extraídas de sua atuação. Além de todas sensações ditas acima, quando a personagem se mostra mais decidida, trabalha a postura de modo mais convincente e ergue mais o queixo, assim transmitindo mix de sensações que inevitavelmente são pontuáveis.
É incrível ver o trabalho da câmera ao abordar a figura de Anne. Cenas que poderiam ser ridículas, como quando a personagem está hipnotizada, são de um encantamento maravilhoso. A sutileza da decupagem nos amarra na obra de maneira singela, pois adora mostar todos os detalhes da fisionomia da atriz, desse modo nos fascinando com pequenas coisas.
Não só isso em relação à decupagem, também há grande qualidade ao registrar os personagens se portando em seus respectivos espaços naquele momento. A câmera não gosta de chamar atenção nesses momentos, no entanto, isso nao é algo que não é potente, pois são empregados movimentos complexos, e ao mesmo tempo simples (até algo paradoxal do macmahonismo). Mantém a elegância e ""praticidade"", e mesmo assim não dissipa o virtuosismo.",4.0
"The Long Noirvember - 20/30
Whirlpool keeps a steady pace for the majority of its runtime and while it doesn't develop its story in a stand-out manner, the performances by the cast are good enough to be engaged. It's a very familiar setting all around that doesn't try to break the mold by any means, it works with what it has, and limits itself to a standard noir film.",3.0

The Long Noirvember 2023 #48/52 (Spot #30)
Movies about hypnosis are often a hard sell in the believability department, so it always surprises me how often Hollywood during this era seemed to dip into that subject matter for a starting point for stories. Perhaps there was some sort of greater cultural fascination with the topic at the time that drove studios to rely on the practice; but, whatever the case, it always cracks me up when I see it make its way into a movie from this period. We actually don't get to that part of the story for a while, as it starts out with the wife a well-respected doctor, Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), finding herself in trouble for shoplifting. Ann's husband, Bill Sutton (Richard Conte), is a psychoanalyst, but it is the mysterious David Korvo (José Ferrer) who manages to get Ann out of trouble. Korvo tells Ann he can help heal her of her kleptomania, but we later learn that he may actually be hypnotizing her for nefarious purposes. When Ann suddenly finds herself the primary suspect in the death of a woman named Terry Randolph (Barbara O’Neil), who was a patient of her husband's and a former lover of Korvo's, Bill has to find a way to clear her name in spite of the evidence against her - not to mention Korvo's ironclad alibi.
I actually think that director Otto Preminger does a fine job of directing this movie, it's just maybe not the most interesting screenplay that Ben Hecht ever wrote (though, to be fair, he wrote some absolute masterpieces). Unless you really buy into the whole hypnosis aspect, there is a lot less here to really hold onto. Or rather, perhaps the bigger issue is just that it takes the characters most of the movie to really figure out that Korvo is using hypnosis to achieve his ends. The viewer has the benefit of knowing what is going on, but Bill and the detective looking into Ann, Lieutenant James Colton (Charles Bickford), are basically stuck looking at the facts a different way. This mostly leads to Ann being gaslighted, to a degree, which doesn't get explored as well as it could. All that being said, the performances are solid all-around. Conte and Tierney are both excellent together, and Bickford provides a nice calming presence as the detective trying to sort it all out. But Ferrer might be the highlight, especially towards the end as he gets more and more desperate when his plan starts to unravel. And the always excellent Arthur C. Miller makes it a visual treat as well, shooting it all quite gorgeously.",3.5
"Noir favourites
Whirlpool was quite a surprise for us - it never features very highly on the Noir best-of lists, but it was a nice surprise to find it better than average.
This was firstly because they created a pretty unique, memorable character in Dr Korvo, an astrologist/hypnotist.
Secondly Gene Tierney had a pretty tough role to play as the manipulated and later hypnotised lead, without coming across as either helpless or stupid. She did a great job, her character starts as assertive but gradually doubts herself as time goes on. She played it well, with subtle facial movements indicating his control.
Lastly I had no idea how the mystery would resolve, and that's always good. Recommended.",4.0
"I feel like this has an obvious plothole: how does José Ferrer know to blackmail Gene Tierney to begin with? He just happens to materialize after she gets caught shoplifting. So somehow he had to know she was a shoplifter and follow her around until she got caught, or he got unbelievably lucky and happened to recognize the wife of the therapist of the woman he stole from and somehow hatched this plot on the spot. It’s a pretty preposterous story either way.
The ending is dumb too. Why are the recordings in the murder house when Tierney could have disposed of them anywhere? Why did Ferrer order her to leave them there where the police could have found them? Why does he go there to get them when he had a perfect alibi, recordings or no?
I really hated Richard Conte after his big confrontation with Tierney halfway through where he treated her like dirt. It made it hard to care about him as a hero or his reconciliation with Tierney.
So this didn’t really hang together for me once the plot got rolling. Tierney and Ferrer are good, though.",3.0
"Ainda que o foco seja muito mais no drama em si, e como esse é articulado entre os agentes (o policial, Dr William, a Ann, o Dr. Korvo...), é interessante ver esse embate sobre a ciência, isso é, como o Korvo a usa de forma desmedida e imoral, em contrário ao marido que defende o oposto.
O final é um pouco apressado e menos sensível do que todo o resto do longa, da a impressão que faltou alguns minutos ou um melhor modo, para encerrar o filme, mas não compromete a obra.",4.5
"A little drawn out, and whilst it contains some excellent acting (particularly from Tierney and Ferrer), it tends to be one performance impressing at a time, rarely sparring. Still, Whirlpool is a very fine Hecht-penned, Preminger-directed adult noir.
Jose Ferrer, then a broadway star, was in his second film at this point, and I suspect his performance here might have aided his Oscar win later that year in the stage-to-screen titular role of Cyrano de Bergerac. His enunciation and oily seduction is spellbinding, elevating the noir form, a superstar-in-the-making bullet to the A-list. The often bewildered suspect Tierney in moments gives a stellar performance of her own, whilst her somnambulance is note-perfect.
The convoluted murder frame plot is also appreciably wacky, grooming a kleptomaniac for ancillary and patsy purposes, with a hilariously convenient perfect alibi, driving whilst hypnotised, even high-functioning self-hypnotism! Conte and Bickford are welcome supports as the shrink husband and widower detective (although the latter having a wife who coincidentally died recently in a gall bladder operation felt a bit much).",3.5
"More whiplashing innocence from Preminger.
Tapping fully into the New Age soothsaying that kind of crept into noir novellas and general LA life and, rightfully, scoped it out to be nothing more than insidious manipulation of people seeking a compassed route for their flaws to be exorcised. Ive said it alot recently I feel, but so many of these older films are about the latent gaslighting that comes from modern living. Its a good plot ideology for salacious suspense, but its frightening to see how many variations can still be shaded into existence.
even the ridiculous notion of hypnosis and murder becoming gelled together turns into skin-itching. high society will justify all manners of its vices if theres someone at the end who'll bear the rotten fruits of it.
Wonder if we learned anything from this.",3.5
Weak screenplay about hypnotists fooling psychoanalysts.So let's focus on Gene Tierney and Jose Ferrer and on Preminger's mise-en-scène. Already forgotten if you're not a hardcore fan of the Austrian born director.,2.5
"Gene Tierney being told to not cry by her husband (Richard Conte), as she holds back tears behind a false hope, is some peak film noir acting I must say. 
What begins as the setup to a Sirkian melodrama about a kleptomaniac’s (Tierney) save from the nick of time by José Ferrer—looking so much like his son it’s a tad unnerving—becomes an increasingly intense thriller/drama where Ferrer shows his hand as a conniving hypnotist. It’s clear from the first murder offscreen he’s pinning kills on Tierney, but it’s only a matter of time before it’s too late to save her. A Laura reunion for its star and director: the performances Preminger directs here are quite good, even Richard Conte’s. Though he’s another in a long line of Tierney romantic leads coming off a little cold when compared to her immeasurable charisma, his minimalism works in this film’s favor as a big emotional conflict comes from how much he wants Tierney to be proven innocent. Even as all the visible chips are stacked against her. This movie is thrilling, psychological, adulterated, longing and checks all the boxes as to why I love noir so much.",3.5
Gene Tierney is gorgeous and Jose Ferrer is brilliant as the hypnotist swindler. There’s a good bit of style and some very interesting themes but the film was too predictable to really stand out.,3.5
"Nearly almost interesting, except the male lead is incredibly boring. Gene Tierney and José Ferrer are decent though.
I think The Locket from 1946 is infinitely superior.",2.0
"Quando forma e conteúdo estão em perfeita sintonia. Preminger abarca a própria ideia do plot de hipnotismo com a forma, uma dinâmica da encenação que permite uma imersão do espectador sem grandes razões lógicas, onde por vezes tal como as cenas aparentam um poder místico - Ann simplesmente não consegue falar a verdade por conta de uma Hipnose -, o espaço também dialoga diretamente - A sequência onde duas portas se abrem para a entrada do cofre como se desembrulhasse Ann, evidenciando uma metafísica ali. Um filme direto e altamente imersivo.",4.5
"honestly wasn’t sure of what to expect when going into this film, but it’s definitely a great work of both tierney’s and preminger’s. not only do i rlly enjoy noirs and thrillers, but gene’s acting in this was amazing—it still shocks me that she never won an oscar for any of her roles.",4.0
"Ever since I mentioned yesterday that I was gonna watch it I’ve had The Sounds’ “Whirlpool” echoing in my head. I’m walking around singing, “It takes the best of us...”
What I’ve noticed about Preminger is that his flicks play out like stand-alone TV episodes where the twist or the actual plot hook occurs midway. For me, especially in stuff like Bunny and Anatomy, their concepts are way stretched out. He’ll just squeeze the fun out of it. 
Far-fetched plotting but hey, it’s the movies.",3.5
"It’s a well acted and reasonably tightly plotted film with a great cast of characters, but it’s also one severely dated by its subject material. 
A psychiatrist’s wife is caught stealing a brooch at a department store, and rescued by a quack hypnotist who claims he can cure her kleptomania, but really only wants to use her to cover for his own crimes. 
At the time it must have seemed like a banger of a plot, but at this point it feels more like absolute nonsense. Really, you’re going to hypnotize a woman to carry out a complex series of tasks framing herself for a crime that would, at best, only have her arrested on the most circumstantial evidence?
Fun enough, but requires more suspension of disbelief than intended. Best taken with a big grain of salt.",3.0
"""Whirlpool"" não tenta sustentar um mistério que carrega a narrativa. O espectador sabe quem está por trás do crime cometido, e a construção do drama e do suspense é dada justamente pelo modo como Preminger explora essa passividade consciente de quem assiste. Sabemos o que está acontecendo, a solução do caso é confidenciada somente à nós, mas nada podemos fazer, além de observar onde a história chegará.
Na minha opinião, o problema do filme reside em sua parte final. O clímax diverge de toda a trajetória, a conclusão é muito imediata e simplificada. Mas nenhum desfecho que deixa a desejar é capaz de anular a dramatização perfeita e encenação sutilmente poderosa de Otto Preminger.",3.5
"Ann Sutton, die Ehefrau eines Psychoanalytikers, leidet an Kleptomanie. Eines Tages wird sie bei einem Einbruch erwischt, als sie in dem Haus neben einer Frauenleiche stehend aufgefunden wird, weshalb sie unter Mordverdacht steht. Als ihr Mann jedoch erfährt, dass Ann sich in letzter Zeit von einem Hypnotiseur behandeln ließ und auch die Tote eine seiner Patienten war, hält er ihn für schuldig und möchte dies beweisen.
Was die Handlung angeht, muss ich gestehen, dass diese qualitätsmäßig eher im Mittelmaß liegt. Trotzdem hat mich der Film unterhalten und Schwarz-Weiß und Noir passt einfach gut zusammen. Der österreichische Regisseur Otto Preminger war in der Welt dieses Genres ja auch sehr geübt, schließlich drehte er mit ""Laura"" (1944; den ich leider immer noch nicht gesehen habe), ""Faustrecht der Großstadt"" (1950, ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"") sowie ""Der Mann mit dem Goldenen Arm"" (1955, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"") weitere bekannte Film-Noirs. Bevor ich aber mit meinem kleinen Text fertig bin, muss ich noch Gene Tierney erwähnen, die Martin Scorsese zu seinen Lieblingsschauspielerinnen zählt und aus der Sicht vieler eine der schönsten Hollywood-Stars der 1940er-Jahre war. Die Rolle der kranken Frau spielt sie in diesem Film einfach ausgezeichnet!

Ranking: Otto Preminger",3.5
"Interesting concept, bland execution.",3.0
"Probably Preminger's most underrated masterpiece, (nobody seems to like this one), but I think it can take its place up there with ""Laura"", ""Fallen Angel"", ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" and ""Angel Face"". It's only fault really, and it's a big one, is the casting of Richard Conte as a brilliant psychiatrist when the part cried out for Dana Andrews. He's married to Gene Tierney, (who else!), who happens to be a kleptomaniac although for all his brilliance he hasn't figured that out. Unfortunately for her, her kleptomania has been uncovered by nasty and murderous hypnotist Jose Ferrer who uses his knowledge to worm his way into her life in the pretext of curing her.
Both Tierney and Ferrer are superb, good enough in fact to make this one of the best movies dealing with psychiatry to come out of Hollywood at the time. The plot may be a bit hard to swallow but Preminger's handling of it is magnificent and it's got a wonderful, grown-up and intelligent screenplay by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt from a novel by Guy Endore. Perhaps its failure might have been attributed to the miscasting of Conte or on the unlikely, melodramatic plot but it cries out for reassessment and it's an absolutely essential part of the Preminger canon.",5.0
"2019 entry 266:
I guess I am making a movie... cause wow! this is the first flick of October I have watched. What is even happening?
Typically October is my movie watching month.... I love HALLOWEEN. So. It is kinda interesting I watched this movie, cause it is about a lady that is LOSING HER DAMN MIND - this is exactly how I feel right now! Ta da!
Did you know... my birthday is Sunday? I completely forgot literally until yesterday. I am normally the type of person that celebrates my birthday all month long and has a countdown and everything. So this is really a big deal that I forgot.
Anyways - this movie is YES. I think before I crawl in the coffin there is no doubt in my mind that Gene Tierney will go down as one of my favorite actors. She is wonderful in everything I have seen her in. In this flick she plays a kleptomaniac that seeks cares from a Miguel Ferrer's dad - who happens to be a hypnotist/con artist. As I said this is YES.
I bought this film noirrrrr collection - for like eight bucks - I highly recommend. There are like seven movies that come in this set.... not sure how else you would watch this thing, but you should!",3.5
The amount of stress and anxiety this caused me was all so close to how Gaslight made me feel.

"I liked this, though it wasn't quite as twisty as I anticipated it might get halfway through. It could've dwelt more heavily on 'there is no evidence at all of your story, lady', although not doing so might be a sign that the audience is assumed to have a brain and a memory.
I wonder if the woman with the hair was meant to remind people of the Bride of Frankenstein. It was cool hair, either way.
The baddie reminded me so much of the Pusher on the X Files that every time anyone talked to him I wanted to shoo them away and cover their ears. He accidentally makes a very good example of the importance of pain as a helpful though unpleasant biological feedback mechanism.
I saw Othello for week 12 of Film School Dropouts, and it hit me like a ton of bricks that this might've been a super loose adaptation of that. Or it plays like one to me, anyway. I hadn't realized until rewatching Othello that I was expecting the bad guy to be basically Iago, and that's why it was such a surprise that it wasn't twistier, and such a surprise at a non-tragic ending.",0.0
"Otto Preminger noir starring Gene Tierney as a klepto but it's José Ferrer who steals the show as a mega-smug, Columbo-worthy villain. Sharp cinematography and some imaginative direction also highlight. The only major drawback is the beyond improbable premise.",3.5
"Although the plot strains credulity, this is an interesting psychological thriller. If Ben Hecht had taken the time to iron out the plot inconsistencies, this may have been a great movie.",3.5
"Solidny noir, ale po Premingerze oczekuję nieco więcej. Ale ja chyba po prostu nie przepadam za motywami hipnozy w kryminałach, najlepiej użył go Woody Allen w The Curse of Jade Scorpion gdzie wyśmiewał się z takich pomysłów. Nie zmienia to faktu, że jest dobrze nakręcone, ma spoko intrygę i świetną rolę główną. Fajne, ale myślami wracać nie będę",3.5
"This Noir is interesting because the roles of some of the characters are gender reversed. Instead of a Femme Fatale, we have a Male Fatale.

"Who's the shit and looks exactly like his son? Jose Ferrer. This guy was given some killer dialogue to work with, and he worked it like a champion. Some of the lines were so seething I actually had to say ""holy shit"" out loud, and he does it with such cool nonchalance. Gene Tierney is good, but it's hard to get all that excited about a character whose biggest concern is what her husband thinks of her. The story itself is a decent suspense tale involving two old friends, neurosis and hypnosis. And greed, and ego... a trustworthy recipe in the hands of Mr. Preminger.",3.5
"Why I watched this one? Popped up on a YouTube feed.
What is this one about? A woman suffering from kleptomania is hypnotized in an attempt to cure her. Soon afterwards, she's found at the scene of a murder with no memory of how she got there, and seemingly no way to prove her innocence.
My thoughts? Might have been believable back in 1950, but very unbelievable in 2024. Lots of overacting in this movie. Even the always reliable Charles Bickford does not come off very well in this one. First half is ok, second half is pretty bad. Final thought: A classic movie only in the sense that it was made almost 75 years ago.",2.5
"Incredibly contrived but spell-bindingly entertaining right up until a rushed (and largely botched) ending. Tierney is excellent but the star turn here comes from Jose Ferrer with reptilian charm and manner. Charles Bickford also works well as the police lieutenant, with the script giving him more to play than is often the case with this sort of character. Only Richard Conte is weak.",3.5

"If you ever find yourself in the world of film noir then you should be wary of doctors/therapists who take an interest in you while you are not an official patient on their books. You should also be wary of José Ferrer. I knew that Whirlpool would be a film in which Gene Tierney found herself in trouble when she ended up in conversation with a therapist played by José Ferrer.
Tierney plays Ann Sutton, a woman who is married to one Dr. William Sutton (Richard Conte). Although all appears well on the surface, Ann has at least one big problem. She’s a kleptomaniac, which viewers are shown in the very first scenes of the movie. While in trouble with store detectives and management, Ann ends up spared further embarrassment by David Korvo (Ferrer). Korvo recognises the ailment, and offers to help Ann with his hypnotherapy. Before you know it there’s a dead body, Ann as a main suspect, and Korvo evading suspicion with what seems to be a cast-iron alibi.
Based on an original work by Guy Endore, Whirlpool is your typical bit of hokum that uses hypnosis as a central plot point for some twists and tension. The script, written by Ben Hecht (prolific and brilliant) and Andrew Solt (less prolific, but with a couple of greats in his catalogue of work), is easier to digest thanks to the perfectly-judged tone and the performances of the leads.
Director Otto Preminger may have a number of superior films to his credit (including at least one featuring one of the cast members featured here), but that doesn’t make this unworthy of your time. It’s wonderfully entertaining throughout, and some of the conversations are both beautifully written and impeccably delivered.
If I ever see Tierney give a performance that I don’t love them I advise people to check that I am still alive. She is one of my favourite stars of yesteryear, and this is another winning turn from her, moving between moments of confidence and moments of paralyzing neuroses and fear. Ferrer is an absolute charmer for most of the runtime, nice enough to make you think he is a villain while also nice enough to make you think he might just be nice. His line delivery, especially during his first extended conversation with Tierney, is like music to my ears, and I periodically chastise myself when I remember that I haven’t seen enough of his movie performances from this period. Conte plays his part as expected, Charles Bickford is perfectly fine as the sympathetic, slightly bemused, individual investigating the murder, and Barbara O’Neil does well enough as a woman who may be pivotal to revealing the murderous face being hidden behind a mask of civility.
It’s a bit silly, and maybe a bit too lightweight for those wanting their noir more gritty and dark, but Whirlpool is also just great entertainment. It’s a star vehicle, and anyone who appreciates the talents of the leads will find plenty to enjoy here. I know I did.",3.5
"Whirlpool was better than I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be a decent noir that I’d forget about in two days ,but actually, it was good and one that I won’t forget about. 
Gene Tierney is fantastic! I’ve seen in her in a few other films and she’s great in them but, I think she might give her best performance here. Richard Conte and Charles Bickford were also marvellous. I had previously seen Conte in House of Strangers (1949) and thought that he was ok, but maybe I thought someone else could play that role better.  Really underrated noir that I highly recommend checking out.",4.0
"Wikipedia calls this a film noir, but it didn’t seem particularly noir-y to me: Most of the lighting is pretty bright, for one thing.
Gene Tierney is—needless to say—preternaturally beautiful, and quite good here as a seemingly doting, selfless wife who has hidden layers. José Ferrer is equally good as an oily, witty hypnotist. The plot loses its way about halfway through—sort of a Preminger trademark; the much noirier Fallen Angel also has tons of plot elements that rapidly go nowhere—but I was intrigued throughout by the Tierney character.
And that reminded me of Andrew Sarris’s observation about Preminger: “The characters click even as the action falters.” Preminger is famous for his ambiguity, and while the script (cowritten by Ben Hecht) makes Ferrer unambiguously villainous, the direction seems to take Ferrer’s side when he says Tierney is unsatisfied with her marriage.
Stuck somewhere in all this contrived melodrama (with the goofiest alibi I’ve ever seen) is a feminist tale that reminded me of—I kid you not—Kate Chopin’s The Awakening. I felt for Tierney long after I stopped caring about who killed whom.
The character, in other words, clicks even as the action falters.",4.0
"I appreciate it's matter-of-fact usage of psychological terms without too much of the inflection you see in many films of the period which resemble a hard-sell marketing pitch. Ferrer drops them like any half-quack might be expected to do. The entire film eschews high melodrama the vast majority of the time, which is great. The story is primarily a mystery, both the why and the how to limited extents, and it unfolds slowly allowing us the pick things up here and there to both contextualize the story but also to try to figure out what it is we have to figure out. Newman's score is quite wonderful in parts, especially as our villain attempts his last villainy.",3.5

Gene Tierney is great as the conflicted woman at the heart of the central mystery - which escalates quickly from petty shoplifting to murder - but the real reason to catch this is Jose Ferrer's thoroughly loathsome and slimy evil mastermind.

"Week 7. Blacklisted noir.
Without any more information than “blacklisted noir,” I took the definition to mean a film worked on by anyone called to testify before HUAC, and Jose Ferrer fits into that.
This is my second film this week featuring Richard Conte, and while the previous had him as a vicious crime lord, here he has the more sympathetic role of a psychoanalyst whose kleptomaniac wife (Gene Tierney) falls under the spell of a con man played by Ferrer. Promising to help her with her kleptomania, Ferrer hypnotizes Tierney to trick her into showing up at the scene of a murder.
Directed by Otto Preminger with a screenplay by Scarface’s Ben Hecht, Whirlpool is a fine film with strong performances by Tierney and Ferrer. Conte gives a fine performance as well, but after seeing him in “The Big Combo” that same day, this performance doesn’t register as well. That being said, it’s a masterful work as one would expect from Preminger.",4.0
"Flawed but interesting companion piece to Laura as both Preminger films utilise Gene Tierney's allure to examine female objectification. Sadly, her stilted deliver of lines such as ""[I was] locked away in the characterisation of a serene and devoted wife"" indicate she is largely a psychoanalytic idea than a complex human being. The fact it shifts focus away from her to her husband (Richard Conte) and a male police lieutenant (Charles Bickford) to solve the murder case is an amusing but unfortunate irony. Still, José Ferrer as the oily hypnotist and astrologer Dr Korvo is just as deliciously chauvinistic as Clifton Webb's Lydecker. Funniest line: ""Very well, I bow to your abysmal scruples.""",0.0

"The first half is great! Jose Ferrer carries the film with his weird, hypnotic great acting. Gene Tierney's okay, Richard Conte's okay, but the second half of the film just does not live up to the first half. Except the death scene is pretty unusual. Psychoanalysis noir that lands below Spellbound, and somewhere nearer to Secret Beyond the Door. Not bad...just not great. Preminger and co. did better elsewhere. For Preminger, from the same year, check out Where the Sidewalk Ends. For Conte, check out The Big Combo.",3.0
"At least five of Preminger's films from 1944-1953--Laura, Fallen Angel, Daisy Kenyon, Whirlpool, Angel Face--feel like a grand collection of variations on similar themes: women in trouble, suggestion and psychoanalysis, crime, deception, and false accusations, and, most importantly, sexuality and gender dynamics that feel way too mature, way too uncertain, inquisitive, and critical, for the early postwar period. Having seen a lot of 40s and 50s films in the past few months, I feel pretty confident in saying this. Gender politics were much more fluid and progressive in 30s cinema and then seemed to vanish for the most part till the early 60s. Preminger's films demonstrate that this wasn't entirely true, that there was still some space for frank depictions of sexual relationships at this time.",3.5

"Mentally I have the Tierney and Preminger films as one of the great pairings of cinema, so the massive gap between Laura and Whirlpool took me by surprise. It just goes to show the quality of these films make them seem so large.
Whirlpool in particular is so amazing it stands as perhaps the greatest noir of all time and surely the greatest bit of proto-giallo piece of studio surrealism ever. The strength of every element and every person is proven by the mere fact that the movie succeeds despite hardly making a lick of sense and having its main narrative concern be delusion. The real world doesn’t matter as this is entirely above it wherein the naked feeling of experience dictates everything. I almost wish to just post every frame of the film as it does it’s own work of arguing it’s worth more than all the words any human could ever write.",4.0
"It’s not all that good, but the Langian overtones in Jose Ferrer’s super criminal hypnotist give it a boost. Gene Tierney stars with understated style. Charles Bickford sub-stars as one of the sweetest cops you’re ever gonna see. Preminger doesn’t have his finger on the pulse here, but Whirlpool has its moments.",0.0
"Ferrer hams it up mighty in Preminger’s overlooked noir. As psychoanalysis, the film dates poorly with its dimestore examination. The mystery elements are much more deftly handled, with the conclusion neatly wrapping up the disparate threads of murder and hypnosis in a satisfactory manner. The rest of the cast underplays their two-dimensional characterizations, especially when compared to Ferrer. Gene Tierney is good as always even if the film doesn’t quite recapture her and Herr Otto’s Laura magic. All of Preminger’s post-Laura noirs are worth investigating.",3.5
"a truly creepy piece of cinema,if you are prepared to take the premise and run with it.
It has a great build up, with some really successful atmosphere creation, and very tangible suspense.
Otto Preminger clearly knows how to direct a good noir (he already directed Angel Face and Laura at this point) and Gene Tierney already perfected her skill at this point.
And, maybe controversially, I prefer this film over the classic that is Laura.",4.5
"Otto Preminger goes ahead and puts out the film that Hitchcock never made between Spellbound and Marnie. Somewhat uncomfortably stuck between the overreaching generalizations of the former and the audacious provocations of the latter, Whirlpool is intriguing but not always engaging - and the performances cannot truly soar in this context. A decent effort that, with a few tweaks, could have been another psychological noir classic akin to Laura, Tierney & Preminger's previous collaboration.",2.5
"The best thing about Whirlpool is that Jose Ferrer is given ample screen time to show off his chops, delivering a character who is wonderfully reptilian. He plays a quack doctor who employs hypnotism, astrology, smooth talking, quick thinking, and shrewd observational skills to seduce and con ladies, including the main character played by Gene Tierney. It's just a pleasure to watch Ferrer do his thing, and he's given plenty to do and witty lines to deliver whilst slithering.
While Ferrer is doing his thing during the first third of the movie, Whirlpool is electric viewing. The rest of the film isn't quite as enjoyable as that first segment. The script lays on the melodrama a bit thickly at the end, and the suspense scenario/crime plot gets a bit ridiculous. The pacing doesn't seem as tight in the second half as well. Gene Tierney, Richard Conte, and Charles Bickford are all less vibrant screen presences than Ferrer, and the movie struggles to hold interest when Ferrer drops out for chunks of time in the middle of the picture.
Well worth a watch for enthusiasts of late 40's/early 50's crime films, but not recommended for more casual viewers who are just dipping toes into those waters.",3.5
The good ol days when they explained away the gaslighting of women with hypnosis!,3.5
"The only reason I'd advise you to watch Whirlpool is for Jose Ferrer's delightful performance as David Korvo. Specifically in the early stages of the film, I was enjoying it simply to see all the sharp and devilish lines he's given and how much Jose rightly chews on it all. Unfortunately, that's about it as far as positives. The rest is a whole bunch of pyschoanalytic babble and a series of absurd plotlines involving hypnosis. Hypnosis was all the rage in screenwriting in the late 40's for some reason and none of these films have aged well. By the end, I was just glad for all this nonsense to be over with. Preminger was capable of so much more but screenwriter Ben Hecht wasn't even trying on this one.",2.0
"I've seen this twice before and have always been hung up by its somewhat bland pacing and performances. I've warmed to them slightly but what really attracts me now is Preminger's commanding argument for cinema as a form of analysis, predicated on Bazinian, theatrical filmmaking that prioritizes realism above all else. Not only the film's subject, which is literally about observing the behavior of others, but also the repetition of sight/blindness as a motif, and the pitfall when we start seeing things that seem incredulous, and then the incredulity of the actors by the things they don't see (and, by extension, that we might not be seeing?) Ferrer at the party says his eyes are a science; Conte later says he was blind to her: to see is indeed a science, a form of control, of knowledge, and we do ourselves and others a disservice is we don't practice it, but we can also abuse the power that it provides.",4.5
"enough pseudo-psychoanalysis talk to rival any Hitchcock.... but worth seeing for José Ferrer's outstanding debut performance.
Even with the today-campy concept (and otherwise not-so-great performances) Hecht's script and Preminger's direction still make for an overall effective noir.",3.0
"I don't think this is how psychology works. I also don't believe Barzini from 'The Godfather' is a psychoanalyst. I do believe José Ferrer as a sophisticate scumbag and his performance makes this pedestrian melodrama watchable. Preminger had a knack for realism but when it comes to the psychoanalysis fad of the post-war years for the middle class, he can't touch Hitchcock. Maybe because Preminger actually undergone therapy where Hitch self-medicated through his films.",3.0
"Hypno-Noir. Tagline: Tomorrow She will know what She did tonight!!
""Whirlpool"" is a tale of kleptomania, hypnotherapy and murder in which the considerable talents of director Otto Preminger and Ben Hecht (who co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Solt) are harnessed effectively to produce a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable offbeat thriller.
Movies were meant to entertain, and not all movies can be a ""Citizen Kane"" but this movie does what it's meant to do. Gene Tierney, perhaps the most beautiful actress ever to grace the screen, and highly underrated, handles the task of playing the fragile, accused murderess in the movie.
Ferrer is terrific as the enigmatic Korvo. From the beginning it's plainly obvious that he's a sleazy, amoral confidence trickster. What a fantastic performance from Charles Bickford as the Lieutenant. Brilliant. Worth it to see his performance alone.

"Whirlpool is to Preminger what Spellbound is to Hitchcock, an overwrought, poorly plotted melodrama steeped in lunatic psychology. Both films were written by Ben Hecht (?!). The director's smooth style kept me mildly interested - for a while.",0.0
"Oh sure, Ann Sutton could pay for that pin - or for many other things - but there's something, probably, about the thrill of taking something, very non-chalant out of a store, especially as an unsuspecting adult white woman in the late 40's, and not getting caught. Is it Kleptomania? Perhaps. But the point is, at the start of Whirlpool, Ann gets caught at a department store stealing a pin, and she's in luck that David Korvo is there to help excuse her away - these are false charges after all, she has the money to buy a dozen of these pins, right - but there's a catch to her being let go: not so much for money, at least it seems at first. She tries to pay him, but for five thousand, p-shaw. No, he wants to get at her mind, to find what it is that made her do this thing... but it will lead to murder.
Gene Tierney and Jose Ferrer play Ann and Korvo, and they're both excellent here. Even a one and a half note character (not quite one, maybe, almost two dimensional, if it tried) like Ann's husband Bill gets a solid performance out of Richard Conte, to the point where we really feel for their marriage, and see the conflict very plain as soon as Ann 'turns' on to her 'nothing's the matter' tone of voice to her husband after she comes home and tells the maid that there's something very wrong and she must speak to her husband soon as he gets home. Is she crazy? Has she been driven mad? She's no femme fatale really - she is in what seems to be a fairly happy marriage (though at one critical point she'll say otherwise in a very tense confessional). But she is flawed and interesting, and that helps.
It's especially good that this character is so strong, as well as Korvo being an equally strong, conniving villain, and we know he's a villain from basically minute one but the fun is seeing how he does things like slip a glass with the lady's fingerprints into his jacket while she's away for a minute from the lunch table. But there's a couple of plot holes here that are jarring - one is more character-based and comes in the third act, it felt like a scene was missing that involved convincing a particular character to give Ann one more chance, and there was a connective tissue from the convincing to her not in prison - and I have to wonder how much they cut out of the book. It seems like a lot. Not to mention the notion of how completely tight the hypnosis can be, just how air-tight a plot can be (that we don't really see be suggested by the way) for Ann to go out in her car and get those records and then for that other thing to happen.
Whirlpool is pretty good, but I have to think Preminger, despite some clever camera angles and the usual flair for hardcore film noir as a director (the tension in that final scene is really terrific, especially how a character hides just until a certain moment), would have had some trouble without this cast. Thankfully, Tierney gives this character credibility and she makes her fragile, torn and frayed, and when she's in her hypnotic trances it's like she's walking on air. I even liked the one/two scene turn by Barbara O'Neil (Constance Collier also has some good lines). Not something to rush to see, but it's a fair follow-up for the director and star from Laura - more of a B-side if one were to screen them back to back",3.5
A pretty good noir from Otto Preminger. Gene Tierney gives a great performance.,3.5
"The dollar-book Freud psychology (as Orson Welles would have called it) is a little silly but if you can look past that then there is a lot of value here. The dialog alone is just golden. Snappy clever lines like ""I hope your new marriage will give you something to live for, if only a divorce"" are like symphony to my ears!
Most (if not all) films have some kind of suspension of disbelief. This may have a little more than most but boy is it a fun ride. Gene Tierney is great in it as the bored middle class housewife who steals to keep her life interesting. The insight the film gives into the life of women, and how they are always defined and under the protection, influence or danger of men is fascinating. This film could be considered feminist. Women are not persons in this society, they exist for men, and if they have problems then it is the men who should and shall solve them. No wonder she gets a kick out of stealing :)
Mild spoilers!
And boy was José Ferrer good as the evil plotting bastard. He manages to create an authentic evil person, who enjoys what he is doing - not because he likes to be evil but rather because he enjoys having power over people, enjoys being the cat playing with the mouse.
A little silly but still extremely entertaining and well made.",4.0

"*Out of the Shadows: The Films of Gene Tierney*
Otto Preminger’s second noir collaboration with Gene Tierney. Whirlpool sees a woman (Gene Tierney) suffering from kleptomania get hypnotised in an attempt to cure her. Soon afterwards, she's found at the scene of a murder with no memory of how she got there, and seemingly no way to prove her innocence.
The second film in my BFI Southbank Tierney/Preminger double bill. Where the Sidewalk Ends offered up a hard boiled police procedural noir mystery, on the other end of the genre, Whirlpool spirals into frame with an undeniably goofy, twisted and unique narrative hook of mind-bending murder. Whilst once again dripping in noir atmosphere, the film does find itself in muddled territory and choppy structuring at times.
The film’s hypnosis hook is a suitably silly one and certainly raises questions when it comes to plot convenience and holes, but the paranoia and sprinkling of the mythology surrounding the subject (the hypnotism technique is utilised by the film’s devious antagonist), contrasted with the deadly serious and revered psychoanalysis (championed by Ann’s husband) is a fun duel of minds. The film can trail off and become a little muddled at points, but the drama at the centre and looming inevitability hanging over the smug antagonist keeps it engaging.
Firstly, the 35mm print of this was a joy to behold. The full crackly, flickering, muffled event that it would have been upon its release (at one point I honestly thought the whole thing was going to break it was so scratchy). As is the same case with Preminger’s other noirs, the film looks excellent. The inky shadows, sharp and graceful camerawork and unique hypnosis, reflection techniques certainly standout.
Gene Tierney is the centrepiece here. She captures the tragedy, fear, confusion and mystified nature of her character’s situation very effectively. José Ferrer’s snooty, pompous, cunning and remorseless Korvo is the standout here and Richard Conte’s growing doubt, yet dedication to his wife’s situation is a solid counter to Ferrer’s sly snide.
Whirlpool is a hidden gem worth checking out. It may stumble a little in terms of its plot execution, but the atmosphere, unique hypnosis angle, direction and performances make it worthy of a viewing.",3.5

Gene Tierney!!,3.5
"A fun noir. Seeing it with a crowd helped bring out the humor in Ben Hecht & Andrew Solt’s script. I remember the same thing happening when I went to a festival screening of Laura (another Preminger-Tierney collaboration) many moons ago.
This one’s a noir of the dime-store Freud variety. The pop-psychoanalysis in the film is pure pulp fiction. My guess is the story sprung out of the idea that somebody could use self-hypnosis to create an alibi—willing away incapacitating pain from a surgery in order to sneak out of a hospital bed and murder somebody.
The film’s biggest flaw is that it’s hard to root for anyone. It ends up having four main characters: José Ferrer’s villainous hypnotist gets the best lines, like telling a suicidal man his upcoming marriage will give him something to live for, even if it’s just the divorce. The film’s at its snappiest when he’s on screen, and he sure does look like his son Miguel in this one. Gene Tierney plays the kleptomaniac wife. Her character is in the most sympathetic position, but there’s an intentionally mysterious blankness about her, making it hard to climb inside her head. Richard Conte is her psychiatrist husband, a purposefully cold character. And Charles Bickford takes on a significant role in the proceedings during the second half as the grizzled cop on the case. For me, he was the most empathetic character and it could have been interesting to see him as the main protagonist. As it is, though, the film shifts between the four of them with an omniscient point-of-view in a way that’s emotionally distancing.",0.0

"La secuencia final de Vorágine…
“En las películas de Preminger, la emoción evoluciona, igual que la intriga y el examen de los hechos: no queda vinculada de una vez y para siempre a uno u otro personaje, según un decreto estricto formulado de antemano. Va de uno a otro y, dentro de un personaje, acompaña y refleja las vicisitudes de su itinerario. Podrá ocurrir a menudo que un personaje que al principio ha quedado completamente en la sombra y marginado desde el punto de vista emocional se convierta bruscamente en la fuente única de la emoción” (Jacques Lourcelles).
Un noir gris… 
“Así como Lubitsch fue el montaje discreto de los años veinte y treinta, Preminger es el movimiento de cámara y las tomas largas de los cincuenta y sesenta. Si Lubitsch resumió su tiempo, Preminger se adelantó al suyo. Las virtudes de Lubitsch han desaparecido, y eso hemos perdido, pero Preminger anticipó las condiciones que causarían su desaparición. La gracia y la precisión de Lubitsch parecen fuera de lugar en un mundo consagrado a la más grotesca explosión del ego. La impasible mirada de Preminger —aceptando el bien con el mal, lo bello con lo feo, lo sublime con lo mediocre— es a la vez más apropiada y más compasiva. (…) Un director que ve todos los problemas y cuestiones como dos planos de una sola toma, como la expresión estilística del eterno conflicto entre el bien y el mal, habiendo bien-mal de un lado y bien-mal del otro, y como eterna representación del bien-mal de todos nosotros” (Andrew Sarris).",4.0

She gets herself in a bind when all the evidences point against her, though fortuitously she has a loving husband (a psychoanalyst) who comes to her aid and saves the day. The moves outlined to frame Gene Tierney were rather ingeniously written, with no gaping holes, until Richard Conte with his scientific deductions broke a rather shut case wide open. A film-noir which calls for your undivided attention, where initially you can draw multiple obvious conclusions, but disuniting and justifying them felt like a complicated process. One of Otto Preminger's familiar aspects in his film-noirs. All of them have plentiful to be observed, reasoned with logically; and I guess you just have to admire his craft of film-making.
A stalwart of an auteur. Needless to say, I'm very fond of his films. Always felt they transcend time beyond compare. Final conclusion: psychoanalysts > hypnotists.",3.5

"Who is Gene Tierney? Are the hypnotic deeds ordered by Ferrer a mirror of her life with Conte? One scene mirrors another, the narrative form can justify everything, from the scientifical to the preposterous. In many scenes, Gene Tierney is confronted with things she can not remember, with actions she suppresses, with feelings long gone and urges secretly hidden.
The camera denies time and time again any hint of sensuality in Tierney's performance, her hair and clothes marking a shallow path. Meanwhile, Ferrer gets license to play both Waldo Lydecker (those elaborate wordplays) and Otto Preminger. In an uncanny performance, he submits himself to torture to persevere in the most perfect of plans. Conte and Bickford (in a remarkable role) are there as pawns in Ferrer's game but also as shadows. There is no happy place to begin in ""Whirlpool"".
""I had to pretend I was healthy and happy when I was sick and miserable"". This statement paired with the little crime we see in the overture, point to a need for closure. Tierney like Vera Miles in ""The Wrong Man"" is unable to digest the formalities, the crimes we see are just a distraction to keep the film going, what lurks in her mind is much more interesting: ""Unless I'm crazy? Unless I'm crazy."".
Besides the obvious ""Laura"" connections (a crime to be solved centred on a woman, this time as both the victim and the accused), I think Preminger is also playing on what we would later use in ""Bunny Lake is Missing"": a sense of claustrophobia. To escape the accusations, the past comes as safe harbour, explain the past - in this case Tierney's father - and all our questions are answered - her kleptomania. Watch as the camera renounces the close-up in this scene, the moment of Tierney true confession. We are presented with her face framed at the bottom by a descending line, while she is being observed from the front and the left by the lawyer and the detective, behind her we only see the body of the physician. Cornered, she is asked to tell the truth as a schoolgirl.
""Whirlpool"" is remarkable for many reasons.",4.5

"Ladra no título, mas quem rouba a cena é o antagonista

Mais uma leva de filmes dos anos 1940 sobre como a novidade da inconsciente e teorias freudiana tiveram impacto na literatura cinematográfica de hollywood.
Aqui a personagem Ann é uma cleptomaníaca que ironicamente é casada com um psicanalista de grande renome que teve por infelicidade ter seu caminho cruzado com ao hipnólogo com tendências astrológicas algo referente aos signos chamado david korvo. Um arquétipo de Bon vivant mulherengo, ambicioso de apetite voraz com mulheres e demais pessoas da alta sociedade. Do outro lado temos de William Bill esposo fiel sensato, amoroso um perfeito pai de família em franca ascensão que não suspeita do transtorno acometido pela esposa que por sua vez teme que sua condição afete o prestígio do marido.
Na outra ponta temos quarta figura central do filme que apesar das pequenas aparições no longa exerce força e motriz que movimentara a trama em um ritmo mais frenético. Thereza uma socialite rica que por outra terrível coincidência foi amante de Korvo e paciente de Bill, neste emaranhado de nós ao chegar nessa conclusão percebe a grande casualidade da situação que não se trata de uma coincidência. O personagem de Korvo assim com havia puxado extensa ficha sobre a história do barão Ferrúcio Di Ravallo fez o mesmo com Ann, Bill, após ter tido sua farsa sido desfeita por Theresa após ela mesma ter sido vítima de golpe e violência física e sexual de Korvo que através dos seus artifícios como hipnólogo conquista tudo o que deseja e o que bem entende, menos uma coisa Ann.
Mesmo conseguindo flagrar o delito de Ann a chantagear de modo furtivo e hipnotiza- lá não consegue a dominar totalmente suas ações.
A recusa de Ann em trair o marido e descoberta de que Thereza lhe alertou sobre suas atitudes causará a sua cólera e o desfecho do assassinato de Thereza onde Ann será acusada de cometer o crime. O desfecho da trama encenado de que a possibilidade de Ann e Korvo tenham tido uma relacionamento amoroso foi uma amarrado extremamente interessante apesar de uma pequena falta de estrutura que poderia ter sido revista melhor na festa onde Bill poderia ter ido a festa e que por uma forma Korvo como stalker estivesse por lá e acontecido todos os fatos na presença dos três sem que Korvo e Bill se vissem, mas são apenas detalhes.
O fato de Ann mantiver contato com Korvo mesmo sabendo de sua periculosidade poderia ter sido refeita de uma forma melhor os encontros infurtivos de Korvo e Ann poderia ter ocorrido de forma em que ele como stalker soubesse cada momento e local dos dois, sim o pano de fundo de hipnose é interessante o fato de Ann estar a todo momento sobre poder de Korvo a fazer todas as coisas contra a sua vontade justifica suas atitudes.
Ao ser presa fica muito vago o fato de Korvo ter feito uma cirurgia em si mesmo e se auto hipnotizado, mas a questão e que a cirurgia de si próprio foi deus ex machine do filme.
Outros fatos se perdem em potencial para o filme que poderia ter sido de uma forma grandiosa dado certo no filme. A participação pequena de Constance Collier como a socialite Tina Cosgrove, o fato da acompanhante de Ferrúcio possuir um rosto de antipatia por Korvo como se ela pudesse de alguma forma determinar rumos grades para a trama.
Ou então a esposa morta do tenente Colton ter feito cirurgia semelhante a de Korvo. Ou então a explicação da cleptomania de Ann ter sido provida da infância e este fato vindo a se torna secundário a trama que leva o mesmo nome da história. O fato de Ann ser uma ladra poderia ter sido atrelado de uma forma maior, já que os rumos caminharam para o desfecho da morte de Thereza e ela sendo a principal acusada do crime.
A personagem apresenta poucas dualidades isso é visto apenas no início e em seguida quando ela é presa (poderia ter afirmado de forma maior a relação de como foi a chave do seu problema, a explicação na cadeia se perde entre inúmeros detalhes no filme) por outro lado Gene consegue ser o ponto alto ela representa uma fragilidade doce sua dualidade é vista pelo telespectador que acompanha seu trabalho no cinema em que interpretou inúmeras femme fatale no cinema noir. Outros ponto de maior desenvoltura e sem dúvidas a maior do filme são os cortes simples e majestosos, a câmera parece deslizar os cenários de uma forma surpreendente colaboram com toda a estrutura do filme e Gene de uma forma muito interessante parece acompanhar este ritmo suave e espasado que o filme tem em muito momento. A decupagem faz com o espectador perceba todos os encalços presente no filme os detalhes ganham destalhes nas cenas com closes e atitude de Gene só filme, a forma como ela se porta como uma pessoa hipnotizada e interessante para uma época em que a base de referência de uma pessoa sobre influência e possessão de terceiros é um perfil robótico como de Zumbi Branco (1932) em que o passar é erto e rígido e não suave e imperceptível, e assim Gene consegue caracterizar.
Por outro lado Korvo é um papel interessante, mas que soa muito ao do dr. Louis Judd interpretado por Tom Conway em Cat People (1942), compreendo que colocar o personagem Korvo como alguém astuto demais dificuldade poderia dar final extremamente gradioso como finalizou o personagem, tendo todas as cartas na manga, deixando os personagens como burros demais para ele, alongando demasiadamente o filme. Ele personagem gradioso e percebe sua grande persuasão sobre os personagens algo que de fato poderia ter sido mais evidenciado de forma maior, mas novamente isso seria perigoso pois demandaria uma forma ainda maior de como matar o personagem, o fato da morte do personagem ter sido envolta de sua próprio ego e forma expressiva numa tentativa sem limites de ser maior que as próprias limitações físicas mostra a falência das ideias de apesar da mente ser o controle não pode de forma alguma dominar o que é físico.
No geral é um filme com muito potencial e apesar de algumas faltas que realmente o diretor conseguiu de uma maneira interessante costurar a filmagem e a atuação de Gene e Korvo merecem destaque",3.5

Si hanno abbastanza quelle stronzate naive sulla psicologia che si possono trovare in altri film anni '40/'50 (Spellbound e All that heaven allows ad esempio) ma le atmosfere noir sono talmente fighe che si passa sopra alle ingenuità tematiche. Il cattivo ha una faccia incredibile e la caratterizzazione da losco dongiovanni è memorabile. Quel nazista pelato di Otto Preminger confeziona una regia classica con dei movimenti di macchina lesinati ma super efficaci.,3.5

"No creo que este film del gran Otto este a la altura de otras obras como ""Anatomy of a murder"", ""The cardinal"", ""Bunny Lake"" o, entre las del mismo gènero, ""Laura"" o ""Angel face"". Este es un noir con buenas estrellas, como la bella Tierney (igualmente, nunca estuvo como ""Leave it for heaven"") Richard Conte, el muy buen secundario de Charles Bickford o el verdadero ""ladron"" de esta pelicula: Jose Ferrer, como Korvo, el fraudulente hipnotizador sobre el que gira la pelicula. Como sabemos, el psicoanalisis (o al menos la interpretacion que hacen los americanos de que es el psicoanalisis) pegaba muy fuerte no solo en los imaginarios americanos (que a la postre terminaron relegandolo a una terapia menor frente a teorias mas conductistas) sino tambien en la tarea de los guionistas, que hacen girar este film, por ejemplo, en la lucha de la ciencia (representada por Conte y su riguroso psicoanalisis) y el timo, representado por Korvo y su ciencia alternativa, hipnosis incluida. El terreno en disputa no resulta otro que la deseable anatomia de Ann (la Tierney) una cleptomana en problemas que su marido, el gran psicoanalista William Sutton, descuida entre su consultorio y sus ponencias a lo largo de USA. Ahi es donde mete la cuña con meros fines pecuniarios el Korvo (que bien que esta Ferrer en el papel!), aprovechando el descuido de la celebridad academica. Todo bien con eso, pero hay momentos verdadera e involuntariamente hilarantes, como cuando Korvo se hipnotiza a si mismo o la boveda tipo Fort Knox donde Sutton guarda sus vinilos con grabaciones de sus pacientes, entre otros. Un final arrebatado e infantil culminan cerrando uno de los intentos, para mi, mas flojos de Preminger, que nos parece decir, en una letania lejana, que no descuidemos a nuestras esposas, porque Korvo acecha. Asi será, Maestro.",2.5

"Gene Tierney looks like a porcelain doll and is incredible at portraying cuckoo bananas (see also “Leave Her to Heaven”). It’s also fun seeing how psychoanalysts of the time apparently kept medical records in a vault of vinyl. Seriously though, I loved the deception & mystery of the crime they’re all trying to solve.",4.0
"A well-written film, although kind of stretching the limits with the implausibility of some of the aspects of the story. This is about a well-to-do wife of a psychoanalyst, who has a little kleptomania issue. This gets her into trouble when she's caught, but a shady hypnotist happens to be there and saves her from prosecution. This encounter unfolds the rest of the story, where she begins to fall for his bigger-picture scheme.
Gene Tierney plays the wife, Ann, who loves her husband, is sweet and dutiful, but is also fairly easily duped by the hypnotist, played with creepy sneeriness by José Ferrer (whose son looks SO much like him, it's eerie). Her much-in-love husband, David, played by Richard Conte, is a brilliant psychoanalyst, but it takes him too long to put 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 together, which makes this able to play out for as long as it does. Although Otto Preminger makes a concerted effort to not make this whole hypnotism thing silly or phony, and take it seriously, one still has to consciously try to overlook the far-fetchedness of a few of the situations. If one does, one can enjoy this more.
I can't say anyone in here is particularly noteworthy in their performances, but Tierney and Ferrer are the best. Conte is a little wooden, but likeable. And Charles Bickford is amiable, but stern and businesslike as the lieutenant investigating, and does a good job. Preminger's direction is good, as well. This has the ""accused of lying when they're not"" thing, and that makes me tense and irritated, so this film did have me by the hairs because of that. I was eager for that be resolved. I did enjoy this enough, and it's a decent film noir.
Added thought: I have noticed in many films of the 1930's-1950's that it seemed to be a common thing for people to enter their cars from the opposite side, and just slide on over. Interesting.",3.0
"As far as Otto Preminger films go, Whirlpool doesn’t quite have the graceful romanticism of Laura or the sophisticated plotting of Anatomy of a Murder, but its psychology and hypnotism-heavy story is made all the more fun thanks to great performances from Gene Tierney and, especially, José Ferrer.

"I'm beginning to question my decision to have Preminger on my directors list.
He has a gift for turning what could be exciting stories into soggy, wordy snoozefests.
This plot is so ridiculous, with so many silly theories and insane ideas about hypnosis, that the movie should be equally as ridiculous.
Instead a detective and a psychoanalyst talk their way through a boring murder investigation while Gene Tierney can barely remember her own name and José Ferrer removes his own gallbladder.
This is film noir. Where's the action? Where's the intrigue? Where's the hook that pulls us in and keeps us guessing?",2.0
"A beautifully directed mystery from Otto Preminger that is let down with its sluggish pacing.
The ever magnificent Gene Tierney really is one of the best of the golden age, with really menacing, sleazy support from Jose Ferrer. It was good to see Richard Conte play against type too.

"Melodrama noir que describe, en su primera mitad, el conflicto de una mujer burguesa con cleptomanía, infeliz en su vida marital con un psicólogo y llena de angustias. Conoce a un hipnotista y empieza un tratamiento con él, pero luego descubre su mala fama. Entonces este la hipnotiza, la obliga a robar a su marido y la deja ante el cadáver de una de sus rivales. El resto del film lo componen los esfuerzos de su marido y el inspector por vencer las coartadas del villano y librar de cargos a la mujer.
El film trata el tema eterno en el cine de Preminger: el rostro como máscara que oculta a los demás sus secretos. La protagonista finge ser una mujer feliz pero vive atormentada. Sin embargo, cuando todo la apunte como criminal será necesario confiar en su inocencia más allá de las apariencias. Por su parte, el hipnotista esconde sus actos criminales detrás de una fachada de hombre encantador.
La película sigue demasiado los clichés del psicoanálisis tan en boga en 1950, lo que acaba perjudicándola. El plan del villano es imposible y se basa en el exotismo que tenía la hipnosis todavía en aquella época. Por otro lado, la investigación apenas ocupa espacio y el asesino se condena a sí mismo al intentar recuperar lo robado y ser descubierto. Hasta entonces, el marido solo había intuido sin pruebas cuál podía ser la solución.
No se trata de una de las realizaciones mayores de Preminger, pero sigue siendo interesante. Tiene algunas secuencias magníficas (como la del robo y el cadáver) y una calidad manifiesta en los diálogos, la producción y la puesta en escena.",3.0

"I was admittedly a bit distracted with worldly problems while watching this, but goddamn if a craftsman like Otto Preminger doesn’t lift my spirits what will.  I know many write this off as being weaker among the noir cycle that the director produced in his early years of Hollywood genre work, but it’s ludicrous plot is so perfectly cinematic I can’t imagine it in-sighting anything but glee. The premise is one of those where the parallels to the act of movie making itself are easy enough to make: man creates scenario in order to hypnotize woman into murder suspect while remaining inert himself save for his own self hypnotism to perpetrate the act himself. There is little point in spending time on such a banal meta observation when it is only one small reason to make a film of stunning misé en scene which justifies itself on the ground of mystery as sleight of hand where the deceit is shown at the beginning creating a closed circle of drifting camera over the murder to find the heart of a matter is to reveal nothing at all. 
Understanding the directors whom the Hitchcocko -Hawksians adored is proving to be such a large step forward in my understanding of both practical filmmaking and cinema theory. It’s encouraging to find the film school within the film school and revel in this interconnection within my love of the medium. 
With that best to close from an excerpt of Rivette’s review of Whirlpool: 
""I believe more and more that the role of the cinema is to destroy myths, to demobilize, to be pessimistic. Its role is to take people out of their cocoons and plunge them into horror...More and more, I tend to divide films into two sorts: those that are comfortable and those that aren't. The former are all vile and the others positive to a greater or lesser degree.""",4.0

gene and otto were pals. gene stepped away from movies for seven years due to struggles with mental health. When she came back it was otto who reached out to offer her the role in their last collab advise and consent.

"A new favorite noir, the ludicrous revelation of its plot completely incapable of dissolving the mysterious unease it conjures throughout. Gene Tierney at perhaps her best, so uncertain of who she is and what she’s capable of, so passive and thoughtful about what it means to be both. The whole film gradually becomes about how much of her identity is constructed by others - mostly men - and how much of a shell that makes her, and what it means to live and think independently within this rigid definition others have concocted of who you are. So, absolutely ripe stuff in 1950.

It’s also full of great small stuff - the detective’s dead wife being a huge standout - that gives the film all the texture it needs to have its silly little resolution.",0.0
"I believe this to be Gene Tierney’s third collaboration with Otto Preminger, after Laura and their other 1950 film Where the Sidewalk Ends
As you might expect from Preminger, the opening credits are quite strong; when they end, we rapidly roll all the way back up to the top of the credits as we enter into the film and see Tierney rolling up a sheet of paper we would imagine the credits were on
Tierney is a kleptomaniac; when caught stealing she is nearly arrested over the price of the item but Ferrer arrives all of a sudden and convinces (perhaps… hypnotizes) the store manager to allow Tierney to buy the item and not alert.
At 6 minutes a shot of Tierney entering her upstairs room from the point of view of her maid downstairs; this was a long take as Tierney started out speaking to the maid downstairs before hastily walking up
Ferrer plays sort of a mix of Robert Wagner in Strangers on a Train and Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master here; that being said, he is also a bit cartoonish on occasion in comparison to those characters
We see some of the early effects of Ferrer’s hypnosis as Tierney falls asleep suddenly when with her husband with next to no prior warning
Tierney, who was seeing Ferrer to help her insomnia and kleptomania, tells him at lunch the next day that she slept for 9 hours that night
Preminger tracks Tierney from the second floor as she walks downstairs as if in a trance
Mysterious film; for a who we’ve just tracked Tierney walking around like a ghost, driving around, saying nothing, holding a vinyl record, she comes across the dead O’Neil after entering her house and the police come in right afterward
2 minute take here as she walks into the great room of O’Neil’s house and the camera tracks her from the upstairs again behind this giant wall in the house Tierney stares up at that we then reveal to showcase a painting of O’Neil
Los Angeles with a hard g at 41 minutes
Great composition at 43 minutes with Tierney holding her head in her hands in the bottom left foreground of the screen as she is questioned by police detectives in the background right and center
“Yes Mrs. Randolph is a patient of mine” and then the dolly into Conte’s face…
A really great shot at 48 minutes of a closeup of Tierney on the left and center of the frame and the back of Conte’s head (they’re looking at each other) on the right
Conte speaks with a Transatlantic accent sort of like Katharine Hepburn
Formal shift here as Conte now takes over the lead of the film; we follow him through the house in a tracking shot as he enters the record cabinet vault and finds the record taken by Tierney is missing; great depth of field shot here with Conte searching through the records in the vault and Bickford outside the room to the door’s left looking inside
Tierney was writing a letter to “My Darling” before entering her trance and unfinished it; it is not mentioned whether it is referring to Conte or Ferrer
Light passing through the blinds in Ferrer’s hospital room (he had a gallbladder operation that kept him in the hospital) as he and Conte speak at 61 minutes
The high angle closeup of Ferrer’s sweaty face in the hospital bed is really strong here
Earlier at the bar in the apartment building, Ferrer had taken a wine glass with Tierney’s fingerprint on it and planted it in his apartment to imply a love affair
We get a closeup of Tierney, Bickford and another cop as she confesses about her stealing at 68 minutes and behind Tierney’s head in the frame is another body just standing in the back almost appearing headless
Conte is quite good here unlike what most think of his performance; but this is a better film with the likes of Cary Grant in his part
Great long take in the dark room here as we watch Ferrer painfully get out of his hospital bed to try to grab his mirror so he can hypnotize himself and end his pain so he can prevent the recordings from O’Neil’s time with Conte from being discovered
We cut to the mirror held up to his face and it’s just a closeup of his dark eyes in the hand mirror
Ferrer takes out a revolver in his car’s glove compartment
Camera tracks inside Bickford’s bedroom as he calls to get Tierney and Conte brought to his office; he has a picture of his recently passed wife on his bedside table and her bed is still there
We dissolve away to Ferrer listening to O’Neil’s record in her house; the camera juxtaposes him against the painting of her on the mantelpiece in a foreground-background shot at 87 minutes
I especially love the translucent curtains in the house illuminating brightly as Bickford arrives with Tierney and Conte
It is good that Preminger does not forget that Ferrer has his gallbladder injury; he’s bleeding all over the floor
He drops dead and shoots the record in his last half-second of being alive
At 87 minutes the last shot is a depth of field shot as Bickford is foreground left reporting the death to the police and Tierney and Conte embrace in the background

"One of those nonsensical films of the 1940’s psychobabble genre. Like Spellbound or The Snake Pit people behave ridiculously and it’s all explained away with some improbable diagnosis and buzzwords that no one really understands. 
This one is particularly ridiculous as Jose declares himself a fraud near the beginning but Gene decides he should treat her ill defined mental illness anyway, over martinis, in a bar??? The murder suspects husband is roped in to try and solve the crime. Make it make sense. 
This isn’t how psychiatry, hypnotism, police investigations, the medical profession or human nature work.
Absolute cobblers.",2.5
"Dark hypnotist Jose Ferrer, ""without a trace of human conscience"", tries to get in - but Gene Tierney fights back through strength of will utilizing all the sentiments of society's willingness for her to remain as an undernourished human ornament, as nervous energy turned renewable towards an end to the hypno bullshit rather than a return to a more milder (or really more widespread & normalized) form of it. A lot depends on how she, along with newly enlightened husband, now perceive their marriage & how viable reconciliation is.
Ferrer is a one man examination of all the insidious ways psychology could be applied. Ways that today are applied routinely, but those who have the most power to pay for it reconfigure the locus of distrust to your average Joe. Under this kind of thing we essentially defend monopoly power & thus the public relations giants under the guise of freedom while we distrust Clive across the road saying we should unionize bc that would be super oppressive. Great film. We live with this guy. We need to negotiate for ourselves who we live with.",0.0

"Unfortunately, this Otto Preminger film noir incorporates psycho-analysis when it was a bit populist and chic to do so (see Spellbound too). I absolutely detest the kind of ridiculous gobbledygook that showed up in plots of the period.
Honestly, what elevates this noir is the acting. I've seen other reviews praise Gene Tierney - and she is good - but for me the standout here is actually Jose Ferrer. He shows just the right amount of duplicity as the movie goes on. Worth watching at least once just for that.",2.5
"""Whirlpool"" ist ein US-Thriller aus dem Jahre 1949, mit Gene Tierney, Jose Ferrer und Richard Conte in den Hauptrollen. Regie fuehrte Otto Preminger. Der deutsche Titel des Films ist ""Frau am Abgrund"".
Ja, doch, der gefiel mir ziemlich gut. Mit dem ersten Akt hatte ich Schwierigkeiten, Preminger laessts sehr langsam angehen, der ganze Einstieg in die Story wirkt konstruiert. Wieder eine dieser ""nette Frau wird fuer Verbrechen missbraucht"" Stories, fuerchtete das es langatmig und schwuelstig werden koennte. Kitsch-Melodram mit ein paar Aufregern, wurd auch schnell muede. Aber nein, der Film geht in eine andere Richtung, schnell war ich wieder hellwach. Will nichts spoilern, deshalb sag ich nicht viel zur Story. Nur soviel: Ein Mann (Ferrer) behandelt die Schlaflosigkeit einer Frau mit Hypnose. Allerdings nutzt er die Hypnose auch fuer fiese Sachen, er macht sie zum Teil eines Verbrechens, sorgt dafuer das sie im Haus einer gerade ermordeten Frau angetroffen wird. Nun ist sie die Hauptverdaechtige. Ihr Mann, ein Psychologe, ist ueberzeugt das der Hypnotiseur hinter der Tat steckt - der aber behauptet eine Affaere mit seiner Frau gehabt zu haben und hatte in der Nacht des Mordes eine OP im Krankenhaus. Dann kann er doch gar nicht der Moerder sein, oder? Diese Frage macht den Film recht interessant, und auch sehr spannend. Dazu noch eine nette Noir Atmosphaere und keine oberflaechlichen Charaktere, hinterlaesst einen guten Gesamteindruck. Besonders Jose Ferrer und Charles Bickford als sehr menschlicher Inspektor ueberzeugen, Conte ist etwas steif, und Gene Tierney sieht huebsch aus. Klar ist vieles der Story an den Haaren herbeigezogen und unglaubwuerdig (deshalb viel er bei der Kritik auch durch, die NYT empfahl den Film in Trance zu gucken) - aber was solls, das wichtigste ist doch das man irgendwie gepackt und unterhalten wird. Und das gelingt diesem Film, den ich deshalb jedem Fan alter Thriller waermstens empfehlen kann.",4.0

His seductive performance is the main reason to check out this little noir film (like you know he's up to no good but you understand completely how someone could fall for his words) But the film itself feels a bit repetitive and dull after a while which makes this a minor entry at best in both director Otto Preminger's filmography and in the film noir genre. Hitchcock did something similar better anyway.",3.0

Ludicrous and terribly enjoyable gaslighting noir from master Preminger, who weans intrigue and suspense from his roving camera and undulating shadows.

"This is well enough written and well enough directed and shot, Gene Tierney, Richard Conte and Jose Ferrer cannot be faulted and yet there is some a little lacking here. All begins well but I think Ferrer's character is just too horrid and as his role and control over Tierney is increased the fact that he is so unlikeable begins to work against the film. We should have a greater understanding why women fall for this piece of s*** and his confident use of hypnotism. So proficient is he that towards the end his mastery of self hypnosis rather stretches credibility too far. The role of the married woman, her perceived hysteria/mania and the wonders (or not) of hypnotism combine to drive this noirish movie more into what was once called 'a woman's picture'. It is still interesting and holds the attention, especially with regard to the shining performance of Tierney but could perhaps have been trimmed just a little.",3.5

"Solid noir reflecting the contemporary preoccupation with psychoanalysis and childhood trauma. It’s fascinating what people thought of psychology at the time. There’s a huge underlying fear of one’s own mind threaded throughout so many classic noirs. Whirlpool is no exception. 
Excellent performances from its leading cast. I loved seeing Richard Conte as the sweet hubby rather than tough baddy. Gene Tierney excellently portrays her character’s melancholy desperation. It’s a melodrama but Tierney doesn’t go too over the top. Perfectly balanced. 
Overall, I thought Whirlpool was really suspenseful and fun. Preminger is top at exploring characters without spilling their WHOLE life story - if that makes sense. Giving us just what we need to see to maintain an engaging film.",4.0
"Sarris's ""Far Side of Paradise"" entry for Preminger in The American Cinema (1969). ""Far Side of Paradise"" refers to ""the directors who fall short of the Pantheon either because of a fragmentation of their personal vision or because of disruptive career problems.""
Laura is Preminger's Citizen Kane, at least in the sense that Otto's detractors, like Orson's, have never permitted him to live it down. For his part, Preminger refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever for the films he directed before Laura in 1944. There is admittedly a streak of Foxphorescent giddiness running through the frames of Under Your Spell (1936), Danger-Love at Work (1937), Margin for Error (1943), and In the Meantime, Darling (1944). However, Preminger is hardly unique in his disdain for the fruits of his early experience. Fred Zinnemann has never been eager to reminisce about Kid Glove Killer, Eyes in the Night, Little Mr. Jim, and My Brother Talks to Horses. George Stevens undoubtedly prefers to jump straight to Alice Adams without pausing for Cohens and Kellys in Trouble, Bachelor Bait, and Kentucky Kernels. Vincente Minnelli's mystique does not encompass I Dood It any more than Robert Aldrich boasts of The Big Leaguer, and Josef von Sternberg would probably prefer to forget his close-up of Grace Moore's tonsils in The King Steps Out.
There is no easy moral to draw from the evolution of Preminger's style since he left Fox in the early fifties to become his Own producer. Ironically, it was only when Preminger began blowing his own horn from The Moon Is Blue onward that his earliest films came into focus. His enemies have never forgiven him for being a director with the personality of a producer. Perhaps they subconsciously resent him for not ruining himself with the excesses of a creative folly. Culture heroes like Sternberg and Stroheim and Ophuls and Welles have acquired, rightly or wrongly, a legendary reputation for profligacy. Preminger's legend is that of the cosmic cost accountant, a ruthless creature who will mangle the muse for the sake of a shooting schedule.
The story is told in the trade of the day Preminger shot the Saint-Newman hilltop scene in Exodus. During the last take, the shadow of the boom fell across the couple. It was too late for a retake because the sun had gone. Preminger decided to let the shadow stand rather than return to the location the next day for a retake that would disrupt his shooting schedule. Some finicky aesthetes might write this decision off as sloppy craftsmanship, but for Preminger it is a question of survival. The fact is that he has not enjoyed a major critical and commercial success since Anatomy of a Murder in 1959. His frugality, and his frugality alone, has kept him from drowning in a sea of red ink. Almost alone of the new tribe of producer-directors, Preminger has accepted the responsibility of freedom, as well as the lesson of a shrinking market.
But what is the artistic point of all these crass production stories? Or as Dwight Macdonald might put it, what's art to Preminger or Preminger to art? Indeed, serious film criticism of Hollywood movies is always impaled upon the point that Holly-wood directors are not profoundly articulate about their alleged art. In this respect, Preminger is not a ""good"" interview. He will freely concede that more is read into his films by some critics than he consciously put there. He neither abuses his detractors nor embraces his defenders. He seems to enjoy the effect he creates with his outrageous personality, a personality that serves also as a mask. To read all sorts of poignant profundities in Preminger's inscrutable urbanity would seem to be the last word in idiocy, and yet there are moments in his films when the evidence on the screen is inconsistent with one's deepest instincts about the director as a man. It is at these moments that the serenity of his style seems to transcend the limitations of his sensibility.
It is ultimately Preminger's manner, rather than his matter, that should concern us most deeply. Otherwise, his extraordinary eclecticism in subject matter would make him a poor choice indeed for a career analysis. What is one to say of a taste in scripts oscillating between Oscar Wilde and Kathleen Winsor, Bernard Shaw and F. Hugh Herbert, Nelson Algren and Allen Drury, Françoise Sagan and Leon Uris? Thematic consistency is hardly Preminger's hobgoblin. The secret of his style is elsewhere. One critic has called it fairness, another the ambiguity of objectivity. Its technical correlative is the perversely objective camera viewpoint that keeps his characters in the same frame. Why does Preminger present his spectacle in this way? As he himself explains, he came from the theatre where he was accustomed to looking at drama as a spatial whole. Consequently, his deepest instincts are always opposed to montage. Without an in-bred instinct for cutting, he is not able to execute the movie gags for which Hollywood has developed an original cinematographic language. It follows almost logically that Preminger's projects, more often than not, have a solemn, somber quality. His melodramas at Fox, particularly Laura, Fallen Angel, Whirlpool, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and his RKO loan-out, Angel Face, are all moodily fluid studies in perverse psychology rather than crackling suspense movies. The characters click even as the action falters. The reviewer in search of crackling melodrama would mark Preminger down as a failure in most of these films, possibly all except Laura. Even his comedies are too fluid to encompass the obligatory reaction shots. The Moon is Blue comes out being a little sad, and Bonjour Tristesse, far from being a merry Gallic romp, is transformed by Preminger's color/black-and-white duality into a tragedy of time and illusion.
Where Richard Brooks displays a tendency to transform art into trash, Preminger displays a tendency to transform trash into art. His most recent plots have been big, violent, and vulgar. Exodus, Advise and Consent, The Cardinal, In Harm's Way, and Hurry Sundown are all derived from bloated novels on big subjects. Unfortunately, Preminger does not entirely transcend his material on any occasion. Nor does he reshape it sufficiently to his own taste. He is similarly passive with his players. John Wayne and Patricia Neal are as admirable in In Harm's Way as Paula Prentiss, Tom Tryon, and Patrick Neal are deplorable. For every John Huston in The Cardinal there is unfortunately a Lee J. Cobb in Exodus. Where Michael Caine and Jane Fonda are original creations in Hurry Sundown, Robert Hooks and Diahann Carroll degenerate into dull stereotypes. individual scenes can be magnificent—the prison raid in Exodus, the shipboard sequences with the President in Advise and Consent, the Viennese ballroom scene in The Cardinal, and the opening dance scene in In Harm's Way</o> invoking in one slowly moving shot the entire Glenn Millerish Zeitgeist of the forties. Too often, however, Preminger seems to destroy what he so lovingly creates. This is part of his ambiguity as an artist, a key perhaps to a cynicism far deeper and infinitely more destructive than Billy Wilder's.
Still, every Preminger film, even his most ill-fated, bears the signs of an overall conception and the stigmata of a personal attitude. If a Centennial Summer or a Porgy and Bess fails of execution, it is not because Preminger lacked a discernible approach toward these musicals, but rather because the various elements in the genre failed to coalesce in terms of the director's conception. By contrast, Carmen Jones succeeds on its own questionable terms as the Preminger musical par excellence—drab, austere, and completely depoeticized.
During his career Preminger has moved into direct competition or comparison with other directors. A Royal Scandal and The Fan pointed up Preminger's relationship to Lubitsch, as did obviously That Lady in Ermine, which Preminger finished after Lubitsch's death. Lubitsch is generally given the edge in these sectors and for good reasons. However, it is not entirely fair to Preminger to place him out of his time. As Lubitsch was the unobtrusive cutting of the twenties and thirties, Preminger is the camera movement and long takes of the fifties and sixties. if Lubitsch summed up his time, Preminger was ahead of it in his Fox period. The Lubitsch virtues have disappeared from the cinema, and we are the poorer for it, but Preminger anticipated the conditions that would cause their disappearance. The grace and precision of Lubitsch's sensibility seem out of place in a world consecrated to the most grotesque explosions of the ego. Preminger's impassive gaze—accepting the good with the bad, the beautiful with the ugly, the sublime with the mediocre—is both more appropriate and more merciful.
We are left with a director who has made at least four master-pieces of ambiguity and objectivity—Laura, Bonjour Tristesse, Advise and Consent, and Bunny Lake Is Missing, a director who sees all problems and issues as a single-take two-shot, the stylistic expression of the eternal conflict, not between right and wrong, but between the right-wrong on one side and the right-wrong on the other, a representation of the right-wrong in all of us as our share of the human condition. In the middle of the conflict stands Otto Preminger, right-wrong, good-bad, and probably sincere-cynical.",0.0
"Effective film noir with a psychological theme. Evil psychiatrist Korvo (Jose Ferrer) sets up a rich doctor's wife (Gene Tierney) for blackmail and murder under hypnosis. His scheme is clever enough to confound the husband (Richard Conte), himself a psychoanalyst, and to make the police lieutenant (Charles Bickford) hold her for murder. All the acting is fine, but it's Ferrer who really makes this film with his insidious characterization. Otto Preminger's direction is surprisingly subtle. The psychological basis (including self-hypnosis) for the story may seem preposterous, but it's actually all possible in the right circumstances. Enjoyable enough, though not a major part of the noir canon.",3.5
"A woman is taken terrible advantage of by a hypnotist in ""Whirlpool,"" a 1949 film starring Gene Tierney, Jose Ferrer, and Richard Conte, directed by Otto Preminger.
Tierney is the wife of a successful psychiatrist who is caught shoplifting. She is helped by Ferrer, a hypnotist who steps in during her interrogation. He works with her to help her solve some of her problems, but he adds some other hypnosis as well.
This isn't a great Preminger. The acting is good, but the script is weak. First of all, is it really possible to hypnotize someone that completely? I don't know.
What I do know is that it's absolutely against all ethics to talk about a patient with anyone as freely as Conte does. Since a good deal of the plot hinges on his breaking of that doctor-patient privilege, the story doesn't hold up.
Gene Tierney is her usual beautiful self. This is not, however, a role that plays to her strengths as an actress. She's sympathetic but doesn't explore the range of the role enough.
Tierney more easily played an icy or feisty type. In those days, as actresses neared 30, studios became less interested, and Tierney found herself in roles which she was not particularly right for - or that wasted her talent just to fulfill her contractual obligations.
Ferrer is excellent as the oily hypnotist, keeping his voice even when he was saying the most outrageous things. Conte is very good as well as Tierney's husband.
All in all, this was interesting to watch, but it could have been much better given the talent behind and before the camera.",3.5

"Gene Tierney plays a woman who secretly suffers from kleptomania is caught but then spared by a man named David Korvo (Jose Ferrer) who hypnotizes her in an effort to cure her condition. Soon afterwards, she is found at the scene of a murder with no memory of how she got there and seemingly no way to prove her innocence. Her husband (Richard Conte) is a psychiatrist who tries to come to terms with the bizarre circumstances while also trying to defend his wife despite her new claims of deflecting her lack of feelings for him. There's lots of back and forth around how Korvo is trying to gain the upper hand and slip away undetected when it's evident that his control through hypnotism will only go so far. This falls in the middle of the series of noir pictures by Preminger. It's neither the best of the bunch or the bottom of the barrel either. A strong cast helps carry this thriller which is worth a look.",3.0
"Whirpool lives up to its name through its psychological elements and gripping narrative; at first, the plot pulls you in with an intriguing set-up- a hypnotist saves an embarrassed thief from prosecution.
After their initial meeting, Korvo, the hypnotist, comes off as mysterious and weird and we don't know what to think of him. It starts to drop off as Korvo and Ann begin their therapy but drops a bombshell in the middle of the film, which is both confusing and wholly intriguing.
It is the attempt by Ann's lawyer, husband, and the police officer to solve this case which really makes this film good, as the true culprit and their motivation and method of murder are slowly revealed, leading to a very dramatic resolution, which nicely rounds off this entertaining film noir thriller.",3.5

"NOIRVEMBER 2018: #22
Another noir that falls into my least favourite sub-category of the genre, what I’ve started calling the ‘Psychobabble Noir’.
As a result this is going to be very much towards the bottom of my rankings for this marathon. That’s not to say that it’s bad however. It’s actually perfectly fine, perhaps because Jose Ferrer is so good as the sleazy and creepy hypnotist. He’s kind of entertaining and even borders on charming at times, that is until the full extent of his character is revealed.
The direction is solid, but not nearly to the high standards of Preminger’s other work and the cinematography is as engaging as you would expect from any 40s Noir.
Nothing special but an entertaining enough genre exercise.",3.0
"In the mid to late 40s, Hollywood was obsessed with psychoanalysis. Some films like Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945) were quike successful and other ones like Otto Preminger's Whirlpool were, to say the least, noticeably contrived. Preminger had worked very successfully with Gene Tierney in Laura (1944), and once more in 1950 in Where the Sidewalk Ends. Whirpool is definitely the least accomplished of the three and it was surprisingly adapted by Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt. The idea of hypnotism as psychotherapy appears to frowned upon in this thriller but it still has some nice moments.",3.0

"Memorable for one scene of a broken Gene Tierney, jailed for a murder she didn't commit, cathartically laying out her whole sad-girl life's story in a single unbroken shot that seems to go on for fifteen tightrope-walking minutes. Actually, one other shot sticks in the mind as well: Slimebag Jose Ferrer in bed after alibi-establishing gall bladder surgery, Preminger's camera staring up the yawning caves of his nostrils as if into the black depths of his soul. Otherwise, this is Preminger up to his usual tricks. Unconvincing psychological thriller/mystery buttressed by solid acting, nimble camera-work, dashes of weirdness.",2.5
"Even our government is against monopoly.

"La moglie di uno psicanalista soffre di cleptomania, ma si fa curare da un presunto ipnotista, ex amante di una paziente del marito trovata misteriosamente morta. Un vortice di intrighi, sospetti e soprattutto fragilità femminile che rendono il film un incrocio tra un dramma e un thriller psicologico. Il segreto di una donna ha la sua forza nelle cupe atmosfere, nell'eleganza formale di Preminger e nell'interpretazione dei due protagonisti, Gene Tierney e José Ferrer, nel ruolo del laido e affabulatore dottor Korvo. Restano impresse alcune sequenze di grande impatto visivo, tra tutte la seduta di autoipnosi del cattivo. Qualche piccola incongruenza di trama depotenzia il giudizio finale.",3.5
"A psychoanalytic chore on second watch. Hardly one of Preminger's best, nor a particularly fine example of film noir, and like another Gene Tierney star vehicle, the perplexedly overrated Laura, is airlessly set-bound.
Worth it all for the scene of Richard Conte (who gives the standout performance) first hearing of his wife's extra-marital activities; stutteringly processing a truth that won't compute, then forcibly shuttering it with denial and outrage before allowing himself to consider the thought further.

"Another collaboration between Otto Preminger and Gene Tierney (after the stimulating crime yarns of Laura and Where the Sidewalk Ends), although this one's steeped in some improbability.
Which, for me, is its most burdened aspect. All of the hypnotizing to create an evil spell was just too farfetched. Still, it's goddamn Preminger—meaning his use of canted camera angles and looming shadows on hilltops is a much stronger suit. The man simply knew how to frame all sorts of noir iconography and that's where Whirlpool manages to work.
Highly-strung Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney) is a kleptomaniac. When she is arrested at a department store for stealing a pin, hypnotist Korvo (José Ferrer) saves her by convincing the boss that she didn't do it. Ann has no idea who Korvo is. But he knows her. And with his initial agenda in mind (to cure her thievery), his greater plan is to implicate her in the murder of his ex-mistress who's a patient of Ann's husband.
For all her neurosis, Tierney is enlivening as a victim. But it's Ferrer's performance that impressed me the most—bringing a stealthy sneer, an intellectualism of sorts, to someone who's more vicious than he appears to be. I just wish the highly problematic narrative of sickness, crime and control—which are compelling themes in their own right, didn't strain so much credulity on the hypnotism. Had the film embraced its goofiness as opposed to playing it with a straight-face, I might've been more forgiving.
And then I'll revert to its clever craftsmanship. Preminger uses a series of clever mirror shots (a great connection to its theme of duality) as Ann adapts to a new projection of herself. My favourite was a reflected close-up of her eyes as she's gone into a new daze.
Strong accomplishment for noir details. Much inferior on its flabbergasting story. I'd recommend it for the visual pleasures.",3.0

"A whipsmart and feverish noir, not least because the terrific Jose Ferrer spends roughly half of it in a deep, sickness-induced sweat. Where Laura opens with Gene Tierney as this empty vessel who constantly has others hopes projected on her, Whirlpool is all about Gene Tierney being stripped of her humanity at the hands of a manipulative man. Same effect, overall. Otto Preminger worked endlessly on the cutting edge; even a melodramatic psychobabble thriller like Whirlpool feels wildly modern, in tone and in style. Here, there are multiple shots that'd rank among his most graceful (I particularly love the way his camera utilizes the space of that giant LA mansion), and a couple of compositions that would look right at home on The Knick, of all things. As a filmmaker, he pushed the envelope in so many ways - his content was more mature, his characters were deeper, and his craft was technically perfect, more or less. Whirlpool is a distinctive and valuable entry into the noir canon.",4.0
"Interesting if improbable film noir from Otto Preminger blends psychological elements with crime melodrama as kleptomaniac Gene Tierney is manipulated by ruthless hypnotist Jose Ferrer who claims he can cure her.

"I appreciated how there was an effort to keep the story within reasonable scientific boundaries. I also liked the thought and subtlety put into some of the scenes. Unfortunately the events that brought about the final confrontation felt too coincidental, I was expecting a better set-up.
I did not like how the nurse causes Korvo to take initiative, it felt too contrived; at the time, I even thought that the nurse had been ordered by Lt. James Colton to tell all that information about the recordings to Korvo, to test if he would make a move. I also think it would have been preferable to have Colton change his mind about helping Ann and Dr. Sutton, right after, or shortly after Dr. Sutton says that he cannot expect Colton to see Ann with his eyes.",3.5
"Preminger settled comfortably into the melodramatic preposterousness of Hecht's hypnosis thriller and gives Tierney a rich vein of feminist frustration to mine in an emotionally rich, affecting performance that evokes the confusion and helplessness of a woman neglected and forced to suffocate her emotions and personality to conform to the placating expectations of suburban patriarchy. While Tierney carries the darker psychological side of this thriller Ferrer throws in a wryly humorous and magnificently oily performance as the swindler exploiting Tierney. Preminger casts a disorientingly dreamy spell on the film that matches Tierney's fractured psyche, evoking detachment with floating long takes in the eerie scene where Tierney finds herself implicated in murder. Tierney's blank stare and painful confusion in the interrogation that follows gives a poignant tragedy to her character as she is bullied and dismissed by the police and her husband.",3.5

"Disappointing film from Otto Preminger where much of the blame is placed on the shoulders of a dime store screenplay by the usually reliable Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt. Gene Tierney is a kleptomaniac married to a psychologist (Richard Conte) who gets involve with a hypnotist (Jose Ferrer) and is framed for murder after being hypnotized. It starts off promising but quickly turns into a disappointing third rate melodrama. Tierney seems to be completely sleep walking through her role. Richard Conte, an actor I generally like is stiff. Jose Ferrer manages to be the most entertaining entertaining.
Preminger used the beautiful Gene Tierney to better use in two other films, Laura and Where the Sidewalk Ends.",2.0
"Otto Preminger simply has to be one of the most debated directors of all time. I have read so many 'for' and 'against' reviews for his many movies. There are those who really don't like 'Laura', a movie which in my opinion is a classic. In the case of 'Whirlpool', this is a movie that I think is overrated and has one of the weakest endings imaginable. Gene Tierney is someone I don't particularly like, whereas I have a lot of time for Richard Conte, who always holds together any movie he is in. Preminger's 'Whirlpool' has it's good points but is overshadowed by it's rather poor scripting and direction. Tierney is good in her role as a kleptomaniac and very insecure woman and there is no doubting that the movie is entertaining. However, for the critics to state that this movie is a good example of Preminger's work I find hard to register.",2.5
"There's a Chinese proverb that goes something like 'the faintest ink beats the strongest memory.' This movie more or less puts that theory to the test, exhibiting the strengths and weaknesses of both, albeit in a reliably pulpy fashion.
I've said this about many noir films I've seen, but it seems plenty applicable to this one too; this movie makes plot look so easy.",3.5
"Preminger's camera pushes thru frames as Tierney is forced thru actions, thoughts, and beyond free will. I was most engaged with this when I thought it was more a noir about men trying to control women (either with hypnotism and psychotherapy, or when Tiernye's husband, portrayed by Richard Conte, ignores her alibi and distraught state and moves her aside to discuss the events), just as much as it was about any sort of mystery.",3.0
"I almost grounded this at 3 stars, but it was so much fun I couldn't bring myself to. Preminger's direction is great, and Jose Ferrer's diabolical villain is absolutely phenomenal as he recites Ben Hecht's extremely showy and fun script. It also looks good as well.
Still, it's dated and extremely silly. The notions of psychoanalysis and hypnosis, just as stories of them were becoming increasingly prevalent in pop culture at the time, are really ill-conceived and used to justify some otherwise pretty weird plot developments and scenarios, and just don't hold up to a modern, discerning viewer. The scenes of the beautiful Gene Tierney sauntering around as you can see the actress pretending to be hypnotised are pretty hard to take - at least we were spared the routine of ""you are getting very sleepy"" while dangling a gold watch in front of her face, but it's close. Preminger tackled some weird and interesting subjects in time, but this is the absolute wackiest project he ever got his hands on, at least up until Skidoo or the final act of Bunny Lake Is Missing.
So take this movie's plot with an entire shaker of salt and you will probably have a great time, but if it's just Tierney and Preminger you're after, Laura and especially Where The Sidewalk Ends should be much higher up your watchlist.",3.5
"Ann Sutton (Gene Tierney), the wealthy wife of a famous psycho-analyst (Richard Conte), suffers since her childhood from a mild case of kleptomania. Afraid to lose her husband's affection she hides her condition from him. However, a minor incident is witnessed by a scheming rival psychologist (José Ferrer), who uses his knowledge to gain control over Ann. Soon Ann finds herself in a maelstrom of events that might cost her her marriage, freedom and sanity.
Very neat thriller/film noir that explores the psychology of a woman in a mental crisis. 15 years later Alfred Hitchcock would create a similar character with ""Marnie"", so in a way this film is quite ahead of it's time. Gene Tierney, who also had episodes of mental illness in her own life, plays Ann so convincingly that it covers up some serious plot holes and the fact that Richard Conte as her husband is a total miscast. He's more of a Dean Martin type roughneck than a sensitive psychologist. He tries, but I just didn't buy it. José Ferrer however is superb as the two-faced villain, with an almost ingenious ability to commit the near-perfect crime.
The suspense is well paced, the more Ann struggles to get out of her peril, the deeper she sinks into it.
This is not quite up there with Otto Premingers' ""Laura"" (1944), that also starred Gene Tierney, but it's not far behind.",3.5

"In this noir from Otto Preminger, Gene Tierney plays a kleptomaniac who's hypnotized by the sinister Jose Ferrer in order to frame her for the murder of a former acquaintance of his, who also happens to be a former patient of Tierney's husband, played by Richard Conte. It is a movie that often requires the audience to suspend not only their disbelief but also their sense of logic.
Mrs. Sutton (Tierney) is the wife of a prominent psychiatrist. One day she filches a trinket from a department store and is caught by the store detective. The detective threatens to call the police, but David Korvo (Ferrer) overhears and informs the store that Mrs. Sutton clearly suffers from kleptomania and that calling the police on her would only invite negative publicity for the store. This makes Mrs. Sutton beholden to Korvo, and he uses both her naivete and resentment of her husband's success to get what he wants.
Part of my ambivalence about this movie stems from how dated its treatment of civil rights and sexism are. Knowing that it was a different time does provide some perspective. But here are some issues modern audiences might notice. The detective confronts Mrs. Sutton as she is in her car, ready to leave. He physically takes her keys away from her and grabs her handbag. Can he do that?
Korvo then helps Mrs. Sutton with her sleep issues, allowing her to get nine hours of sleep by way of hypnosis, again making her beholden to him and more likely to want to please him.
At a party, she encounters a Mrs. Randolph, who warns her about Korvo as a man who takes money from women. (This account is corroborated by another source shortly thereafter.) A few days later, Mrs. Randolph is found dead in her home, with Mrs. Sutton standing over her. Mrs. Sutton has no idea where she is, how she came to be there, or anything.
The crux of the movie involves Dr. Sutton (Conte) trying to prove his wife's innocence to the police lieutenant (Charles Bickford), who gamely allows the accused woman's husband to tag along to the crime scene and other locations, for some reason. I know, it helps to further the plot along; I suppose having Bickford investigate the case would lack the drama promised by a Preminger-Tierney movie.
So there is a bit of an illogical aspect to the proceedings, I think. Throughout the movie, there are mentions of how Korvo is a master hypnotist, but hypnotism didn't play as large of a role as I was expecting it to. It's as if the movie wasn't sure if it wanted to be a crime drama, a desolate film noir, or a melodrama.
Good work by Tierney and Conte, even if they're both underused. Bickford and Ferrer each steal their scenes.",2.5

"A good if imperfect psychological drama. Story flow can be somewhat disjunct between sequences, causing some minor plot holes and indistinction in the main characters. Ferrer is outstanding. Plot and character motivations can be a bit too vague, though the story remains engaging and has good pacing. Has some good use of mystery and intrigue, as well as some clever cinematography moments. Hypnosis premise is a bit daft, especially in the 3rd act. Climax is underwhelming.

"Psychoanalytic condition turned into mise en scène autophagy. Preminger aims for absolute precision in his découpage not for apparent efficacy, but to undesignate himself from any bias towards his characters. It's a melodrama striped of it's imediate subtext in a sense, since it's all in the words spoken: besides Ann's confession (an amazing scene in how Preminger's camera lingers rigidly on the character's face in a single shot), there's a very important moment with Bickford's character for example, where he simply mentions the death of his wife, an apparently superfluous comment, but one that adds layers of dramatic conditioning to those climactic confrontations. But it's not simply about the dialogue itself, but specifically how those dialogues are manifested through the acting. There's this seductive force in every performance, one that always seems to thread the fine line between naivety and agression, earnestness and deceivability. It's not exactly surprising when Ferrer's character turns out to really be the bad guy, but he's far from being typified either. And the camera work plays a crucial part in this game of reconstitution as well, as the way Preminger communicates Ann's remembrance is through mirroring camera placements to manifest their naturally evocative force from the film's earlier moments, an inventive take on flashbacks if one would like to see it that way. Piecing the mise en scène together, one lie at a time.",3.0

I have such a freaking crush on Gene Tierney!,4.5
Preminger having fun with a crazy movie about a hypnotized shoplifter turned murderess. And it starts off okay and I will always love Gene Tierney. But I don't think this uses her as well as other roles where she played troubled sorts. She just feels more like a prop in her story and too much of what is happening is being discussed and dealt with by men. Good for what it is but I wanted more.,3.0
"Não assisti muitos filmes do Otto Preminger, o único que vi foi Laura(1944). Vi algumas semelhanças entre esses dois projetos e achei incrível, como mesmo com vários aspectos parecidos, ele ainda consegue ser muito original.
Aqui, acho até que Preminger consegue trazer uma premissa e um ""universo"" mais interessante, por mais que seja quase óbvio o que tenha acontecido, você fica curioso pra saber o que de fato aconteceu.

"Kleptomania? Murder? Seduction? How do you make any of this boring?!? Well, unfortunately, this movie found a way. 
This movie isn’t awful, but for a setup that does have some potential, it’s just not as interesting as you think and it’s kind of boring. And unfortunately, I think a fair amount falls on the lead actress. I’m going to be honest: I really don’t know if anybody had a grasp on who this character was supposed to be. In one scene, she seems to have kleptomania. But then by the end, she’s apparently under someone’s influence, which is why she seems to hate her husband and says he should move out for his own good, but she also says all this before she’s under that someone’s influence. Yeah, I don’t know if they really grasped this character. It’s a shame too, seeing how there is a good story about overcoming self-hating and rising above the demons of your past, but it’s never given the focus to fully develop. 
Instead, the movie focuses on this murder mystery that happens because…I’m actually not really sure. In fact, I don’t even think they give a motivation for why the villain kills this one lady. The most I can think is because that lady says to the main character that he’s using her to gain her wealth and steal it for himself, I think? As such, the mystery is not fulfilling to see play out. There’s no reason for this murder to happen and how the main character gets framed just feels random and out of nowhere. 
I will give it credit though for the cinematography. There are a lot of well composed shots. The characters are blocked really well to help paint the visual storytelling and be efficient with how dialogue scenes are shot. Some of the acting and writing is pretty corny, but sometimes, it can be used to some of the side characters’ advantages where they can have a lot of fun with how over the top it can be at times. 
I guess I could say the male characters were fine, but at the same time, nothing stands out about them either. There’s a point where I honestly mixed up the characters from one another. They look the same (tall, dark hair, suit jacket) and talk the same (deep voice). It unfortunately just means that I can’t really say anything unique about them because there’s nothing unique about any of them. 
I don’t know. This movie isn’t awful, but it’s painfully unmemorable. It’s one of those movies that goes in one ear and out the other by the next day. I’d like to discuss more, but my brain is forgetting about the movie as I’m talking about it.",2.0
"there’s something poetic about that scene where the character opened a door entering into a room filled with books and then opened another door entering another room where they opened a vault filled with vinyl records; the character grabbed two vinyl records, drive all the way to a house, opened the lamp light on their closet, placed the vinyl records there, closed the door, melancholically went downstairs to their living room where the piano is and silently stared at a painting near the fireplace.",5.0
"This is a weird one! I saw this on TV as a kid, but my memories of it were completely distorted. Here's all the things I thought I remembered about this film:
- That it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When people would discuss the best Hitchcock movies, I would always think ""Why does nobody ever mention Whirlpool? Whirlpool is so underrated!"". I should say that I did realise it was Preminger and not Hitchcock a few years ago, but I thought it was Hitchcock for a LONG time before that.
- That the husband was the villain. I guess I was amalgamating it with Gaslight, maybe, or some other bad husband film from this era.
- That a good part of it took place in a mental institution. I honestly don't know what I was thinking of here—could be anything from Now, Voyager! to Splendor in the Grass.
- That it was really good!
So… in truth, this is an Otto Preminger film where the husband is the good guy, it is not set in a mental institution, and it's honestly not that good after all. Don't get me wrong, it's fine, but I had built it up so much in my memory that it could only be a letdown.
While much, much better than The Dark Mirror, this does share one of that film's major issues, which is that the villain is telegraphed from the very start. Korvo (great name!) is so obviously an oily conman that Gene Tierney willingly spending any time with him at all reflects pretty badly on her judgement. Sure, she's ambivalent, but even that is stretching credulity. I think, also, that the film's perspective shift from her to her husband does the film a disservice; it flattens out her character, turning her into a damsel and removing her agency. She has the potential to be a genuinely interesting character, but the film becomes too invested in her blamelessness to give her any sharp edges.
Is it possible that there's a different film I was thinking of that is closer to the above, and I'd just conflated the two? Or does this really good psychological thriller about a villainous psychiatrist manipulating his wife in a sanitorium only live in my imagination?",0.0

"An interesting mystery about a woman framed for murder by hypnosis. The real murderer has the perfect alibi that he was undergoing a gallbladder operation at the time. I couldn't help thinking he was a bit stupid as although he could make himself ignore the pain he couldn't ignore his body not being able to heal. Surely it would have been better to hypnotise the hospital staff into thinking they'd performed the operation so he was still in full health and then have the operation properly at a later date.

"When a mentally ill woman (Gene Tierney) gets caught shoplifting, a predatory hypnotist (Jose Ferrer) befriends and ultimately manipulates her into taking the fall for a murder he committed. Tierney's psychiatrist husband (Richard Conte) and a police lieutenant (Charles Bickford) search for evidence of Tierney's innocence but their discoveries only serve to further implicate the confused, amnesia-stricken woman.
Jose Ferrer is terrific as a silver-tongued parasite who takes advantage of Tierney's mental fragility to plot his convoluted murder plot. For the first half of the film, the set-up and the execution of his plot are pretty masterfully accomplished; it's the latter half when both Ferrer and Tierney step off the stage and Conte and Bickford step onto it that the film fumbles the ball. Shifting focus away from Ferrer proves to be an especially fatal mistake, but the plot also sinks under the weight of its increasing number of contrivances and absurdities; and it doesn't help that the finale fizzles when the supernaturally clever villain makes a boneheaded mistake.",2.0
"Nice Film Noir/Suspense film.
Very much enjoyed Jose Ferrer's performance, and it is certainly one of my favorites. (He reminded me of son, Miguel, a bit in this one. Probably the lack of a mustache.)
The rest of the cast was fine, and it was a nice production overall.
Might watch or half-watch again.

This psychological noir is in the best of hands with Otto Preminger in control. From the first tracking shots in the shop to the last shots of the film this is first class production.
The standout however is Jose Ferrer as the slimy manipulator of everything. He plays it so well you just want to give him a slap, right in the kisser.

"This peculiar 1949 thriller by Otto Preminger about a kleptomaniac (Gene Tierney) under the control of a Mabuse-like hypnotist (Jose Ferrer) hasn’t much of a reputation in America, and the acting (which includes Richard Conte as Tierney’s psychoanalyst husband) and cornball script (by Andrew Solt and Ben Hecht hiding under a pseudonym) help explain why. But the French enthusiasm for this moody and creepy melodrama, sparked mainly by Jacques Rivette and Jean-Luc Godard, isn’t without defenses: Preminger’s ambiguous relation to his characters and his sense of moral relativity have seldom been put to such haunting use.

"HEAVY-HANDED ""HOO-DOO""...FILM-NOIR TROPES GALORE...JOSE FERRER'S ""HOMME FATALE"" SHINES
Director Otto Preminger’s Take on His “Film-Noir” always feels like He is “Slumming”.
With “A-List” Casts, Big-Budgets, and Top-of-the-Line Film-Makers at His Ready,
He Hits All the Tropes (sometimes just a little too hard), and the Finished Films are Entertaining, Enjoyably Eccentric, and Fit Neatly in the Genre, but, there is a “Play-Acting” Ambience.
A Distance to the Exploration, an ""Anti-Verite"", if you will, Lacking Street-Level Grit, with Down and Dirty Folks that are Caught in a “Whirlpool” World of Noir.
That being said, Here We Have Gene Tierney as the Beautiful and Mesmerizing Wife of a Psychiatrist, who is Mesmerized.
The Miss-Cast Richard Conte who seems Lost in the Role,
An Unlicensed “Astrologer-Therapist” Quack, Jose Ferrer, as the Films Villain and He Knocks-it-Out.
Rounding the Classy Cast is the Haggard and Shaggy Charles Bickford as a Throw-Away Non-Entity Police Detective.
The Cinematography is Ultra-Slick and a Few Eye-Popping, Grotesque Shots Blasting Through with an Edge of Surrealism.
Over-Shadowing Everything is the Film-Noir Fascination with “Psychiatry/Psycho-Therapy”,
and although it was Tackled Many, Many Times in the Genre, far more than any other,
it Never Approaches Verisimilitude, mainly because it was then such an Abstract, Newly-Jargon Practice of “Medicine”,
that even its Real-Life Practitioners had Difficulty Mastering its Bona-Fides Clearly.
But Film-Noir Tried Over and Over Again to Include it in the Plot, Either Up-Front or Peripherally, with Very Little Success.
The Result is Even Less Successful in Hind-Sight and when Looked at Today, Most are Hopelessly and Irrecoverably Dated, and Hamper the Overall.
The Director’s Fans and those of Gene Tierney will Like this one More than Other Film-Noir or Casual Movie Watchers.
Despite the Preminger “High-Hat”, the Miss-Casting of Conte, and “Far-Out-There” Story and Script (Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt), as a Mid-Level Film-Noir it’s...

Sort of an odd film for 1949-50. It might have worked better several years earlier, as this is kind of a ""psychiatry is magic"" type of film.
Still, this is an essential film for looking at how movies treated psychiatry. Also interesting to see (obliquely) how a woman's psychological issues were dealt with by movies.",3.5
"This doesn’t have the detective tropes and nighttime aesthetics of the stereotypical film noir, but it makes up for that with dark psychological themes aplenty.
It does a reasonably good attempt at showing a woman’s perspective of being manipulated by a hypnotist villain, presenting the hypnosis as both creepy and not overly implausible, before inevitably switching to the husband’s perspective so he can get her out of this mess.
But it’s hampered by its objective point of view. We’re shown Ann going to the house and clearly not committing the murder, then being unable to remember whether she dunnit or not – a more iengaging approach would be if the audience, like Ann, didn’t know what had happened.
And the ending is rather contrived – it relies on a nurse happening to tell the villain exactly the information he needed to hear. A friend and I were sure that it would turn out the husband or the detectives asked the nurse to drop this information, so as to set a trap, but it in fact turns out to be part of one big coincidence, which is less satisfying.",3.0

It looks gorgeous, unsurprisingly, and Preminger’s camera loves Tierney’s face, but Ben Hecht’s writing is excellent and features some biting dialogue. What makes this film really special though is Jose Ferrer’s deliciously sly villain, who seems to have all the best lines as he smoothly slides through every scene he’s in, the epitome of suave.

"Driven to steal by the frugality of her father who put his money in a trust so she couldn't touch it, Anne (Gene Tierney) is a kleptomaniac. Her husband Dr. Sutton (Richard Conte) is a psychoanalyst and has asked her to live within their means but years later her itchy fingers have gotten her in trouble. She's nabbed for stealing a pin and the department store doesn't press charges. However, a very strange negotiator (José Ferrer) has convinced them to let her go without reporting the incident to police.
Mr. Corvo is a hypnotist, ladies' man, and a gifter, not in that order. He lives off the women he swindles but a Mrs. Sullivan lost sixty thousand to this scam artist that she planned to give to her daughter. He uses hypnosis to suggest changes in Ann's life, to go to sleep at eleven, get up nine hours later, and steel her husband's recordings of his psychoanalytic sessions with Mrs. Sullivan. Corvo is ingenious in his execution, steels Ann's scarf to kill Sullivan, has his gall bladder removed on the same day for an alibi, and frames Ann for the murder so that she is found with the body by the police without a memory of what's transpired.
Gene Tierney is excellent at portraying an adult woman lost at sea. When she's under hypnosis, her mental confusion is so thick that she moves like an automaton. She has a logical childhood fear of not having money and acting out on it by stealing to rebel against both authority figures who withhold money from her. For fear of this man, so chilling and bloodless, I almost stopped watching José Ferrer. Clearly, he triggered me. Charles Bickford (the lieutenant) and Richard Conte have the air of shrewd professionalism--they solve the mystery of Mrs. Sullivan's murder by retracing Ann's steps with her.
Ann's lying to her husband almost gets her condemned for murder. The expectation that she fit the mold of an attractive and carefree wife is the linchpin of this story. Ann has the feminine mystique. She's all about appointments and social dates and no other deep commitment to herself. Lying comes naturally. In fact, she's stolen for so long that she lies to herself about being a thief. She can't have the department store or someone leak her kleptomania to the newspapers. To catch a man guilty of grand larceny, a wife needs to tell her husband the truth for once.",0.0
"My logical brain was trying to understand why Anne wouldn’t just admit her cleptomania earlier to protect herself against the murder charge. But then I had to force myself to understand that is not the point. Some of the sillier plot points don’t detract like they would in some B noirs because everything else going on is so interesting.
I didn’t know I needed more Jose Ferrer until seeing this. He was terrific.
The sequence in the middle of the film where Anne has her hypnotic “sleepwalk” is some of Premingers’s best work as far as setpieces go… and that’s saying something.",4.0

"""Oh Bill. struggling all day with those sick people and their wretched complexes, how you must hate them!"" Gene Tierney as Ann Sutton
Expanding on my previous review, I note that the hero of this film, Richard Conte, is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, while the villain, Jose Ferrer, is described as a ""quack"", a psychotherapist who uses hypnosis and astrology and demonstrates contempt for conventional morality. The murky terrain of mental illness and psychotherapy is willfully obscured by the screenwriters and the director for the sake of marketable plot twists and melodrama. The fact that Gene Tierney, tragically stricken with mental illness herself, had to submit to the manipulations of Preminger and his hacks, is the darkest shadow hanging over this noir nightmare",3.0

"Quite simply dreadful. 

Preminger and Hetch ruin any mystery the film might have by laying the narrative out linearly. We are then subjected to watching a detective and psychiatrist husband (who has all the charisma of an ironing board) solve everything we already know the answer to. 

Added to this is some of the flattest staging and dullest cinematography in the expressionistic genre, limping painfully to the finish. 

Aside from the aforementioned ironing board, we have Gene Tierney in a performance with little modulation between her blank stared hypnotic state and her whimpering melodramatic monologue uncovering her kleptomanic past. 

Jose Ferre is about the only interest in the movie, perfectly cast thanks to his baritone vocals and aura of superiority. If only he’d be so good as to erase this 100 minute tedium from my memory.",1.0

"Yes it's rather fantastical on top of the psychobabble (more Manchurian Candidate than Spellbound) and doesn't always play by its own internal logic (if Jean needed to have kleptomania to be hypnotised into certain acts, Korvo would have to be somehow inherently immune to physical pain?) but it's still likely due to a cruel mindgame of fate that because none of the main cast were named Hepburn or Bergman or Cary or Jimmy or Bogie that it didn't get as famous as some of the lesser pictures of those stars.
The 37th-minute tracking shot alone should make this film more famous than it is, and Tierney's performance make it a classic. José Ferrer's performance is a strange one; he is simultaneously repulsive and attractive, dapper and unfashionable, seductive and abusive, believable and ridiculous, all of which he needs to be
The long slow moving shot isn't just technical (I'd hate to traverse two floors like that now with jib and a small camera, let alone with a tonne of film equipment), but puts you in the numbed mindset the film insists Ann is in, and lures you into a strange state between tension and security until . . . It cuts to a medium two-shot and you realise exactly what has happened.
The camera, the lighting, the blocking, the wardrobe, are all motivated throughout, which makes a great deal of difference. Right at the end when Korvo opens the phonograph, there's a lovely Pulp Fiction glow emanating from it",0.0

The leading married couple are basically paragons of virtue with a couple of issues, ie they're not very interesting. Much more fun are Ferrer's manipulator and Bickford's grizzled cop, but the plot lets them down too with some silly lurches.",2.5

Há um ou outro atropelo, claro (sobretudo no desfecho um tanto precipitado), mas é uma trama que asfixia, pois põe em xeque a confiança conjugal. Em mais uma colaboração com o diretor, Gene Tierney está fabulosa, como de praxe, mas o grande desempenho é o de Jose Ferrer, repugnante, sedutor e atroz em iguais medidas. Filmaço! (WPC>)",4.0
"Great film noir by Otto Preminger once again using actress Gene Tierney in the role of Ann Sutton who has a problem with kleptomania and wants to cure it to save her marriage to Dr. William ""Bill"" Sutton played by Richard Conte.
Ann engages David Korvo played by Jose Ferrer, who is an immoral and devious hypnotist who uses Ann as a cover for a murder he commits. Ann thinks David is going to help her overcome her kleptomania.
It is a very interesting movie regarding not only the ethics of a profession but a battle of psychological wits.
Movie builds a lot of tension and the audience builds a growing hatred for the scheming and conniving hypnotist David Korso.
Movie has a vey satisfactory conclusion after all that tension. Great support by Charles Bickford, and Barbara O'Neil.",4.0
"Em ""A Ladra"", Gene Tierney interpreta Ann Sutton, esposa de um famoso psicanalista que é pega furtando uma loja, mas é salva pelo hipnólogo David Korvo (José Ferrer) que pede pra colocarem os itens na conta dela. Ele convida Ann pra jantar com ele, mas não aceita o dinheiro que ela tenta lhe dar prevendo que ele iria chantageá-la, ao invés disso Korvo quer ajudá-la. Numa festa, ele hipnotiza Ann curando sua insônia e mais tarde tenta levá-la pro seu quarto de hotel, mas ela recusa com ele levando sua taça de martini sem ela perceber. Naquela noite, Ann entra em transe e rouba discos de vinil do seu marido, colocando eles no armário onde Theresa (Barbara O'Neil) é encontrada morta e sendo presa quando a polícia chega. William (Richard Conte) acredita que sua esposa é inocente e que Korvo lhe incriminou.
Ele se lembra de Theresa reclamar do hipnólogo lhe extorquir dinheiro, mas o policial Colton (Charles Bickford) descarta a suspeita já que Korvo estava fazendo uma cirurgia no dia. Pressionada a confessar o crime, Ann apenas admite sua cleptomania causada por um trauma de infância, que William fez ela reviver quando tiveram que viver com o baixo salário dele. O psicanalista monta uma teoria de que Korvo se autohipnotizou pra conseguir deixar o hospital pra matar Theresa, o que explicaria seu aumento de temperatura no dia. O hipnólogo vai mais uma vez ao local do crime ouvir os discos, descobrindo que eles revelam que sua culpa, Colton visita o apartamento no dia pegando Korvo no flagra. Ele ameaça o policial com uma arma, mas sai do transe percebendo que está sangrando até a morte.
Na toada de filmes psicologísticos que saíram durante a popularização da teoria de Freud, como ""Quando Bate o Coração"" do Hitchcock, ao menos essa não é outra tentativa de Preminger de repetir o sucesso de Laura. Tierney faz uma personagem traumatizada pela sua própria vivência como mulher, tendo que se submeter à homens mesmo com condições de se virar sozinha. Já Ferrer é apresentado como alguém inofensivo, se tornando um vilão mais óbvio conforme a trama avança. As teorias mirabolantes de William são tão esdrúxulas que nos fazem questionar se não seria uma solução melhor que Ann fosse mesmo culpada. Pra piorar, não faz sentido nenhum que Korvo volte ao local do crime e que Colton resolva ir até lá no mesmo momento. Fazendo desse um filme com boas ideias, que começa muito bem mas se perde no caminho.",3.0
"Tão simples, mas tão provocador o modo como Preminger encena Whirpool. A conciliação do sombrio do Noir com o sobrenatural dos mind games do Korvo proporciona um obscuro e perigoso ambiente que o estilo noir já carrega em si ainda mais intensificado pelo modo como o sobrenatural opera de maneira sutil no filme. É esse casamento entre o olhar pessimista do noir com o misticismo que entra em cena que instiga tanto o espectador no filme de Preminger, remete demais ao que o Tourneur vinha fazendo em seus filmes Cat People e Leopard Man, pois os 3 filmes trabalham o perigo ""sobrenatural"" de canto, sem dar a ênfase que se espera a um elemento tão chamativo. O diretor insere esse ""a mais"" em sua trama e encara aquilo do mesmo modo que encena: às escondidas.
Além disso, o que mais gosto aqui é a dualidade Ciência (aqui a Psicanálise) vs Místico (aqui a hipnose) conflitando em cima da personagem de Gene Tierney.
Ainda lembrando de Tourneur, o conflito místico-científico é muito parecido com o que ele viria a fazer em Night of the Demon, lá mais diretamente nos próprios diálogos e nas intenções dos personagens, ao colocar em cheque a crença no místico e como suas personagens vão lidar com esse elemento ao solucionar seus casos.
Preminger parece muito interessado em trabalhar em seu cinema as divergências de pontos de vista que manipulam a narrativa a ser contada. Em ""Whirpool"" por colocar em cheque a autonomia das ações de Tierney, em ""Laura"" ao criar um mito pelo relato dos homens que se fascinam pela mulher, em ""Bunny Lake"" ao nos enganar durante o filme todo sem nunca manipular nada visualmente, só entregando pontos de vista e nos provocando a acreditar neles. São essas múltiplas visões de cada personagem que proporcionam o diretor a trabalhar a Moral de seu filme pelos seus personagens, cada um com perfis tão sólidos e representativos de um posicionamento interagem e criam situações que levam a assinatura de mise-en-scene do diretor, sua camera-stylo está na moral dos seus filmes, não é mesmo?",4.5

The reveal of how he gets between the operating room and scene of the crime is right out of a horror film, and I love the scene in the beginning where he seduces Gene Tierney's confidence by posing as a blackmailer. Richard Conte is too stiff, and occasionally acts like he has something to hide, so it's a bit of a disappointment that he turns out to be straight-as-an-arrow by the end. At the end of the day, any crime procedural that involves a key suspect establishing innocence by undergoing surgery is just begging for plot holes to arise, but this film handles its high concepts deftly all the same.",3.0

The film is burdened by much psychobabble and things get farfetched towards the end regarding the possibilities of hypnotism, but it is all pretty interesting to watch. José Ferrer is excellent as the smooth-talking hypnotist who manages to seduce and misguide the protagonist, and his eventually revealed plot to commit a perfect murder is fascinating if somewhat ludicrous. The film looks pretty good too as one might expect with Otto Preminger at the helm, and Charles Bickford has a great down-to-earth supporting turn as a police detective. Richard Conte feels rather restrained as the protagonist's husband though, and it is hard not to wonder if the film would have been better with Ferrer in focus instead.",3.0

I like it a lot and it has earned a rewatch for sure. Among noirs which give the genre a successful bend, this is among them.",3.5
"The opening credits of Otto Preminger's Whirlpool: printed on fancy paper, wound through the screen by some sort of scrolling mechanism. The camera then pulls back into the filmic world, where the credits paper is revealed as a sheet of gift wrap in the hands of an upscale department store clerk who begins spreading it out for use, after which it will presumably become a piece of trash. In this same store, Gene Tierney's not-so-happy homemaker and covert kleptomaniac is caught boosting a pricey piece of jewelry, and, soon after, pens a hasty confession note meant for her husband, but thinks the better of it and tears it up. And just a little later she writes a check for a sinister man to keep quiet about her theft; it too becomes ripped into pieces. It's a film that in so many ways eventually takes as its very core the maintenance of appearances, and yet Preminger in these early moments has already sown the seeds of tension through this subtle nudging towards a sense of self-negation.
Forever perched high on the pedestal of ""ambiguity"" by auteurists, Preminger is probably an underrated director of sheer terror - there are so many moments of it in his work. It's something his style is perfectly suited for, as the horrors are allowed the space and distance to mingle with the mundane, to infect, subvert and swallow it in fell swoops. The crucial sequence in Whirlpool is a remarkable series of fluid long takes depicting the midnight-hour possession via delayed hypnosis of Tierney (rupturing another expressive use of paper, this time an abandoned love letter), charting an entranced trek across town to take her place as patsy at a murder scene. As a formalist coup it's part and parcel with the most striking of Preminger's cinema, and as a depiction of one of the scariest of all propositions - the loss of self-agency - within an unbroken visual and narrative context, it's fairly unparalleled within my viewing experiences.
Whirlpool seems settled nicely in the Preminger critical narrative as neither his best day nor his worst. I wouldn't argue - the second half which is almost all Richard Conte and little Tierney flattens out pretty quickly - but I'll give the last word to Jacques Rivette, one of Whirlpool's staunchest defenders:
""I believe more and more that the role of the cinema is to destroy myths, to demobilize, to be pessimistic. Its role is to take people out of their cocoons and plunge them into horror...More and more, I tend to divide films into two sorts: those that are comfortable and those that aren't. The former are all vile and the others positive to a greater or lesser degree.""",0.0
"I wanted to like this film more than I did. Tierney is one of my favorite actresses, and although she did well, the storyline was lacking. Maybe I will come back to this someday...but I doubt it with so many other far superior films.",2.5
"Certainly a unique idea, a metaphysical sort of dueling between two Svengalis -- one traditional psychologist, the other a mad hypnotist in dandy's clothing, wrapped around an ordinary story of someone being framed for a murder they didn't commit. Only there's no filigree or nods to the ridiculous premise. It's all played like serious, straight noir.
It involves playing Gene Tierney for a patsy, and the fact that she is so easily swayed by Jose Ferrer's pushy lothario, it makes you think that there has to be some other sneaky way to read it. But no, she really is that suggestible, and she has to be to establish her in the necessary plot points to make this very unbelievable story work.
Plus it has Richard Conte as the ""good guy,"" an interesting choice as he comes off very gangster-like. But again, there's no second layer to him. He really is a somewhat unconvincing good guy. Gene is beautiful, as you would expect. She is made to walk and drive hypnotized to the murder scene, where she hides confidential patient diaries (the murdered woman's) on vinyl shellacs.
Conte manages to hypnotize HIMSELF not once but twice, once to murder the woman, and the second to will himself out of bed whilst suffering what is apparently a very painful aftermath of gallbladder surgery. Very odd stuff to swallow with a straight face. He does a good death tumble at the end, as he's bleeding to death from his incisions.
Weird for sure, but not great.",3.0
"Gene Tierney smolders and Jose Ferrer is brilliantly devilish with his witty lines and schemes as Otto Preminger successfully creates the world of Whirlpool, slowly building tension in the first act... and then it all comes crumbling down.

As usual, Ferrer's rat-a-tat eloquence is something to behold, this guy is always playing Cyrano and his general skeeviness is a highlight of the picture. It's a little bland, especially for a Preminger picture - I kept expecting someone to go completely off the rails at any moment, but there are no dark twists here. This s by-the-numbers Hollywood Noir; okay for what it is but as I watched Whirlpool go slowly down the drain, I couldn't help wishing I had just watched 'Laura' again instead.",1.0

Enter one of the most memorable movie villains I've encountered: Jose Ferrer as a hypnotist-cum-blackmailer with a fantastically sinister voice.

"Kind of a draggy noir revolving around hypnosis as its main plot device. No real tension or suspense generated here. Laura is the superior Tierney/Preminger pairing, although Jose Ferrer makes a fine silky smooth sleazeball.",2.0
"Psychobabble noirs, so preposterous and always seem to take themselves way too seriously, but still compelling in their distilled exploration of human nature. Ferrer makes the most of every moment he's on screen, contemptible yet believable. The looks in his eyes and snarls on his lips are perfect. Tierney, despite being chained by her role, is still fun to watch as well. The plotting is pretty tight too, so that despite the many underlying issues it's still fun to watch.",4.0

"Screened as part of “Noir Fest I”
Much like Preminger’s Laura, this gives off a greater whiff of lush melodrama than outright noir, but it’s getting closer to the mark. Gene Tierney certainly finds herself mired in a seemingly inescapable dilemma, with both her sanity and her sense of security crumbling. José Ferrer is the quack psychologist who manipulates her for his evil scheme, but “loving” husband Richard Conte is almost just as untrustworthy. I wasn’t overwhelmed by this, but as with Laura (and some other Premingers I’ve seen), this may improve with repeat viewings.

"Elementi e fissazioni presenti nel modo di far cinema del regista tornano in questo strepitoso noir (la sequenza del dipinto appunto e il finale). Il capogiro dello smarrimento e dell'impotenza di soverchiare il quotidiano, subendolo (da qui il titolo).
C'è tanto: traumi di gioventù, l'insinuarsi del male nell'instabilità d'animo, l'incapacità di vedere al di là delle apparenze e poi immancabile l'amore. Sceneggiatura sempre al limite, ma assolutamente e incredibilmente sempre sul pezzo (Ben Hecht, mica càzzi) e un cattivo da mandare a memoria (l'ipnotista Korvo).",4.0
"Solid entry into the considerable genre of the pop-psychoanalysis film noir, which seems to have been a favorite of expat directors (See Fritz Lang, Max Ophüls).
Through great direction, clever dialogue and some crafty camera movement, this film manages to overcome its overly simplistic conceptual foundation to create a truly creepy and dream-like atmosphere. The plot twists and turns towards a genuinely tragic conclusion, creating a lot of tension and hinting at underlying themes rarely explored in contemporary Hollywood films, only to be completely deflated towards the end by the compulsion to tie everything up in a way that actually glorifies the institutions that were challenged earlier.",3.5
No actress who plays characters maddened better than Gene Tierney!!!,5.0
"I was initially really excited to watch this one. The premise sounded great AND it was a film noir with a female lead. While it didn't disappoint, I did think the plot would be a little more complex than it is in the film. It actually ended up being a pulpy movie. I think I felt underwhelmed because the premise had me conjuring a different kind of third act.
It's still very solid.",4.0

This movie has an interesting plot and is similarly close to the movie The Blue Gardenia (1953). Gene Tierney and Jose Ferrer are nice to watch together.,3.5

"The kleptomaniac wife of a successful psychoanalyst is lured by a scamming hypnotist who promises to help cure her sleeplessness, then manipulates her into being culpable for a murder he commits. Despite a solid crew led by director Otto Preminger and co-writers Ben Hecht and Andrew Solt, Whirlpool was a disappointing film. It started with an interesting premise that failed in its execution. The screenplay requires the suspension of belief and is filled with numerous holes and implausibilities, punctuated by a climactic scene that's totally ridiculous.
José Ferrer was thoroughly effective as the hypnotist in one of his early Hollywood roles. Gene Tierney performance was over the top as the kleptomanaic, in contrast to Richard Conte's near emotionless perfornce as her husband. A fine supporting performance by Charles Bickford as the police lieutenant; his performance felt more natural than any of the others. Great cinematography by Arthur C. Miller created a noirish and suspenseful feel.",3.0

"Film Noir #8: Whirlpool (1949) film thoughts... Pulled this one out of the stack of DVDs tonight and didn't realize I had another Otto Preminger film to check out. Gene Tierney (who else?) plays the wife of a noted psychiatrist that has just been caught shoplifting at a Los Angeles department store. David Korvo, without knowing her intervenes and somehow gets them to let her go. She agrees to go to a local party with him, not knowing the whole time he is putting her under hypnosis. A couple of nights later, she finds herself in the home of a patient of her husband's... and the woman has been strangled to death....did she do it? How?? Why??
I didn't know a thing about this film going into it. It has an interesting premise which you need to check your brain at the door to enjoy it fully. The Krovo character is slick, creepy and has everybody fooled. The film has strong characters, good dialogue and leaves you guessing at the right parts and had one good twist. Tierney is really solid in this role as someone who is just not in control and looks fantastic...well everything looks great here. It's an above average watch, I will not say it ""great"" though because you really need to actually have a belief in that hypnosis works...they do everything possible here to make you want to believe it. Man....Tierney looks great in all black.........",3.5

"Endlessly fascinating, one I can't wait to watch again. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the opening credits, where I would have seen the name Jose Ferrer. Entire time I kept thinking that Korvo looked eerily like Miguel Ferrer. Mr. Ferrer's and Tierney's performance are absolutely stellar.",4.0
"""Otto Preminger""
An interesting film from Otto. Gene Tierney plays a clepto who's married to a psychologist, when she is caught for stealing a hypnotherapist blackmails her, saying he wont tell her husband anything. Then he hypnotizes her into framing her for a murder. A simple little film from the 40's that Preminger really ties together nicely. But I felt somewhat unsatisfied with it, it didn't do anything new or innovative. Tierney is great though and beautiful as always, playing a helpless women really well and José Ferrer as the hypnotist criminal was awesome. His voice was so powerful and almost entrancing in its self.
A good Films Noir but not great.",3.0
"First impulse here is to scoff at the goofy depictions of psychoanalysis and hypnotism, the campy conception of a world where villainous, vaguely ethnic Svengalis prey on mentally fragile society wives. But the very fact that this conflict is being presented as the foundation for a thriller – albeit one marked by heightened fictional atmospherics - shows these concerns were relevant. This is a time period which, despite its insistent air of modernity, still carried strong associations with a past where quack doctors and smooth-talking charlatans were serious fears, and where the very idea of mental illness as a part of an otherwise ‘normal’ person’s life was a mostly alien conception. Not to mention that Preminger (born in Austro-Hungarian Ukraine / raised in Vienna) had an uncomfortable level of familiarity with circumstances in which pernicious, shadowy leaders bamboozled people into doing their bidding. So yeah, it’s silly, but to focus exclusively on that fact is to ignore the upsides to a pulpy representation of a world still stuck between apprehensive mysticism and the comforting sterility of modern medicine.",3.5
"A post-war battle between psychoanalysis and, shall we say, less scientific methods for mapping and manipulating the mind is couched in this noir tale of a kleptomaniac who is hypnotized into taking a murder rap. Jose Ferrer steals the show as the silver-tongued villain whose dulcet baritone gets to spout an endless string of witty lines, including, ""Personally I have nothing against women betraying their husbands. Even governments are against monopolies.""
The surprising heart in the film doesn't come from stars Gene Tierney and Richard Conte but from Charles Bickford as a grizzled lieutenant whose weary countenance is hiding grief over his recently departed wife.",3.5
"Preminger Land--Otto, that is. I'm a late convert to Otto Preminger, and while this is not great Preminger, it's pretty good. I'm not sure if this is really a film noir or just a late 40's (in the then style) ""psychological thriller."" No matter.
Troubled Gene Tierney is taken advantage of by slimy blackmailing hypnotist, astrologer Jose Ferrer, while her husband, psychologist Richard Conte is clueless, until the shit hits the fan. Charles Bickford is the crusty police detective who lands in the middle of the situation.
Ultimately, the whole enterprise is rather unbelievable. It's melodrama, yes, but what about . . . ? The are more questions than answers. Again, no matter, it works within the world of the movie. Preminger's framing, fluid camera movements and long takes, Arthur Miller cinematography, Ben Hecht's and Andrew Solt's dialogue, the lead performances--and David Raksin's music all make the thing work.
The four lead players mostly al do well. Ferrer as the smooth operator, con man Korvo, just oozes unctuous charm. You wouldn't trust him for a second. Richard Conte is miscast as the straight leading man. I can believe him as a reporter, nightclub owner, hood, cop, truck driver, G.I.--a lot of different roles, but not a world class psychologist. I like Conte, and he's not at all bad, just out of place. Bickford is his old reliable self--the good moral center in this case. Gene Tierney's performance is underrated. She begins rather staid and trite but evolves to an emotional opening up that occurs 2/3 into the film. Not ""realistic"", but her performance really grew on me.
Bottom line--the plot is, rather ridiculous; but the direction, cinematography, dialogue and performance roll right over that--oh, and that David Raksin's score. It's not ""Laura"", in fact it is probably my least favorite of the ""noirs"" Preminger did for Fox--but ""Whirlpool"" did carry me for the ride.",3.5
"48th entry in the 100 movies in June challenge.
Otto Preminger reunites with Gene Tierney, the star of Laura, for this melodrama-noir. There are some great moments that really dig into this seemingly perfect marriage and Tierney and is superb. José Ferrer is great as the sleazy villain. The plot's reliance on hypnotism and the too-easy resolution (both come from the need to protect Ann and remove any shred of guilt or suspicion from her) are weak points, but it was enjoyable overall.",3.5
"Much like Preminger's other ""society"" noir films Whirlpool has a much lighter visual style than what has traditionally come to be known as film noir. You may even be forgiven in thinking that it is simply another Hollywood ""women's picture"" with the tedious melodramatic scene setting that fills the first half of the movie. It is when this is done and dusted that things start to get darker, Gene Tierney is hypnotised and sleep walks through some petty crimes before coming to in front of a fire place with a dead body nearby and some rentacops ready to arrest her. This sequence is without a doubt the best of the movie as from here on Tierney is pushed from cop to doctor to prison as a series of men attempt to define her and her actions. It's all a little silly but then I guess male behaviour towards women hasn't really changed much since then. She is property and seemingly untrustworthy, labelled a liar with no basis in fact whereas male criminals are trusted implicitly for no other reason than that they are men. It's hard to say whether this was an intended critique of male-female relations or just an Hollywoodised version of reality, either way it doesn't make for fun viewing.",2.5
