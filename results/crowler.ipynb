Bradford Dillman is haunting and Dean Stockwell compellingly gullible and smart at the same time. I don't know how he does it.

      "Quase um filme-ensaio, e estou falando do tipo que fazem Farocki e Andersen mesmo. Para perceber isso basta observar a forma como Fleischer desloca o protagonismo da narrativa das personagens dos dois rapazes para a do advogado que os defenderá no tribunal e, em decorrência disso, imaginar o filme com o título das forças em embate: Séc. XX (na figura de Welles - isto é, do cinema, da ciência, da justiça que afloram, se consubstanciam e se sedimentam após a 2ª Guerra com a tomada de consciência sobre os limites do homem potencializada pela reflexão sobre o holocausto) X Séc. XIX (na figura de Dean Stockwell e Bradford Dillman e do promotor interpretado por E. G. Marshall - isto é, o caso Leopold-Loeb e os últimos estertores do romantismo, do fanatismo, de um pendor elitista e proselitista, um anti-humanismo que ainda sobrevive nos nossos dias, como bem se vê).\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem I had with this fictionalized account of the Leopold and Loeb trial is that the murderous duo, despite their infamy, are just not that interesting once you examine them in any depth. Hitchcock’s Rope, which used the same crime as much looser inspiration, made up for that by placing the emphasis on situational suspense, adding an immediacy to its drama. Richard Fleischer’s film, however, has more philosophical ambitions, which sometimes proves to be a detriment. \n",
      "For the first half of the film we focus exclusively on the pair of killers—named Steiner and Strauss here—and the perverted Nietzschean philosophy used as justification for their crimes, which is just too superficial to be provocative in any real way. Their unspoken fear of masculine inadequacy—one’s a mama’s boy, the other sexually repressed, both probably gay—cuts a bit deeper on a cultural level. It forces us to wonder if their attitudes would’ve turned so toxic had the world been able to accept their nonconforming natures. But the psychology behind these characterizations still feels a bit trite to me. The dominant/submissive roles they play in their relationship is an intriguing wrinkle, but one that goes largely unexplored in any meaningful way. \n",
      "Arriving in the second half to save the day is Orson Welles as the fictional Clarence Darrow stand-in. It’s here where the film turns into a thoughtful rumination on the role of the defense attorney in the legal system. His final summation at the trial is unavoidably didactic in its critique of capital punishment, but what struck me more deeply was the compassion in his words. His argument is not a defense of their actions—which are indefensible—but a defense of their civil rights—which, in his mind, should be undeniable. It’s an act of selfless solicitude that his loathsome clients are neither worthy of, nor grateful for. Yet it is necessary, if only to keep the courts honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuestros protagonistas cometen un crimen motivados por la convicción de un orden moral alternativo en el que su superioridad intelectual legitima el obrar contra aquellos que no están a su altura. Es, a simple vista, un concepto similar a rope de Hitchcock, cosa ineludible al inspirarse ambas en el mismo crimen acontecido en la vida real.\n",
      "A medida que avanza, sin embargo, se aleja de la obra de Hitchcock separándose de la noción de thriller mientras se aventura como drama judicial con la llegada de un Orson Welles que se roba el show. El discurso final es el verdadero punto de esplendor de una película que es en sí lo suficientemente efectiv\n",

      "1st Richard Fleischer\n",
      "The first of Fleisher's three films based on a true crime story (The others being The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place), Compulsion is a serious, slightly dour film with three excellent central performances. The film is adapted from a novel based on the Leopold and Loeb murders of the 1920s. Here, two young men kidnapped and murdered a teenage boy, simply to see if they could, judging themselves to be 'morally superior' to him. Like all iconic murderers, the fascination here comes from the duality of their crimes- the brutal savagery contrasted with their apparent intellect (Loeb spoke 15 languages) and their privileged upbringing.\n",
      "The film is a fictionalised adaptation of their case, and while it makes some good points as to the historical context, especially in terms of their immense wealth, it never really gets to the heart of WHY the two men were so bound together. There's the subtle suggestion that Stockwell's character may be homosexually bound to his compatriot, but it's never really explained. The two of them remain rather glassy figures, though the performances by Stockwell and Dillman manage to convey a certain arrogance and smugness in their performances. Welles also is on near-top form, not as good as when he's Harry Lime or Quint, but still excellent in his final monologue. The use of music is sparse but effective, and there's some nice visual tricks involving a pair of glasses. Overall, not half bad.\n",

      "This could have been a masterpiece if the hays code didn’t interrupt the flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "COMPULSION is a tour de force by a director, Richard Fleisher, who has a remarkably strong filmography. Retelling the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case, who murdered a boy just to prove they could, the film is set in two separate acts. The first half looks at the actions and motivations of Steiner and Strauss, renamed, as they try to manage the whirlwind of police activity, with Strauss involving himself upfront in the investigation and Steiner battling his own Nitzschian empowerment against his own moral qualms of guilt.\n",
      "Both Stockwell and Dillman give powerhouse performances. Stockwell as Steiner has the trickier role of presenting us with a man who wishes to be submissive to his friend (a great moment comes when he is goaded into attacking a romantic interest by Strauss saying \"you want me to order you to do it\"), but still has some humanity inside. It appears painful to him when he realizes that he may not be the \"superman\" that he thought he was.\n",
      "Dillman has the showier role of Strauss, giddily taunting all around him by flexing what he believes to be his superior intellect, yet there is something stunted in him. His childlike enthusiasm, his lack of thinking of consequences, his attachment to his \"mumzy\" all present themselves. Both are petulant and entitled and as such they are dangerous. The way the actors keep blurring the power that the characters hold over each other is engaging to watch.\n",
      "The second half comes alive when Orson Welles hits the screen as the defense attorney hired by their families. Based on Clarence Darrow, he is a strong civil rights advocate and his taking on the case of two privileged men, clearly guilty of the crime, seems to be of no concern. In his eyes all people deserve their fair fate.\n",
      "At first I was impressed by Welles' subtleness in this role. Trading quips with reporters and looking slovenly and ill-kept, he underplays the part. When it comes time for his final summation to the judge, he sparks alive, giving a lengthy soliloquy that is dynamic and moving. It is clear that this was why he took this role.\n",
      "Apart from the lurid opening sequence placing this as yet another hip late 50's b-movie, Fleisher ably directs this. The momentum is good and the few stylistic flourishes are welcome, though the superimposed glasses over the final moments was a bit over the top.\n",
      "This was a top-notch film, better in my opinion than Hitchcock's ROPE which took a different look at the same story a few years earlier. It is not often that a movie can impact my beliefs, but the speech at the end made me view capital punishment through a different light. For any work of art to be able effect change is a welcome relief, especially in the times we are living through now.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would think a film about the infamous Leopold and Loeb killing would make for a compelling film, right? For Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation \"Rope\", it certainly did. But this version, although more accurately reflecting the actual case, is slow, talky and tiresome. Even Orson Welles showing up midway through to channel Clarence Darrow for the courtroom section doesn't help.\n",
      "The case itself - two wealthy Chicago youth plotting and executing \"the perfect crime\" and the subsequent trial - created a national media frenzy in the 1920s. This film is based on a 1956 novel by Meyer Levin who himself interviewed Leopold in prison (Loeb had been murdered in prison by another inmate in 1936). The film never shows the pair murdering the child but details their strange master-slave, homoerotic relationship and their Nietzschean sense of superiority.\n",
      "Bradford Dillman (as Artie, the Loeb character) and Dean Stockwell (as Judd, the Leopold character) are good. Stockwell as usual excells in playing vulnerable, sensitive characters. Although both are disturbed, Loeb is the more sociopathic of the two. There's an unfortunate side plot involving young Martin Milner and Diane Varsi, as university classmates of the two that doesn't add much, and Varsi in particular is quite wooden in her acting.\n",
      "I'm likely an outlier in that I disliked Welles' performance here (He won the Cannes Best Actor award for this performance). He plays the boys' lawyer (who in real life was Clarence Darrow) and gives long impassioned speech near the end which is basically a condemnation of capital punishment. Darrow did the same in the real trial speaking for 12 hours (!) But to me, Welles was distracting. He's sloppily dressed with a bad haircut, speaks with a long drawn-out drawl and seems more of an odd duck - eccentric but smart - than a masterful attorney.\n",
      "Anyway, for a better film adaptation, watch either Hitchcock's \"Rope\" from 1948 or the 1992 indie queer film \"Swoon\" by Tom Kalin. And fun fact - the 1970s thriller \"What's the Matter with Helen?\" is a very loose imagining of what might've happened to the mothers of Leopold and Loeb after the sensational trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summer of Scam 2: Criminally Insane\n",
      "I'm a huge fan of Richard Fleischer and he's certainly, for me, one of the most ridiculously under-appreciated directors possibly of all time.\n",
      "But there are a few things not quite right about Compulsion, despite the many positives it also has in its favour. It particularly falters during its latter stages, where I actually think that maybe Fleischer's personal politics get in the way rather.\n",
      "I am absolutely and totally against capital punishment, and I would not be swayed an iota from that belief. Yet I think Fleischer totally overdoes his anti-execution message here, and quite possibly gets carried away at the prospect of Orson Welles delivering a technically flawless monologue arguing against Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman being killed by the state.\n",
      "You can understand why that might be. It really is a brilliant piece of heartfelt acting and direction. I just think it turns things in the wrong direction here. Fleischer does mostly really good work in the first three-quarters of Compulsion in showing what an unpleasant and unrepentent pair these two were, yet his mistake with Welles' involvement is that he risks leaving us sympathising with them.\n",
      "I admit it's a *very* hard balance and Welles' message of love, tolerance and understanding is completely laudable. Yet there's only a brief message about the boy they murdered. There should have been a greater emphasis on this - it's already glossed over enough by the fact that Fleischer chooses not to film his murder or any of the immediate build-up or aftermath as it is.\n",
      "At the very least, Fleischer should have chosen which film he wanted to make here. The two just don't fit together. There are problems early on in that Dillman and Stockwell can't be nearly as intelligent as they claim to be if their performances in denials are so clearly rehearsed and contrived that surely nobody would believe a sodding word they were saying right from the get-go. If it wasn't for E.G. Marshall occasionally noting that he's not sure they're guilty, it would be like an episode of Columbo.\n",
      "Fleischer is excellent at framing their privilege, however. He doesn't push the financial envelope too far but it's clear what he's getting at. These two are clearly of the mindset they're above all others as much because of their wealth and social status than their book smarts. Their arrogance towards anyone 'beneath' them, which is almost everyone, is the very epitome of upper class white status.\n",
      "Additionally, the relationship between the two leads is very well played, thinly veiled with its sexuality subtext although disappointingly not doing more with Stockwell's need to be dominated by Dillman. I'm surprised, really, this is such a mixed bag but it's more in how it's a mixed bag that it's most disappointing of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next time I'll kill someone, I'll make sure not to Forget about my glasses.\n",
      "PS: Everytime Orson Welles is on the screen, it's a cinephile orgasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study of moneyed sociopathy featuring two types of lead performances: a showier, surface-level turn from Dillman and a subtler, interior one from Stockwell.\n",
      "The shape of the film is a little off. The inciting murder happens before the story begins (unless I missed something) and the last act is given over to an actor desperate for an Oscar. At which point, Compulsion succumbs to nauseating triteness.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the two young leads are good and I was very taken by EG Marshall’s performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's nothing coded about the relationship between Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell. It's clearly a dom/sub thing they have going on.\n",
      "I also found Orson Welle's rambling to be quite cynical, and that it ends the movie on quite a pessimistic note. Which is fitting considering who he's arguing in favor of.\n",
      "\n",
      "based on the infamous Leopold and Loeb murder case, explores the chilling minds of two wealthy, intellectually gifted young men, played convincingly by Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman. Their characters, inspired by real life killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, believe they can commit the perfect murder simply to prove their intellectual superiority.\n",
      "unfolds with a meticulously planned crime, as these young men abduct and murder a young boy solely to test their intellect against society norms. What follows is a gripping courtroom drama, where their defense attorney, brilliantly portrayed by Orson Welles, fights to save them from the death penalty. Orson Welles delivers a powerful performance, capturing the complexity of his character and adding depth to the film. The screenplay, adapted from Meyer Levins novel, provides rich dialogue and beautiful monologues, enhancing the film's intellectual depth.\n",
      "The courtroom scenes are skillfully crafted, adding depth and tension to the narrative. In these scenes, viewers witness the clash of legal titans as Orson Welles, playing defense attorney Jonathan Wilk, faces off against the prosecution in a battle for justice. Orson Welles delivers a commanding performance, portraying Wilk as a brilliant and charismatic lawyer who is determined to save his clients from the gallows. The courtroom sequences are marked by compelling dialogue and gripping cross examinations. Compulsion raises a perfect questions about the nature of justice, the limits of intellect, and the responsibility of society in shaping the actions of its individuals. The tension in the courtroom is palpable, making these scenes some of the most memorable and impactful moments in the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "80/100\n",
      "Second viewing, last seen 2004. There's a fascinating paradox at work here: Compulsion abruptly turns into a different film about ⅔ of the way through (and surely must hold the record for Latest Entrance By A Movie's Top-Billed Star, with Orson Welles first appearing 68 minutes in), making it feel disjointed and incoherent...but, at the same time, pseudo-Darrow's lengthy, impassioned argument against the death penalty gains tremendous power by arriving from out of nowhere, as the unexpected denouement to what had been a true-crime thriller told exclusively from the murderers' POV.\n",

      "That’s a sentimental term. There’s no such thing as sadness. Only the reality of things happening.\n",
      "RIP Dean Stockwell – his performance here is so layered and compelling, with the nervy snottiness and spiky desperation he lends Judd telegraphing so much. I love the way he moves – small, measured and creeping. The film's stark lighting highlighting both his beauty and its scars and imperfections. His boyish pomposity and how easily it crumples inwards. A \"powder-puff\", pinched and nasal. The desire stewing under the surface for Strauss; how he's under his thrall. How much he enjoys that; how much it scares him.\n"

      "The message of Mitchell Leisen’s “Remember the Night” is simple: love conquers all adversity through its depth of kindness. \n",
      "The structure of the film, though, is remarkably intricate for a movie that seems to at first sell itself as a home for the holidays romance. \n",
      "Perhaps - because it carries all the personal complications of the talented cast and crew involved in it. \n",
      "“Night” was the last screenplay penned by Preston Sturges before he took up the director’s chair for himself — driven to do so after being irate at the liberal cuts that Leisen had made to his script. Sturges likely took the hacking personally, having based the plot somewhat off a brief but intense elopement he had with an heiress whom he met and fell in love with on the road to Palm Springs.  \n",
      "As for the film’s stars, Barbara Stanwyck as a hot-handed thief quite literally steals the movie from Fred MacMurray, whom Leisen reworked into a morally upright supporting lead to Stanwyck’s emotional center. \n",
      "It was a crime that no jury could convict. \n",
      "Stanwyck, true to form, turns in a performance of magnitude and pathos - despite working in the sometimes frothy realm of romance. \n",
      "Just as Sturges had written one of his own life interludes into the script, Stanwyck brought her own background to the front of the lens. Portraying a woman so shattered by a loveless upbringing that she ran away from her family for a self-destructive pattern of theft, Stanwyck… could no doubt relate. \n",
      "While the straight arrow Stanwyck never turned kleptomaniac, she was raised in Brooklyn as an orphan, after her mother died following a streetcar accident and her father left to Panama never to return. \n",
      "“Night’s” greatest scene, then, and possibly one of the greatest in Stanwyck’s entire filmography, depicts a Midwest Christmas morning. Surrounded by family, surrounded by love — Stanwyck allows the comfort of the welcoming and kind surroundings to engulf her. \n",

      "*MINOR SPOILERS*\n",
      "I watched this on the big screen for the first time last night. It’s still the greatest movie I’ve seen: a witty, knockabout Preston Sturges comedy (his last script before becoming a director) that slips gently into an extraordinarily powerful articulation of romantic love: romantic love as both the saviour of and ultimate threat to family, career and existence itself.\n",
      "Fred MacMurray is an assistant D.A. brought in to win a case against shoplifter Barbara Stanwyck. After forcing her case to be postponed till after the festive season (leaving her in the clink over Christmas), he has an attack of conscience and gets her bailed out, and soon they’re travelling to their home state of Indiana together, as their frosty relationship begins to thaw.\n",
      "Combining Sturges’ comic smarts and sly sentimentalism with the lushness of director Mitchell Leisen’s visual vision, it’s a heady concoction in which the imagery – a Gothic, lamplit house; shooting through streamers at a New Year barn-dance; silhouettes against Niagara Falls – perfectly complements the action, in which each of the supporting players (Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson, Sterling Holloway) has one truly great scene with which to comprehensively nail their character, and in which Stanwyck exhibits the most refined strain of that incandescent, beguiling sensitivity that for a short time made her the most important actor on the American screen.\n",
      "Incredibly, MacMurray matches her every step of the way, the pair generating an intense chemistry of which most screen couples can barely dream – no wonder they were re-teamed for Double Indemnity, many film fans’ contender for the title of Best Noir Ever Made (I’m more of an Out of the Past man, myself).\n",
      "Every time I watch it, I find something new to make me laugh or cry. Here it was MacMurray’s petulant cry of “Those jurors are gabbing again” (laugh), as he takes an unusual approach to the climactic court case. And then there are all the elements that reward time and again: former lawyer Willard Robertson as a ridiculously OTT defense attorney; Stanwyck and MacMurray’s meeting in the apartment, her very genuine sardonism put to great use; the running gag about her defence of ‘hypnosis’; her heartstopping “You bet”, when he tells her he’s a lucky man to have the family he does, huh; the musical interlude in the parlour; Patterson’s line about her engagement; the moment when it dawns on you that Sturges is preaching on the malleability of human behaviour, one of my pet themes; and the night-time chat between Bondi and Stanwyck – a raw, captivating, unusually mature and effortlessly judged piece of cinema. And then there is the denouement, a Niagara Falls/courtroom one-two that sees Sturges take every duplicitous restriction of the Hays Code and work it in his favour, as only he could.\n",
      "There’s a black valet who’s a bit thick, a running joke about Sterling Holloway yodelling and an oft-maligned hair bow for Stanwyck, and you’re welcome to sneer, smirk or raise alarm at them all you want, but - for me - everything that happened in cinema up to Remember the Night was just a rehearsal, and nothing that’s happened since has been half as good.\n",

      "Perfect constructed Sturges script. I know he suposedly disliked Leisen direction for being far too soft, but it has a very good balance of the Wilder-like irony of the basic situation and the redemptive romance and the film let both sides feed each other. And there's Stanwyck at her near best. And as lovely as most of this is, it has a very bitter logic that the entire wallk through the past sets up with movie magic only doing enough to allow the lovers to escape themselves (and on this McMurray usual stifness is very well deployed).\n",

      "Second viewing, last seen 1993. Remembered it as lightly enjoyable, and one could readily imagine a version of this story that's more overtly comic. Indeed, the basic scenario—representative of law and order travels with criminal; one of them awkwardly visits an estranged relative; they grow close enough that Mr. Law (who'd been looking out solely for his own professional and financial interests) ultimately seeks to let the crook get away—was recapitulated decades later, minus the romance, via Midnight Run. Instead, Remember the Night turns startlingly dark for a moment, with Lee's attempted maternal rapprochement cruelly rejected, before shifting into a lovely, heartwarming portrait of restorative kindness...which then itself takes an ugly turn as Jack's mother ever-so-sweetly asks the wounded bird she's been tending to please fly somewhere far from her respectable and hardworking son. Sturges and Stanwyck would perfect this sort of thrilling tonal whiplash the following year in The Lady Eve—and that's the (even) greater film, in my opinion—but Leisen contributes purely visual aspects that Sturges, for all his genius, was never remotely able to match. Certainly there's nothing comparable to the shot of Lee sobbing on her mother's front porch, during which Leisen has Mom peek out the window, deep in the background, and then just switch off an interior light and vanish, rather than emerging to patch things up as one might expect. A truly disturbing moment that subtly enriches an otherwise one-dimensional character without ever calling attention to itself. Apparently, Leisen also cut a lot of the snappy patter that Sturges had written for Jack, fearing that it was beyond MacMurray's capability...which now seems patently absurd, since MacMurray and Stanwyck arguably set the standard for high-speed badinage just four years later, but probably better served this particular picture (just as The Lady Eve wouldn't work with a scabrous wit in Fonda's role).\n",
      "Yet there's still plenty of vintage Sturges here—most notably in the opening reel, which hands the minor character of Lee's attorney an epic opening or closing argument (it's not clear to me which) that revels in escalating lunacy and remains blithely unconcerned about taxing the viewer's patience. Plotting's uncommonly strong, often creating and then subverting expectations; an entire sequence exists solely to divert Jack and Lee through Canada on their way home, but while Leisen gets a gorgeous Niagara Falls clinch out of it, Lee winds up passing on Jack's suggestion that she thwart the U.S. justice system simply by remaining outside of the country's borders. And having complained a few months ago about Kramer vs. Kramer's ludicrous custody trial, I was very gratified indeed to see a movie made four decades earlier employ that sort of witness badgering to an actual purpose, with the attorney deliberately trying to make the jury despise him so that they'll acquit the woman he's ostensibly trying to convict. (If you can watch Lee suddenly grasp what's happening and not need to brush tears away, you're less of a sap than yours truly.) I could perhaps wish for a slightly stronger finale, meaning literally just the last few seconds—what we get's a tad prosaic—but here I've been gushing for two full paragraphs without even mentioning Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway, who collectively manage to make \"common\" decency seem genuinely inspiring rather than saccharine or like a rebuke of those self-obsessed city folk. \"I'm pretty lucky, huh?\" Jack asks Lee, vis-à-vis the warm bosom of his family, and Lee's quiet \"You bet\" pierces because we've just seen her endure the opposite. Only a great movie would then have one of those same people gently stick the knife in, leading to an unhappy happy ending.\n",
      "(If you somehow require further prodding, note that the Coens outright swiped Stanwyck's line \"That gag's so old it's got whiskers,\" giving it to Bruce Campbell in The Hudsucker Proxy. Also I watched this on 30 December, which is ideal; entire film takes place between Christmas and New Year's, basically.)\n",

      "In this Christmas film starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, a thief is caught and placed on trial, and the assistant district attorney, fearing that the jury will let her go free because of the goodwill of the season, has the trial postponed until after the holidays. However, his good nature gets the best of him when he decides to bail her out of jail since he feels awful that the girl will spend the holidays locked up. However, his actions \"backfire\" when the thief is placed in his care. This relationship develops into something more, and the two discover the value of love, friendship, and festivity.\n",
      "Written by Preston Sturges (his final screenplay was for someone else), it is full of amusing moments, a writing that blends the cheesy, the saccharine, and the screwball in a coherent and enjoyable way in a film that will make you laugh at the numerous witticisms and drop a tear or two at the occasional revelation. Fred and Barbara, in particular, give strong performances; they have natural chemistry and do a great job bringing their characters to life.\n",
      "All in all, even though some of the comedic segments didn't work for me and it can get a little melodramatic at times, this is still a great movie that you should watch during the holidays or any other time.\n",

      "The tension between Leisen's and Sturges's styles that was evident in Easy Living is here resolved, with the former easing off his tendency to favor background design over foreground acting and the latter hinting at the real depths of pathos lurking beneath his antic comedies. Yet it was Leisen who understood that the true focus of the film should be Stanwyck, not MacMurry and reoriented the screenplay accordingly. If Sturges bitched and moaned about the director's fussy alterations to his other script, he owed Leisen a debt for showing just how good Stanwyck could work in a comedy, which of course paid off handsomely for Sturges down the line. There are some sublime shots here: the way candlelight hovers in Jack's family home, or the matte background of Niagara Falls that glows so radiantly that the water backlights the putative lovers. But the real pleasures are in the natural chemistry that develops between Stanwyck and MacMurray, slowing down screwball into just an honest-to-goodness meet-cute that plays not off of manic gestures but subtle interactions. When Lee realizes early on that Jack's stoicism is a product not of his resolute kindness, her soft \"Gee, you're sweet,\" said as much to herself as him, lays out the next 2/3 of the movie in one fell swoop.\n",

      "It’s Babs' birthday today. She would have been 114. In some ways, it feels like she is. I just watched her resort to milking a cow after getting lost in the middle of nowhere on a long drive. And not for one second did she lose that sly twinkle in her eye.\n",
      "As petty jewel thief Lee, she finds herself in hot water for sniping bracelets and flogging them for quick cash. Spend any time at all with Lee (Barbara), and it’s no wonder that her real trick would be to unknowingly steal the hearts of anyone who stuck around long enough to hear her story. And I don’t know about you, but that’s just about the best legacy that anyone could ever hope to ask for.\n",
      "That sparkle she wears can blind the dullest of men, but what helps REMEMBER THE NIGHT shine so bright is that you can sense a gradual shift in that spark, from the inside out. It’s most evident in the moments where she’s hit with the realisation that no-one has ever been this selflessly kind-hearted and good to her before. And expected nothing in return. That kind of revelation has the power to change you, but only if you let it. Only, if you think you’re worthy of the time of day they stoop to give you. And she wears that struggle and everything else all in her two glistening eyes.\n",
      "Slowly that twinkle starts to reveal itself as something more, something less dazzling than a personal cry for help. When she gives in and lets it all out, the result can be seen in the slight, dampened sheen of her pearly whites. At once, we see reflected back the strength of human tenderness and selfless deeds on someone who has only known a life spent running from unhappiness.\n",
      "For all of her adept swindling, Lee has all but let any chance of love slip through her fingers. Resorting instead to buying it. Or rather, steal. It’s the poignant tremble of ‘what in good name have I done to deserve this?’ as fixed with ‘so this is what it’s like to have a family to call your own, friends and folk who actually love and care for you, warts and all?’ All right there in the solitary glance to the side. Falling to the knees beside the warm bed they’ve let you stay in for the night. The clutching of the pearls when no one is around to see.\n",
      "And in a world where the littlest gestures often reveal the grandest impact, sometimes all it takes is a small exercise in human decency from the one person you’d least expect it. To change everything for the better. And it’s only in learning to love another, can she hope to love herself. On the road to accepting more than the lowly love she thinks she deserves.\n",

While watching Remember The Night I was again impressed with Fred MacMurray and I am somewhat convinced he could be the most underrated actor of his era. He was in big films of course, but he is never really spoken about as a guy with range, one that could be straight, cutthroat, and funny. Together, the duo is charming and delightful.

It’s a movie so full of music – five of the loveliest diegetic songs you’ll ever hear, ‘Easy Living’ perhaps nodding to Leisen and Sturges’ only other collaboration – and full of the most exquisite lighting: the orbs around the candles, the shadows at Niagara, the hideous Gothic nightmare of Stanwyck’s mother’s house, as one of the great screen villains comes to the fore, Leisen finding every crease in her face. There are so many great jokes that I keep alighting on new ones every time I watch it: this time it was MacMurray's deadpan, \"If you know any other Fat Mikes, you can send them too\", the fantastic battle-of-the-sexes material in his apartment, and, near the close, Stanwyck's fantastically sarcastic, \"Some district attorney you turned out to be.\"\n",

'Snowflake' Toones plays John's slightly slow servant but he isn't quite as daft as he first appears. And Beulah Bondi ages up yet again to play MacMurray's mother.\n",

      "I feel a bit like Scrooge or the Grinch as I write this review since it's a Christmas favorite for so many. I enjoyed it but with reservations. There’s much to like: Mitchell Leisen’s romantic/sentimental direction. The less madcap than usual but still witty and edgy Preston Sturges script. Plus a terrific cast - Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and some great character actors in secondary roles.\n",
      "However I always cringe at the elevation of old-fashioned Midwestern small-town goodness as the universal American ideal. It always feels like an earlier version of “family values” contrasted the dangers of modernity and big city living. We see this in the Hallmark holiday movies where a sophisticated NY woman goes to Iowa and realizes what she’s been missing. And this theme is strong in Remember the Night although the film’s positive features somewhat balance it out.\n",
      "Nonetheless, I do like the emphasis on the power of kindness to open up the hearts of those who’ve had to live in survival mode. Stanwyck is Lee Leander (love the name!), a chronic shoplifter of high end items who’s arrested at Christmastime. Considering she reports having no money and skipping from one free meal and hotel to another, she looks quite glamorous with fashionable early 40s outfits and stylish hairdo.\n",
      "MacMurray is DA John Sargent who winds up escorting her to his Indiana family and hometown while she’s out on bail. (Note: Apparently Sturges made Sargent more of a moralistic hard-ass in his script but Leisen insisted he be more pleasant and relatable).  Lee is deeply touched by the goodness of McMurray’s mom (Beulah Bondi) and maiden aunt (Elizabeth Patterson), and of course they fall in love. There’s also a hired hand played by Sterling Holloway, an actor whose schtick annoys me. But that’s another story.\n",
      "The second collaboration of Leisen and Sturges - they did Easy Living - shows their different approaches. I wound up liking the first half with its quirky but lovable characters (Sturges) more than the sentimental second half (Leisen). Stanwyck does a great job of showing Lee’s softening and transformation. But there’s a strong gendered messaging in her transformation: We watch Lee being taught to bake, and to wear a lacy corset for a rural dress-up New Year’s ball. John’s mom (Beulah Bondi) kindly but clearly pressures Lee to not do anything that would derail her hard-working son’s career.\n",
      "I hate to add even more critiques but there's some racist elements as well. John has a black servant whose pattern of speech and behavior has the usual Hollywood stereotypes, and there’s some casually racist anti-Chinese jokes in the banter between John and Lee (“In China, they eat dogs” and references to “Chinese coolies” in the trunk of the car). These are minor but I still wish they weren’t there.\n",
      "Nonetheless, there are some lovely and amusing moments throughout. And genuine pathos, such as when Lee visits her hostile and contemptuous mother. The paring of the quick-with-a-sharp-comeback Stanwyck with the understated MacMurray works so well they wound up doing three more films together. But I much prefer them in Wilder’s Double Indemnity and Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow. Anyway, hope I wasn’t too harsh because this is truly a well-made film. I guess I just prefer my “feel good” movies to be less linked with those old-time heartland values.\n",

      "The marriage of Stanwyck's consummate, unique artistry and screenwriter Preston Sturges' fusion of the hard-boiled and heartfelt begins to work its magic instantly, and by the time they pitch up in Indiana to spend the holidays with MacMurray's family, I'm a mess. MacMurray too is astonishingly good, giving far and away the greatest, deepest performance of a long and erratic career.\n",
      "Probably the 12 most moving moments in cinema history are crammed into this one film – among them, a meltdown at a New York nightclub, Elizabeth Patterson's love letters and Stanwyck's immortal \"you bet\" – while former costume designer and set dresser Leisen's very specific style (including props in the foreground to colour the whole frame) leads to some astonishing imagery: including a New Year's kiss shot through streamers and a Niagara Falls scene filmed almost entirely in silhouette. Its atmosphere is like nothing else I've ever experienced.\n",
      "The movie's hilarious too, from MacMurray's ironic admission of state-sanctioned hedonism (\"Oh yes, my life is just one long round of whoopee\"), through Sturges' memorable ruminations on honesty, to a climactic courtroom scene that's both emotionally redolent and gloriously petulant, as MacMurray goes from intimidating the defendant to insulting the jury. Even the supporting characters are given pure gold: deftly sketched personas spouting stellar lines, including a ludicrously loquacious lawyer (Willard Robertson), dullwitted bondsman Fat Mike (Tom Kennedy) and overstretched orphan Willie (Sterling Holloway) – working for his supper at MacMurray's ma's house.\n",
      "But the film's much more than a smart, moving, even heady rom-com: it's a plea for love, tolerance and social justice, a film about second chances, the malleability of human nature and the conditions that breed criminals, all masquerading as a holiday romance.\n",
      "I've seen it perhaps a dozen times now – this was my second time on the big screen this year – and there's nowhere I'd rather be than at Beulah Bondi's house, as her son Jack (MacMurray) and the thief he's prosecuting (Stanwyck) swap songs, stories and presents, while falling desperately and irredeemably in love.\n",

      "In a previous write-up of a wonderful film called Ninotchka, Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch worked together and got along as writer and director respectively, turning in a flick for the ages — Lubitsch became a mentor figure to Wilder. However, it wasn’t always that Wilder was proud of how other directors handled his work such as Howard Hawks on Ball of Fire (jeez, at this point, if one had a dollar for everytime I mentioned this film or Barbara Stanwyck in a review, you might have enough to get yourself a Peloton) and Mitchell Leisen on Midnight. But even then despite editing scenes and dialogue crafted & cherished by Wilder, both of those directors gave audiences a film for the ages. Speaking of Leisen, there was another writer whose work he altered to his dismay — that of Preston Sturges who made real gems like Sullivan’s Travels and The Palm Beach Story. The product of such is known as Remember the Night. But did Leisen’s changes hold up to screen greatness like how he edited and sowed Wilder’s script for Midnight? Yes, they did and even better. This 1940 film is a Christmas classic steeped in sweetness that stemmed from roughness.\n",
      "In New York City, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is arrested after stealing a bracelet from a jewelry store. Assistant district attorney John “Jack” Sergeant is assigned to the prosecution team in a trial that occurs right before Christmas Day. In order to prevent an acquittal due to a holiday spirited jury willing to proclaim Lee not guilty, Jack postpones the trial to after Christmas on a technicality. Little does he know that he himself becomes filled with the holiday spirit as he immediately feels guilty post realizing that Lee will have to spend the 25th of December in a jail cell. So he bails her out. But oddly enough due to a misunderstanding, Lee appears in Jack’s apartment, having nowhere to spend Christmas. Jack decides to take her to her mother’s house on his way to see his own family where love, humility, and joy reside — something Lee must experience herself. Will she?\n",
      "There’s just a really great quality about old writers and directors — Frank Capra was the sentimental, conservative, and common sense American and Billy Wilder found ways to make fun of politics in his films, while also proclaiming views against communism or fascism like in the aforementioned Ninotchka. Importantly, these filmmakers knew how to balance their art with the message. Preston Sturges had an unwavering brand of messages out there and one theme that stood out was responsibility. In Sullivan’s Travels, he made the whole case for movies’ responsibility to the audience: for the average citizen to escape the burdens of life ranging from politics, familial troubles, hard days at work, etc. — to not lecture or preach. In Christmas in July, it was the responsibility for people to stay humble amidst all the hard work and pay. \n",
      "In Remember the Night, responsibility plays a factor in both characters Lee and Jack. Lee is a thief, responsible for her actions and her court sentence. But one must also take into account why she is the way she is — a rough home life with a mother who spoke ill of her and never cared for her as a child growing up in Indiana. Her fellow Hoosier, Jack, is a man who himself had a rough home life and put himself through work to become the lawyer he is. Most importantly, it is the responsibility of one’s parents to shape their kids into the adults they are today. \n",
      "Jack’s mother to Lee: We were very poor after my husband died. In fact, we had nothing. Jack had to do chores before school and chores after school, and -- when he was in high school, he drove a delivery truck afternoons to earn a little money. And after chores, he studied evenings to try to get into college. He worked his way through college and he worked his way through law school. Oh, I’m not trying to say there’s anything unusual in that. Thousands of boys are doing the same thing this minute. But I am trying to tell you how hard he worked to get where he is today. How very, very hard.\n",
      "Sturges’ words here are very much the missives of wisdom, but it’s amazing that such ideas as this aren’t found in films of the current age. Or maybe they are and I just haven’t touched upon them yet. This kind of message isn’t one to lecture or preach to the audience, but to inspire people in their normal lives. Babs Stanwyck’s Lee took it upon herself to do what was right and MacMurray’s Jack felt it his due diligence to welcome Lee into his loving home and away from the horrors and memories of her childhood. From the way his life was shaped in a hard working, caring, loving, and humble family home, Jack’s actions based on humility have paved the way for romance to blossom between the law giver and the law breaker for a Christmas miracle that never at one point loses its humility. Even at the very end.\n",
      "Remember the Night is an excellent film and another addition to the annual Christmas movies to be seen time and time again, helped by Leisen’s use of blocking and cinematography. It is a wonder as to what this film would’ve been like if Sturges was director in addition to writer — more lengthy monologues for MacMurray rather than utilize his quiet nature, for instance? Sturges probably wouldn’t have known how to play or tailor the script to the co-leads’ strengths the way Leisen knew. That is not until The Lady Eve. Not to mention… another favorite starring Babs. Look, I stan Stanwyck. This might be my most favorite collaboration of her and MacMurray over Wilder’s Double Indemnity. And right here again she knows how to light up the screen. Stanwyck + Christmas movies = joy.\n",

      "While watching REMEMBER THE NIGHT, I couldn’t help the occasional momentary flashes that the two leads would headline DOUBLE INDEMNITY just four years later!  That isn’t a flaw with this movie.  It speaks more to the versatility of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.\n",
      "   \n",
      "Just as “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens defined Christmas for Victorian readers, REMEMBER THE NIGHT captures the American ideal of Christmas that was popular in the 1940’s possibly right through to the 1970’s.  It lovingly creates the image of what it is supposed to be like when the extended family comes together during the Holidays.  That’s not to say that people were expected to sing around the piano and attend a barn dance.  However, it presented a sense of belonging and not being alone during a festive time ... which may mean that REMEMBER THE NIGHT might not be the best Christmas movie to watch during the Pandemic!\n",
      "   \n",
      "Director Michael Leison (probably best known for DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY) keeps things moving with a very light touch.  The comedy sequences are gentle rather than laugh out loud funny (okay, maybe with the exception of the cross-eyed portrait on the wall) and the relationships are more touching than passionate.  Yet, it is appropriate for a show that wants to merge “smart” with “nostalgia.”  Add to that a screenplay by Preston Sturges, and it would be difficult to “miss.”\n",

Apparently Sturges didn't like how much Leisen lightened the film, but Sturges' wit shines through expertly. I have to go against Sturges on this because Remember the Night is a masterwork.

      "5.0\n",
      "Preston Sturges described the plot of this film, which he wrote and which Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray starred in, this way: “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” I suggest the following addendum: “Then their love for each other redeemed them both.” A pattern of sentiment, subversion of sentiment, and triumphant return of sentiment repeats throughout the film. Assistant district attorney MacMurray plays a courtroom trick that keeps accused thief Stanwyck in jail. He feels bad about it, so he asks bail bondsman Tom Kennedy to get her out for the holidays. Kennedy misreads his intentions and leaves her at his apartment. Stanwyck quickly realizes MacMurray was trying to do her a good turn, not take advantage of her. As a result, she begins to fall for him. \n",
      "That same pattern continues, with variation. Learning that Stanwyck grew up not far from his mother Bealah Bondi’s house, which he’s getting ready to drive to, MacMurray offers her a lift. But Stanwyck’s mom, Georgia Caine, turns out to be a loveless, puritanical harridan. So MacMurray helps Stanwyck save face — and have a merry Christmas — by inviting her to Bondi’s house. Etc. When they return to New York, MacMurray tries to “throw” his case against Stanwyck, jeopardizing his career in the process. But Stanwyck has learned how important MacMurray’s career is to him and Bondi, both of whom have been good to her, as well as the sacrifices they made for him to have it. So she makes her own sacrifice for his sake: she changes her plea to guilty so that, if they still love each other after she’s served her term, they’ll be able to look each other in the eye. \n",
      "It’s a rich and incredibly moving film. That’s due equally to Sturges’ screenplay, which suggests meaningful parallels in MacMurray’s and Stanwyck’s respective backstories, and director Mitchell Leisen’s subtle handling of the thematics and emphasis on characterization. Both Stanwyck and MacMurray grew up poor; both even stole their mothers’ savings. But Stanwyck’s mistake was met with emotional cruelty, while MacMurray’s was met with love. Would their roles be reversed now if their situations had been different then? Love, or the lack of it, has made them who they are. Yet the film never feels sappy because Sturges’ tendency to subvert the sentimentality of the story before reinforcing it and Leisen’s reluctance to hit us over the head with it keeps us on our toes. There’s ambiguity even at the end. Will these two lovers ever reunite, and if so, how long will it take?\n",
      "Stanwyck and MacMurray have great chemistry in their first film together. One scene stood out to me in particular. As they share a cab to the courthouse, Stanwyck grows concerned about what MacMurray is planning. As he tries to kiss her, she turns away slightly. He kisses her cheek and neck instead. Suddenly, she’s smiling and leaning into his kiss. It’s a wonderful display of Stanwyck’s acting talent as well as their chemistry. (It also illustrates the repeating pattern I describe above. In fact, those few seconds could represent the whole film.) Two of their three subsequent films together are at least as good: Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity and Douglas Sirk’s There’s Always Tomorrow. That Leisen rarely gets mentioned alongside Wilder and Sirk as a master of the medium is a shame. Off the top of my head, I can think of at least four other films he directed, in addition to this one, that are masterpieces. \n",

      "As a first-time viewer, I was struck by just how long the beginning of the film dwells in the courtroom.

O’Leary attempts to get petty thief Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) acquitted by depriving her of responsibility for her actions. He concocts a long-drawn, fabulous story in which his client, an innocent victim of mesmerism, entangles herself in crime with all the volition of a puppet entangled in its strings.\n",
      "Lee stole a bracelet; O’Leary’s defense attempts to rob her of her autonomy.\n",
      "The movie cannot allow this defense to succeed. To acquit her on the basis of mesmerism, the film suggests, would be equivalent to looking to her past to deny her culpability in the present – as though all of us, “hypnotized” by our upbringings, could no longer be treated as agents, but as products.\n",
      "It’s a rather conservative message – but the movie also doesn’t want us to identify with the unforgiving rectitude of Lee’s mother. One of the most humane things John Sargent does in the film is rescue his new companion from a heart-breaking scene of failed reconciliation.\n",

Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent as a young woman whose life of petty crime has its roots in some unhappy childhood experiences, who comes to see that life has better things to offer. Fred MacMurray is nearly as good as the prosecuting attorney who, cynical as he is, takes pity on her and introduces her to the kind of life she had never known. Beulah Bondi, as MacMurray's mother, is gentle and expert in her portrayal of a woman filled with love and pity. The supporting cast, particularly Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway as family members, is keen in its depiction of small town characters, providing richly authentic feelings to even the most comic of types. The legal stuff at the beginning is largely laughable in its variance from actual courtroom procedure, but Sturges has filled the rest of the script with a true sense of life and feeling.

Sometimes, a fella just wants to believe in the inherent goodness of people, even if, you know, well.

It wasn't until Jack offered to buy Lee dinner that I realized he was a morally upright character. I had, like her, assumed he had an ulterior motive for being kind to her.\n",
      "The presentation of Lee's character was interesting too because for a long time, I kept waiting for the film to try to explain away her own crimes and mistakes. Maybe I'm cynical in expecting this, but it couldn't have been helped because the film itself didn't try to use sentimentality to mask flaws in its characters.\n",
      "There was a cloud of inevitability that hovered over the romance between Jack and Lee, but I never really believed it wouldn't pass by the ending. I kept thinking somehow, some way, by the ending the two of them would be together and the world would bend to them being a couple, treating them as though they really were the main protagonists.\n",
      "Sure Lee's homecoming was not what I expected and she got a little dose of reality and some overly tough love when she got home. Sure it would feel a little bit like a cop out if everything just worked out well for them. I mean just because you are remorseful doesn't mean the law should just forgive you but come on, these two are so endearing and they have both become better people! Lee has slowly lowered her protective demeanor and personality and started to reveal more vulnerability, probably something she hasn't done since she was a child. Jack is in love and is starting to learn to sometimes see the humanity in the people he prosecutes, even though he was never a jerk or completely ruthless and uncaring.\n",
      "I was won over by the their budding romance that I didn't think too much just how much this new found love was bringing integrity to one character, while blinding and taking it away from the other. It was not until the final scene, which is just fantastic, that I realized how much of a copout a normal ending would be. It would undo so much growth for one character and slowly begin the downfall of another's integrity.\n",
      "Remember the Night shows just how crucial a loving and supporting family can be to who we become. Honesty, integrity, kindness and love are all virtues that made people good. Being dogmatic about any particular one while ignoring the rest will blind you. Jack thinks loving Lee is enough reason to sacrifice some of these virtues, as though this wouldn't have further reaching consequences.\n",
      "Lee on the other hand, is seeing these virtues earnestly for the first time in a very long time. Her own insecurities and flaws are for once unable to prevent her from doing what she feels is the right thing. She also sees the value on waiting to know a person better before deciding they are perfect in every way.\n",
      "Through the ending, the film manages to feel both hopeful yet realistic. It takes a story I wasn't quite able to really pin down in terms of what it was going for, and really ties it together in impressive fashion.\n",
      "MacMurray and Stanwyck were definitely very good, but I was also impressed by Beulah Bondi's performance as Jack's mother. I've seen her in a few films (though I didn't immediately clock this) and much like in Make Way for Tomorrow (what a film, what a performance!), she possesses an aura that's hard to describe. It's like she exudes integrity, tenderness, honesty and whenever she speaks, I'm fully attentive. If anything I wish we got more scenes of her and Lee because their heart to heart was just great to see.\n",
      "In the end, I was won over by Remember the Night. I don't entirely know why but I at least know that what the film does well, it does very well.\n",

      "There could be some instances among cinephiles wherein penning a second missive of a film you’ve seen before and about which you’ve previously and lovingly jotted down your thoughts might feel manufactured as opposed to wholehearted enthusiasm. However, fortunately, the assurance must be stated — my second write-ups of films don’t at all come from a place anathema to eagerness, and certainly wouldn’t think most others and my friends on this platform don’t share the sentiment. However, being a member of this medium, even watching a movie can spur ludicrous thoughts about what words one shall write down post viewing. Possibly much of the time for people, yet none for some others, absorbing a film’s magic is meant to obtain a stage of joy. People ideally watch a movie for the sake of enjoyment, relaxation, and escapism. Even to learn a lesson or have one’s values be supported or challenged, and see life through a different perspective wherein emotion is all but difficult to explain verbally as opposed to visually. But among the vast number of reviewers and “reviewers” here, watching a flick for the sake of composing the next Letterboxd entry can never be the goal of watching a film. And so therefore, the viewer may not come to witness the kind of emotion that’s exuded by a great film such as Mitchell Leisen’s Remember the Night. If there were all but one adjective to describe this little Christmas tale wholly, the word “adorable” materializes. It’s undeniable that my first write-up in 2021 for this Preston Sturges written charmer still stands its ground. \n",
      "Once again, after being arrested for shoplifting, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is taken to court where district attorney Jack Sargeant (Fred MacMurray) is assigned to prosecute her. However, due to his wits and Christmas being just days away, Jack successfully postponed the trial until January, leaving Ms. Leander in jail all alone. But due to his good heart, this clever lawyer decides to bail Lee out and take her on a little road trip to see her mother. Not only her mother, but Jack’s sweet family up in the Midwest. Through periods of loneliness, a ruckus trial, and a true gift of a man’s goodwill and chivalry, Lee discovers not only a new willingness to reform her dastardly ways but a special kind of love that she had never received and a forgiveness that was never bestowed on her soul. In the spirit of Christmas, Ms. Leander only begins to learn what love is — how it feels and what’s expected to emanate from one’s heart. And by love, what a dose of sacrifice and unselfishness does to the soul — it burns, but it burns ever so deeply that the willingness to suffer only grows stronger. \n",
      "Post watching this Leisen charmer on Christmas Eve of 2021, my dumb thumbs tapped away…\n",
      "“… responsibility plays a factor in both characters Lee and Jack. Lee is a thief, responsible for her actions and her court sentence. But one must also take into account why she is the way she is — a rough home life with a mother who spoke ill of her and never cared for her as a child growing up in Indiana. Her fellow Hoosier, Jack, is a man who himself had a rough home life and put himself through work to become the lawyer he is. Most importantly, it is the responsibility of one’s parents to shape their kids into the adults they are today.”\n",
      "The thought still stands. But stemming from the virtue of responsibility is love. Whether one wants or doesn’t want to act, responsibility is not a human’s innate ability to feel righteous about oneself, but to act for another — a person or cause — simply because it is right and moral. Good ol’ MacMurray’s Jack Sargeant never wanted to bring the enticing criminal into his apartment, pay her dinner, and neither did he expect to allow her into his warm and loving Indiana home. The radiant and cute Barbara Stanwyck’s Lee Leander had never expected for the man who was to put her in jail to do all of those good deeds either. But one feeling in both individuals’ cases was for certain — neither wanted to be alone. Lee had no one but her mother who disowned her. Jack lived by himself and only wanted to see his sweet family once again.  \n",
      "The steadfast lawyer not only recognized the horror of loneliness, an unloving parent, and the absence of love and joy in Lee’s life.. but he fixed it for her. Rather than allow the jewelry thief to spend another Christmas by herself, Jack stays with her. Instead of having Babs’ Ms. Leander sit and listen to her malevolent & uncaring mother crush her spirit further, Jack takes her to meet his sweet mother, aunt, and cousin. From this comes the remedy to install the missing love and joy into Lee’s soul, but the final dose of that medicine came in the form of Jack devoting himself. Without this recognition of such an intense willingness to give oneself unto another, Lee herself wouldn’t have found the courage to care for Jack and his well-deserved reputation as a district attorney. Consequently, the D.A., who had always received and reciprocated affection and happiness his whole life wasn’t the person to declare the final “I love you” to this pretty dame. But like how the seasoned lawyer made the final court trick and postponed his fellow Hoosier’s trial, the rookie in the realm of such ebullient human emotion, Lee, was the person to make the final sacrifice and postpone that solidification of love for the right time and place. \n",
      "Through intimate, reflective, and sweet framing of the characters in not just scenes related to the plot, but small portions that drive the journey and evolution of Jack and Lee’s relationship, the Leisen and Sturges collaboration only makes for a stellar wintery classic never to be ignored. Simple dinner scenes, a slow dancing sequence, a family scene by the piano, and the dichotomy between the morose entry of Lee’s mother and the warmly lit introduction of Jack’s mother, aunt, and cousin, can hit the viewer with an indelible charm that can’t be overlooked. Once again, Remember the Night is just adorable, and another flick that should be seen every Christmas alongside It’s a Wonderful Life, The Bishop’s Wife, and The Shop Around the Corner to name a few.

I for one couldn't wait till Christmas to watch this gem again. It's so sweet and charming that it makes me all warm and gooey inside. Stanwyck has never looked lovelier and I love how the camera captures her face, especially when she's not even speaking and her face and eyes are doing all the talking. Some of my favourite scenes: the milking of the cow; the unwrapping of Christmas presents; the singing around the piano; the bedroom scene where Beulah Bondi (love her) talks to Stanwyck about her son and how nothing should spoil what he worked so hard for. And then of course there's the scene where Stanwyck visits her mother and gets a cold reception. It's heartbreaking and memorable. Only flaw: the overly long courtroom scene at the beginning of the film which makes for a slow start. \n",

      "Preston Sturges' comedy is surprisingly the weak link here. Not bad, but compared to the humor in the other two Leisen films I've seen- the humor in this film tends to feel like it belongs in 1940 and doesn't really land well with my modern sensibilities. Some of the jokes were still funny, it's just some of them also fell flat. Rufus' inclusion as a character was also not necessary and pretty racist.\n",
      "The romance and character drama parts of the script were great though. I really loved both of the leads and the dynamic between them. Stanwyck especially got most of the focus from the camera, and I'll tell you hwhat I lived for it every time we got a closeup on Stanwyck's face. Her forlorn looks of longing and her small moments of hopeful acceptance take front-and-center stage, and it makes her the defining element of the film.\n",
      "MacMurray was also great leaning more into the sly and witty city slicker on the outside and the gentle and empathetic romantic on the inside. His performance doesn't have the emotional high/lows of Stanwyck's, but he is a well-written character with a genuine charm.\n",
      "My favorite section of the movie was when they were at the Sargent farm. Almost all of my favorite scenes from the film take place within that section; I just wish we could've stayed there for longer. The piano scene after Christmas dinner was just magical. I loved the whole family dynamic there as well and the contrast of being in a big country home full of love and family as opposed to the dwindling humanity of the New York courthouses, luxury hotels, mansions, and banks that I'm used to from Leisen's other films.\n",

      "Out of Classical Hollywood's many talented directors and visionaries who could clear-as-day make films with an iconoclastic style and are best remembered for their hard-working skills behind-the-camera, Mitchell Leisen isn't a name you'll find mentioned often, and that's because Leisen was very much a writer's director, in that the quality of his work depended solely on the material he was hastily given to make something out of, especially in the pre-war days. The thing about Mitchell Leisen is that he didn't make Leisen films, he made Paramount films and spent 29 years being a loyal journeyman, but that's not to say Leisen didn't craft his unique personal directorial niches, creating leisurely-paced films and emphasizing eye appeal and visual elegance helpfully informed by his time designing sets and costumes for, say, Cecil B. DeMille or Ernst Lubitsch. Remember the Night is Leisen's most famous film not because of the man himself, but because he made so many changes to the original script that the credited screenwriter, Preston Sturges, got so fed up and decided to make films of his own, a few of which have made a few laps ahead of Leisen's in terms of popularity, and as a heartfelt Christmas-adjacent drama with healthy doses of comedy, it works like a charm.\n",
      "Lee Leander is on trial for a third offense of shoplifting and awaits further questioning after the holidays, all while a sympathetic attorney, John Sargent, agrees to give a roof over her head with a little help from chummy bail bondsman Fat Mike (no, not the guy from NOFX). Lee's major story revolves around that of redemption and reformation, slowly warming her cynical attitude towards living and ownership as she agrees to join John in a trip to Indiana towards both their elder's homes, structured around many detours on and off the road that shift her identity and rekindle the small-town values within her (though not without hesitance towards a quick bit of arson to escape from a pickle), escaping the frivolousness of New York and finding communion and longing within the friendliness and love of a family like John's that helps Lee understand the morality and capability of greater things within a dame burdened with a tendency to scatter off with jewelry that's not hers. By finding herself within sentimentality, Lee is able to mature from her past sins and learn what she may desire to help keep these life lessons rooted within her.\n",
      "As much as love reforms Lee, love also corrupts John as he's the man assigned to book this petty thief to the slammer after the holidays, agreeing to have her accompany him on a non-romantic basis that wanes, falters, and gradually eases towards each other that brings John into a conflict of interest towards whether falling in love or maintaining his attorney reputation is more important. The chemistry between our two leading actors, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, is absolutely palpable, Lee bouncing off a tough demeanor hiding her vulnerability with John's relaxed, good-as-gold integrity as he ends up effortlessly shedding the distance between them, evoking the Christmas spirit as they express kindness to each other, charm in gathering around John's family piano for a sing-a-along, intimacy underneath the New Year's flairs, the two are destined for each other and it takes a considerable amount of the runtime for that self-imposed barrier between professionalism, i.e. to treat this pairing as a temporary truce between attorney and thief, to collapse into enormous fondness. John comes to know Lee better as a person rather than just another case, and how that internal conflict comes to head is inevitably as bittersweet and realistic as one can get out of such an improbable pair.\n",
      "Preston Sturges' witty dialogue and ability to juggle from one mood to another (to the point that this understated melodrama briefly turns into a screwball comedy once the pair get lost in Pennsylvania, complete with invasive cows, gun-totin' farmowners, cruel justices of the peace, it's like I'm actually there) helps Remember the Night be as clever as it is, but Leisen's subtle abilities to tug at the heart-strings, injecting compassion and soft-spoken conversations in-between the brashness of the lead couple's opposite personalities, it's an element that's hard to properly define or give meaningful words to, but the swinging emotional tides make a light romantic yarn quite cozy and sweet enough to get wrapped into a stellar final scene, the film is quite adept at mending spirits and breaking hearts, with enough of a reminder that Christmas allows us to raise our sights and see the best in other people as we tumble inevitably towards a new year of uncertainty and doubt, impossibly hopeful in its downbeat moments that's able to balance out its moments of hokiness in trying to prove those above thoughts true. A lot of heart and a delicate sentiment make a simple, small, otherwise unambitious film mean more than what you'd expect.\n",

It doesn’t kick so hard until the arrival at Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson’s house 45 minutes in, but it’s so good at setting up a powerful force field of home/family issues that the sleight-of-hand of Stanwyck’s reform seems almost plausible, happening as it does in the background. There’s a direct, solemn/sad emotionality in the film that doesn’t seem like Sturges. The script is brilliant though, full of slight smart digressions that establish and deepen the characters, so that no one seems a mere repository of the film’s (considerable) wit. Just wonderful.\n",

One is at the beginning of the film, the other at the end. The camera just lingers on her face as she processes some information and moves fluidly from one emotion to another, most of it playing out only in her eyes. It's more riveting than the soliloquies of Shakespeare or sports drama speeches. I sought this out in part because of Preston Sturges but in those moments I didn't care if there was any more witty repartee left. You simply cannot take your eyes off Barbara Stanwyck.

      "My favorite Christmas movie subgenre is the Barbara Stanwyck Doesn't Know What To Do With Cows subgenre.\n",
      "That said, Remember the Night is no Christmas in Connecticut (1945). Barbara Stanwyck plays a petty thief who's invited home for the holidays--except it's not her home; it's the family home of her prosecuting attorney, played by Fred MacMurray. The story should be predictable from here, but Preston Sturges's screenplay and Mitchell Leisen's direction fit everything together so smoothly that every plot point feels completely natural and genuine.\n",
      "MacMurray and Stanwyck are a great pair, but it's Stanwyck's show all the way. First of all, she's gorgeous; her whole style for this film is sleek and flattering. Secondly, her performance is just moving. She has a couple of moments when she's alone with her thoughts after being shown an unexpected kindness, and her defenses melt so completely and so subtly that it's hard not to tear up with her at the overwhelming tenderness of it all. Knowing that Stanwyck bounced around foster homes for most of her early life adds another layer of sympathy to her performance. I'm sure the subjects of home and family were just as bittersweet for her in real life as they are for Lee Leander, and I think that element of personal history occasionally shines through in the sensitivity she shows on screen.\n",
      "I love the simple complexity of this film, too. On the surface, it's a straightforward redemption tale that might take some suspension of disbelief, but we're also consistently given insight into the different upbringings and lifestyles that produced the two main characters. Leisen generates his sympathy from the ground up--one person is not just independently good or bad. There are nurturing elements (or a lack thereof) that contribute to their personalities and behaviors, and fortunately, personalities and behaviors aren't set in stone. A brassy thief can soften just as easily as a stiff prosecutor can loosen up (and--thank goodness--just in time for Christmas).\n",
      "Come to think of it, Remember the Night and another of my Christmas favorites, The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), have basically the same message: things don't always work out exactly the way you want, but that's okay. Both films are reassuring in their acknowledgement of difficulty, and they're reminders that problems can be solved, even if you have to get arrested three times first. I've found that a lot of Christmas films from the war years have a strangely uplifting quality even if they're not completely happy, and I think it's because they're tinged with the implicit recognition that good things aren't limited to peaceful times any more than they are to a perfect relationship or a clear-cut solution. Watching other people make the best of the worst on screen is an act of artistic compassion very much in keeping with the goodwill of the holiday season.

It's funny, easygoing, and sentimental, with a dedicated cast, a sincere love story, and just enough realism to run the full gamut of emotions. It's touched with poignancy and a little heartbreak, but it never oversteps the bounds of holiday spirit open-heartedness. It'll make a worthwhile contribution to any watchlist, Christmas or otherwise.\n",

      "Shouldn't this be called \"Remember That Night?\"This Preston Sturges written script has a lot of quotable dialog....so much so that I started to wonder why this wasn't a better known established classic the way It Happened One Night or The Lady Eve are, and I think it's partly cause of the generic title (title like this is very easy to forget) and partly because of how much better known stars Fred MacMurray and Barbra Stanwick 's other movie together is. This movie could not be more different than Double Indemnity if it actively tried to be but this one came four years before that did (and according to the TCM intro of it more or less flopped upon release... apparently it was a January release which even back then was apparently regarded as a studio dumping ground)\n",
      "This is a largely Christmas set unlikely road trip movie between a shoplifter played by Stanwick and the assistant district attorney trying to put her in jail played by MacMurray who feeling guilty over pulling a maneuver in court that would see this first time serial offender sitting in a jail cell over the Christmas break (it looked very much like the jury was getting ready to acquit her because of the Christmas spirit so MacMurray not wanting to lose pushes for more time for discovery or something so the case gets held over) MacMurray then bribes the bail bondsman to let her go for the holidays in his custody because of guilt cause he's a decent guy, and when it turns out she lives in the same small town his mother and aunt and cousin all live in, they go on the road together.\n",
      "The movie is primarily an opposites attract rom-com with the cynical but guarded Stanwick trying to loosen up the straitlaced to a fault MacMurray (upon getting released into his custody she immediately complains that he's cheating her out of a decent holiday meal at the jailhouse....\"I got no family, where am I gonna go?\") (\"Well surely you must have family somewhere\") She does indeed have a mother tho when they go visiting her, it is maybe the most brutal mother daughter reunion you could imagine, the mother is terrible to Stanwick and so MacMurray extends the temporarily emotionally wrought Stanwick the offer to crash with his family thru the holidays which apparently extends to New Year's.\n",
      "Even tho the dialogue here is crackling for the first half and the tone is sharp at times very sharp...the movie sorta shifts gears to be more of a sweet romance in the second half and even tho I had much preferred the sharper more sarcastic attitude filled first half, I will admit that the extent of the warm hearted nature of the second half is disarming enough that I even started to give in to the idea that the lawyer could fall for the woman he has to try and convict. In fact the irony of the movie's romantic angle working so well is that when at the very end it has to shift back to the two of them in the courtroom, it feels off somehow as if the movie itself doesn't even want to be here but they gotta wrap this story up. (The ending felt kinda odd to me, like the note it ends on is oddly dramatic for something that had been comedic and sweet for most of its runtime)\n",
      "All that said I still really enjoyed it and think that the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable (we're lucky that a different studio saw fit to try to pair them up again several years after this had been forgotten by most people) it's that chemistry that keeps this alive and purring when it shifts from sarcastic comedy to a more conventional romance even tho you know that the plot of him trying to put her in jail has to kick back in at some point.\n",

      "Still can't get rid of Sturges as he wrote this Mitchell Leisen directed holiday romance starring, and I'm ready to pronounce my stance on this, the greatest actress of all time Barbara Stanwyck. I've praised her too many times for all the miniscule things so no bother going into that. Remember the Night is a sweet and melancholic film about acceptance, love and family. It's got a bit of a jarring structure going from a court film to a road movie then full on romance and finally going back to the courtroom. I can see why modern audiences can be put off by old Hollywood because the movies, at least many of these lesser known productions, are often far less dynamic and more episodic in nature. (The other usual complaint, acting, isn't a problem you run into with Stanwyck on-screen however).\n",
      "Leisen and Sturges paint good character portraits though. The multifacetedness is presented through simplicity and ironic humour; every person has good and bad in them. We can't choose our family nor where we grow up geographically. Some are luckier than others but everyone needs love and compassion in their lives. It's a simple, small film with a lovely silhouette shot here and there.

Being the first pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray, you can only imagine the best is yet to come - especially knowing what the two of them would be going on to make much later, because the chemistry that the two of them exude on the screen is just extraordinary.

      "Yeah, yeah, Frank Capra, but here's the thing: despite his talents as a writer and director, Crapa films often make non-Americans gag with their onslaught of sentimentality. If you want a better blend of recognisable reality but also heightened sweetness with a dry wit, then Preston Sturges is your man. It's A Wonderful Life (1946) gets a run every Christmastime, but despite its iconic status, if we can be honest for just a moment, that movie is as cloying as it is uplifting. Remember the Night should get a run as an under-seen alternative to It's A Wonderful Life. (Perhaps it would have were its title not so similar to 1958's A Night to Remember, although nothing sinks in this film.) It's a more intimate tale where Barbara Stanwick's shoplifter Lee is busted but thanks to DA Jack (Fred MacMurray) not wanting the trial to interrupt the holiday period he comes up with a technicality to have it postponed into the new year. However he feels guilty about making this woman spend Christmas in gaol, so bribes his friend to get her bailed and then they take a drive to visit family in Indiana.\n",
      "The opening courtroom scene is strange and clearly intended to be funny but isn't, however as the two hit the road the film finds its rhythm, the banter sharpens, they get into some amusing adventures, some painful history is revealed and soon enough the film had won my affections. (Almost) every character is beautifully drawn with only a handful of authorial brush strokes, Jack's family seems far more believable than most clans you see in movies, and the relationship between our two leads feels earned whereas so many other insta-love stories in contemporary films do not. As with Sturges' Sullivan's Travels (1941) the journey reveals multiple facets of the human condition, but all are handled with a deft touch and uncovered via crisp badinage.\n",
      "Lee's lonely existence reminds us all that Christmastime is not always some Norman Rockwell painting or Frank Capra movie. Many people are alone or estranged from their families, and the relentless media focus on togetherness can be hard for many at this time of the year. So this film about the comfort of strangers in many ways resonates far more than generic emotional stocking stuffer, where everyone loves each other and you know that despite whatever contrived conflict all will be well be the end. I remember when I moved to Canada I was adopted by some acquaintences for Christmas dinner, we had a nice meal and then watched Natural Born Killers (1994). It's strange and a bit sad that I can't remember their names or where they lived, but isn't that how so much of life goes? Most of us don't live in a Norman Rockwell painting, so despite social conditioning to conform, many of us respond to less conventional tales of the holiday season. I doth declare the Die Hard (1988) meme has now run its course and so we can inaugurate a new slate of alternative Christmas movies. My new holy trinity will be In Bruges (2008), The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) and Remember the Night. Happy holidays, all.\n",

The tonal shifts are emphasized by Mitchell Leisen's direction, keeping things subtle with shot selection and not overwhelming the viewer with any kind of sentimentality, despite some unfortunate stereotype humor in the early goings. Stanwyck is the glue to the whole thing, going from wisecracking thief to wounded child at the drop of a hat; the relief in her eyes as she gets to celebrate a holiday with a real family is incredibly moving. Also incredibly moving is both of the stars trying to out-grand gesture each other at the end, making big and bold sacrifices to do the least amount of harm to the other one. But the Sturges touch is still ever-present, with big laughs still poking through for the duration, like when they cross the border into Canada by essentially telling the god-to-honest truth and the genteel Canadian border guards just letting them pass through.\n",

      "This is a tough one to rate, because I’m a sucker for romantic films and I’m a sucker for Barbara Stanwyck, but the first 40+ minutes of this film are really not very good. The lengthy courtroom scene in the beginning is silly, we see a lot of shambling from an African-American servant, and the premise of the film which unfolds – that a prosecutor (Fred MacMurray) would bail a defendant (Stanwyck) out and then drive across the country with her to Indiana – is ridiculous. The scene in the cow pasture they end up in one night before being hauled in before a small town judge is too. This is definitely a film where you’ll need to be patient.\n",
      "The point at which MacMurray escorts Stanwyck to her estranged mother’s home and she turns to him and says “Gee, you’re sweet” in such a wonderfully authentic tone is where the film gets good. Stanwyck is a thief who is literally from the wrong side of the tracks, and the following scene which explains her difficult upbringing is quite good. Soon afterwards MacMurray takes her to his own home, where his loving family embrace her and act with incredible decency and kindness. His mother (Beulah Bondi) and aunt (Elizabeth Patterson) are such a sweet old pair, and a joy to watch. One of the points of the film is that the family we’re born into and the love we receive is so important in life, and I liked this message. Meanwhile, as you undoubtedly guess, Stanwyck and MacMurray begin falling for one another.\n",
      "The romantic scenes are engaging, helped considerably by how attractive and talented Stanwyck and MacMurray are. Stanwyck lights up the screen from the minute she casts a sharp glance at MacMurray in the courtroom, and never lets up. I don’t for a second believe her as the product of a broken home and a grifter with a rap sheet – she simply doesn’t convey the necessary edge for that here – but the film isn’t really going for that. There is an underlying sweetness all around, and the scenes between Stanwyck and Bondi, which might have otherwise been full of suspicion on one side and defiance on the other, have none of that. Instead we see things like Bondi lacing Stanwyck into her old corset (“When I was young, we thought 19 [inch waste] was big”), and having rational heart to heart talks about the feelings that she sees developing. These scenes are just as good as those between Stanwyck and MacMurray.\n",

      "Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in their first screen partnership. A script penned by Preston Sturges. What more could you want? Well, how about a courtroom drama, a road movie, a slapstick comedy, and a thoughtful Christmas movie all rolled into one? Collectively, it’s a stack of filmic ingredients that proved too tantalising to pass by, and I have to say, I found the oddities of the film’s fanciful scenario every bit as appealing as its sound and well-earned sentiments. There is a plentiful supply of rosy, festive good cheer to be found here, but crucially, it isn’t plastered on too thick, and the film is otherwise very much grounded in the believability of its characters. The conceit that engineers our central romance—between a petty thief and the district attorney hired to prosecute her—is precisely that, but Sturges uses both the conscious absurdity of this setup and the inherent bias of the film’s Christmas-time setting to great effect. Our attorney, Jack Sargent, makes this bias known from the outset, when he gets Lee Leander’s shoplifting case postponed on a technicality in order to bypass the projected leniency of a holiday spirit-buoyed jury, knowing full well that their judgement is compromised by the fact they are making their verdict at this typically good-natured time of the year. Of course, Jack’s attempt to circumvent the very good spirit that threatens to undo this clear-cut case comes back to bite him when he gets swept up by the same spirit of Christmas himself. The jury were ready to acquit Lee for the sake of “peace and goodwill toward all”, and by the end of the film, Jack is more than willing to do the same.\n",
      "It’s an obvious trajectory, but Sturges’ screenplay doesn’t succumb to the most obvious traps or outcomes. In fact, what follows is a curious mix of full-on farce, like a wonderful sequence where a stranded Jack and Lee get accosted by an overly-curious cow, and some disarmingly affecting and more melancholic asides that reflect on Lee’s troubled family life. Much of the narrative is built around Lee’s acceptance into Jack’s family home, after she is shunned by her estranged mother and has nowhere else to go. This welcome shown to Lee is genuinely touching, as it presents such a warm and palpable contrast to her own, much colder upbringing in a home that never offered her the same treatment. Stanwyck conveys the overwhelming emotions of being accepted in such a compassionate way so well, the camera often just lingering on her face as she quietly wells-up and observes the warmth displayed around her. It says everything about what her character has been through, and what she ultimately yearns for.\n",
      "It’s this journey of acceptance that anchors the entire film, giving it the staying power it needs beyond just that typical Christmas movie desire to shamelessly pluck at our heartstrings. But the important distinction here is that nothing feels forced or overly manipulative in the way it so easily could have been. It helps when you’ve got someone as discerning as Preston Sturges providing the strings, and a director in Mitchell Leisen who clearly knew how best to pull them, all with an evident awareness for the lessons the former wanted to impart. It also helps that Stanwyck and MacMurray’s relationship is made to feel so believable. Romantic chemistry is a term that gets thrown about a lot, but it is so crucial if we are to fully invest in a screen relationship—and I doubt few who watch Stanwyck and MacMurray perform together could ever doubt that they had such chemistry in spades. When the pair gaze into each other’s eyes here amidst a raucous New Year’s Eve party, or when Lee stands before a mirror and despondently replies “I’m afraid so” when asked about her feelings towards Jack—we very much believe that their feelings for each other are true.\n",
      "What caps this off even further is an ending that is both bittersweet and very well judged. Although we think we can see the film swinging towards an unrealistically happy resolution, about to throw in one last conceit to scupper the case and give the audience the “happy ever after” outcome they no doubt wanted, that’s not exactly what we get. Instead we get an ending in which Lee reckons with and accepts her past wrongdoings as a chance to repent and better herself, with a resolute Jack standing firmly by her side. To me, that’s a perfectly honest and realistic Christmas message to get behind if ever there was one.\n",

It's no wonder they would reunite a few years later in Double Indemnity.

Anything vying to have the audience sympathize with a crook is at least a little progressive, even if the approach is a tad simplistic. One trope I'm glad they avoided was having the girl fall back into her criminal behavior at an inopportune time to create drama. Once they reached the prosecutor's family farm, I was worried she was going to try to steal something, or someone would accuse her of doing so, and I'm glad they never even came close to that pitfall.\n",

Same with Lee's mother (Georgia Caine) who is a believable harsh woman, as if she didn't get enough love and didn't know how to pass it along.\n",

      "I certainly enjoyed this film much more on this rewatch than the first time and I can´t say why. Preston Sturges, who wrote the screenplay, summarized the film the best by saying, “Love reformed her and corrupted him.” “Remember the Night” is not on the same level as the other two Stanwyck/ MacMurray collaborations I´ve seen, “Double Indemnity” and “There´s Always Tomorrow”, but it´s a mature and deeply affecting romance that lives from the sizzling chemistry of its leading duo. Barbara Stanwyck plays a thief, which is fitting because she steals the movie and my heart. Her confident screen presence, the sincere pathos of her performance, and the mesmerizing twinkle in her eyes make me swoon. Furthermore, the film features humor, warmth, and great visual direction. In particular, the scene with the Niagara Falls in the background is really pretty. “Remember the Night” is a graceful, melancholic Christmas classic that still warms your heart 8 decades after its release.\n",
      "Fun Fact 1: One day when Preston Sturges visited the set, he told Barbara Stanwyck that he would write a screwball comedy for her. This film would become “The Lady Eve”.\n",
      "Fun Fact 2: The film was completed eight days ahead of schedule and $50,000 under budget, which Leisen attributed to Stanwyck's professionalism, saying \"She never blew one line through the whole picture. She set that kind of pace and everybody worked harder, trying to outdo her.\"\n",

      "I'm gobsmacked to come here and discover this is a universally-beloved classic. Well, I won't be bullied out of my original judgment. My apologies, but here is my dissident's report.\n",
      "This movie has the illogic of a screwball comedy but none of the rapidity and wit. Leisen heavily altered the Preston Sturges script, removing much of the fast-paced screwball patter because he presumed that Fred MacMurray was only capable of quiet strength. The result is zany situations given a leaden presentation. (Sturges was so aghast at the treatment of his work that he was driven to start directing his own scripts.)\n",
      "Take the early scene where a lawyer cooks up an implausible hypnosis defense. You can imagine this dialogue being rattled off by a smooth-talking slick-haired shark. Leisen instead assigns it to an old doddard. As the attorney drones on, we see the judge bored out of his mind and checking his watch, and we feel the same. And yet, when the jury reacts, we see them improbably won over! I don't think this scene makes sense at all given the acting and direction... the jurors seem impossibly dull-witted. The whole movie is like this. It's populated by a bunch of dullards, too slow for the silly situations to read as clever. Nearly every scene had people annoying me with their dunderheadedness in some way. Lee starts a fire in an office, and a woman throws water on a couple of men in there by mistake, but it's so languid and slow that it looks like she did it on purpose, not in panic. The men ignore Jack and Lee as they saunter out of the office, catching onto the fact that it was a distraction past the point of plausibility. Then we get a scene of supposedly-smart Jack wondering how the fire started.\n",
      "And let's not get started on Jack imitating his house staff with some truly aggressive racism.\n",
      "Nothing is quite as fatal as the fundamental premise though. A prosecuting attorney consorting with the defendant is so self-injurious and beyond the pale that it needs much more of a reasonable impetus than what we get here. Without much of a prod at all, Jack and Lee are immediately on a road trip. Maybe this is fine for a zany comedy, but this isn't shot like a zany comedy. They try to milk a cow and it's barely even playful because all the Sturges snappiness has been sloughed off.\n",
      "I know that everyone's applause must be directed at the movie's second half when it goes full-on melodramatic. I doubt anyone would celebrate the movie if it ended after the first half hour. But I think the sentimentalism only has a chance of working if you ignore the set-up, and I can't. The reality of the movie is already broken. It's established a world of idiots.\n",

Feeling sorry for her, John arranges to have her bailed. She’s duly delivered to his apartment, which wasn’t his intention. Still, it means they can have a bit of a chat and he learns that she originates from his neck of the woods and offers to take her home to visit her mother for the festive season. After all, he's already he's headed that way to stay with his mother, aunt and cousin. The journey by car is more circuitous than expected, which is a good plot contrivance because it allows the two main characters to become better acquainted. And so we learn how their relative upbringings led them to their present circumstances.\n",

And though billed as a romantic-comedy, Remember the Night is not especially laugh-filled, although there are funny moments. Rather, it’s a very warm picture, one with a handful of characters that see the best in humanity, even petty felons like Lee. And this being the era of the Hays Code, the film has to end a certain way, which will probably leave modern-day viewers with very mixed feelings.\n",

Stanwyck is Lee Leander, a petty thief caught stealing a bracelet, and MacMurray is John Sargent, a lawyer for the DA's office. When he tricks the defense attorney by insisting that his plea of hypnosis will require a stay, it leaves Lee stuck in jail over Christmas. Feeling a bit guilty, John arranges a bail bondsman to get her out, but the bondsman, assuming John wants her brought to him for a \"favor,\" dumps her off at his apartment.\n",

I don't need to go any further, because of course they fall in love. John tells his mother why Lee is there with him, and she can't believe that Lee could be a thief, and she is treated like one of the family, but mom (Beulah Bondi) tells Lee how hard John worked to become a lawyer, and is worried that their relationship could cost him his job as a prosecutor.

But for a long time all the courtroom business seemed like it had just been a pretext to get these two people together for a not-quite-screwball caper, which meant that when Sturges brought it back into the story at the end I couldn't help but feel a tiny bit as though I'd been yanked this way and that by a script that couldn't quite make up its mind. Otherwise, this is immaculate stuff: I love how the visit to the mother gives the film a sharp kick of leaden seriousness manoeuvred into so smoothly there's never the remotest suggestion the filmmakers don't know exactly what they're doing despite the distinct variation in tone. And the segment at the family home is bliss, warmly sentimental without being cloying, cut as it is with Sturges's familiar sharp insight into the foibles of small-town folk, as well as a legitimately great Sterling Holloway performance.

He's solid, he's not going to screw up, and he makes his stars look damn good. Barbara Stanwyck is pretty great here as a girl from a broken home who steals things - but is it nature or nurture? The story is predictable - if they aren't falling in love, then why am I even bothering to watch it? But damn if they don't sell it. She falls for his whole family of course, including the guy who later gives the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh, and his mom and \"aunt\", whom I've decided are a couple and you can't change my mind. On top of all that it's a Christmas movie, complete with Auld Lang Syne, and even Beulah Bondi, the same mom from It's a Wonderful Life, a movie I've watched countless times.

This is the kind of Stanwyck performance that just hits me right in the guts. A mother's rejection, seeing McMurray's family's love and warmth for each other, receiving gifts from that family, actually treated with kindness and affection, a mother's plea to let her son not ruin his career over her because of how hard he worked to get there, the realization that McMurray would throw his career away for her and refusing to let that happen on the stand, and making McMurray wait on a marriage proposal until after she serves her time in order to \"be square\"...you feel all those emotions because Babs knew how to convey them. I still cannot just pretend that McMurray's treatment of his butler isn't wholly unpleasant and it hangs over the film. I think why I cannot embrace Preston Sturges like others is how he wrote characters like Rufus. The worst of these is when Fat Mike bursts into Sargent's apartment and presses the door on Rufus' neck...it's reprehensible.

      "For example, where Miracle on 34th Street climaxes with an overwrought courtroom scene, Remember the Night has one within 10 minutes. You see, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is on trial for stealing an expensive bracelet and trying to pawn it, her third strike. Her public defender has a reputation for theatrics, and this is no exception, putting forth a hypnosis defense in a way one would expect from a junior high school mock trial. Sensing an impending acquittal, because Christmas time, Assistant DA John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) gets a continuance until after the first of the year.\n",
      "Feeling pity on the woman, Sargent bails her out, only to have the bondsman drop her on his doorstep, answered by the resident African American stereotype. (At this point, being surprised by such racism in old movies is like expecting Kirk Cameron to say something rational in Saving Christmas.) Finding out that both of them are Hoosiers, he hits upon the idea of taking her on his preplanned road trip so that both of them could see family.\n",
      "That's essentially the superficial reading of the movie, when it's really more of a redemption arc for Lee. This arc becomes noticable in a hurry when we meet her mother, a foul woman who perhaps always looked like she was about to shit a cactus, one who seemed to plant a self-fulfilling prophecy into her daughter's head. Not a loving place, especially contrasted with Sargent's doting mother (Beulah Bondi).\n",
      "This sounds like quite a trip for a love story, though it's hardly surprising given the talent behind the camera. This would be the last script written by Preston Sturges before he started to assume the director's chair himself, largely out of dissatisfaction at what he perceived as tinkering by director Mitchell Leisen, a man known for a fair amount of romanticism, and for driving writers to direct their own movies. Whomever was ultimately responsible, they remembered to give the characters enough dimension to make the audience care.\n",

      "In my opinion, this is equally as great of a classic romcom as IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT or BRINGING UP BABY or BALL OF FIRE. It might even be Barbara Stanwyck's single most charming performance.\n",
      "Lee (Barbara Stanwyck) is a petty thief who is arrested for shoplifting a bracelet. She is sent to trial where the district attorney, Jack (Fred MacMurray), bails her out for the Christmas holiday and, after taking sympathy on her, offers to take her on a road trip to be with her family.\n",
      "They go on a long trip that leads to various shenanigans, but also reveals that Lee comes from a cold and unloving mother (Georgia Kane). This one scene is really the lynchpin of the entire film, as it gives us a vision of Hell. And it makes the entire rest of the film feel much more uplifting in contrast.\n",
      "Eventually the two spend the holidays with Jack's family, but all the while they are falling in love, yet both know she will likely be imprisoned once they go back and she will stand trial. We also see how both Lee and Jack had similar childhoods, growing up in towns not too far apart, and really the only difference between them was their upbringing, which set them on very different paths in life.\n",
      "It's a heartfelt premise that has real maturity to it, and even though Jack does his best to rescue Lee, first by encouraging her to jump bail and then by trying to lose the case, I like that the film ends with Lee choosing to plead guilty, and even still, insisting on serving her sentence rather than allow Jack to rush into a marriage with her. It's a surprisingly mature ending, and I like that it treats crime and the justice system seriously.\n",
      "REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a sweet little Christmas movie, and while it shows a charming romance between two likable leads, it also tackles other themes as well and shows that romance does not allow you to magically escape from all of life's problems as so many Hollywood films often do.\n",

      "There's a moment in the car, in a field with cows and a threshing machine, middle of the night while New York state attorney, McMurray, is eating his sandwich, where Stanwyck remembers she is set to go back to jail and so desperately hopes her mother will be happy to see her. Up to this point, she's been able to forget about jail for a while and has somewhat bonded with the attorney set to put her in jail January 3rd. She's not seen her mom in a while but they didn't exactly part on good terms and Stanwyck's kleptomania might derive from trauma of her childhood. All of this exposition, though, took me away from Stanwyck, in just a change in tone, voice, and her eyes, telling a story of such absolute disappoinment and anxious longing...fear of her mother's response to seeing her is of equal weight to a prison term. Stanwyck rivals this exceptional work later when she sees her disapproving mother and at the courthouse in her refusal to let McMurray purposely lose a case she felt was a slam dunk against her.\n",

      "I must have had my curmudgeon pants on last night, because most of my friends liked the night’s second film written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen much more than I did.  This was Sturges’s last screenplay that was shot by another director as he began work on his first film as writer/director, The Great McGinty (which screens in the Sturges season next week), in the same year.\n",
      "I was right there for the first half of the film which was funny, very cleverly paced and superbly acted.  Cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff begins with a brilliant close-up of a wrist with a diamond bracelet on and we realise from the background dialogue that this woman is trying on the bracelet in a jewellers that is busy because it is close to Christmas.  When she asks the sales assistant to get another bracelet from a lower shelf, she does a runner while he is distracted.  It turns out that she is recidivist thief, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) and she gets busted when she tries to pawn the bracelet before news of the theft can be circulated.\n",
      "She goes to trial very quickly and, in some very funny courtroom scenes, her lawyer, Francis X. O’Leary (Willard Robertson), gets carried away and suggests to the jury that Lee was hypnotised by the sparkling jewels, walked out with them unknowingly, and hocked them to get bus fare to return them.  This plays into the hands of the Assistant DA who is prosecuting her, John “Jack” Sargeant (Fred MacMurray), who does not object to this fanciful story because it enables him to get an adjournment until the New Year - juries are not keen, apparently, to convict women in Christmas week.\n",
      "Sturges and Leisen cleverly get around the dead hand of the Hays Code, twice (the second time comes in the Niagara Falls scene late in the film).  When Jack hears Lee complaining to her lawyer that this means she will have to spend Christmas in jail, he feels sorry for her and organises with bail bondsman, Fat Mike (Tom Kennedy), to post her bail.  Fat Mike clearly thinks that Jack intends to have sex with Lee and delivers her to Jack’s apartment. Lee clearly thinks the same thing but, once that is cleared up, agrees to have dinner with Jack before he sets off to spend Christmas with his family.  When Jack discovers that Lee grew up in Indiana, only a few miles from where he did, he offers to drop her off at her family’s place on his way by, even though she has not seen them in years.\n",
      "Roadworks and fog on the drive see them getting lost and spending the night in Jack’s car in a field.  When the landowner, who has clearly pulled this scam before, drags them before a local JP who is in on the scam, Lee schools Jack on how to disguise who he is and sets fire to a wastepaper bin so they can escape.  Predictably, Lee’s mother (Georgia Caine) is a bitter and vindictive woman who wants nothing to do with Lee, whom she has written off years ago as an inveterate criminal.\n",
      "What had, until that point, been a polished comedy with some social justice underpinnings, takes a sharp turn into cloying sentimentality.  Jack comforts a sobbing Lee and takes her home to spend Christmas with his family, his mother (Beulah Bondi), his aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), and his young adult cousin Willy (Sterling Holloway) who seems to have a mild intellectual disability (unless this is a joke about Hoosiers that I did not get).  His family immediately thinks that Lee and Jack are romantically involved but even when Jack tells his mother the full story, she still makes Lee welcome.  \n",
      "The last part of the film, beginning with Jack’s mother’s late night chat with Lee on New Years Eve after she sees them kissing at midnight, is the classic “woman putting her needs/desires aside for the man she loves” trope.  I thought for a moment that Sturges/Leisen might be going to break the mould in a scene where Lee tells Jack that stealing is the only job she knows.  He says that, once he marries her, she will have a full time job - cooking for and keeping house for him.  The look Lee gives him suggests that a stint in the women’s prison might be a more alluring career prospect, but the moment passes and, apart from a possible night together at Niagara Falls, the plot settles down to its three-handkie conclusion.\n",
      "Stanwyck and McMurray stop this from being saccharine dross, but they have to work hard to do it.  Sturges was unhappy that Leisen altered his screenplay to move the focus from Jack to Lee and made the Jack character more subdued and less dashing than the character Sturges had written.  That seems like very astute changes as they played to the actors’ strengths.  Stanwyck is wonderful here and totally capable of carrying the movie.  Stanwyck and McMurray would go on to make three more films together, including Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in a really tough year.\n",

      "There’s a sequence a third of the way into the movie when district attorney Fred MacMurray has brought a shoplifter whom he ’s prosecuting – played by Barbara Stanwyck – home for Christmas to a small town in Indiana (don’t ask — it’s a Preston Sturges script from 1939). She came from a broken home and has never experienced any true love. And now she gets the opportunity to witness a real family enacting the Christmas spirit for the first time. MacMurray sits down at the piano to plod through a stodgy rendition of “The Old Folks at Home,” while his mother, his aunt, and their hired hand listen attentively — adoringly, even — even though he can barely stay in key. Then Stanwyck, getting into the Christmas spirit herself, sits down at the piano, and she and the hired hand — a towheaded dimwit — improvise a surprisingly moving rendition of “A Perfect Day,” and as Leisen cuts to a close-up of Stanwyck and the whole family joins together in song – “Do you think what the end of a perfect day/Can mean to a tired heart,/When the sun goes down with a flaming ray,/And the dear friends have to part?” – we realize that she’s fallen in love – not with MacMurray so much as with the fuzzy notion that an ideal world of pure love might actually exist somewhere out here in the real world, the perfect theme for a Christmas film. It’s a small moment, but it hints at a depth of character and ideas that a smart screenwriter can achieve without a word of dialogue.\n",
      "Later, there’s another great sequence. MacMurray’s old mother — played perfectly by Beulah Bondi, one of my favorite old Hollywood character actors (up there with Eugene Pallette, (seriously, she’s that good)) — who’s the salt of the earth, who’s never had a nasty thought in her life, the kind of person who accepts Stanwyck into her home with unquestioning love, invites herself into Stanwyck’s bedroom to have a woman-to-woman talk. Earlier that evening, she’d seen her son kiss Stanwyck at a barn dance. And now, unexpectedly, instead of telling her how happy she is to welcome her to the family, she explains instead that given how hard MacMurray has worked to climb out of poverty to get where he is, they shouldn’t do anything to spoil his success for him. And Stanwyck, catching the hint, decides to perform the noble role and agrees that she won’t do anything to continue leading him on. A bitter and cruel scene, in which this old lady overflowing with humanity has essentially told Stanwyck that she’s a gross slut unworthy of her son, a scene that’s made all the more powerful because Bondi plays it with such tenderness and generosity, suggesting to us that the family ideal that Stanwyck evoked in song earlier has always been merely a façade, a mask for a world that’s just as calculated and striving as the one she’s been trying to escape.\n",
      "For the rest of the movie, Stanwyck follows Bondi’s advice and pushes MacMurray aside – including an amazing scene at Niagara Falls with some of the most beautiful rear-projection I have ever seen – and Mitchell Leisen lights her so that her iridescent, watery eyes throw back the anguish of the world.\n",
      "I watched this alone in my mother’s apartment in Washington DC on Christmas Eve, the night that we Scandinavians actually celebrate Jesus’ birth. My mother had gone to church after dinner to sing in the choir for the evening service, and though she hinted that I could join them if I wanted, I decided to stay home. I haven’t been to a service in more than twenty years and I didn’t want to jinx anything by ruining my streak. Mom would never say anything out loud, of course (she’s Norwegian-American, after all) but I could tell she would’ve liked it if I had come. But then she has her faith and I have mine.\n",
      "The movies — especially old Hollywood movies, with their emotional register that strikes so many people today as sentimental —serve the same purpose for me as the church once did when I was young: it’s a window onto the world and thus a window onto the self, a reprieve from the world and the self but also an uncomfortable reminder of the insoluble imperfections of both.\n",
      "Sturges and Leisen stage the final scene in a holding cell after a trial in which Stanwyck has admitted her guilt so that she’ll be sent to prison to save MacMurray from her inherent sinfulness. Appropriately for a Christmas movie, the story is about the idea of redemption. And yet, its happy ending is leeched through with darkness and uncertainty. Recall the title of the film. We can forgive, yes, but to what end? Will this forgiveness lead to any reformation or just another cycle of judgment and shame? A wonderfully jaded – but, admittedly, dimly hopeful – Christian parable.\n",

They flirt so naturally; their feelings are born out of honesty, and strength of character - a rare thing to see in romantic comedies of any era. Stanwyck is especially skilful at conveying all the passion bubbling away beneath the surface. Her subtlety is aided by the beautiful, intimate black and white imagery. This is one of the most gorgeous looking rom-coms I can think of. Director Mitchell Leisen really knows how to make his leading actresses light up the screen. He shoots Stanwyck to perfection nearly every time, as she once again proves she can do no wrong. Preston Sturges’ screenplay is rife with layered flirtations, and fills the story with quirky side characters, before giving way to a more melancholy final third. By the time the inevitable rolls around, it’s infinitely more moving than the early, lighthearted antics might indicate. This has instantly become one of my favourite Christmas classics.\n",

Early on, it might feel like Remember the Night is marching towards an inevitable finale. Yet, not only does the film eschew a predictable outcome, but it is so engaging throughout that one almost forgets its plot will need a resolution at all.

Yes, 1940, but there are plenty of films of the time that portrayed black people in roles of domestic servitude without making them the butt of a joke (or several jokes, none of which were funny). I also found it jarring the way our leading man goes from an uptight man of virtue to one willing to break the law and take a huge chance on destroying his career over a woman he just met, almost overnight. I get that’s the whole point of the movie, the way this unlikely couple falls in love, but the change that comes over him feels so abrupt, and with a few tweaks - even just one more scene of our pair talking where it appears to dawn on him that he’s falling for her - it could have been more believable. \n",

She can appear innocent in one film and domineering in the next.

Her range is incredible, as she seamlessly switches between comedic, romantic, and dramatic modes. She teams up with her future “Double Indemnity” screen partner Fred MacMurray, but this time they play decent people (if you ignore the shoplifting). The two have cute chemistry, though I like MacMurray more when his characters have a slimy edge.

I guess Leisen just needed to helm a holiday romantic drama instead of a screwball comedy for his gifts to really shine, reworking and streamlining Preston Sturges script into a spry <95 min there-and-back-again structure that smartly foregrounds the romance over the comedy. The right amount of wit still remains, but with a real sense of weight to proceedings that even Sturges rarely made approached. The film satirizes and celebrates small-town middle-America in ways both funny and perceptive, especially in how it contrasts the effects familial love (and lack thereof) have on the development and eventual character people have—yet it doesn’t use the lack of love Stanwyck’s character received as a child as an excuse for her criminal behaviour, but takes her on an arc of moral progress through the treatment MacMurray’s family shows her without becoming moralizing (in a heavy-handed way, at least). It helps that MacMurray and especially Stanwyck are just absurdly great, and in an entirely different register than their iconic pairing in Double Indemnity—Stanwyck’s turn here should be included alongside the great acting-with-their-eyes-that-says-more-than-the-dialogue performances. Really wish there wasn’t that…let’s say, insensitive racial caricature in the first act; it’s a big yikes that distorts and almost perfect film.\n",

Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray make quite the team together, it's no wonder that they were duo for three more movies. All the moments spent together at the sergeant's house were warm and lovely. And of course, the scene at Niagara Falls brought all the feels next to that ambiguous ending. Dammit morse code showed no mercy in 1940.

      "A film that earns its warmth precisely because of the bracing blasts of cold. Case in point: Jack’s salt-of-the-earth family is heart-meltingly gracious to Lee (who they correctly recognize as his love interest before he does), acutely aware of her lack of a loving family. Which makes Jack’s mother’s gentle, last-minute pleading for Lee not to taint her son all the more devastating. The same goes for Lee’s ill-fated visit to her estranged mother, a rejection as painful as any ostensible comedy would dare. At every turn I was disarmed by the sensitivity of Preston Sturges’ script; each complication is treated with the gravity of drama rather than comedy, and potential stock characters are gifted with uncommon depth. Stanwyck especially digs into her character’s pain without losing any of her delicious wit.\n",
      "Not that this isn’t funny. Sturges devotes one of the very first scenes to a defense lawyer’s lengthy, increasingly ludicrous performance for the jury, and I adored moments like Sterling Holloway’s Jack McBrayer-style cowpoke revealing a beautiful singing voice. Everyone gets their share of snappy lines, though Remember the Night isn’t in quite the same register as Sturges’ take-no-prisoners comedies. That’s likely due to director Mitchell Leisen, who brings a more restrained tone as well as a lovely visual elegance. In hindsight, it’s all in preparation for the gut-punch of an ending, where each character gets their own gesture that's as hopeful as it is bittersweet. Not bad for sharing space with a goofy cow-milking scene.\n",

Playing to type here, as the good-natured, intelligent lawyer, MacMurray is superb. But as with any film she is in, Stanwyck steals it, and with ease. Bottled lightning. She is one of the great actresses. It may not have the verve of her early pre-code performances in Night Nurse or Baby Face; nor is she quite as good as she was in, say, The Lady Eve or Double Indemnity, but this is a great turn, that is surprisingly emotionally resonant, for a film that starts so funny. Again the scene between Stanwyck and her mother is one of the best Stanwyck scenes I have seen. And that is high praise indeed.\n",

Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were a superb screen pairing, probably best remembered for their scandalous affair in Double Indemnity, though here Stanwyck is in total opposition to her famous femma fatale persona, putting in a heart-breaking performance as a shoplifter with such disarming tenderness that you can't help falling for her too.\n",
      "Leisen is fast becoming the greatest screen romanticist after Borzage in my estimations, a director able to stage his scenes with the utmost beauty and sensitivity that the production design itself seems to carry more importance than the story—it may well have been funnier with Sturges behind the camera directing his own script, but his more contentious style would likely have dampened the romantic milieu that is so wonderfully maintained here, the attention to detail in regards to lighting and props is always taken into thoughtful consideration.\n",
      "There is an unfortunately stereotypical portrayal of Fred Toones' black servant character, who MacMurray treats with what seems like contempt and irritability, making his character more difficult to like, though aside from this there are very few, if any other missteps in this utterly charming romantic comedy—the road trip sequence is a memorable standout, the two leads beginning to fall in love as they get lost and wake up in the middle of a field of cows, which they naturally decide to milk and get dragged to court by the farmer.

      "It reminded me of years ago when I had allowed my inner Grinch out while playing keyboards in a goth band. It was around the holidays and we were rehearsing in a garage. Even though it was very cold at the time, I felt comfortable there. I was in a safe space, surrounded by other people like me. People who’d devoted their lives, or at least their free time, to the darkness. People who lived outside the constraints of normal, sunny society. People who wore dark eyeliner, and knew where the orchestral setting on the keyboard was, and had seen The Crow. I was so comfortable that I off-handedly mentioned that I don’t like Thanksgiving or xmas. Something, at the time, that I really didn’t think was a big deal. I was very naive. My bandmates' faces dropped. I felt immediately ostracized. An outcast even among the outcasts. In trying to convince me that I was wrong, the singer said to me, “It’s not that you don’t like the holidays, you just have a bad relationship with your family.” I was an adult playing keyboards in a goth band in a garage in New Jersey, I obviously didn’t have a great relationship with my family. It wasn’t until weeks later that I remembered that goths love xmas because of their hero Jack Skellington and that I had basically committed blasphemy against him.\n",

      "This is a surprisingly tender film given its initial premise, and it might be Barbara Stanwyck's best performance. A soft-hearted DA feels bad about a career jewel thief spending Christmas in jail so he pays the woman's bond, and they end up embarking on a poignant roadtrip together to visit their families for the holidays and predictably fall in love. I really had no idea where this film was going for most of it and was not expecting the ending at all.\n",
      "Stanwyck begins the film as her typical comedic bad-girl persona, though we hardly hear a line from her for at least the first fifteen minutes of the film. We open on her wrist donning an expensive bracelet. The wrist leaves the frame. Next we see her at a distance, rushing down the avenue to pawn the bracelet. She enters a pawn shop but the camera remains outside on the street, just peeking through the doorway where we see her exchange muted words with the pawnbroker. He knows something is up, and closes the door on us. Next thing we know we're in the courtroom where she stands trial. For the next ten minutes we get a monologue from her defense lawyer addressing the jury. We've yet to hear Stanywck really say anything, but as the camera continuously cuts to her during the monologue, we get her facial reactions - surprised yet impressed by her lawyer's ridiculous yarn - which are brilliant and hilarious - silent acting at its finest.\n",
      "Then we mostly get Stanwyck being Stanwyck - full of moxie and wit and seemingly self-assured. We even get a great scene with Stanwyck acting alongside an adorable cow that deserves some sort of animal Oscar, if only to acknowledge the poor debasement the animal was subjected to for the scene. The film changes gears around the midway point when we meet her estranged mother - a miserable figure who has denounced her daughter and won't accept the young woman back into her life. Stanwyck and MacMurray then go visit his family - the polar opposite - and it's here that Stanwyck is smothered with kindness and produces one of her finest performances.\n",
      "The subtle discomfort that Stanwyck displays when around MacMurray's family, the fact that she has never been around such kind people and it almost makes her feel worse about herself, is expressed entirely through Stanwyck's eyes, fleeting glances at the warm, accommodating people she's surrounded by. When Stanwyck is left alone, she finds herself overwhelmed with emotion, coming to tears as she grapples with what she's being offered, and whether or not she even deserves this.\n",
      "The ending is phenomenal. While upholding the standards of the Hays Code, the film manages to both punish Stanyck's character as a thief, while still allowing her to \"redeem\" herself and continue to garner our sympathies. It ends in a jail cell - with a kiss and an embrace - one of overwhelming passion. I wasn't expecting it to end there, but then the credits rolled and I realized I was pleasantly satisfied.\n",
      "Some of the cinematography in this film is out of sight - particularly the interior shots of the homes in Indiana - the lighting and shadows have noir vibes. And the penultimate scene at Niagara Falls - whether or not that was a set - the Falls frozen in winter, Stanwyck and MacMurray silhouetted against it, is a brilliant image.\n",
      "My only complaint with this film is that MacMurray makes for a poor Boy Next Door. He's best playing toxic skeezeballs. I had trouble taking him seriously as a mama's boy from Indiana, and he doesn't quite have the right charm that this role required. But it didn't really detract from my enjoyment at all, and I wonder if I hadn't already seen him in Double Indemnity and The Apartment that I would have felt the same.\n",
      "Another note: This is a Preston Sturgess script. I've been watching a number of Sturgess films lately and I've noticed one thing that stands out in his stories - the presence of Black actors. Now, the depictions in these stories is rarely flattering by any means, but when you start to realize that all the screwball comedies penned by Sturgess have Black actors - who are primarily absent in almost all other screwball films of the era - you start to wonder what Sturgess's intent was through their inclusion. As I said, the depictions are rarely flattering - the characters are always the help and always subservient. MacMurray even describes his servant/butler (?) as \"Not very smart but he's a great cook.\" I did enjoy the porter in The Palm Beach Story continuously calling yachts \"yachets\" because seriously, why is it spelled y-a-c-h-t? In Sullivan's Travels Sturgess has a very clear purpose in his inclusion of Black actors - they make up a church congregation with whom Sullivan and some prisoners of a chain gang get to watch cartoons, and its here that Sullivan realizes that the \"common man\" doesn't need drama - they need comic relief. Part of me wants to think Sturgess just wanted to remind white audiences that they're not alone in this country, but another part of me maybe just thinks Sturgess sees Black people as \"the help\" and sources of comedy. Either way, his films gave roles to Black actors, which is not something other screwball comedies of the era did. I'm sure there's some more informed writing on this elsewhere.\n",

      "Still utterly delightful. Stanwyck was a goddess created to deliver Preston Sturges’ dialogue to the masses. MacMurray has so much more range than initially meets the eye. And the two’s chemistry is simply electric. They carry a slightly hokey, deeply sentimental story without once dropping your interest. The screenplay laces the passionate, bubbling romance with touches of melancholy, while Leisen’s direction is careful, restrained and efficient. It’s top tier effort all around - a Christmas film that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the all-time classics. I’m very glad I revisited this one, and reminded myself what an absolute pleasure it is.\n",

      "Remember the Night is a romantic dramedy following a sympathetic attorney and the comely shoplifter he has taken home for the Christmas holiday as love blooms between them.\n",
      "I really have no idea how I didn’t know this was a Christmas film until now but it’s immediately became a new favourite of mine and one that I’ll definitely revisit. Remember the Night is a perfectly paced and very well written piece of early 1940s cinema that sets its story up perfectly within the first 10 minutes or so and manages to remain consistently entertaining and engaging throughout the rest of the film. Although a lot of classic Hollywood films can feel a little laughable at times with how fast the romance stories move along but thanks to Preston Sturges’ excellent screenplay and the superb performances from both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, it feels so believable and easy to become invested in.\n",
      "It’s great to see the romance slowly build throughout the film without ever feeling rushed, boasting some terrific chemistry from Stanwyck and MacMurray that’s always enjoyable to watch. What’s also interesting is the morale questions raised about Stanwyck’s character who is a criminal, one of the main plot points of the film yet she’s also written, directed and played as a very likeable character who goes on quite an interesting journey throughout the film, something that makes the ending effective and thought provoking. The cinematography is amazing, presenting so many wonderfully set up shots that draw you into its captivating story through the beautiful filmmaking on display. The soundtrack also works, never outstaying its welcome and always fitting the film’s tone brilliantly. \n",
      "Overall, Remember the Night is filled with excellent performances, gorgeous cinematography, fantastic direction and brilliant writing. The romance between Stanwyck and MacMurray is set up brilliantly and the story remains thoroughly interesting and entertaining from its superb opening scene to its bold and effective ending. Definitely a new favourite Christmas film of mine.\n",

      "I finally broke down and bought a blu ray copy of this highly underrated Christmas film as after every viewing I enjoy it just a little more.\n",
      "Much like love this is a bittersweet story with two knockout performances in a near perfect film that is sadly marred by a pretty racist character in the beginning that takes a little away from it as a whole but seeing the brilliant pairing of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray several years before their team up in my favorite noir but playing such a different pair reminds me of how damn good they are and helps to balance out the ugly aspects that date it as a product of its time.\n",
      "This is a few different films in one as it bounces between a courtroom dramedy (with one of the best and funniest defense lawyer performances in history) and road trip with a classic rom com set up as Stanwyck plays Lee Leander, a thief who was just pinched for stealing and trying to pawn a bracelet and MacMurray is John \"Jack\" Sargent, the prosecutor tasked with putting her away. Knowing that at Christmas the jurors go soft Jack gets an extension of the trial but feels guilty when he hears Lee complaining about being locked up for the holiday.\n",
      "Even though the setup is pretty by the book the chain of events leading to romance isn't. After Jack gets a bondsman to have Lee freed the bondsman assumes something sleazy is going on and drops Lee at Jack's place.\n",
      "That Jack is a decent guy who only felt bad about locking Lee up is a surprise to Lee and when the two find out they're both from Indiana Jack offers Lee a ride to reconnect with her estranged mother on his way to visit his family and slowly starts to realize that Lee isn't bad, just unloved from an early age.\n",
      "The chemistry between the two is palpable and the road trip aspect works really well with the two of them getting into a slight jam after accidentally trespassing and Jack ends up being a small time criminal himself in a nice nod to showing that not everyone who breaks the law is necessarily guilty, bad or deserving of a harsh sentence.\n",
      "The meeting with Lee's mom does so much more to humanize Lee than any dozens of lines could and the warmth and acceptance Lee has been lacking in her life and finds at Jack's family farm is the beating heart of the film.\n",
      "Stanwyck is one of, if not my favorite actress from the 40's and she brings such a depth and loneliness to her character that finally has someone who cares about her and that she cares about in return.\n",
      "Jack's slow realization that the worst thing about someone doesn't define them feels earned and his everyman small town decency is charming and wonderful.\n",
      "It's also just really funny. Preston Sturges wrote the screenplay and although he and Stanwyck would work together on The Lady Eve one year later this has a slightly better mix of comedy and melancholy for me with an ambiguous ending that doesn't tie everything up with a bow.\n",

      "Moved to disappointment by the festive season, New York District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) lets attractive thief Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) out on bail and suggests that she has a journey home to Indiana. Along the way, they have a confrontation with a Pennsylvania sheriff, encounter each others’ parents, and sooner or later fall in love.\n",
      "John's mother, however, doesn’t like this, and seriously tells Lee to stay away, in case she damages John's job. Not aiming to cause distress, Lee resolutions to leave the man she really likes.\n",
      "Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck both give very good performances in their respective roles as John and Lee. John is the District Attorney who postpones the trial to Lee can spend Christmas with her family, while Lee is the woman who is caught shoplifting for the third time, but won’t be going behind bars.\n",
      "They both suit their roles very well, providing moments of charm and humour in the process and make the most of the time they have on the screen.\n",

      "The direction from Leisen is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a pleasant atmosphere happening as well.\n",
      "The script is written to an excellent standard by Preston Sturges as he makes the movie really easy to follow and creates funny moments too. But even when the movie isn’t funny, you can still understand what is happening, because the narrative is definitely there from beginning to end.\n",
      "The camera stands out best in terms of the technical aspects in glorious black-and-white, because it makes very good use of the locations and also captures the humorous occasions well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status.\n",
      "This film would be the last that Preston Sturges would write for another director – he would go on to do this own movie career following this with The Great McGinty, a movie which won him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n",
      "Overall, Remember the Night is a really enjoyable movie to watch, thanks to the very good and central performances and chemistry from Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, along with Mitchell Leisen’s direction and Preston Sturges’ well-written, funny script. One festive treat from start to finish.\n",

      "Prémisse parfaite de comédie romantique: elle, accusée à raison de vol à l'étalage, ce n'est pas sa première offense ; lui, procureur, carrière impeccablement honnête, spécialiste pour mettre les femmes en prison ; le tribunal est reporté de quelques jours, dans l'entre-temps ils tombent en amour, évidemment.\n",
      "La première moitié du film est aussi bonne que les meilleures comédies romantiques de l'époque, très drôle, dialogues savoureux, et qui peut résister aux regards que lance Barbara Stanwick à Fred MacMurray (lui me laisse plus indifférent, mais il fait la job), ou à ses \"gee you're sweet\" murmuré à mesure qu'elle se rend compte qu'elle tombe amoureuse? C'est écrit par Sturges, et on voit qu'il a dû s'inspirer de ce film quand il a écrit Lady Eve pour Stanwyck, dans un rôle semblable de criminelle qui tombe amoureuse d'un homme d'une autre classe sociale (d'ailleurs, ça m'étonne toujours à quel point les films de cette époque dealaient assez franchement avec les différences de classe pour en faire un réel enjeu, ce qui a pratiquement disparu avec le temps). On reconnaît aussi certaines structures de scènes que Sturges aime bien, les personnages secondaires qui commentent l'action principale, comme des spectateurs.\n",
      "Bref, on a Stanwyck, extraordinaire, toujours à devoir s'affirmer contre le jugement des autres, mais peu à peu elle se fait rattraper par la morale, elle se plie à certaines conventions pour séduire son mec (plutôt que de l'entortiller dans ses mensonges comme dans Lady Eve) et même si elle demeure très émouvante dans le drame qu'elle vit (qui n'est pas sans rappeler à certains égards celui de Stella Dallas), même s'il y a quelque chose d'assez audacieux dans la transition de la comédie vers le mélodrame, on a un peu l'impression que c'est le film plus que la société qui finit par se dresser dans le chemin de Stanwyck. Je sais pas trop pourquoi, c'est un peu ambigu (il y a une manière de voir la fin de manière plus positive), mais il y a quelque chose qui ne passe pas tout à fait, qui n'arrive pas à être aussi nuancé que peut l'être Stella Dallas.\n",
      "Je mets un gros cœur pour Stanwyck pareil, parce qu'il y a quelques moments incroyablement émouvants qui passent entièrement par son jeu, qui nous surprend en passant du registre du screwball au mélodrame avec une fluidité toute émouvante. Il aurait suffit de pas grand-chose pour que ce soit vraiment excellent.\n",

      "Remember the Night is warm, witty comedy; that drifts between a screwball set-up and into a pure romantic drama. I do not think that it is any surprise that Preston Sturges is credited as the screenwriter, because the film has a lot of his first-class dialogue, though it may lack his directorial nous. It runs towards sentimental in the second half, but the tremendous performances from the peerless Barbara Stanwyck, and Fred MacMurray keep it fresh and watchable. A Christmas film par excellence, that deserves to be switched into the Christmas film rotation.\n",
      "A film for anyone that thinks MacMurray is only good in Billy Wilder films playing against type. Playing to type here, as the good-natured, intelligent lawyer, MacMurray is superb. But as with any film she is in, Stanwyck steals it, with ease. One of the great actresses, it may not have the verve of her early pre-code performances in Night Nurse or Baby Face; nor is she quite as good as she was in, say, The Lady Eve or Double Indemnity, but this is a great turn, that is surprisingly emotionally resonant, for a film that starts so funny. The scene between Stanwyck and her mother is one of the best Stanwyck scenes I have seen. And that is high praise indeed.\n",

Above all, it is blessed by the talented performances of FRED MACMURRAY, BARBARA STANWYCK (in one of her best roles I've seen thus far) and BEUAH BONDI (Make Way for Tomorrow, It’s A Wonderful Life, Mr Smith Goes to Washington), who epitomizes the compassionate mother-in-law.\n",
      "The script by PRESTON STURGES is extremely well written, asserting itself well in scenes of levity and gravity alike. Never in a million years did I expect to see two people trespass a farmer’s property all on ‘ignorance of fact,’ pass the night without doing ‘a little passionate necking’ and proceed the next morning to TRY to milk a cow who decided to visit them.

      "With the shifts toward drama, MITCHELL LEISEN’s fine direction and the detail-oriented editing by future Billy Wilder collaborator, DOANE HARRISON, dually help emphasize this character study of Lee as an outcast from her own family as well as from society. Empathy and compassion are a crucial part of how Lee and John eventually see eye to eye and fall in love, and by introducing the roadmap to the viewer early in steady trickles, Leisen ensures that when the moments of decision do eventually happen, they feel realized to us and right to each character.\n",

John’s cognizance of how she feels in the remark he makes to Mrs. Leander as they make their farewells speeds the arc of their relationship further along to when she arrives as a guest at the Sargent residence and we see Beulah Bondi’s Mrs. Sargent take Lee in like her own daughter. What a homely part of this film where Lee joins in the Christmas festivities, and how can one not appreciate the New Year’s kiss scene, the pivotal moment in front of the Niagara Falls or the final act in court.

But Remember the Night plays into the hands of simple moral good, clear message, no risks taken; it has all the workings of a didactic piece. But it’s the other elements that make this film so lovely. Barbara Stanwyck is unaffected, alluring, from beginning to end. From her witticisms to her emotional displays of longing, regret, happiness, love, and her pragmatic, heartbreaking endearments, it’s no wonder that her prosecutor’s initial base altruism blossoms into passionate love, and I’ve fallen for Babs too. Fred MacMurray: “Don’t you think I’m the best judge of what’s good for me and what I want most in this world?” Of course, Babs is the star here, but when it’s time for MacMurray to experience some heartfelt pining, he does shine, playing the part with emotional affliction.

Its jokes don't land as hard for me, especially when the quips are equally smarmy and lingering rather than always varietal or quickly-paced.\n",

Many argue this is his finest.\n",

Back home again in Indiana, the mushy grace of Mitchell Leisen (\"You know where we're going for our honeymoon?\") and the infinite cynicism of a Preston Sturges (\"People aren't responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls\") are, with only a few moments of indecision, wed.

      "Mitchell Leisen's Christmastime romance Remember the Night finds Barbara Stanwyck at her most adorable. The script was written by Preston Sturges, and although Sturges was very unhappy with the liberties taken by Leisen, the changes resulted in a more tender, emotionally grounded film. Stanwyck is Lee, a shoplifter who goes home for the holidays with assistant District Attorney Jack (Fred MacMurray). Despite the film containing some screwball elements, the unlikely romance that develops between the two feels organic in a way that is rare for Old Hollywood. The magnificent lead performances, especially the vulnerability shown by Stanwyck, make us believe that this mismatched pair would really fall in love. Remember the Night's bittersweet ending has remained with me in the day since I watched the film, so perhaps it is even better than I had initially believed.\n",

      "I had to review at least one good Christmas movie tonight. After rewatching that North Pole stinker, \"Santa Claus the movie\", I needed to wash the taste of failure out of my mouth. 1940's \"Remember the Night\", with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck was just the thing needed. She plays a shoplifter and he plays the D.A. who prosecutes her on Christmas Eve. Rather than have her spend the holiday in jail until the trial starts, the ol' softie takes her with him while he visits his family. As you can imagine the two fall quickly in love. Of the two Christmas movies Barbara Stanwyck made, I much prefer this one, even though there are some cringe worthy moments when the era's blatant racism is displayed in some early scenes with MacMurray's man servant. Yikes! What were they thinking? The chemistry between the two leads is real, and the ending, when MacMurray attempts to lose the case on purpose, so his newfound love can avoid any prison time, doesn't seem at all farfetched. Stealing scenes left and right is squeaky-voiced Sterling Holloway. A wonderful character actor from back in the day, and the voice of Winnie the Pooh for many, many years. He alone makes the movie worth your while. I believe it's still available on demand at TCM. Watch it before your Christmas tree turns into next years compost.\n",

The beautiful Barbara Stanwyck's outstanding portrayal of a woman shaped by a troubled past, intertwined with co-star Fred MacMurray's portrayal of a compassionate prosecuting attorney, creates a movie filled with warmth and style. Director Leisen and writer Sturges skillfully blend their leads' personas to avoid excessive sentimentality while showcasing a transformative journey. The initial legal aspects might seem a little quirky and distant from reality, but the film compensates with a genuine portrayal of emotion. The conclusion seems slightly off and bittersweet.

      "About the only thing that's consistent between the two is Barbara herself, whose acting and choices in fashion are still the most superb aspect of the production. In fact, performance-wise, Stanwyck probably impressed me even more in this one. I feel like she's one of those great actresses who can communicate so much with just her eyes and her demeanor that she makes every scene she appears in absolutely mesmerizing and owns every single line of dialogue.\n",

Fred MacMurray does an alright job as Jack Sargeant and the two have nice chemistry in a lot of their scenes, but his characterization is rather inconsistent and the way he falls in love with Lee doesn't really feel organic and sown-out well enough. (The romance in Christmas in Connecticut happened fast too, but at least that had the excuse of playing out over two nights, whereas this is implied to take place over at least a couple weeks).\n",
      "The biggest thing that made Remember the Night really off-putting for me was the over-exaggerated comical characters in its first half, from the incredibly bombastic prosecutor to Sargeant's dim-witted assistant, which uhh... it's very unfortunate that this film couldn't resist taking a spoonful of some good ol' fashioned 1940's racism. Boy, is that whole section uncomfortable.\n",
      "The fact that it starts out as such a screwball ends up feeling weird, especially since it ends as a soft and more sentimentally grounded story that I was finally getting into. I guess if it had been more centered on Lee and Jack and this intimate story it seems to want to tell than on everything else, I could have appreciated it a lot better.\n",

This can only make me wonder just how much better Sturges' original screenplay could have been because despite him being so unsatisfied with the experience, this film is absolutely wonderful. Sturges' sly wit is very much on display, even if it's a tad more sentimental than some of his later efforts. But what's wrong with sentimentality? It's freakin' Christmas!

      "If you can get over that high concept, and admittedly, it isn’t hard to, it’s a fun film. MacMurray’s a bit stiff to be convincing as a romantic lead, he fared better being the jaded suspicious lover in “Indemnity.” But Stanwyck is fantastic, both hard edged and sensual when the script requires. It’s a screenplay with some surprisingly dark moments, but they’re appropriate to the story and even the season. The early courtroom scenes are fun, as is the comedic road trip through Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Stanwyck meeting her mother for the first time in many years is an effective, heartbreaking scene. The further scenes in the household where MacMurray’s family openly accepts Stanwyck are heartwarming, and really get me in the holiday mood. The ending is predictable, and I was disappointed in how some things in the screenplay weren’t planned as much as I would have liked. But for classic Hollywood, this is a good holiday offering. Three stars.\n",

      "District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) is prosecuting Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) for shoplifting. When the case is suspended for the holiday break Leander is released on bail. Sargent feels sorry for Leander being alone for the holidays so he eventually brings her to his childhood home to spend the period between Christmas and New Years with his family where she gets to experience a true family Christmas and just maybe fall in love. On paper this movie has a ridiculously improbable premise that would be more befitting a Hallmark Channel original production. But the story and screenplay by Preston Sturges is so excellent that it transcends the sitcom setup to be one of the most warm hearted, romantic, and inspirational holiday themed movies you'll ever see. How this one has flown under my radar all these years is a mystery. I'm always on the lookout for quality holiday entertainment outside of the standard classics that are always mentioned. Why this film is never included in the conversation amongst the likes of It's A Wonderful Life, A Holiday Affair, The Shop Around the Corner etc. is puzzling. It's every bit as good as those films and deserves to be included when speaking about the finest holiday set films from Hollywood's classic era. What is most impressive with this one is how multi dimensional the characters are allowed to be. On the surface this could have been just a screwball comedy but instead it is a rather heartfelt, bittersweet, tale that is deeply imbued with the Christmas spirit. My only quibble with this one is what amounts to a rather downbeat ending. I think the ending fits the story and is probably the only logical place for it to land but it's still likely going to be unsatisfying to those who've grown accustomed to every Christmas themed movie being wrapped up in a nice, neatly packaged ending where everything turns out perfect. That this isn't that type of movie is both part of its appeal but is also what has likely kept it from being more of a perennial favorite. That being said, this is a classic in waiting that deserves a wider yuletide audience and is highly recommended for those looking for alternative holiday time fare.\n",

      "Remember the Night does follow a standard romcom formula of having two people stuck together, and by the end of it, they're in love. In this case, it's prosecutor John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), who ends up taking home shoplifter Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) rather than let her spend Christmas and New Year's in jail. The cross-country drive ends with them falling for one another in a way that feels a bit predictable, but is at least enjoyable to watch with MacMurray and Stanwyck.\n",
      "Most of this feels fairly generic, and MacMurray's mindset in a few points was hard to follow, but at least the end is a bit stronger than many of these, first with Sargent trying to throw the case so Leander is acquitted, and then Leander changing her plea to guilty both to prevent Sargent from jeopardizing his career, and because she feels she has to have paid for her wrongdoings before she has any chance with Sargent. It's an emotional sort of conclusion, and it's not the overly happy ending that feels so common. It even eschews the quick wedding after that because Leander wants to enter the marriage clean, and with Sargent having had the time to be sure. It's a strong ending, one that pulls the rest of the movie up with it by ending on such a powerful final note.\n",

They have great chemistry together, and I could watch them team up in a dozen more movies.\n",

A DA who feels sorry for a criminal around the holidays gets her bailed out and agrees to take her home for Christmas and bring her back in time for her trial, since they come from small towns nearby each other. It's part courtroom drama, part rom-com road trip, and it all works together really well. Parts of it are very predictable, but the journey is so charming that it doesn't matter.

      "But Fred feels bad about having poor Barbara stuck in jail for the holidays, so he asks a bail bondsman to do him a favor and get her released. The bail bondsman thinks he wants Barbara released so he can have sexytimes with her (they don't come right out and say this, what with the Hays Code being in place at the time this was made, but it's not-so-subtly insinuated) so he has Barbara brought to Fred's apartment. One thing leads to another and Fred brings Barbara along to visit his mother (Beulah Bondi, who would go on to play James Stewart's mother in \"It's a Wonderful Life\") back in good old Indiana. Feelings develop between Barbara and Fred, naturally, which complicates matters.\n",
      "Let's get the obvious out of the way first: when it comes to movies starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, \"Remember the Night\" pales in comparison to \"Double Indemnity\". Of course, to be fair, \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the greatest movies ever made and \"Remember the Night\" is a slight, likable-enough romantic comedy/drama. I watched this for Yuletide ambiance and, in that regard, \"Remember the Night\" was a bit disappointing. It doesn't have that magical Christmas vibe. It could take place at virtually any time of the year. There's a gift exchange scene but, frankly, it could easily have been a birthday party if not for the Christmas tree in the corner. There's a New Years Eve hoedown but, well, hoedowns don't exactly scream festive cheer.\n",

      "Also, the fact that MacMurray's mother basically guilts Stanwyck into sacrificing herself to prison time so as not to disrupt MacMurray's career sits weirdly with me. Beulah Bondi is great here, such a manipulative character but given such a warm regard by the film that you can see why Stanwyck would be completely convinced by her largely self-serving platitudes. Would it really be so terrible if MacMurray just whiffed on this one particular case, let her get off, and then romanced her afterward? Would the justice system crumble? Would his job actually be compromised? I doubt it. But Stanwyck must learn a moral lesson and go to jail so that the morality of American Cinema can be preserved. It's not just that this ending was probably preferred by the Hays Office, it's that you can practically feel them rewriting the ending before your very eyes. All due respect to screenwriter Preston Sturges, but this is not one of his best efforts.\n",

      "\"Remember the Night\" is a trifle, but Stanwyck and MacMurray make it worth a look. But if it's Christmas atmosphere you're looking for, I'd steer you to the Yuletide romance of Robert Mitchum's \"Holiday Affair\" or Stanwyck's \"Christmas in Connecticut\" instead.\n",

Indiana legitimately feels like another world: suddenly there’s more “en plain air” (via a backlot) compositions, more personal clutter paired with interior continuity (the camera bouncing across rooms and up and down stairs in the second home), and a closer proximity to death; references to deceased family members abound. The warmth of the second home relies on the acknowledgement of the march of time, with its pictures, heirlooms and stowed-away wedding dresses; the prevailing chilliness of the first home is a different reaction to the same source.

Stanwyck is magnetic, cold and impassive to begin with before slowly opening up, her eyes shining as the warmth of MacMurray and his family shows her a new way forward. The scene with her mother is haunting and brutal in a way I don't expect in a film like this, more noir than romance. Contrasts perfectly with the lovely, homely scene on Christmas morning, idealistic but in a way that feels real. Brought a tear to my eye, I'm a sucker for this kind of sentimentality, broken people finding connection. But probably most memorable for that ending which uses the Code (the criminal can never be allowed to go free) as a knife to shatter these lovers.

This can only make me wonder just how much better Sturges' original screenplay could have been because despite him being so unsatisfied with the experience, this film is absolutely wonderful. Sturges' sly wit is very much on display, even if it's a tad more sentimental than some of his later efforts. But what's wrong with sentimentality? It's freakin' Christmas!

      "A Christmas classic, Remember the Night from director Mitchell Leisen and writer Preston Sturges is very sweet. It is odd, to be sure, as it brings together assistant District Attorney John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) and the woman he is supposed to be prosecuting, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck). A dumb play by her defense attorney to claim she was hypnotized by the beauty of the jewelry she stole and tried to pawn sees Sargent push for a continuance. That way, he can bring in an expert to dispel this silly notion, win over the jury, and get the conviction. He does have a heart though, seeing the poor Lee lash out at her attorney because the continuance will see her jailed for Christmas and the New Year. Putting up the money for her bail, Sargent thinks that will be the end of things and he will have a free conscience. However, Lee thinks he wants sex in return and goes to his apartment where the two do not have sex, but do begin to strike up an unexpected friendship.\n",
      "It is rather implausible with the film trying to concoct some way to get these together and headed to Christmas with John’s family in Indiana. Some unexpected commonalities are found between them, as both grew up in Indiana and were poor, but aside from this, they are certainly an “odd couple”. He is prim, proper, and educated, while she is facing a shoplifting charge and had led a hard-knock life. The oddity and clear imbalance of their relationship - after all, once they return to New York City, John will prosecute her again - gives Remember the Night a very strange vibe. The prolonged setup as well as their drive to Indiana makes up much of the film, leaving relatively little time for the eventual Christmas celebrations. In context, it does not have the right spark. MacMurray and Stanwyck bring some charm to the road trip portion, but otherwise, the film gets bogged into some unnecessary conflict as they get arrested in Pennsylvania and have to escape. It is, as with much of the film, a strange section that never quite gels with everything else. Once it returns to the courtroom, it does not get much better and does end up leaving the film on somewhat of a low-note. Fortunately, the chemistry of its two lovers does end up saving it in the final scene, but it is a film that does something very well but does not focus enough energy on it and instead follows this needless plot thread to an unneeded conclusion.\n",
      "In trying to fit within a 90-minute runtime, this extended bit before they get to Indiana may be necessary, but ends up stealing the focus from the joy of the film’s Christmas section. What joy to be found there, too! It captures so much of the feeling of going home or seeing family. The fun popping of popcorn, sitting around and singing Christmas songs, and baking sweets to snack on together, all are portrayed and felt with full force. This may be small-town Indiana, but it is quite hopping at Christmas with local celebrations, dances at the fire station, and parties for New Year’s filling their schedule and the film with touchstone moments. It is a whirlwind of a week, one that is sure to live in the characters’ minds for years afterward, bringing John and Lee closer together than they ever expected and full of warmth. Watching his mother (Beulah Bondi) and Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson) try to prod Lee in the right direction to win his heart, responding with warmth when hearing of her crimes, and always including her, is easy to be moved by. It is a section devoid of conflict or animosity, a time of togetherness and joy. Even as they say goodbye and Mrs. Sargent watches the two drive off back to New York, one can feel the pang of wanting to be together. One can put themselves in her shoes or in John’s, parting from a loved one after a great time together that must now end. It hurts and one feels nostalgic for being together right away. To evoke this quality speaks highly of Remember the Night’s overall impact, capturing not just the look but also the feel of Christmas.\n",
      "As always, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are a delight together. They show the chemistry here that made them a natural pair with Stanwyck’s worldly charisma blending nicely with MacMurray’s aw shucks demeanor. Though the film built around the characters is undoubtedly bizarre, it does feed off of their cuteness together into a charming and inviting Christmas film. Leisen and Sturges perfectly capture the joy of coming together, of the hectic time together, and the longing for just a minute more when it comes time to leave. Adding in a kleptomaniac may add some odd hilarity, but nothing can distract from or dilute the genuine Christmas magic that Remember the Night exudes.\n",

Why they go on the road together is a bit of a stretch but a well-handled one by ace writer Preston Sturges and ace director Mitchell Leisen. The whole Indiana thing plays an important part in the film with two bands playing the beautiful and sentimental tune My Indiana Home at strategic times in the film. Stanwyck softens herself up as well as the audience as her character emerges.

After MacMurray asks for a continuation of the trial which would result in Stanwyck spending the Christmas break in jail, he feels guilty and bails her out. With no plan other than to visit family in Ohio, they have to improvise.\n",
      "Alongside some perfectly pitched acting from the two leads, the script is wonderful, penned by the same writer who infused another film which is close to my heart, The Invisible Man, with both humour and pathos. Remember the Night is constantly funny and the dialogue quick-witted, yet endearing when it needs to be. It's clever enough not to fall into the trap of over-sentimentality and isn't sickly sweet like many seasonal favourites. Stanwyck is something of a tragic figure and while the film is romantic and heartwarming at times, it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice neat bow at the end.\n",

With Lee having nowhere else to go, Jack eventually invites her to spend Christmas with him and his family. It's typical romantic fare, but the magnetic chemistry of Macmurray and Stanwyck is irrefutable. Although they will reunite in the much darker, noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), there is a refreshing charm in watching Macmurray and Stanwyck in what initially feels like a no-frills, by-the-numbers romance.\n",

      "Remember the Night makes for a pleasant film built around the virtues of homespun love and small town simplicity that feels like it's teetering on the edge of having something to say. Its story, about Stanwyck's petty thief Leander being taken in over the holiday by Fred MacMurray's district attorney Sargent after he postpones her trial till after Christmas in hopes of convicting her with a less charitable jury, sees the pair travel across hill and valley to spend some getaway time with Sargent's family. These early going scenes are quiet good, if a touch strangely paced or toned in places - an early sequence with Leander's lawyer spinning a ridiculous story claiming she was hypnotized into stealing is amusing yet goes on for a long while, and most of the humor from Fred Toones' servant character is just plain stonefacing with how much he's asked to degrade himself. When the film's got Stanwyck and MacMurray alone and talking their differences out and slowly falling in love, though, it makes an enjoyable, lively march. There's some good business with the pair dancing together while Leander starts to see Sargent's more sensitive side, some fun runaround with a confusing map and a sudden interrupting cow, a nice joking country trial scene where they both surprise each other by putting their respective skills to use and respectively rising and stooping to save the other's hide, and a darkly shot, melancholic scene wherein they arrive at Leander's home and show Sargent and the audience alike just how broken and loveless it is. Story's spinning, gears are turning, actors are acting, all's right.\n",
      "Once we arrive at Sargent's childhood home and dig into the holidays with his family? Remember the Night feels like it's found a cozy place to bunk for the night, settled in all safe and clean, and resolved to enjoy the atmosphere for a whole half-hour. Mark you, this stretch of the film is not empty or aimless: Stanwyck and MacMurray still put in the legwork of her adjusting to homelife full of warmth and care and people who don't belittle you for your mistakes, him trying to disguise his growing feelings for her as the hour of their court date draws closer, and both exchanging longing looks across domestic scenes to keep the spark alive. In total effect, unfortunately, Mitchell Leisen's direction puts a great deal of emphasis on that very coziness, the gentle quirks of Sargent's extended family, the loveliness of exchanging all precious gifts and singing beautiful songs and two dottering old ladies watching a young couple obviously fall for each other in the midst of a dance. It represents the film slowing down without taking time to really examine or highlight anything about our main characters, celebrating the virtues of their environment rather than what it does to them. While I am inclined to think cinematic appreciation for a time and place makes excellent film when done well, the execution here just feels too much like a studio-bound realization of such rather than an authentic slice of Americana at the movie's core. All exceedingly pleasant, and all doing terribly little to make me do much more than quirk my lips in a small smile here and there.\n",
      "With Preston Sturges as screenwriter, and this being his final film for another director before he started overseeing his own scripts, one might feel inclined to think of this as a failure to find the depths in Sturges' work on Leisen's part. Personally, however, I find Sturges' screenplay lacking in what it does with the whole homestead sequence as well. When the film recaptures my interest in the final fifteen minutes, it does so with a few scenes of note - Sargent offering Leander escape as they take a detour through Canada, the pair confessing their love and agonizing over what to do next as they embrace before Niagara Falls (their reduction to shadows here and the earlier slip into darkness at Leander's home are, incidentally, both credits to Leisen's direction), and the the big mutual sacrifice where Sargent deliberately tries to sabotage his case against Leander until she willingly confesses and begs for jailtime for his sake. The idea is meant as one of equal exchange, each giving up something precious in the name of love. Consider, then, just how equitable the relationship here actually is: as prosecutor and eventually willing benefactor in one, Sargent holds most of the power in their dynamic, with Leander having little choice other than a barren holding cell over Christmas if she refuses to stay or follow. Their journey shows they can skillfully hold their own and back each other up when the going gets rough, yet emotionally Leander is coming from a broken, unloving home, while Sargent has an extensive support network as a powerful, beloved figure at work and in his old house. And isn't it ever so coincidental that the passages depicting the two falling into irrevocable love take place in surroundings bound to remind Leander of what she doesn't have, and what she could have if she treated her would-be jailer as a potential husband?\n",
      "I don't think there's any sinister intent in Sturges' screenplay. There's a mismatched power dynamic at play, yes, but it's one written in the tradition of a man who has everything finding himself willing to give it all away if it means the happiness of the woman he loves, with said woman proving her devotion in an equal act of sacrifice. Even if the sacrifices aren't equal (he'll probably just lose some reputation and still have everything else to his name, she'd go to jail with as much nothing as ever were it not for a last-second marriage), they're written with the intent of balance, and play reasonably well. I say fault lies in Sturges' screenplay because there's rich, verdant fields of potential to mine at Sargent's home, far more interesting territory to mine than just showing how the innocent country life can make two people fall in love, and yet what we see onscreen is content to play at that and just that. We don't bring the loneliness or fear of love someone with Leander's backstory might have after her childhood to the forefront, don't cast any suspicion across her brow towards Sargent's intent in bringing her here, don't put challenge to the value of wholesome family values for the sake of reinforcing them with greater strength when we find genuine loving intent instead of anything sinister. That half-hour stretch could play with far more focus on what the scenes immediately preceding implied about our main characters, and instead take it all at face value for a pleasant, charming, somewhat empty romance backed by the good ol' folks back home.\n",
      "I could be spoilt by seeing Stanwyck and MacMurray play at a more tempestuous, wicked love in Double Indemnity. Ironically, despite their characters falling for one another in a heat of murderous passion and falling apart as mistrust and selfish intent poisons their lives, the relationship there is more equally balanced and mutually beneficial than the one in Remember the Night. Being equally deep in the shit will do that to ya. Still, we get right to it, this film offers some strong material on one side, a workable capper on the end, and an inner core comprised of gooiness rather than some more satisfactory crunchy or solid bits. Somehow I've figured the best way to express my feelings about Remember the Night is to compare it against a Cadbury Creme Egg, probably because I had one the other night, and the experience of biting into something solid and finding an appreciable but nevertheless soft mass yielding no resistance at the center seems an even analogy. Remind me to avoid food metaphors when talking film in the future, they always get stupid weird.\n",

Just beautiful - and festive to boot. To have seen this twice on 35mm in a single year is a real blessing.\n",

Although the Hays Code meant each film would bend towards a more moral ending for each, I still really loved how this film did not fully give a prototypical happy ending, but still managed to deliver quite a cathartic character resolution for each.

      "This is the polar opposite of Double Indemnity - less soul crushing and suspenseful, it’s more heartwarming and screwball. Written by Preston Sturges it’s filled with his quirky satiric view on small town life populated with syrupy spinsters, saccharine moms, folksy country bumpkins, a backroad justice of the peace partial to locals, cows eating hats, barn dances, and sentimental songs by the fire on Christmas Eve. Yet there is an underlying cynicism in the abrupt tonal shifts into drama and dark humor pointed at the judicial system, “Midwest nice”, and the bleakness some people can have for Christmas. It also doesn’t cop out on Stanwyck’s punishment at the end, making her arc from likable but unscrupulous petty thief to redeemed lovesick convict all the more bittersweet and heartbreaking. In the end it is a little like Double Indemnity with MacMurray falling so hard for Stanwyck he is willing to turn to criminality and undermine his career as assistant DA.

Fred MacMurray isn’t quite overmatched by his costar — he’s capable of selling the accomplished prosecutor who has a big heart, especially for his country family — but most anyone is going to get a run for their money up against Barbara Stanwyck. When we meet her as Lee she’s committing the shoplifting that starts off the whole chain of events that lands her in John’s (MacMurray) arms and no one sells a hardened but proper lady like she can. Preston Sturges’ final film as only a screenwriter (he insisted on also directing everything after this) serves up a bloviating defense lawyer (Willard Robertson using his background as a real lawyer to scenery chewing effect), two exceedingly kind countryside sisters (Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson who carry the entire heart of this film), and an hilarious country bumpkin (Sterling “Winnie the Pooh” Holloway serving pure heartfelt ridiculousness) among many other memorable supporting and bit parts. At issue is the usual diminishing and debasing portrayal of African Americans (Fred Toones is only credited as his nickname Snowflake for his heavily caricatured role as servant Rufus), but at least it’s a cultural artifact and not the driving center of the narrative.

It's the week before Christmas and the defense attorney knows the jury will not be eager to linger for a long trial, so he plays all the sympathy cards in his deck... even claiming Leander was \"hypnotized.\" Of course that's nonsense but Jack knows his only chance of conviction is to delay the trial till after \"the season of giving.\" That's exactly what happens when he says he'll have to call in an expert on hypnotism who is out of town for Christmas, and so wins a continuation.\n",
      "So in the meantime, with the trial delayed, Sargent, who's a decent fellow, arranges bail for the beautiful dame and prepares to head back to Wabash country to see his dear old Mom (Beulah Bondi) who still maintains the working farm where Jack was raised. But through unforeseen circumstances, he finds himself stuck with Leander and when he finds out she has an estranged mother too, back in Indiana, he offers her a ride back to her hometown.\n",
      "The trip by automobile is a cool adventure as they run into road construction, take a wrong detour and end up in the middle of a cow pasture the next morning. When they try to get milk into a thermos from one of the milk cows, the farmer shows up and drags the travelers off to the local magistrate for trespassing and other light misdemeanors. Of course they don't give their real names and manage to skip on the arrest after Lee starts a fire in a waste basket to create a diversion. This part is all played for laughs and comedy is a strong suit for both the lead actors. By now we're won over to the wild plot, no matter where it leads.\n",
      "When they reach the house where Lee's mother still lives (with a new husband) we find out just how angry and embittered the old woman is. It's clear she has no intention of reconciling with her runaway daughter. So Jack has no choice but to take Lee with him on to his own home for the holidays.\n",
      "Jack's Mom (Bondi), his Aunt Emmy (Elizabeth Patterson), and weirdly eccentric cousin Willie (Sterling Holloway, in a scene stealing performance) welcome Leander into their home and make her a natural part of the seasonal festivities. (They think she must be \"Jack's girl.\") This part of the film which involves making the strange woman feel welcome, baking popovers and sharing meals, exchanging presents, and even dressing up in vintage clothing for a cornball, New Year's Eve barn dance, is the heart of the movie, and we can eat it up like popcorn. Along the way of course we realize the young couple is truly falling in love.\n",
      "Jack's honest enough to share the circumstances of Lee's situation with his mom, and although she's sympathetic, she sees the danger to her son's hard-fought reputation... so she goes to Lee to plead the case for caution. This is the crisis and the nut of the film, and the resolution may move you or leave you scratching your head. There are no easy answers... that's for sure.\n",
      "The Sturges magic is already evident in this early work, made before he took to directing his own scripts... (this one was helmed for Paramount by Mitchell Leisen).\n",
      "I had never seen \"Remember the Night\" and it moves instantly to a list of all-time seasonal favorites. Stanwyck and MacMurray have an undeniable chemistry and they get to play \"good people.\" Four years later they would reunite in the darkest heart of film noir for the classic \"Double Indemnity.\"\n",
      "Enjoy this one as a pleasurable romp: with courtroom screwball comedy; a picturesque road trip; an idyllic Christmas interlude; and a well acted romance... complete with a trip to icy Niagara Falls. One viewing, and you will forever \"Remember the Night.\n",

      "This year’s pick for Christmas viewing is a slightly more obscure classic, the first out of four films that paired up actors Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Courtesy of @indicator , this lovely set did manage to arrive earlier than I expected, just in time for me to plan my Christmas watch. Overall, I thought this was a lovely film, all up to the final scene which manages to pack quite a punch. Anchored in two very charming, very off beat performances, Stanwyck in particular is quite sizzling here, this has one of those screwball premises that quickly turns its plot into a rom com vehicle. Essentially, love blossoms between a shoplifter (Stanwyck) and a prosecutor (MacMurray) just when he postpones the trial after Christmas and a quick ride to her family’s place turns into them spending their whole holiday together. So it’s quite predictable in that respect, but where other situational comedies find a way to escape their dreading outcome, here director Mitchell Leisen, working off the back of a script by Preston Sturges, let’s his two protagonists fall in love but their fate together isn’t shifted by a miraculous turn of events, as they have to face the consequences of what’s on ahead. Safe to say this was quite refreshing in that regard. The Christmas and New Years setting does add to the value of seeing this over the holidays and it’s a firm recommendation from me to all couples resting their shoulders on the sofa next to the tree.\n",

      "The unexpected appearance of Preston Sturges' name in the credits was a pleasant surprise and a good omen. This is actually the final script he wrote for another director, after this point he began his prestigious phase as a writer and director, and in this film his skill for crafting characters and dialogue is quite apparent. There is a touch of his style of screwball, while also being reminiscent of Howard Hawks, but Remember the Night unfolds in a mostly sentimental and tender manner. Stanwyck and MacMurray have great chemistry, she's always had a knack for playing these smart-talking, yet elegant and emotionally fragile characters The scenes in the countryside at MacMurray's family farm are quite charming, the best scene in my opinion is when the characters are gathered in the house and the young cousin played by Sterling Holloway sings a beautifully and gently disarming rendition of \"The End of a Perfect Day.\"\n",

Afraid the jury will be nice right before Christmas he gets the case delayed until after New Years. Feeling guilty he gets her out of jail and agrees to bring her to Indiana too spend time with her family. When they reject her, he brings her to his family instead. It is interesting to watch how the justice system has changed over the years. There are a lot of references to how difficult it is to prosecute a woman and what a woman should be doing in the home. The whole thing is so implausible and silly, but counter that with some real sincere moments and great casting of Stanwyck and MacMurray. They have undoubtable chemistry.

      "Editing out heroic speeches given to John Sargent, (named after the third wife of Sturges,Louise Sargent)from the original screenplay, the changes (un- credited co-writer) /director Mitchell Leisen made brings a element of silky Melodrama to this winter tale,as the quiet, self-assured Sargent falls head over heels for the troubled romantic Leander whilst driving home for Christmas.\n",

Sturges the writer was ready for this film by 1940, but Sturges the director could not have hoped to bring out the depths of the script that Leisen brings out. While Sturges the comedian and light dramatist director delivers great films like CHRISTMAS IN JULY and THE LADY EVE almost concurrently with this, it's not until HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO that Sturges can effortlessly direct drama with the same level of subtlety and richness that Leisen brings to the material here––and Sturges's choice of cinematographers ultimately limit him for his entire career from achieving (intentionally or not) the visual lushness of Leisen's films. Ultimately Sturges will deliver the quasi-cubist menagerie close-ups of HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, but the delicate shot of Stanwyck crying on the front porch of her childhood home while MacMurray comforts her and her mother looks coldly out of the front door window in the background, or the shot of her frozen in the mirror as the reflection of MacMurray's mother climbing the stairs moves to exit the room, would certainly not have existed, and they are as stunning as anything cinema can deliver.\n",

She gets to fall in love and be treated like a real human just as she is, and at her trial, she’s the one who wants to do the moral thing, not her supposedly upstanding new bf Fred MacMurray. Babs’s performance is a masterclass on portraying a complicated lady. A lesser actress would spend the whole movie looking dour and introspective, or would style her more like a femme fatale, but Stanwyck really spaces out those moments of darkness, which makes it all the more effective when her defenses finally come down.\n",

On the face of it, believably arranging it in the writing so that our protagonists, John and Lee, set off on the road together (as they must) is really tricky, but every line in the scene in John's apartment is scripted and played to perfection, so the unlikely premise flies.\n",
      "From there, it is just incredibly sweet and funny, and when it needs to be it is quite deeply moving. Stanwyck and MacMurray have famously fabulous chemistry. Whether sharing witty repartee, emotionally wrought dramatic scenes, or just straightforward conversation, they effortlessly click. Stanwyck's face is a wonder. So many looks that just melt you. There are times she looks at MacMurray and it's almost like you can literally see the love radiating from her features. And she has brilliant comic timing too - I loved her performance in the Justice of the Peace's office, for example. Her reactions to MacMurray's unspooling of his invented identity are priceless.\n",
      "Also, it's another great Christmas film - something that usually goes down well with me. The scenes in the Sargent family home, particularly the moment Stanwyck realises that his family have somehow made her presents (\"hour of ecstasy!\" - one of the biggest laughs, snuck into one of the most moving scenes), are so good. Pure, and heartwarming.\n",

But from what I can see, though clearly there is a significant element of glorious heartache in play here, this ending is one to feel really good about.\n",
      "More than anything, I'm relieved it ended so sensibly - with Lee showing a desire to a) pay for her crimes and b) protect John to a sensible extent by not allowing him to throw a case, or rush into marrying her - but crucially with her stating that once she has gotten \"all square\", and once John has had time to cool down and think it over, then they could potentially get married. Not a cut and dry ending (and all the better for that), but one that is realistically happy. I was worried when John's Mother gave the big protective speech in Lee's bedroom that it was going down the road of Lee simply refusing to be with John, ever, to 'protect him'. That would have been overly simplistic and would not really have made realistic sense or served these intelligent characters well - of course there is every chance they can be together, they just need a bit of time to straighten themselves out, and then they can see. Sturges finds a way to get us there, and given how much I had invested in the film by that point, given how much Stanwyck and MacMurray and indeed Sturges's charms had me rooting for these two, I am enormously grateful for that. Love reforms her, and in her redemption she saves a good man into the bargain….and though they may ache for now, there remains a possible way forward. It's sad, it's happy, it's kind of everything at once. Not quiet bittersweet, but something else. However you might label its particular combination of emotions, it's perfect. Very clever, emotionally astute, and timelessly so. A microcosm of the entire movie. I loved it.\n",

      "apparently most people say that the ending of remember the night is a sad one, but i don’t completely agree. it ends with lee leander confessing to her crime and being locked away from civilisation for a while. i believe (by reading reviews) the majority of the audience are emotionally invented in the relationship between jack/john sargent and lee leander which is understandable due to how it’s grows and develops into such a great emotional connection between the two. being invested in their relationship makes it understandable why you’d consider it a sad ending because you’d want them to be happy and be able to live a peaceful life together. the ending gave so much character growth to lee because after being accused of stealing three times before and stealing longer than she could remember she was constantly running away, she finally has some security and knows exactly what she needs to do to make things that are in her power right. this growth would have only been possible by her exposure to the sargent family; jack was loving and welcomed her into his home as did the rest of his family, they treated her as one of their own and she took part in their traditions which was something she never experienced in her own home. they all brought her love in both ways that she felt love and she had love to give out to them, she got treated as she should have as a kid, which inevitably shows the audience the true meaning of christmas. lee leander stole to get that thrill that she couldn’t find anywhere else and she needed it because her family had always cheated her out of anything good. with confessing lee gets to know her true self and she finally has something to live for. the last glimpse we see is her being surrounded with love when she’s being locked away for a long time, and it helps her so incredibly much. she doesn’t need to hide (herself) anymore. \n",
      "though remember the night was written for carole lombard, i personally believe that the character of lee leander is very reflective of stanwyck herself. in one way, lee is quite a reserved person much like missy who never went out to parties like she was supposed to and when she did she kept to herself and brought a book to bury herself in, but when surrounded with people they’re comfortable with their true self comes out and nothing else matters.\n",

Going to the movies in 1940 and having to choose between this and Shop Around The Corner is such a scary thought now. Paramount production values, Ted Tetzlaff and Edith Head are perfect companions to Leisen's fleshing of luxuries and muted punctuation, visually, during intense dramatic pulses (the scene leaving Barb's mom's house, Niagara Falls, many more). Christmas in part but Christmas throughout, perhaps more Christmas than most, if that makes sense. It is made with love, a more Leisen than Sturges thing (Sturges is far from incapable of that but still true), which I'm very susceptible to.\n",

      "Nice, old-fashioned charmer with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck playing nicely off other, as they would in three more films over their careers. But this is the first one, and it's a sentimental tale set at Christmas, where Stanwyck, as Lee Leander (love that name!) is arrested for stealing a bauble from a jewelry store. Turns out she's a small-time thief and as she goes before the court, MacMurray is Jack Sargent, the prosecuting attorney. He's serious about his career and he manipulates the blowhard defense lawyer into going on and on, loving the sound of his own voice. Jack's trick is that if they had given the case to the jury that day, the jury most likely would have been very lenient on Lee, not wanting to send a woman to jail on Christmas. So he stalls, and the rest of the trial is put off till after the new year.\n",
      "Jack feels bad about Lee being stuck in jail though, actually being an old softy, so he arranges with a bail bondsman friend to get Lee out for Christmas. Jack thinks that's the end of it, but he sees Barbara has no place to go, having no money. They find out they're both from Indiana, so he agrees to drive her out of New York to see her mother in her old small town, not far from his birthplace.\n",
      "They bond over the trip, and when Lee's mother turns out to be a cruel old bat who won't forgive her for past misdeeds, Jack gallantly invites her to spend Christmas with him and his family. Once there, Lee is greeted with open arms like a member of the family. Jack's mother, Mrs. Sargent, is played by that great supporting actress Beulah Bondi, who had a long career in film and television. Jack's Aunt Emma is played by Elizabeth Patterson, who was in almost a dozen episodes of I Love Lucy, mostly as the elderly neighbor Mrs. Trumbull. And rounding out the household is farmhand Willie, acted by Sterling Holloway, who is probably most known as the familiar voice of Winnie the Pooh.\n",
      "Of course, as they spend Christmas through New Year together in such a homey setting, Jack and Lee begin to fall for each other. Mrs. Trumbell had felt sorry for Lee all along, but when she sees them kiss at the New Year's Eve barn dance, she begins to worry about how it will affect her son's career. She knows that Jack will probably do anything to see that Lee gets off, and she's right. So she secretly has a talk with Lee, turning the screws on her emotions about Jack having come up from nothing and working himself to the bone to make a name for himself. Well, it works and Lee tries to distance herself from Jack but he's having none of it.\n",
      "From here on, it's a back and forth as to whether Jack will throw the case to get Lee free, or if she'll confess to stealing. What happens is really well-acted and although some may want to score the film higher marks for leaving us hanging a bit, I wanted to know how it turned out. So we're left haning a bit but it's better to think that things will turn out well for both of them as they both admit their love for one another.\n",

Her character largely relies on Stanwyck’s ready ability to play this sort of gal with a hard past and bring a stunning amount of pathos to the role.  Get your hanky this is one of those sad and bittersweet Christmas stories.  It’s maybe a little heavy on 1940 era morality (we can’t allow anyone to get away with a crime!) but ends up being a far less straightforward tale because of it.\n",

It’s essentially a “big city girl goes back to [her/her love interest’s] small town for the holidays” plot, just like a Hallmark movie really, but with an intelligent script that makes room for darkness and never really does the expected thing. Yet somehow this is a romantic comedy, with carols around the piano on Christmas Eve, comical local color, a Hoosier barn dance on New Year’s Eve, and blisteringly charming performance by my fave and yours, Barbara Stanwyck. I love Christmas in Connecticut more as a whole, but she is perhaps even more charming on all levels here, and the chemistry is better with Fred MacMurray than with Dennis Morgan.\n",

There is an open complexity to the film, a lack of token moralism - a more conventional version of this film, from this era, would paint the story as a pious tragedy; a man of good stature fallen due to his carnal flaw, a woman already fallen, lost. Presupposed in such moralism is that everyone should confirm to one kind of religious and conservative order. Instead Remember the Night never judges the characters for falling in love. They are free, at least within the film, to think and feel what they want. It's not for Hollywood to tell them what is right and wrong.\n",
      "The film grows more and more sublime, as MacMurray gets the trial extended over Christmas and New Year and fixes Stanwyck's bail. Together they travel out into the country over Christmas - even platonically, their escapade is illegal, but the film never even makes it an elephant in the room. Stanwyck's tender performance is like chocolate that slowly melts in your mouth against the archaic country Christmas atmosphere; heat meets cold in a film that never betrays its down-to-earth emotional ambiguity. One wonders for a while where the film is going. Then, eventually, you never want it to end.\n",

      "La película comienza como una comedia guiada por la viveza y velocidad propia de lo que seguramente aporto Preston Sturges, pero a partir de una escena ominosa, el encuentro con la madre de Stanwyck, donde no hay comedia ni cariño, la película se carga de otra manera y comienza su periplo hacía el drama moral.\n",
      "Los personajes se van enamorando, la película construye esto de la forma que mejor sabía hacer el cine clásico, filmando pequeños gestos en situaciones compartidas, las manos y las miradas, un pañuelo, el como va variando el gesto de apoyarse sobre el hombro del otro; para un momento en que los protagonistas amanecen juntos y protagizan una pequeña escena cómica ya están enamorades, aunque capaz ninguno de los dos cayo en la cuenta. Teniendo en cuenta el destino carcelario de Stanwyck la película ya comienza a cargar por debajo sus imágenes.\n",
      "Cuando llegamos a las secuencias más tiernas y edificantes de la película, la navidad con la familia de él, hay dos cargas -una del pasado y otra del futuro- que lo construyen todavía más este momento como una isla luminosa aíslada. El pasado de Stanwyck es oscuro, todo lo contrario al amor que esta recibiendo en esa casa, se ve en las lagrimas que asoman seguido sus ojos, pero también ella sabe desde el principio que esto es un compas porque al volver de estas holidays la espera el regreso a lo que ha heredado de esa infancia, su vida de crimen, de pobre y la cárcel.\n",
      "Pero de todas maneras la semana con la familia de él se vive como una reconversión, es dónde empieza el juego muy complejo moral de la película, la familia acoge a la Stanwyck, la hace una de ellos, la trata desde un principio como una igual, la \"eleva\" y le permite vivir desde otro lugar moral la vida, pero ese lugar conlleva también por un lado habitar otra clase social y por otro tomar la tradición (utiliza el vestido de la tía), el debe ser femenino (el corsé para achicar la cintura) y, claro, la familia. Desde nuestro punto de vista actual todos elementos de alguna manera cuestionados, pero que sentimos (como lo siente la Stanwyck) como lugares acogedores, que la reciben, que dan significado donde antes había cinismo frente al mundo; digamos eso que a veces el cine clásico hace tan bien de hacernos ver de otra manera esta sobre-determinación de \"american way of life\" y dónde están los que podrían ser sus lugares más cálidos, pertenecer a algo. A lo largo de toda esa semana de holidays, junto a la Stanwyck, nosotros también pensamos que hay una esperanza, una salvación a pesar de toda la carga que veníamos trayendo, ya estamos esperando el final feliz, la entrada definitiva de Stanwyck a ese mundo acogedor de la familia y el cariño.\n",
      "Pero el último día pasado con la familia ocurre esta escena increíble: lo que no se ha dicho en ningún momento de manera explicita encuentra su lugar entre susurros en la oscuridad de la noche en una habitación a medio iluminar. Estas bases de la vida moral solo se pueden sostener en columnas rectas, duras, y que no pueden más que herir terriblemente al personaje de Stanwyck (solo ver su rostro durante esta escena). La madre cariñosa, la que se nos ha mostrado como el personaje más bueno de la película -y no por esto lo deja de ser- le pide por favor que deje ir a su hijo, que ella, con su vida turbia no debería estar con él; no hay perdón, cada uno pertenece a su mundo moral y social, separados, y por más buena voluntad y desprejuicio que se ponga entre susurros se busca mantener un orden.\n",
      "Algo se rompe en ese momento en la Stanwyck y determina lo que hará su personaje en el resto de la película, por más que ella hiciera la conversión, hiciera el cambio moral, tomara la tradición y la familia como suyas, no hay posibilidad, no hay redención y esto queda marcado en su cuerpo de tal manera que lo que nos reconfortaba se vuelve pesado, duro, inamovible y ni siquiera nos permite el happy ending hollywoodense.\n",

Everything at John's house where Lee is cozying up with his family and falling in love is tremendous. I especially liked the scene where Mrs. Sargent puts her hands on Lee's shoulders and re-assures her. Stanwyck is so good here, perfectly emoting the impact physical closeness has on her, which her own family clearly failed on. The conclusion is far too swift, and has an air of inevitably that left me unsatisfied. I guess I was expecting something to happen in the courtroom that would work dramatically while also providing the big happy ending this movie deserved. Oh well.\n",

      "Atleast I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong. What a gem this is. The direction is so steady and confident in the material it never becomes maudlin. I'm glad Mitchell Liesen directed this and not Sturges, because this could've gone horribly wrong in a heartbeat. I had recently commented in my review of The Lady Eve that that film was Stanwyck's best performance, but I'm going to call it a tie. Who wouldn't fall madly in love with her here? She spends half the film with tears in her eyes, and every one feels completely warranted. When she turns around and non-chalantly says \"Gee, you're sweet.\" I can hardly think of a more realistic and perfect bit of writing and line delivery. This should actually be slightly out of place at this point in the film as it divulges Lee's infatuation with John a little early, but it's so perfect it doesn't matter. I also love the subtly great camerawork such as their first dance early on that moves into a close-up of the singer, or the pan in the barn leading to the couple kissing for New Years. Even after two viewings, the four stars is still tentative, and I expect this to climb higher.\n",

      "Very strange that Criterion put this up in the month of May with their Mitchell Leisen collection, and not with their Christmas collection last year, but whatevs. Famously known for being the last script that Preston Sturges wrote while not being a director (of which is the fault of Mitchell Leisen, who took various liberties with the script, of which his changes I actually agree, and feel makes a stronger film then that of which Sturges wrote.) Leisen famously “watered down” a lot of the dialogue involving Fred MacMurray, and had the film focus more of its attention on Barbara Stanwyck’s character, and I feel these are much better/needed changes, since everything in film should always be about showing, not telling (not sure if Preston Sturges was early in his career or something, and didn’t understand this), but the lack of dialogue for MacMurray works alot better, and makes him come off more charming especially during the films second act, which makes for a great sentimental/somber Christmas film. The films script smartly balances a fine line of MacMurray taking Stanwyck’s character to see his folks, of which they get into various adventures along the way (the cow scene reminded me a lot of the horse scene in ’The Lady Eve’, when the horse keeps butting in all the time), all the while never feeling like MacMurrays character is trying to “get lucky”, but instead is feeling guilty. As Struges himself once described the film, “Love reformed her, and corrupted him”. 5/5\n",

      "It’s no illusion that Barbara Stanwyck has played more than her fair share of fallen women. It’s also not as if there’s not a reason for this, as she lends herself as a performer to so many of the facets of what being troubled could mean. What she brings to her petty thief in Remember the Night is perhaps a heavy dose of forlorn denial and reflection, as Lee Leander is walking a tightrope to prison and has to come to terms with what stealing pretty baubles has gotten her through the years. Forming a pillar for her fallen woman to rest upon is Fred MacMurray as John Sargent, the opposing counsel with the DA’s office, smooth and suave and too good at his job as he lets Lee’s attorney talk her right into a tight spot. Past the conceit of these two characters, the film takes swinging turns at being sweeping and cathartic to almost trite. As chemistry and rapport builds between Lee and John in an ill-advised, well-intentioned trip to Indiana, we even begin to root for them, as star-crossed as that fate may seem out the gate. It’s at that inevitable end, though, that the line through the story begins to fray a little as Fred MacMurray takes the love that John begins to feel and imbues it with hangdog saccharine as he pouts and fights and puts his job on the line to keep Lee to himself and out of jail. Prior to this, he’s the aforementioned pillar, stable as Lee isn’t, showing her what it means to have a loving family and a warm home for Christmas. The hardened grace with which he removes her from her hostile mother’s home is admirable, and the way he has to learn how to weasel out of tough situations like she does makes for plenty of cute moments. However, so much of that is lost in this character revelation, as he becomes a soft mess the moment he realizes he loves her. It retroactively makes many aspects in the film far less forgivable, like John’s butler who’s as loud a stereotype as they come, or Sterling Holloway playing the hired help for John Sargent’s mother and is equally simple and just as unnecessary. Remember the Night has some layered and deep moments, but so much of it is repeated or bolstered with fluff that much of the poignancy is lost already once it comes time for resolution.\n",

Seeing them together again felt really odd. It was like some weird alternate universe and it was funny because I still had their characters from DI on my mind (I watched it just yesterday). But anyway, this film was really cute and heartwarming. Things progressed at a perfect pace, with the exception of the ending because I thought it was a bit rushed. The camaraderie between the characters John and Lee was really nice to see. I love that John always looked out for Lee even though their circumstances were far from normal. \n",

I’ve watched many older films and I haven’t been captivated by the couples like I have with Fred and Barbara. Individually and together, I love them. The way they say their lines, the emotions in their eyes alone, and how it’s like I’m watching them in person and not on a screen. I wonder if this natural way of acting was new to the scene back then. Love these two a lot and I definitely recommend this cute Christmas movie. \n",

Dinner leads to the revelation that both characters come from the same rural area, which leads to MacMurray offering to drive Stanwyck home to see her estranged mother for Christmas.\n",

This might sound like a gooey Hallmark movie, but what follows is a similar yet heartfelt story through family and redemption, and it works because the characters were (mostly) caring, had heart, and it's so nice and warm.

I still found the romance aspect to be done well, but only could've gone so far if the moral center of it wasn't hindered by what was presumably the Hays Code. The film treats her stealing to be almost as bad as murder and that's really the only thing keeping Lee and John apart, both legally and emotionally speaking.

      "Delightful. The first of four collaborations between Stanwyck and MacMurray, and the last screenplay Preston Sturges wrote for another director before embarking on his own filmmaking career. Sturges was apparently unhappy with Mitchell Leisen's direction, as well as the changes he made to his original script. I can understand his frustration, and while it's interesting to consider how it would've turned out with him behind the camera instead, I think Leisen did more than a fine job with Sturges' script. Leisen and his cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff provide some beautifully shot sequences—the New Year's Eve barn dance scene is particularly moving. Stanwyck and MacMurray are both outstanding of course, but the whole cast is excellent. I especially liked Elizabeth Patterson as Aunt Emma. The film is a comedy for sure, but like most Sturges stories it includes elements from a variety of genres, yet never feels disjointed or messy. It's hilarious, dramatic, tender, and bittersweet. \n",
      " Again, Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent. Her presence never fails to captivate me. Leander is a surprisingly complex character, and Stanwyck couldn't have given a better or more authentic performance. Beyond the elements that might make modern audiences uncomfortable, I think Leisen could have trimmed a few minutes off to make it a solid 88-90 minutes. That said, it's consistently engaging and never feels like it's dragging. It's also a great Christmas movie, as it explores the deeper meaning and sentiments of the holiday, as opposed to the pomp and grandeur displayed in most holiday-themed productions (especially of the time).\n",

      "There is such authenticity to her work. She doesn't possess a showy bundle of mannerisms and so there is a verisimilitude to what she does. She makes everything feel and seem totally lived in and as such her performances have not dated at all. There is a modernity to what she is doing and her work could be transplanted to films of today and you wouldn't recognise a difference.

I can see why Preston Sturges sought his own directing ambitions after this film came out. It is certainly not a bad film, it’s actually quite good. The idea of a prosecutor falling in love with a defendant is interesting, and it’s well executed. The film also touches on Capra as small town sentiments are presented whole heartedly, not out of humor (aside from the citizens arrest sequence). I think I was expecting a screwball comedy and got a melodramatic comedy instead, which is not a bad thing. However, the film is weaker than Midnight. The second act dragged and flopped slightly in its conclusion. Watch this for the performances and careful directing, but not thematic execution.\n",

      "Serial shoplifter, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck), snatches a bracelet from a jewellery store, but gets caught red-handed. Despite the evidence against her, prosecuting attorney, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), is worried she could still get off. It is Christmas after all, and Lee is an attractive woman; the jury might well go easy on her. When a slip-up by the defence results in Lee's trial being postponed til the new year, it's John himself who winds up going easy. He bails Lee out for the holiday season, which is a silly move, because Lee has no place to stay this Christmas. And so, these two people - the criminal and the man prosecuting her - take off on a wintery road-trip to Indiana, to see their respective families.\n",
      "That synopsis, and the fact that the script is credited to Preston Sturges, might lead one to expect a wackier affair than the one we get. Yes, Remember the Night has its fair share of funny moments - the best coming from Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), who is giddily shipping John and Lee from the moment they enter the house - but on the whole, the movie is more interested in drama and romance than comedy.\n",
      "There's a gentle sincerity to Remember the Night, but it's not some syrupy concoction. There's something bitter stirred in with the sweetness, and while the overall result is feel-good, things are hardly wrapped up in a neat glittery bow.\n",
      "And yet, as good as it is, something stopped me from wholly giving myself over to the film. If I had to diagnose it (and I'm writing a review, so I guess I do), I think the problem lies in the fuzzy characterisation. The film (in the first third at least) wants the audience to see John as a shrewd, somewhat dishonourable operator... but it doesn't really work. Sturges and director, Mitchell Leisen, frame John getting the trial delayed until after Christmas as underhanded, though I really don't see what else he could do in the circumstances. He either challenges the defence council's huckster-ish claims and gets the trial postponed for reports, or he lets it slide and Lee goes free to thieve another day. Equally fuzzy is Lee's criminality, which gets vaguely pathologised throughout the film, without us ever really getting to the nub of it.\n",
      "Stanwyck is fantastic of course, and overcomes this weak characterisation, but still, it was enough to stop Remember the Night wholly clicking for me. I may well rewatch next Christmas, to see if it lands more cleanly.\n",

      "I am sure that people who are already familiar with Remember The Night already notice when it starts to become a more popular viewing choice towards the end of the year (due to it being set during the Christmas holiday period). I wasn't familiar with the film before now, but I suddenly started noticing it everywhere. I can only imagine that it's a solid choice for some of the classic movie channels, and the recent (typically sublime) UK Blu-ray release from Indicator must have helped it become even more ubiquitous than usual this December.\n",
      "Written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen, all you should need to know to get you interested in Remember The Night is that it was the first movie to pair up Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. It's not their best (because four years later they would work together in the classic Double Indemnity), but it's a very enjoyable use of their talents.\n",
      "Stanwyck plays Lee Leander, a woman who has been arrested on a shoplifting charge. She did it, and she doesn't seem too remorseful about doing it, but MacMurray's prosecuting attorney, John Sargent, knows that a jury can be affected by seasonal goodwill just before Christmas, which is why he is happy to request a continuance of the trial until after the holidays. Unfortunately, with no family or funds available, this means that Miss Leander will spend the holiday season in jail. Sympathetic to her situation, especially as he caused it, Sargent manages to get her out on bail. Dropped off at his apartment, Miss Leander quickly ends up making Mr. Sargent regret his good deed. He is heading home for the holidays, and decides to take Miss Leander to her family, where she can enjoy some time before heading back for her assigned court date, and so begins a blossoming relationship that could cause hurt and happiness in equal measure.\n",
      "The thing that works best about Remember The Night is that it's a message movie that delivers a message you might not actually expect. Yes, there are the usual enjoyable character interactions, and there's a fun set-piece or two (small in scale, but there throughout the runtime nonetheless), as well as the strengthening connection between the two leads, but this is a film that uses the goodwill of the season to reflect a light of joy/shame on the many supporting characters. Stanwyck's character is not pleading innocence throughout, nor does she ever really make any excuses for her own behaviour, but viewers, and those in the movie who get to know her without their view shaded by her arrest, can easily see that there is much more to define her than a penchant for thievery.\n",
      "It helps, of course, that Stanwyck's character is played by Stanwyck, an actress who I've never known to disappoint (although I still have so many more of her movies to get around to). It also helps that MacMurray is putting in yet another of those winning turns that he delivered for a good few decades, making him easy to root for even when he might not have been consistently in the right. Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson are a delight as two members of Sargent's family (his mother and aunt, respectively), Georgia Caine plays a much-less-delightful mother to our female lead, and Willard Robertson, Sterling Holloway, and Charles Waldron all get at least one good moment. It's also worth mentioning the small role for Fred 'Snowflake' Toones, a character actor who may be involved a couple of scenes that disappointingly play to the prevailing attitude of the era, but who deserves to be namechecked nonetheless. (it's the writing/direction that disappoints there, not his performance)\n",
      "It doesn't overdo the Christmas feeling, but you get it emanating from the screen at key points, making it easy to see why people may choose to keep this one in annual rotation. It delivers familiar good feeling with a satisfyingly unfamiliar sprinkling of realism . . . 1940s cinematic realism, which is still miles away from actual realism though. Determined not to let things turn into a fairytale, nor the characters to transform into a princess or prince, Remember The Night is a great example of how to give audiences what they want without letting them feel as if they have just been served a bland final product from the end of a standardised factory line.\n",
      "This may not have the constant snowfall and bell-ringing of other Christmas movie classics from this era, but that just gives you all the more reason to revisit it. I know that I'll be trying to make this a new December tradition in my house.\n",

      "Once we get out of John Sargent's apartment so Rufus can no longer be abused, the film picks up. If we had stayed in New York, this film would have sunk further. But I fell in love, absolute love, with Stanwyck as Lee. While \"Christmas in Connecticut\" is frothy and light, a romp, \"Remember the Night\" really gives Stanwyck a role to sink her dramatic chops into. The visit to her cold-hearted mother, how she accepts that she must serve her time instead of allowing Sargent to sacrifice for her, giving her heart to him, all the pain of the past and the potential for love in the future; Stanwyck, each and every moment delivers. There really wasn't any kind of genre Stanwyck couldn't occupy, but you give her drama and comedy together, the woman could be a powerhouse.\n",
      "Seeing Lee come alive when meeting Bondi, Patterson, and Holloway during the Christmas holidays, seemingly finding herself a real family, not to mention, romance with MacMurray, that is where the magic emerges for me personally. Even before the road trip when Sargent and Lee are at the dinner, there are real sparks. I could see why \"Christmas in Connecticut\" might be preferred, but \"Remember the Night\" doesn't embrace screwball totally, which was why I liked the latter more, to be honest.\n",
      "Besides how Rufus was treated, I didn't care for the detour (literally and figuratively) when Sargent and Lee are held under citizen arrest by a sourpuss not happy about how they run into his fence and slept in his farmland. That Sargent had to flee what would have been charges that cost him his law career thanks to Lee's use of fire, it just left a sour taste for me. I can't fully like Sargent because of how he treats Rufus, and this extra bit of breaking the law ruins him a bit. Some might say this gives him flaws. I dunno.\n",

But ADA Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) is on to his tricks and takes the opportunity to call an expert medical witness, which forces a continuance until after the holiday season.

After she shows up at his doorstep angry she won't be getting her free meals in prison (and because she also thought he arranged her release so they could meet), he offers to give her some money to send her on her way so he can go visit his family out of state.\n",
      "Once Lee realizes that Jack actually had no ulterior motives for helping her get out of prison for the holiday break, though, she actually does end up being more thankful for the kind act. They enjoy a meal together, and eventually they realize they are both from Indiana. After he finds out she hasn't been back home since running away years before, he offers to drop her off at her home on his way back to his own hometown. From there some wild antics ensue as they try to find their way home, eventually leading to a sour reunion back home for Lee. After remembering why she left home in the first place, she begs Jack to drop her off somewhere else. He instead offers to bring her back to spend the holidays at his boyhood home and meet his own mother (the always spectacular Beulah Bondi), but feelings start to arise between them that promise to cause an awkward situation between the prosecutor and the thief (who he is supposed to be trying to put in prison).\n",
      "I toyed with an extra half a star for this one initially, but I settled on a 3.5/5 because I definitely liked it less than the last Mitchell Leisen movie I watched (Easy Living). Perhaps it would have helped to watch this during the holiday season in order to get fully swept up in the emotions of things, seeing as how the events take place during Christmas and New Year's Eve. Whatever the case, the romance just ended up not hitting quite as hard as I anticipated (at least given its popularity here on Letterboxd). Don't get me wrong, MacMurray and Stanwyck are good together, but they lack that fatalistic intensity they would bring to the screen just a few years later in Double Indemnity. The Preston Sturges script also lacked the comedic flair he is so famous for, but I suppose it's not like anyone ever promised that here. I just wasn't expecting it to be as much of a drama as it was, I suppose. Fortunately the Edith Head costumes are great, so if nothing else Stanwyck is always looking as sharp as ever (even when she is busy helping MacMurray milk a cow).\n",

It’s not hard to find examples of this kind of blatant racism all across this era of films, but something about the aggression here is extremely off-putting—MacMurray calls him names even when he isn’t on screen and threatens to hit him when he is, and bail-bondsman Fat Mike shoves him against a wall while sneering and berating him—as part of a joke. That Rufus is shown to be afraid of Fat Mike is part of the gag (which is even worse), but rather than a belly laugh, I got a belly ache, and I couldn’t really forget it for the rest of the film...\n",
      "It’s all the more unfortunate because the rest of the movie is actually fantastic. Almost as hard to deny as the racism at the start is MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck’s tremendous chemistry, which I know best from Double Indemnity, but which, here, is put to even better use than in that noir classic, mostly because Stanwyck gets to be funny instead of “fatale”—although Barb still gets to lead Fred astray all the same. I just adore Stanwyck in comedy mode, and Preston Sturges’s script suits her no-nonsense patter perfectly. MacMurray also gets to play to his strengths as a square-jawed, square-personality’d boob hung up on Stanwyck’s endless charms. Unfortunately, I’m pretty sure that Sturges was in many ways muscled out of the second half of this film—the romance angle feels so much more cookie-cutter and less zany than Sturges at his best (the cross-eyed grandfather, for example, is Sturges, but the Niagara Falls speech is almost certainly not)—but, still, amazingly, it works! Right up until that Code-approved ending...\n",

If you’re making what’s first and foremost a romance, you can’t just cut to credits without concluding said romance.

And I've seen plenty of insane Code-forced morality in the last couple years. A laughable amount of character assassination and logic assassination crammed into like two minutes with her sacrifice being shown as a necessary emotional conclusion in a world premised around a DA's easy ability to get a girl out of jail for no reason. I guess I can't exclusively blame the production code for the messy premise and ending because this was clearly written as a \"their love/adventure corrupted him and saved her\" situation, as if his career success as a DA and the supposed hard work to get there as described by his mom made him a previously uncorrupted moral good and the love of a person from a perfect family was the only thing that could save her from her life of extremely mild crime. But thankfully I couldn't care less about any of this and my brain counts the line where that one juror whispers \"He's just trying to get her in wrong\" as the actual end of the movie and everything else as Preston Sturges doing a bit anyway, so we're all good.\n",

I also feel like I should have warned her that this is much different from Double Indemnity. I have the impression that she is too familiar with typecasting and immediately assumed Barbara would be the bad bitch again. And then she even called me out for being “too sentimental” by the end of it just because I was moved as I usually am when I watch my all time favorite.\n",
      "Anyway, I was able to pay attention to more things this time around. My review today will be dedicated to the awesomeness of Preston Sturges’ story. \n",
      "It’s not very easy to use “fate” and coincidences in your screenplay because they are often used as mechanisms to wrap things up or to artificially move the plot forward. Sturges definitely uses it the second purpose, but he makes it seem so organic in the story, even though the eventual path it took relies in many of those events.\n",
      "This resource is definitely noticeable, and it would heavily bother me in many different scenarios, and it might get in the way in the first viewing. However, Sturges always manages to also include the other side of the balance in the script, sometimes with expository dialogue, other times in a more dramatic way that could only be managed by Leisen.\n",
      "Showing the other side is extremely handy in order to improve the believability of a story. Demonstrating that your characters are aware of the luck their having over and over again makes us think the film at least acknowledges the situation they’re at, and juices the best they can from it.\n",
      "Another thing that definitely helps to improve in this aspect is how they face each one of them initially. Coincidences are a great complicators and the film gives them exactly this treatment when they initially come around. For instance, in the very beginning, Lee was okay with spending holidays in jail, she would have food and a place to stay but now that she was out, what should be a great thing after all she had her freedom, was actually dealt with as a complicator. Now she hadn’t anywhere to go but to accompany Jack in his trip back and that’s how it all begins.\n",
      "Along the way we have more and more of these complicators that are ultimately put to balance in the climax of the story, meaning, most importantly, that every action had a consequence, that would eventually have to come sometime but that most other productions ignore and call it a day. Having a purpose for every aspect is fundamental in storytelling in my opinion. This special dose of realism is just one of the factors that bring Remember the Night so close to my heart, the right story found the right people at the right time and the outcome is this glorious masterpiece.\n",

      "I'm not exactly sure what to say about this film. The racism and mistreatment of the Rufus character was very cringey, but admittedly was only for a very small portion of the film. I thought I was going to have more to say about it but it never popped up again, so that threw me for a loop. The main characters themselves were lovable and their romance was pretty good at jumping out of the screen at you. Stanwyck's performance is brilliant and she really makes the film alongside the meddling of the Bondi and Patterson characters, actresses that I remember fondly from It's a Wonderful Life and Little Women. Expecting perfection out of your children will get you nowhere, and if you can't show an outpouring of love towards your children after reproving them you are not a parent, you're an overseer. It's true that some people are fairly rotten and little will change them, but it's also true that a number of them could be changed by a little bit of kindness and nurturing and having the opportunity to regularly receive that. Cute film, really wish the racism hadn't marred it.\n",

      "I really think this is one of the greatest romances ever produced by Hollywood. A film that revels in gestures and glances, elevating attraction to a poetic form, complemented by Mitchell Leisen's unusually beautiful images, especially his use of high contrast black and white. It’s one of those movies that changes what kind of movie it is every 25 minutes or so, but each new detour is just as wonderful as whatever came before. Fred MacMurray is great, and I really think Barbara Stanwyck is one of the all-time great movie stars. In this, as in seemingly all of her romantic comedies, her soulful performance adds an uncommon level of depth to her scenes with her co-stars - she always portrays her affection and longing in ways that I find disarmingly honest. It’s enough to elevate any film; in a masterpiece like Remember the Night, it’s staggering.\n",

Should I lock up the silver?\" type lines) are probably better than the macro overall story.\n",
      "I am totally stumped as to why it's called Remember The Night. I must have missed a line or two? I went and Googled it, and found that the original script called it The Amazing Marriage which makes even less sense because nobody is married.

      "I watched it because I saw it on some holiday movie lists. It does take place over Christmas, and there's certainly enough frivolity and warmth to complement the season nicely. But it's not so festive that it can't be watched at any other time of the year. And it should be watched throughout the year. It should be more widely known than it is.\n",
      "The thing that struck me the most throughout the film is the strong undercurrent of grace, as the Sargent clan heaps kindness on Lee with no questions asked and without a hint of pity. Lee, for her part, accepts the love without bitterness or cynicism, despite a personal history that would make some amount of suspicion or callousness completely justified. The eagerness with which Lee so excitedly joins in with all the activities--the piano-playing, baking, wearing 30-year-old-dresses--in an attempt to soak up as much goodness as she can is as moving as her disappointing reunion with her mother is tragic.\n",

      "Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) has been caught stealing jewelry. It’s her third offense and she’s looking at a hefty sentence. In his opening statement, her attorney has cooked up a cockamamie defense involving hypnosis. But district attorney Jack Sargent (Fred MacMurray) suspects that the jury, full of Christmas spirit, will acquit her. So he arranges to postpone the trial until after the New Year. Feeling guilty over his ploy, he pays her bond so she can enjoy the holidays. Unfortunately, she gets dropped off at his door. When they discover they’re both from Indiana, they agree to take the road trip together. After a close call of their own with the law, they wind up at house where Lee grew up… but her mother (Georgia Caine) wants nothing to do with her. So Jack takes her to his own home, where his mother (Beulah Bondi), Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson) and helper Willie (Sterling Holloway, who I momentarily got mixed up with Stanley Holloway of My Fair Lady) welcome her with open arms.\n",
      "What a wonderful gem this is. The script by Preston Sturges is full of charming wit and the direction by Mitchell Leisen is incredibly generous with sentiment. Both have their roots in screwball comedy (Leisen’s lively Midnight and Preston arguably the king of the genre) but here they allow the comedy — which itself is delightful — to give way to deep, embracing warmth. Who wouldn’t be bowled over by the hospitality of the Sargent household, with Ma Beulah Bondi (two years after playing a much more elderly character in the gorgeous Make Way for Tomorrow) doting on you and the kindness of Aunt Emma and the goofy eccentricity of Willie (with such a surprisingly lovely singing voice). The contrast between the joy of Jack’s home and the cold rejection of Lee’s home lays the foundation for a fabulous, heartfelt romance.\n",
      "MacMurray and Stanwyck would of course meet again in the noir masterpiece Double Indemnity and the Sirk melodrama There’s Always Tomorrow (which could almost be an unofficial sequel to this film) among other pairings, but this was their first film together. The chemistry is fully felt, and the sparks fly whether in sly glances or steamy embraces. It’s a beautifully realized romance, the alacrity of which is easily accepted as Movie Magic. The groundwork is laid in their amusing cross-country adventures and the romance blossoms as Lee is welcomed as a human being with feelings rather than a scofflaw and disappointment. And my lord, Stanwyck (who has ties to Sturges in The Lady Eve and Leisen in No Man of Her Own — both fantastic films in their own right) is just the greatest. At the film’s climax we watch her face go from hurt to confusion to revelation to joy and then to sorrow. Seamlessly.\n",
      "The final scene may seem to be open-ended, but it says everything you need to know. Leisen and Sturges hit the perfect note. Despite the unfortunate circumstances of their love, the relationship we’ve seen develop between Lee and Jack is worthy of celebration. A beautifully rendered, expertly executed, and often exceptionally touching picture. It’s not a feelgood film… it’s a feelgreat film, one full of forgiveness and acceptance and just plain human decency. Possibly a future entry in my top 100. Rating: Great (94)\n",

Stanwyck is so touching, realizing what her life's been missing after she meets his hilarious, but really very sweet family, that I openly wept through most of the film. Though there are moments of amusing levity, this is really about a doomed romance, though perhaps there's a way for the characters to meet in the middle. Remember the Night shows what Christmas, family and love CAN be, but despite its romantic veneer, there's realism there too. It plays by the rules of drama, not screwball comedy.

The two leads are great and playing total opposites from the types we know them as in Wilder's classic noir, but other standouts are Beulah Bondi as MacMurray's well-meaning mother, and Sterling Holloway (whose voice you may recognize as Winnie the Pooh) as a simple farm hand.

      "Isn't this damn near unmatched with its heartwarming and heartrending ethos? Not an easy mode to achieve, yet it happens from the moment Lee's trial is postponed by Jack so her Christmas isn't spent in jail. Of course, she's a jewelry thief who he has assigned to prosecute, which gets followed by many contrasts of stirringly immense conduct. Having seen Leisen's Midnight in theaters recently, a glorious paradigm of incidental screwball, that seemed to be my assumption here. Instead, Remember the Night is far lighter on plot, but greatly reinforced by mended compassion. That's a major component of Sturges' script (about 20 minutes at Mrs. Sargent's home, followed by a New Year's barn dance elsewhere), in which Lee's sadness is boosted by curative comfort. Occurring right after the most visceral scene, too, when Lee shudderingly visits her spiteful mother (with some hope she'll be embraced during the holiday spirit), makes this next shift more poignant. As the New Year rings in, a potent reversal unfurls, where even Mrs. Sargent turns pragmatic to suggest that Lee's dishonor could ruin her son's hard work. A vast cavalcade of mutual retraction.\n",

I'll hoc the bracelet to go to Long Island!\"), hands flailing with multiple impersonations, is so dynamic that Stanwyck gazes with astonishment to her attorney, though MacMurray is amusingly content for him to prattle on. (Played by Willard Robertson, a highly prolific character actor who I've seen little else from, yet owns his frenzied theatrics.) Then there's Jack milking a cow after he gets lost in a Pennsylvanian field (along with the hilarity of it mooing through Lee's passenger side), the first sign where a solicitor in New York has embraced his homelier roots as a Hoosier. Equally sidesplitting is Lee's abrupt plan to start a wastebasket fire (or else Hank's claims of their property destruction would be severe), then bested by Mrs. Emory throwing water on him and her husband. In that sense, it's so delightfully eccentric.\n",
      "In another sense (and clearly the focal one), absolute merit reigns, by dint of Stanwyck's rueful brittleness and amazed gratitude. (A quote that somehow encapsulates both emotions: \"You mean...you're taking me home with you?\") Around a decade has passed since Lee's even considered to return home. Makes retroactive sense due to being banished from her mother because of shoplifting, only worsened when she's rejected again. There's a powerful flourish as Lee's mother walks away from the distant window in left-frame (after gazing at Lee's tearful despair on the porch), casually content to never see her again. I wouldn't quite call this one of MacMurray's best performances—he does what's required as a paean for decency—but offers shades that deepen. Truly enjoyed how his love is conveyed for Lee (by treating her with contempt so the jury can show compassion), and the subsequent close-up of confounded realization is soul-stirringly lovely. That's superb plotting, in which Lee invokes sacrifice to express her love, pleading guilty so Jack's career can stay afloat.\n",
      "Since when has a Christmas rom-com been concluded with this amount of bittersweet excellence? Far worthier to go there instead of a crowdpleaser (which Jack could've created by telling Lee to jump bail), and if that did transpire, it'd surely cheapen her. (Around this moment, MacMurray and Stanwyck receive a tip-top location where they're stunningly framed at Niagara Falls.) Other grace notes exist from earlier, such as their dance to Louis Armstrong's \"Indiana\" (a nostalgic ode for Jack and Lee's hometown), but then she suddenly departs mid-song, fueled by bleak memories that don't align with the Wabash's moonlight. So close to perfection this could've been (aside from Rufus as a stereotyped black character, then Jack mocks his valet's cadence), nor does that leaven with Fred 'Snowflake' Toones' laugh. Otherwise, I did like the opening 25 minutes (once Jack and Lee leave New York, the remaining hour and change is flawless), right until their acknowledged severance. \"Will you stand beside me and hold my hand when they sentence me?\" \"Of course, I will\", they vulnerably assert in a darkened jail cell, with only wistful patience being strained between them. If that's not love, well, then what is?\n",

      "Christmas gifts arrived late and the tree is still up so it's still OK to be watching Remember the Night, a Preston Sturges penned Christmas romantic comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. No doubt Stanwyck and MacMurray have chemistry, but Sturges script is a little underwhelming, especially in the first half when the film takes the rough shape of a screwball comedy à la Bringing Up Baby or It Happened One Night. It doesn't feel as sharp as Sturges later work, but the film does eventually come into its own as the Stanwyck-MacMurray relationship develops. It's a sincere melodramatic romance, I really believed it. It's a tender and sentimental film, perhaps a little overloaded, but that's typical of holiday fare. Barbara Stanwyck never misses.\n",

      "Because it is a Mitchell Leisen? Outside small circles few know who he was and indeed which films he made. Midnight might not be Only Angles Have Wings, and Remember the Night isn’t as wholesome as that other Stanwyck yuletide classic Christmas in Connecticut – but the films are a lot closer to true masterpieces than most in the genre, and well on par with almost anything Cukor/Hawks/Sturges/Capra made, not to mention celebrated films from guys like Van Dyke, La Cava or McCarey. And yet this is only my third* Mitchell Leisen, and I only now that thanks to a place like Letterboxd.\n",
      "Apparently Leisen was more or less pushed out of the inner circles of Hollywood for being openly gay, according to this great piece I googled, and his films buried. And with people like Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges backstabbing him (”an interior decorator who couldn't direct”), it’s easy to see how he faded away, with only minor success beyond the early 40s.\n",
      "Sure, visually he wasn’t always up there with the greats and his output seems a bit hit and miss, especially when he steered away from the comedy route. But the interior decorator had tricks up his sleeve, staging elegant scenes in front of a chateau (Midnight) or inside a Midwestern cottage (Night), or just nailing the meet cute.\n",
      "Was it the scripts that made him? Wilder & Brackett on Midnight, Preston Sturges on Easy Living and Remember the Night aren’t the worst companions in the industry. But they seem to have complained enough to give us a hint that the director knew something about film. And he did have a knack with actors (at least two Academy Awards wins). It doesn’t hurt to have the ace duo of Claudette Colbert and Barbara Stanwyck in these two films (and Jean Arthur in Easy Living) either – but someone needed to give them direction, and old Mitch seems like the guy who did it right. Colbert isn’t as magic as Stanwyck or Arthur in my book, but by God I’ll never compain when she shows up. The men, ah Fred is Fred and Don Ameche… he’d be fed to the lions opposite Stanwyck but survives Paris as Colbert’s beau (we all know he is).\n",

Stanwyck plays a con artist thief caught stealing a diamond bracelet, Fred MacMurray prosecutes but takes pity as it's Christmas and posts her ball through a slightly nefarious contact who then dumps her on him and they end up on a journey together, through the country, their past and their feelings\n",
      "I must point out Fred has a black servant who is very yassar and all that kind of thing and is portrayed as a bit dim. This is of course just a cultural element of the time so obviously we can't truly damn it but it does feel a tiny bit awkward this day and age.\n",
      "To deal with the core of this though, it's a wonderful masterclass in acting from an actor largely forgotten, or at least she's a bit ignored. Her trademark use of her eyes is forever exceptional as they dart about taking in her opposite player and surroundings. Her use of breaking and body language come to the fore in a particular heartbreaking blow scene but as usual from her in a natural realistic way, quite unusual for the time. While contemporaries Katherine Hepburn, Korean Crawford and Bette Davis were all incredible powerful performers, they were always a bit too much on the show boating side. Stanwyck has subtlety and restraint to make her characters feel real.\n",
      "There is a progressive element to the story too in so far as she's a woman taking control of her own destiny, not defined by a relationship with a man. She makes her own way in the world, albeit by criminal means (in some ways she's almost Catwoman you could argue)\n",
      "The film does get bogged down a bit of old country America stylings with a sing song around a piano and a barn dance at Fred's family home. It's another 'of the time' moment and to some extent is excusable for the ideas of showing what a caring family is like, it's just a shame it drags the pace and wit down a bit.\n",

She and MacMurray have great, natural chemistry, and she’s just a well written character—she expects nothing good from anyone, is incredibly world-weary, but she isn’t all bad, just grew up rough and turned into exactly why she was expected to be—a thief. Seeing her transform throughout the movie was a treat. I just wanted more dialogue between her and Fred to show their developing affection for each other. Her sacrifice at the end is definitely a tear-jerker…for once, she thought of someone other than herself and wanted to do what was right for him.

      "Four years before their classic pairing in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck starred in this very sweet and sentimental romantic comedy directed by Mitchell Leisen from a screenplay by Preston Sturges. Stanwyck plays Lee Lender, who’s arrested for stealing a bracelet from a New York City jewelry store, and MacMurray plays John \"Jack\" Sargeant, the assistant district attorney assigned to prosecute her. The trial begins just before Christmas, but to avoid facing a jury filled with the holiday spirit, Jack has the trial postponed on a technicality. When he hears Lee complaining to her lawyer about spending Christmas in jail, Jack feels guilty and asks a bondsman to post bail, who assumes that Jack wants to force Lee into an affair, and after freeing her, he delivers her to Jack's flat. Discovering that Lee is from Indiana like he is, and that she has nowhere to spend Christmas, Jack offers to drop her off at her mother's house on his way to visit his own family.\n",
      "Now given this premise and the previous work of Leisen and Sturges, I expected this to be another screwball comedy, but it’s definitely much more of a traditional romantic drama with comedy sprinkled in. When Jack drops Lee off at her mother’s and sees that she doesn’t want a relationship with her daughter, he offers to bring her to his family’s home to spend Christmas with them. Naturally they end up falling in love even though they get back to New York, Jack is still gonna hafta prosecute her for her crime, leading to a surprising, moving ending. \n",
      "It should go without saying that MacMurray and Stanwyck are both great with incredible chemistry. It should also go without saying that Stanwyck is ridiculously charming and beautiful. Beulah Bondi is great too as Jack’s mother, while Sturges’ script is great and Mitchell provides great direction. This was a very sweet, pleasant surprise. \n",

      "REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a strange hybrid screwball comedy/holiday picture/road-trip movie, with a little film noir thrown in. It has the last screenplay written by Preston Sturges that he let anybody else direct, and he didn’t like the changes this director made. Maybe Sturges’ original script would have worked better. The director though is Mitchell Leisen, who directed the wonderful EASY LIVING with Jean Arthur and the equally great MIDNIGHT with Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert. Many people love REMEMBER THE NIGHT as well.\n",
      "Judging the success of a movie that shifts radically in tone is very subjective. When I think it’s done well, there’s nothing I like better. But this one just didn’t end up working. I loved much of it. It’s very well shot, and is the first of several wonderful pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Most of the elements work fine together. It’s the sudden shifts into dark noir territory that aren’t prepared for or handled well. Those scenes don’t take up much screen time, but they throw the whole thing off.\n",
      "Most egregious is a lapse in professional propriety undertaken by MacMurray’s character (a prosecutor) and Stanwyck’s (a thief out on bail). I had suspended my disbelief easily because I thought I was being asked to do so for the sake of fun, but unexpectedly this breach of conduct becomes a noirish plot point and in fact central to the movie.\n",
      "This turning of a silly screwball premise into something serious not only wrecks the mood but wrecks MacMurray’s character as well, a man who we are given to understand is quite smart and ambitious and even street-wise. Such a man would never do what he does, unless nobody would notice in the make-believe world of a particular movie. You can’t have it both ways.\n",
      "You may be able to shrug it off and enjoy the other 9/10s of the film for what it is, with lots of warmth and humor and terrific acting by Stanwyck. I’m very fond of a lot of it. But there are some odd scenes that go nowhere, and the serious stuff just doesn’t fit in.\n",

The zip and wit is really downplayed though, replaced with a heaping pile of schmaltz that doesn’t do a great job of selling the ridiculous story. \n",
      "Is it really Leisen’s hack job that’s to blame? There’s something about the very unsatisfying ending that feels like some Hays code accommodations were made and that the sloppy results came out of a conference room rather than a bungalow on the lot. Stanwyck is still a force though and this first pairing with MacMurray feels natural and sincere. They’re doing a lot to make this a pretty enjoyable tugging on the ol’ heartstrings, and I couldn’t help but be charmed.\n",

The folksy affect akin to the Tom character included early on.

Wild run. preston sturges did the script for this movie and he was getting ready to become a notable American writer/director, This was the last time someone else would ever be directing one of his screenplays. To this point he’d been writing in hollywood for a decade, and for as long as he’d been writin em, he’d be feeling that directors were getting it wrong, no exception here with director mitch leisen. Mitch edited preston’s script to suit for what he thought were the strengths of our two stars here, but in doing so, cut a buncha dialogue that preston wrote. preston had enough and he pushed and pestered producers to let him direct his own screenplays, paramount eventually caved, and preston sold them the screenplay for the great mcginty for $10, on the condition that he would be hired to direct it.\n",

      "A cutesy Christmas romance pairing the handsome charms of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck together, with a screenplay from the comic master Preston Sturges, is a recipe for success. Somewhere along the way, however, Remember the Night gets bogged down in cheery Christmas hokum and loses the thread of wit initially penned by Sturges in its opening act. The opening of the film is quite humorous, with the improbable meet-cute of MacMurray as the New York district attorney prosecuting Stanwyck’s petty thievery, before extending the case past the holidays and bailing her out of jail to take a trip back to their coincidentally shared home of Indiana. Stanwyck shows off her acting chops in the film’s more dramatic moments, such as in confronting her emotionally abusive mom on the holiday trip home and in being warmly embraced by MacMurray’s humble country family in construct to her years of lowly existence slumming in the streets to get by. MacMurray proves less capable than Stanwyck as the film goes on, leaning into the hackneyed tone of the story as thing ramp up toward a romantic conclusion. Their chemistry as a couple, which started strong, dissipates once their inevitable pairing is confirmed, and the story falls into a rote pattern of romantic tropes covered in a tinsel dressing. There’s some other tedious issues, like obnoxious side characters that border on offensive in their depiction of both a Black servant and what appears to be a mentally deficient sibling, but they are mostly ignorable in comparison to the turgid pacing of the narrative. Still, Stanwyck never gives less than her all, and it’s clear that Sturges screenplay had something to it that just didn’t quite make it to the screen without his deft hand behind the directorial wheel. Remember the Night is a decent Christmas romp, with heart and glee and what not, but it’s just shy of having something special to set itself apart from the pack, falling instead into the realm of general Christmas classics that offer warm feelings for the holidays, but little else.\n",

      "Now that's a timeless Sturges line. Stanwyck is luminous and perfect, her chemistry with Fred MacMurray is really lovely. But the dated elements, however brief - the caricatured black servant, the corseted homey costume intended to endear us to a Nice Girl by making her old-fashioned/innocent - stood out to me more on this rewatch. There are really nice elements and sentiments to it; I appreciate the genuine care/respect it has for Stanwyck’s character, and even the corny stuff is nice. But it’s bookended by meandering courtroom scenes and that speaks to the movie’s overwhelming issue, which is its pacing. You can hear bits of Sturges in the script, and it makes me yearn for what this movie could’ve been under his direction. It feels a little defanged, and the beats are often uneven. Overall it’s a nice movie, it’s just never as memorable for me as I think it’s going to be. \n",

The DA, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray), pulls a fast one stating he needs his expert witness and the expert is not available until after Christmas, effectively jailing Lee for the holidays.

      "Although I can't stand Preston Sturges' treatment of African-American characters in his films (he wrote the script for this one), and you see that again with Rufus here (MacMurray's butler). Thankfully it is early and Rufus lives at MacMurray's apartment in NYC, so once Fred leaves for the holidays to spend time with his mother and family at his farm, out of state, as out-on-bond (arranged kindly by MacMurray so she wouldn't be stuck in jail during Christmas and New Years) pickpocket, Barbara Stanwyck, tags along (she visits her cold mother, disappointed and rejecting her). Going from her mother's cold reception to MacMurray's warm and friendly mother's farm is quite helps Stanwyck's feelings...the lack of feeling and cruelty gives us an understanding as to why Stanwyck is a wreck. MacMurray's comforting presence is really a big help to Stanwyck after that horrible experience with her mom.\n",
      "The film, to me--after MacMurray and Stanwyck nearly get arrested by a smalltown judge and a farmer who spite out of town city slickers (Stanwyck lights a basket of letters after they give the judge phony names!), accidentally going through a fence due to a bad detour--really reaches its most pleasant and emotionally rewarding when the duo reaches the spacious farmhouse of Beulah Bondi (playing MacMurray's mom), Aunt Emma (Elizabeth Patterson), and the great voice actor Sterling Holloway (Winnie, the Pooh, and Kaa of \"The Jungle Book\"). Stanwyck bonds with MacMurray's family, they pass around Christmas presents, play the piano and sing, and eventually attend a barnhouse old-fashioned costume dance. Obviously Bondi, knowing that Stanwyck is a criminal and MacMurray will be prosecuting her once they return to NYC, worries that her son could ruin a bright and promising career if he falls in love. Because of MacMurray's sacrifices, Bondi appeals to Stanwyck, hoping she won't hurt her hard-working son's career.\n",
      "The film definitely thrives off of the cast, and especially the dynamic and chemistry of the leads. Stanwyck's pain, the lack of a real family and actual love, her relieving Bondi of concern about jeopardizing MacMurray or putting him in a predicament, acknowledging her love for him, and realizing that he would give up everything for her, is all there in her exceptional performance. I prefer Stanwyck here than \"Christmas in Connecticut\" because it is more multi-faceted and requires a lot more nuance. Bondi's work, especially when her sister insists Stanwyck and MacMurray are in love at the dance, is also quite rewarding. The Niagara Falls conversation about romance and MacMurray willing to let Stanwyck go with the melodramatic music, ending with a kiss, then back to the courtroom in NYC. Stanwyck unwilling to let MacMurray convince the jury to let her off because \"women are hard to arrest\" because she loves him...her mind just going when in a cab, realizing he might try to help her because he loves her, Stanwyck really gets the point across that despite how she feels, his career is important to her. She's willing to take the time and how Stanwyck reacts to MacMurray telling her he'd wait for her...Stanwyck is just perfect. Those courtroom tactics MacMurray applies to ruffle feathers (jury and even judge), Stanwyck won't allow it. Great stuff.\n",
      "The show-stealing scene could very well be early in the film before the judge calls for Stanwyck's case to resume after the holidays, as Willard Robertson's blowhardy theatrics for the jury about HYPNOTISM is hilarious. MacMurray just lets him go then asks for a continuance with Robertson's reaction afterward just priceless. Just a wonderful little movie to watch at Christmas time. This was another film I caught on Turner Classic Movies just a few years ago and is now a gem I watch annually every December.\n",

Stanwyck doesn't even half convince as a homeless serial shoplifter but she convinces so bloody hard as a romantic lead I'm tempted to consider this her finest hour. Ditto MacMurray; both wring every last drop of wry humour and disarming pathos out of Preston Sturges' script. The ending is Hays Code fodder yet paradoxically better for it - it's a sombre, minor key end to an otherwise chipper film wherein every seemingly insurmountable obstacle was swiftly surmounted using the sheer force of quick senses and true love! Doesn't pander, doesn't wallow, doesn't think anything of itself other than what it is, and what it is is fabulous. Close to perfect, just not perfect enough, cos it's a bit racist. Not for long, but racist is racist, and yes I know it was 1940, but racist is racist, so I'm more than happy to dock a half star (at least).\n",

Because I am a huge nerd with fucked-up priorities, I feel actual guilt over this. Luckily, Hollywood has been cranking out movies about or at least adjacent to Christmas since the silent days, leaving me lots of older films to fill my December with.\n",
      "Which brings me to “Remember the Night.” The film has two factors that attract fans of vintage cinema. It was written by the highly respected Preston Sturges and stars siren of the silver screen, Barbara Stanwyck. (Who I previously encounter in “Christmas in Connecticut.”) Sounds like a good choice to kick off the month with!\n",
      "A few days before Christmas, Lee Leander is caught shoplifting. This is her third offense and she might be facing jail time. The prosecuting attorney is Jack Sargeant, who successfully convinces the jury to postpone the verdict until after the holiday is over. Feeling bad about Lee spending Christmas in a jail cell, he pays her bail. She accompanies him as he drives home to Indiana, with the agreement that he'll drop her off at her mom's house in Pennsylvania. But Lee's mom is an asshole, so she sticks with him as he visits with his own mom and family. As the New Year approaches, the two start to fall in love.\n",
      "As in the previously reviewed “Christmas in July,” Preston Sturges' dialogue here has certain zip to it. This extends to the character names – as with a colorful bail bondsman named Fat Mike – on down. From early on, the banter is quick and razor sharp. Probably my favorite example of witty exchanges here is when Lee succinctly points out the difference between her and Jack, with the metaphor of stealing a loaf of bread when starving. Another highlight occurs when she sets a fire to escape a tight situation, Lee dismissing the desperate measure in a typical flippant manner. The film is full of wacky situations – such as the couple falling asleep in a cow field, being accosted by the trigger-happy owner the next morning – but it's that fast-paced dialogue that truly keeps this movie light and entertaining.\n",
      "What elevates “Remember the Night” further is the surprisingly sincere romance at its center. Jack's interest in Lee is motivated by kindness, an emotion which soon turns to something more romantic in nature. The sexual tension between them is evident in that catty dialogue, to the point where neither the audience nor the characters are surprised when they start snogging during the Christmas party.\n",
      "Ultimately, “Remember the Night” points itself in even more important moral. Lee's mother rejects her daughter as the holiday approaches, because she's a judgmental bitch. Jack’s family accepts her into their home, and their hearts, immediately. Because family, ultimately, is not who you are born with but who you choose. You don't have to spend time with someone if they make you hate yourself. That's an important message to hear, especially around Christmas.\n",
      "Tying “Remember the Night” together is its lovable cast. Stanwyck is utterly delightful as Lee. She spits the razor-sharp dialogue with confidence and wit. She also displays a clear vulnerability, revealing the sensitive heart at the center of this thorny exterior. She plays off Fred MacMurray extremely well, who is also excellent as Jack. He brings a light-hearted energy to the part, approaching many every challenge with a smile. It's no wonder the two fall in love, as both are delightful.\n",
      "In the supporting cast, Sterling Holloway is immediately recognizable as Willie, the child-like handler on the ranch. Elizabeth Patterson is so sweet as Aunt Emma, in scenes when discussing the importance of acceptance with Lee over cooking pies.\n",
      "By the way, “Remember the Night” has a good share of Christmas atmosphere. Its first shot is a snowy city street, with Santa ringing a bell on the corner. There's a tree decoration sequence, a New Year's party, and a big family dinner. In other words, it's an ideal fit to kick off a Christmas movie marathon with. The cast is excellent, the story is full of humor and heart, and the execution is competent. After enjoying this and “Christmas in July,” I guess I should definitely watch more Preston Sturges movie.\n",

      "A petty thief (Stanwyck) is taken pity on by a prosecuting New York DA (MacMurray) who ends up taking her to his Indiana home for Christmas. The only thing that holds this back from utter perfection is a slightly muddled third act with some forced character lurches. What goes before is just wonderful - a playful treatment of morality and tolerance and family and regret. Such clever scripting from Preston Sturges, it just spins intriguing character beats that create these layered, very human characters. And for a light comedy it has a lot of darker spots and some very downbeat aspects. Stanwyck is just perfect as the most honest and noble of thieves, to the extent that she puts all the good people to shame.\n",

      "This column originally appeared in The Independent:\n",
      "In 1944, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck co-starred in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, a film noir generally regarded as the highpoint for the genre. One of four films featuring both actors, the first had an entirely different tone and ought to be considered one of the great romantic comedies. Remember the Night (1940) was the last Preston Sturges script shot by another director and it’s nothing short of a masterpiece.\n",
      "Sturges was irritated by the fact that director Mitchell Leisen shortened his script both before and during filming but the result is a blistering pace and the kind of economy most films would undoubtedly benefit from. We open with Stanwyck’s Lee Leander being arrested for stealing a bracelet from a New York City department store. MacMurray’s Assistant District Attorney is assigned to prosecute the shoplifter and has the trial postponed on a technicality since he is concerned the holiday spirit will lead to a lenient jury. Realising Lee will spend Christmas in prison and feeling a pang of conscience, he agrees to drive her home for the holiday season after learning they are both Indiana natives.\n",
      "The premise is that simple. A respectable, conscientious lawyer and a jaded, cynical career criminal are forced to learn from and about each other as they fall hopelessly in love over a few winter days. The Second World War was raging at the time of the picture’s release and there is a powerful message about the redemptive power of tolerance and the importance of second chances in a cruel, unforgiving world. More importantly, 77 years on, it’s still funny.\n",
      "Remember the Night was completed eight days ahead of schedule and $50,000 under budget, facts Leisen attributed to the imperious Stanwyck, saying: “She never blew one line through the whole picture. She set that kind of pace and everybody worked harder, trying to outdo her.” Somewhat sensibly, he shifted the focus of the script from MacMurray’s character to Stanwyck’s and was rewarded with a performance of such subtlety, depth and nuance that it’s impossible not to be moved by a line as simple as, “Gee, you’re sweet.”\n",
      "The film deftly blends humour and sentimentality while functioning as a courtroom drama, road movie and romantic comedy. The leads are perfectly cast and the pathos always feels earned resulting in a denouement that is astonishing moving. Frank Capra fans will find plenty to enjoy in a rare “opposite attracts” romance that never feels mawkish as will anyone with a beating heart.\n",

You could sense the coldness and hostility from Stanwyck's character's childhood home from how dark it is and the constant shadows used in many scenes at her home (her stepfather's just standing in the hallway with the light shining from behind him so its just a silhouette, her mom at the door after they left and peeking to check if they have left and her shadow slowly moving away from the door being turning off the house lights) like these are just details I appreciate so much!!

Its a bit cliche but love really does go a long way.

Barbara Stanwyck is typically fantastic as a woman who is simultaneously a sassy cocksure criminal and a damaged little girl struggling to forget her history. Fred MacMurray’s role is somewhat less nuanced (though this theme of conflicting duality ultimately extends to him too), but makes a strong romantic foil nonetheless; and there’s a nice supporting part for Beulah Bondi as his understanding mother — who, again, is capable of seeing both sides of the situation.\n",

I liked all the driving scenes, especially when they started to get lost, it was an interesting glimpse into how long-distance road trips probably would have gone back in the 1940s, and even though this wasn't a horror film I found it a bit atmospheric, especially with it being dark and they're being some snow on the ground.

      "Very enjoyable almost rom com that set the template for every Hallmark movie you've ever seen. Charmingly opposed couple leaves the big city for the quaint hometown and discovers, family, love, and the true meaning of Christmas. What elevates it is in the writing - a funny script that's never screwball but nevertheless has an extended bit about milking a cow - and performances, with Stanwyck in particular getting across the wounded little bird vibe of her character in a way that's wholly natural and not the least but condescending. It helps to that we see her go through some genuinely painful conversations throughout. Her rejection from home had me legitimately affected, complimented by the stunning shot of her mother leaving her cold and dark on the porch, making the conscious choice to turn the lights off. Further, MacMurray's mother's gentle - but still cutting - refusal to bless rhe couple is pitch perfect. Lee deserves love just like anyone else, but it just shouldn't be with her son. It's a minor hypocrisy, and thus believable.\n",
      "There's also an understated quality to the romance that works in the same way. Stanwyck and MacMurray just slowly grow on you with gestures and a general affability, there's nothing forced here. It earns its ultimate declaration of love scene, shot in gorgeous silhouette in front of an impossibly bright Niagara Falls. It's their honeymoon, a night they won't forget. I would have honestly been fine with a hard cut to ending there, but the film does enough with its last minutes despite the obvious presence of the Hays Code in the room. In particular, Stanywck's wordless realization that MacMurray really *will* throw the case for her, really *does* love her despite all he's worked for professionally, is just so golly sweet. I suppose it's fitting that she feels the need to make a gesture in return.\n",

      "Die psychologische Zeichnung der Figuren -wenn auch teils oberflächlich- gelingt sehr gut und bettet sich perfekt ein in die dichte Atmosphäre, die den Film seine Laufzeit über begleitet. Während der Film sich keinem Genre klar zu ordnen lässt, und immer wieder zwischen komödiantischen, ernsten und sentimental melancholischen Szenen hin und her wechselt, versteht er es doch, ein Ganzes zu sein, was vor allem durch die sehr gut geschrieben Dialoge und guten schauspielerischen Leistungen der Darstellern gelingt, die ihren Figuren eine angemessene Tiefe einhauchen. Ohne Vorwissen über den Plot ist „Remember the Night“ noch dazu echt fesselnd und unterhaltsam. Zwar hat er seine Längen, doch die stoßen nicht als negativer Aspekt auf, da der Film immer wieder an Schwung gewinnt und neue Elemente aufweist die bezaubern. Gerade das Finale hat mich nochmal sehr überrascht und die für mich aufgebaute innere Logik und gewollte Authentizität des Films untermauert. \n",

Without any prior knowledge of the plot, \"Remember the Night\" is also really captivating and entertaining. Although it does have its lengths, these don't come across as a negative aspect, as the movie keeps gaining momentum and has new elements that are enchanting.

He had to play a dumbed down, emasculated, subservient character for his entire acting career and he died much too young at 56. It's a monumental injustice to think of someone's entire artistic life completely penned in by racism.

A kinda fun roadtrip ensues, and then the melodrama sets in. And it is laid on thick. Stanwyck visits her estranged mother who is a Hoosier Demon that ruined her life and set her on the path of being a career criminal through sheer midwest emotional withholding and cruelty. Macmurray's family that they then stay with over Christmas is the polar opposite, and there's some teary eyed intense down home yuletide sentimentality for the rest of the movie. Its good if you want to get a bit emo around Christmas, but it's certainly not funny nor wickedly fun. Its saving grace is the empathy it has for criminals.\n",

      "Salió bien porque Sturges decidió que nadie más estrope... estoooo... dirigiría un guion suyo. Ahí salimos ganando por muchas razones. En primer lugar porque Sturges se descolgó dirigiendo \"Los viajes de Sullivan\" y \"Las tres noches de Eva\", así, para empezar. Y en segundo lugar porque Billy Wilder le tomó la matrícula a la decisión de Sturges y, tras la mencionada \"Medianoche\", \"Adelante, mi amor\" y \"Si no amaneciera\", mandó a esparragar a todo el que quisiese llevar a la pantalla uno de sus guiones. A partir de entonces sólo lo haría él.\n",
      "Wilder a su vez tomó buena nota de la química en pantalla de Stanwyck y MacMurray. Vaya si la tomó. Eso sí, le dio un girito de nada tanto al tipo de relación que plasmarían en el celuloide, como a la manera que tendría MacMurray de encender las cerillas.\n",

      "Remember the Night's story is the most dramatic and grounded I've seen Preston Sturges going. Yet, his ability to infuse a dreamlike quality into even the most realistic scenarios remains intact. The film expertly balances the line between realism and absurdity, serving as a testament to Sturges' 'fairytelling' prowess. You can seamlessly immerse yourself in the narrative without a trace of doubt. Barbara Stanwyck's presence, a strong contender for the title of Hollywood's greatest actress, further enhances the film. Her mastery of the art of make-believe, as seen in other classics like Ball of Fire and The Lady Eve, is clearly evident. Fred MacMurray once again proves to be a quietly great comedic actor, and Beulah Bondi to be one of the greatest maternal figures in cinema.\n",

      "Thinking that he was doing a shoplifter a favour by asking her trial to be postponed until after Christmas, an ambitious lawyer becomes guilt-ridden upon discovering that she was homeless and was hoping for a warm jail cell with a meal in this offbeat romantic drama. Both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray do well in the lead roles, with the film teaming them up a few years before Double Indemnity would enshrine them as cinema legends. Stanwyck's casualness towards stealing - while nonchalantly setting bins alight to get out of sticky situations - renders her a very interesting character, and while it is predictable that MacMurray will eventually develop feelings towards her, he puts up an initial wall of resistance very well. The pair also share some great adventures while on the road together, spending an indeed memorable night (and morning). The second half of the film becomes a bit pat once they get off the road and meet MacMurray's relatives, but this remains engaging while it lasts.\n",

      "This movie is less about Christmas songs, decorations, etc. and more about Christmas spirit and charity, in that McMurray's prosecutor character feels sorry for Stanwyck's thief character who has no place to go at Christmas, so he takes her home.

      "Four years before Stanwyck and MacMurray conspired in one of my favorite films Double Indemnity, they teamed up in this holiday romantic comedy for a much lighter dynamic. Well, halfway. Stanwyck is game for adjustment but MacMurray seems strangely close to the coldness of Walter Neff despite Stanwyck repeatedly saying what a good man he is. I wonder if getting introduced to him in My Three Sons reruns and Shaggy Dog movies gave me more of an impression of him playing against type in Indemnity and The Apartment than he really was.\n",
      "MacMurray is Jack Sargent, a New York City assistant DA (no relation to the Shaggy one to my knowledge) who finagles a delay in the trial of a petty thief named Lee (Stanwyck). It's hard to get a jury to lock up a woman at Christmastime, you see, so by getting a recess until past the holiday season, Jack stands a better chance of landing (the absolutely guilty) Lee in the clink. But when he overhears that she can't make bail he secretly arranges for the bondsman to let her out for Christmas. The bondsman, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, misunderstands the arrangement and sends Lee to Jack's apartment.\n",
      "This is already a highly suspect situation of ethics and Jack does everything he can to keep Lee at arms length, shy of doing anything whatsoever. He takes her to dinner and dancing (she's broke and he deprived her of a free turkey dinner in jail, after all) and later they roadtrip together to visit their families for the holidays. It's not love at first sight but it's not hard to see where this is going. The roadtrip angle is drafting off It Happened One Night, though it never matches that movie's energy mostly, it pains me to say, because MacMurray is so strangely committed to being a wet blanket. Even Stanwyck's purposefully-and-beyond stick-in-the-mud partner Gary Cooper in next year's Ball of Fire was better at harnessing comic energy.\n",
      "But the movie's strengths don't rely on the comedy, but the Movie Gifts theme - family. First they stop by Stanwyck's mother's house to find the cruel old crone has remarried and has nothing remotely kind to say about her daughter. The Preston Sturges script has had crackling moments, but it's neve more effective than Jack reading the homelife Lee has escaped and calmly telling off her horrible mother \"We'll be leaving now, Mrs...\" \"My name doesn't concern you.\" \"You've got that right.\"\n",
      "This sets up a contrast with Jack's family, a warm and caring couple of aunts (old pros Beulah Bondi and Elizabeth Patterson) and his dimwitted brother (Sterling Halloway playing slightly more cartoonish than most of his famous animated voice roles). They naturally assume that a lady travelling with Jack must be a soon-to-be-wife and welcome her into the family. This is my favorite section, with the aunts bickering and baking and everybody attending a New Year's Eve dance. This is the kind of movie my grandparents would have grown up with, and I can feel the influence of the era (if not this movie specifically) on their lives and homes.\n",
      "The shenanigans along the way are also a point of amusement about the past that has long fascinated me, mainly how law and accurate record-keeping were enforced in days when licenses were scraps of paper and any central databases covered only small sections of the country. The answer is as I suspected, that people lied their asses of all the time to avoid punishment. Here Jack and Lee lie (and set fire to) a local police precinct, then lie their way through the Canadian border on the way back. Happy New Year! The Social Contract goes the way of auld lang syne.\n",
      "The movie is bookended by courtroom scenes - a dangerous move in my book - but the first is played for comedy and the last is effective, thanks again to the Sturges touch, as we and characters realize Jack's strategy for getting Stanwyck off the hook without being (more) obvious about demolishing the prosecution's handling of the case. The ending, however, is not quite as expected as the journey would make it seem. Hard to get Double Indemnity out of the head, though this is of course far less extreme.\n",

It is a fun road trip movie for a bit before settling into a Christmas drama as you learn more about her backstory. This part is nice but the film really shines when you get into the third act and the characters lay everything out on the table. There is a beautifully shot scene that is back-lit by the Niagara Falls that sweeps you away in the romance. Then, the courtroom finale has some fantastic payoff when you realize just what's going on. It's just a shame that what should be a feel-good ending is undercut by a moralistic ending that screams of studio interference.\n",

      "Yes, once again (or rather, once before), Stany is forced to spend Christmas on a farm in the sticks—though it's all a little less screwball this time. In this \"pre-war\" (I mean some countries I could mention were already at war but that's none of my business) melodrama-tinged romcom (heavier on the rom than the com), it's less about whether the career gal will finally settle down (a theme I've noticed in the post-war Christmas films I've been watching lately) and more about whether the shoplifter will finally be sent down. Yes, Stany's a real crook this time, not just a phony, and ol' lantern-jaw himself, Fred MacMurray, is the prosecutor who sees to it that her case is postponed until after Christmas—which means she'll be spending the holiday in jail! Fred feels bad, buys her dinner, finds out she's a hoosier like him and offers to give her a lift to her mother's old place on his way back to visit the family… but will their plans change and she'll come home with him instead and they'll fall in love and she'll learn a valuable lesson? I'll never tell! 😉\n",
      "I have to say that at first I really didn't think I was going to like this. There's an interminable courtroom scene early on, with the long-winded defence lawyer spinning a yarn about how Stany was hypnotised, which it seems the jury is going to swallow hook, line and sinker. This doesn't seem to be a film which has a lot of respect for either jurors or defence lawyers. Then there's the offensive portrayal of MacMurray's Black servant (Fred \"Snowflake\" Toones) as dim-witted (\"but a great cook!\", says MacMurray). In Christmas in Connecticut there's a brief scene of a Black waiter explaining the etymology of the word 'catastrophe' to Uncle Felix; it's fairly patronising, with the humour obviously meant to derive from the supposed incongruity of a Black person being more knowledgeable than a white person (and some additional fun being had at the expense of someone whose first language isn't English), but give me that over this any day.\n",
      "It does get much better once it leaves the city, though, between the blossoming romance between the leads, the affecting cruelty of Stany's mother, and the warmth and kindness of MacMurray's family (his mother is Ma Bailey!). The ending is perhaps a little unsatisfying due to the constrictions of the Hays Code, which demand that Stany be punished for her crimes, but it's almost more subversive that way—is any audience really going to be rooting for her to go to prison? It's almost like the film observes the letter of the Code while sneaking in some anti-carceral messaging in spirit.\n",
      "This has a sprinkle of It Happened One Night, and also shares elements with a couple of films that came out the year before: your actual Aunty Em on a farm from Wizard of Oz, and a scene where a woman holds on to a bedpost while another woman tightens her corset out of Gone With the Wind, with which it also seems to share some of its racial politics. Possibly it's all coincidental, and Wizard still hadn't broken even at this point so maybe nobody was consciously emulating it, but you have to wonder.\n",
      "Stany met screenwriter Preston Sturges on this picture, who would go on to write The Lady Eve for her, possibly her finest moment. Still, I don't know if I've ever seen Stany look more luminous than she does here, her initial toughness quickly giving way to vulnerability.\n",

This may not have anything like that film's reputation, but to me it's ultimately the more successful of the two, despite a rough start.\n",

The level of detail in the sets and in every character is of such a high caliber I doubt I’ll ever tire of it. There are many cut-aways to an aunt fantasizing about being young enough to wear lingerie or exchanging a knowing glance. Every character, no matter the size, is specific and gets to have a bit of extra behavior. I don’t know much about director Mitchell Leisen, but the amount of care he puts into each element of this film is something worth studying. At the heart of the film is Barbara Stanwyck playing—I think—her most vulnerable role. We care about her so much because Preston Sturges wrote her to be an unapologetic criminal whose history of rejection and mistreatment gets incrementally revealed, allowing us to worry about her future. We then get to see her seeing MacMurray’s loving, kind family, knowing that it can never be hers, that her destiny is prison, that she has no one to turn to in the world. It’s beyond heartbreaking and it’s a masterclass in engendering--and motivating--viewer empathy for one’s hero/heroine. And of course Stanwyck meets every moment with her superlative acting ability. Everyone should watch this movie. It’s a tearjerker but it’s not at all manipulative. It’s executed flawlessly, aside from a few moments that have aged badly regarding race. Most remarkably, it ends on a hopeful note that doesn't feel even slightly forced or saccharine.\n",

They show once again that they have phenomenal chemistry, they showed it in the psychological suspense movies and right here in the romantic comedy they radiate sympathy, tenderness, splendor.The romance is very well developed, because both characters get to know each other in a reasonable period of time, specifically the christmas season which makes it more beautiful. They have many scenes just them, which allowed the romance that was being created to be conveyed in a better way. What i like about this film is that the romance is not instantaneous or superficial, like other romantic comedies, that is thanks to how the story developed and also thanks to the power and talent of both actors, they are great together. I loved when Jack takes Lee to spend christmas with his family, since she had nowhere to go.

After that, hijinks ensue and of course they end up together.\n",

It’s a good script, although Leisen chopped up quite a bit of what Sturges delivered (that was one of the catalysts for Sturges to move into directing his own work—and also gave him a chance to offer Stanwyck the lead in The Lady Eve, which established all the modern romantic-comedy tropes). They still remained friendly, and in fact Sturges was on set during much of the filmmaking, which is rare even now. It’s an amusing film that’s a good substitute for It’s A Wonderful Life, if you don’t want to do that again over the holidays. It’s pacy at 90 minutes, and while not quite the bona fide classic that some people have tried to make it out as, Remember the Night is a fun watch.\n",

      "Remember the Night Stars Fred MacMurray as a prosecuting attorney and Barbara Stanwyck as the petty thief he's prosecuting right before Christmas. Sensing in the judge a streak of Christmas goodwill, he successfully moves to postpone the trial until after Christmas. He feels bad, however, about Stanwyck being stuck in jail throughout the holidays and so offers to pay her bail. Upon finding out she doesn't have anywhere to go for the holidays, he invites her home to visit his family in Indiana for one last holiday before she's locked up. This is a weirdly sweet holiday movie that is a little jarring considering I most know this pairing from their work in Double Indemnity, which is definitely less than sweet. Unfortunately once they've established the sort of unorthodox dynamic, the rest of the movie plays out much more like a typical romance. The ending does go in a slightly different direction than I expected, but thinking back on it that's the only part that really took any chances with the story. It's probably worth seeing especially if you are fan of either of the stars, but it didn't blow me away.\n",

And Stanwyck -- the camera loves her look and her talent, and so do we. A winner! Reminiscent of many other lovable films, too numerous to mention. Well let's mention a few: I Know Where I'm Going!, Ball of Fire, You Can't Take It With You, Christmas in Connecticut, It Happened One Night, The Princess Comes Across, Hands Across the Table. Double Indemnity! Arsenic and Old Lace! Very fun, and dare I say, moving. Quite different from the Sturges/Stanwyck The Lady Eve, and Leisen's Midnight and Easy Living. And yet so many common threads, it's a great addition to a classic movie collection.\n",

I started to think it was an allegory for how bad society treated women who weren’t considered “pure” enough in those days.

It's anchored by two great lead performances from Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche, but the film's frequent twists and misunderstandings mark it as the most screwball of comedies. Remember the Night, now my second Leisen, has a much less ridiculous plot—even if it's about a district attorney falling in love with a defendant during one Christmastime—and instead works primarily through Barbara Stanwyck's wiles and Fred MacMurray's inability to resist them. Their romance is predicated on a lopsided power dynamic where Stanwyck virtually has no choice but to seduce MacMurray, as it is the only way she can save her own skin, and as this plays out in their increasingly morally strained romance, the emotional resonance becomes tempered with fears of the ramifications of such concessions.\n",

And that ending is 100% the hays code fault.

This part of Stanwyck's character's life is forever closed off from her. Beautifully acted and filmed.\n",

      "Mais um melodrama com traços cómicos, que se desenrola sob guarida do road-movie, do que uma comédia screwball de ritmo alucinante repleta de situações caricatas – uma constatação que tem o seu quê de surpreende dado que Remember the Night (1940) foi escrito por Preston Sturges. O modelo narrativo do road-movie, que na época se tratava de um género ainda com poucos exemplares, é empregue com distinção. Dois desconhecidos evadem o caos da cidade de Nova Iorque rumo ao estado de Indiana onde ambos nasceram. Durante a viagem pela América rural, os protagonistas reencontram o seu eixo no mundo e reconhecem que a mão um do outro é aquela à qual querem dar a sua para o resto da vida. Embora a província norte-americana seja retratada com contornos mofadores (a sequência do julgamento é a mais engraçada), o elogio aos valores de família e honestidade campestre são de um candura inegável. A órfã é recebida de um modo tão acolhedor pela família do advogado do ministério público que a acusa que é como se ela estivesse a ser adotada em idade adulta. A presença de pieguice melodramática é incontestável. Contudo, o tato do realizador, e em particular do duo de protagonistas, faz com que Remember the Night tenha um núcleo emocional autêntico. O dilema moral construído por Sturges demonstra também o quão apurada era a sua escrita. A estrada que a ação percorre conduz-nos a um ponto no qual os protagonistas têm de se autodestruir de maneira a provarem o seu amor. Sargent tem de sacrificar os anos penosos que passou a estudar para ser um advogado em Nova Iorque e Lee tem de abdicar da sua liberdade. Sturges sacode o final feliz que seria protocolar e faz com que uma autoemulação se transforme num ato de redenção e legitimação de amor.\n",

      "Watching the sequences with Rufus, beyond just the historical racism of them, is jarring because you can almost see the actor, Fred Toones, \"dumbing himself down\" for the role, which is even more sinister considering his character is mostly played for laughs, and as a device to essentially cement white supremacist racial hierarchies and confirm status quo.\n",

(Relatable.) Being treated like a person is healing for Stanwyck, and falling in love is corrupting for MacMurray, who goes from being a straight laced DA to trying to throw off Stanwyck’s theft conviction for love.

      "Fred MacMurray is a boring square, which is fine as long as he's *playing* a boring square; he's not exactly Gary Cooper but he gets the job done at least. Stanwyck sells their romance with no help from him; in fact there's tons of tiny little moments here to remind you that Babs is one of the best actors of all time, just breathtakingly good, elevating already-solid material 3 or 4 levels higher by her performance alone.\n",

Halfway through I gave up on trying to make out the great stage sets through the muddy analog murk, and just listened on while I resuming reorganizing my tape library. I still got plenty of enjoyment out of it, but I'd love to catch a proper print or restoration of this some day. Good enough to rewatch.\n",

I felt for sure she was leading him on with the whole hometown bit, the way that narrative pays off is actually really touching and good. This movie will definitely activate your Christmas Spirit zones without getting sappy about it. Many have complained about the ending, surely a necessity under the Hays code; it still \"works\" for me, because even if MacMurray and the audience can forgive Stanwyck, society never will, and thus the film, in microcosm, cannot either.\n",

Preston Sturges's script is a perfect hybrid of romance, light comedy, and deeply affecting pathos. The humanity in this is just beyond the norm for old Hollywood, but certainly not beyond the norm for Sturges who was one of the most empathetic screenwriters we've ever had.\n",
      "For all the goodness to be found in this movie, it's doubly baffling to see such extreme racism around the character of Rufus. I'm used to seeing racist bullshit in old movies because these are literally documents of a completely different era with completely different values and perspectives, but this one just went beyond the norm in the worst ways. The big difference here is that multiple characters in the film verbally abuse Rufus, the black servant character, and for no reason whatsoever. None of it builds on the story, and none of it does anything for the characters, so it's really hard to understand why any of it is there. It's a counterweight to everything that I wrote in my previous paragraphs, but at least the there's very little of it in the film even if it is infuriating when it shows up.\n",

      "If you asked me about my favourite Christmas film, I would promptly name Frank Capra’s classic It’s a Wonderful Life, a movie that has become part and parcel of our family’s Christmas traditions. And then, I’d probably stop, scratch my bearded chin and say, “But let’s not forget about Remember the Night.“ The only thing is that my children would hardly enjoy it as much as James Stewart realizing what life in his hometown would have been without him.\n",
      "Still, Remember the Night is among the Top Five Christmas Films for me because it aptly balances sentimentality and tragedy and as the script was written by Preston Sturges, it also throws in buckets full of intelligent humour. Paradoxically, the script may owe part of its power to the Hays Code, which insisted that a crime must not go unpunished, and so the thieving Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) has to atone for her act of larceny, which consists in stealing a ring – whose symbolical meaning may be read as a desire for human closeness. When we later come to meet Lee’s mother, a cold, prim and proper Puritan lady, living in a decaying and dimly lit Gothic building, we can understand why Lee has drifted into her petty criminal life. Interestingly, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) has grown up in similar circumstances, and when he was a boy, he also once stole milk money from his mother (Beulah Bondi) – but it was his mother’s love, rather than an adament moral self-righteousness on the part of his parent, that made him realize the wrongness of this act and consequently work off his moral and financial debt. The message is clear: It is more through love, kindness and human proximity rather than through the unfeeling insistence on an ethical code that children are taught to become reliable and valuable members of society. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Sargent home stands in stark contrast to the Leander home, the former being brightly lit and full of chattering people where the latter is gloomy and inhabited by two human gargoyles. Lee’s mother pretty much ignores John Sargent – probably because her Puritan imagination can come up with only one explanation as to why her daughter should be travelling through the country with a male stranger – but Mrs. Sargent and her sister receive John’s female companion with open arms, with the warmth of the season and, this can hardly be over-estimated, without questions. And yet, the script is not so starry-eyed as to be blind to a mother’s natural worries for her son, which becomes clear in one of the film’s highlights, namely the scene where Mrs. Sargent, after realizing that her son has fallen in love with their unexpected Christmas guest, goes into her room in the last night of their stay, in order to probe Lee and to gently point out to her the social danger Lee is putting John in. Stanwyck is standing in front of a mirror here – like in another of her famous films during an interview with a mother figure – but this time, she is holding a comb in her hand and the mirror stands for Lee’s look into her own soul.\n",
      "As I said above, the Hays Code may have helped here, but Preston Sturges might have come to the film’s conclusion, anyway, and so we don’t have the typical cheesy Christmas ending but a more mature denouement, which takes into consideration the fact that a person may not be ready for true happiness and freedom until they have fully come to terms with their own past and accepted responsibility for themselves.\n",
      "Despite this rather serious message – a message which successfully fends off cheesiness, by the way –, Remember the Night is a delightfully humorous Christmas film, and Mitchell Leisen’s direction is both lavish – as in the scene where John and Lee visit the Niagara falls at night – and exuberant. The director made some changes in Sturges’s script, which put off the latter to such an extent that from that moment on, he would direct his own scripts himself, which may be seen as another Christmas gift this movie makes.\n",
      "So, even though It’s a Wonderful Life will remain my unconstested Christmas favourite, Remember the Night will also keep its unshaken place in my Top Five Christmas Movies.\n",

      "4 years before they teamed up for Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray starred in this sentimental romantic dramedy (notably, the screenplay was penned by Preston Sturges, in his last? non-directorial effort). Stanwyck is Lee Leander, a shoplifter who is nabbed and sent to trial a few days before Christmas. MacMurray is John Sargent, an attorney assigned to get a conviction on her. Suspecting that he is about to lose the case to the in-the-holiday-mood jury (and the truly inspired theatrics of Leander's lawyer (Willard Robertson), probably the funniest scene in the movie), Sargent maneuvers to get a continuance until after the holidays. But feeling guilty about it, he bails Leander out so she can at least enjoy the holidays.

But this Christmas movie also has a melancholic bite to it, a dark cloud in the form of the uncertain fate awaiting Leander in court, which becomes a storm when bonds eventually form between Leander and Sargent.

I understand the escapism of the middle is supposed to yield tragedy at the end, but it just feels like everything is played so close to the vests that the romantic development just feels stunted. There are certainly beautiful, stunning moments (Niagara Falls scene!).

      "There's a dread that punctuates the comedy and romance of Remember the Night, a haunting that comes to the fore as MacMurray accompanies Stanwyck on an executioner's walk to her childhood home, a Victorian Gothic shadow on \"the other side of the tracks.\" After their brief and disatrsous reunion, MacMurray comforts Stanwyck on the porch as her mother passes like a ghostly apparition behind a lace curtain in the window. By contrast, MacMurray's childhood home, suffused with the warm light of family and filled with Americana characters right out of a postcard, would seem entirely opposite. Yet, when MacMurray's mother (Beulah Bondi) makes her cruel turn — pulls Stanwyck aside and tells her she's not good enough for her son — the camera captures Bondi's reflection as she ascends the staircase and locates in her another maternal ghost standing at a callous distance, framed by a window of sorts. Stanwyck is a woman who doesn't need to be told to give a false name, having already cast off her inheritance years ago, and she is more than ready to accept that she doesn't deserve MacMurray's name either. Stanwyck's brilliance as an actor is to convey this roiling tragedy beneath her shimmering surface. MacMurray, by contrast, relies on his large frame, its solidity giving greater weight to his straitlaced kindness as his life begins to revolve around Stanwyck's.\n",
      "On their journey back to Indiana, the two end up sleeping in a farmer's field and are wakened when a cow greets them through the window, rurality intruding upon these fallen city folk. This picturesque romantic scene is interrupted by a farmer, brandishing a gun, who soon embroils the two in petty legal squabbles. Their adventures with the justice of the peace mark a turning point in the dance that sees MacMurray become disillusioned by the justice system and Stanwyck become enamored by the possibility of her redemption within it. By his mother's machinations, MacMurray ends up giving both her and Stanwyck a perfumed called \"One Hour of Ecstasy.\" His mother has no need for it and Stanwyck comes to believe she doesn't deserve it. This refusal is put to the test at Niagara Falls, the icy water glowing pure white as the lovers embrace in dark shadow. The hour passes, and Stanywck chooses to submit herself, for the first time, to the ordeal of holding fast to her own identity.\n",

      "\"a double-bill review with TITANIC (1953)\"\n",
      "Two Barbara Stanwyck pictures, REMEMBER THE NIGHT is a choice Christmas movie, directed with a nimble deftness by Mitchell Leisen from a Preston Sturges script, and betokens the first pairing of Stanwyck and MacMurray in a motion picture which would continue for overall four times, among which the apotheosis is Billy Wilder’s noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944).\n",
      "Stanwyck’s Lee Leander is a homeless (yet inexplicably glamorous) shoplifter under arrest and MacMurray’s John Sargent is the assistant district attorney, her assigned prosecutor. Out of the latter’s tactic and conscience, they end up together for the holiday season, with the court will resume after the New Year. After realizing both are from Indiana, they embark on a home-coming trip which will only compromise the case when they inevitably fall in love with each other.\n",
      "REMEMBER THE NIGHT is notably for blending heterogeneous elements from Sturges’ script together: a courtroom drama (with Robertson shamelessly and ludicrously hoking it up like nobody’s business as the defense attorney, but marred by a sign of the times of portraying an African-American manservant as a halting prat), a zipper caper (their detour in Pennsylvania allows John a taste of the brush with law, as they are accused for trespassing and destruction of property), a holiday heart-warmer (with John’s convivial family warms up to Lee, who is rejected by her own remarried mother, even ), and eventually a swooning love story (a romantic interlude in Niagara Falls, foregrounded by shadows and profiles of embracing and necking) that feels convincing and surprisingly grounded with a sagacious ending.\n",
      "The film has more than enough Midwestern goodwill, homespun folkways and level-headed charm to spare, especially in John’s family. Sterling Holloway’s cousin Willy is a buffoonish simpleton, Elizabeth Patterson’s aunt Emma is a hoot of a spinster and as John’s mother, Beulah Bondi is expertly tactful in handling their budding romance with an earnest plea that is quite tricky to pull off. While MacMurray proves to be understatedly amiable, Leisen’s natural propensity warrants that the stakes are in Stanwyck’s performance, which is as extraordinary as you might hope, even Lee’s characteristics are within a conventional spectrum, she is a crook without a wicked bone in her. Her outpourings always hit the mark because she can dial up the degree of intensity at the drop of a hat (checking her scenes with Bondi during their crucial exchange and in the final court kerfuffle), without looking theatrical.\n",
      "Jean Negulesco’s TITANIC is 20th Century Fox’s first enterprise about the proverbial ocean liner tragedy and an antecedent of James Cameron’s juggernaut. Boasting the accuracy of its navigational textual actuality, the film fairly sheds light on what is the causation: two mixed telegrams about the threat of an iceberg (one of which is delayed), the pursuance of a record-setting speed and shy on binoculars for lookout, it is the combination of manmade error, poor judgment and technological deficiencies.\n",
      "Stanwyck and Webb play Julia and Richard Sturges, a wealthy, but estranged couple. She plans to spirit their two unwitting children Annette (Dalton) and Norman (Carter) away to her hometown in Michigan, harboring a not-so-popular idea of raising them as down-to-earth Americans than rootless Continent-dwelling-and-trotting expatriates. Their heated ructions reach the flashpoint when Norman’s paternity is divulged, that embitters Richard and deeply wounds his consanguineous pride, whereupon he cruelly snubs Norman and busies himself with playing bridge. Only during the moment of life and death, heartfelt reconciliations (first with Julia, then Norman) become the balm that eases him into accepting his fate with the Grim Reaper.\n",
      "Among other passengers, Thelma Ritter is always a sight for spontaneity and sideswipes as a nouveau-riche grande dame, who refuses to be manhandled by anyone and is uncannily acute to spot a pond scum amid the melee; Richard Basehart’s defrocked, self-hating, bibulous priest is a lost cause whose emitting of vicariously felt distress saves his final sacrifice becoming an empty gesture. Also Brian Aherne’s sturdy captain betrays minimal outward emotions, maintaining his honor and dignity until the last minute but a glint of regret and guilt isn’t entirely negligible in his eyes.\n",
      "The film’s shipwreck visuals, as a matter of course, look dated and artificial on a “a boat in a water tank” level. However, when the ship is in extremis and the Christian hymn “Nearer, My God, to Thee” is playing, Negulesco nearly captures the solemn pathos that elevates the film’s projected impact.\n",
      "It is interesting to see Stanwyck play another woman who stands on a lower moral ground than her male counterpart, but Julia holds her own despite of her unfaithfulness. Thanks of Stanwyck’s standing, her measured elegance and approachability, Julia isn’t a mere faulty part in the tug of love, against Webb’s slightly intolerable priggishness, but a woman whose realness reflects, however subsidiarily, in this handsome, but overly drawing-room drama-cum-fateful disaster spectacle festooned with the gravitas of respectability and nobleness.\n",

For all its syrupy sentimentality it also cuts through that a bit with a pretty moving humanist bent about although some people react to adversary in their upbringing in different ways, everyone is deserving of forgiveness and a chance to see the goodness underneath their flaws. Plus, Stanwyck and MacMurray had great chemistry, and the rest of the cast is also really good, particularly the mom and the aunt. Something about that scene where they are signing around the piano on Christmas Eve, I don't know what it was, but it got to me. Mitchell Leisen and Sturges were a good team, this one worked for me.

Remember the Night, sensitively directed by Mitchell Leisen, is firmly in the latter camp. When it's trying to make the audience laugh, it's very charming. When it's trying to make the audience cry, it's touching, but a bit baffling. I think I may be in the minority on this, but it felt like its melo-rom-com tone sat uneasily in Remember the Night.\n",

She, as she usually does, is the film's beating heart. She's matched by a charming young Fred MacMurray, but it's hard not to feel like he's a little out of his depth. Beulah Bondi also does some reliably beautiful work as MacMurray's mother, effortlessly embodying the film's complicated tone. It has some real pleasures within it, even with a striking and odd ending, but it doesn't quite feel totally successful.\n",

Sturges' script is more infrequent with its jokes and slapstick compared to his later films but it's no less of an enjoyable watch because of its tender, melancholic story. Barbara Stanwyck is phenomenal in this and completely steals the show. Fred MacMurray is good as a square lawyer but Leisen correctly re-frames the camera around Stanywyck, focusing more on her inner turmoil and redemption and letting her performance breathe. The beautiful Niagara Falls scene, which has perhaps the most sublime lighting in a movie with all around great lighting, really highlights this because MacMurray's face is totally eclipsed in shadow while Stanwyck's beautiful, tear-stained face subtly glows with heavenly lighting as they share a tender scene. All around a great film but its Stanwyck's performance that ultimately elevates this above some of the other Golden Age Christmas classics.\n",

And the ending has a sliiiight \"Will Hays Made Us Do It\" feel, but it's not enough to negatively affect this lovely, lovely movie. Stanwyck shines, as always, as the intensely likeable crook, Lee. The scene with her mother is honestly brutal for being all of about 90 seconds long, and the scene with Beulah Bondi telling her about her son's efforts to overcome poverty to become a lawyer actually made me tear up. This is a Christmas rom-com but it's also a movie about someone experiencing a lot of different kinds of love all at the same time and more importantly for the first time, and it makes the iffy ending easier to take. There are people and relationships worth bettering yourself for, even if you haven't previously considered your own well-being worth tending to. So glad I watched this.\n",

The combination of Stanwyck’s radiant performance, Preston Sturges’s zingy script (the last he wrote before embarking on his own career as a director), and Leisen’s polished sophistication yields one of the most intoxicating romances of the 1940s.\n",

      "Director Mitchell Leisen and screenwriter Preston Sturges are invested in these characters and it shows especially in the second half. The second half of the film touches upon how Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) and John Sargent (Fred MacMurray) had very similar rough upbringings. They both came from very poor families, but they ended up living very different lives in adulthood due to how their parents raised them. Leander's parents hate her and practically ruined her life. She has to steal in order to survive because no one would give her a job after her parents call her a dirty thief in front of everyone in their small town. John had a loving mother who encouraged him to work his way into law school and he ended up having a successful career as a lawyer. What I'm basically saying is that Remember the Night is about nature vs. nurture.\n",
      "Barbara Stanwyck gives such a great performance in this that I'm surprised she wasn't noticed for awards season when this originally came out. Barbara says so much with just her facial expressions. You don't need to hear her speak in order to understand what she is feeling. It's honestly these types of subtle performances that I tend to adore than the bombastic performances that you tend to see win awards (I like to call it the \"YELLING MEANS I'M ACTING\" performance).\n",
      "I do want to talk about two other things. The cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff is a thing of beauty. The way he uses low key lighting during the night time scenes makes it look like an expressionistic, film noir at times (which is appropriate since it's a romance between a lawyer and a thief). Remember the Night will probably be considered corny by some due to its sentimentality. I personally don't think it's a bad thing at all. I actually missed it when films showed genuine emotion instead of hiding behind self-aware irony because studios are afraid of audiences thinking a film is cheesy. That type of self-aware irony makes a movie just plain cold and emotionless. It's why I gave up on majority of modern Hollywood blockbusters because there is no soul behind any of it.\n",

The middle was missing that tension between distancing from her as a woman of trial and falling in love helplessly - there was no moment where you see this switch happen or feel that anything really changed so drastically to justify his behaviour at the end. John was aloof and carefree during the whole holiday season and only considers whats to come when he’s in Canada.

To pull off a love story with these lopsided dynamics, you have to convince us that this man is a genuinely honest and well-intentioned man, and he does just that. \n",
      "Which gets to why the movie is so good as a whole. This story has so many complicated dynamics, and could easily be thrown off by poor execution. But instead, it’s all handled with so much care and intelligence, that it’s pulled off so well. Jack’s mom is a perfect character and a perfect representation of this point. She’s a good and caring woman, who isn’t looking down on a woman for running into the law during tough times. BUT, she also knows the damage it could do to her beloved son’s career. And the way she went about it all was so well done and sensical, and you respect her even when she’s trying to keep the leading romance apart.\n",

      "To cross the gender gap I’ve always had an issue with Fred McMurray. I saw him for the first time in The Apartment (1960) and ever since then I’ve never been able to get his character out of my mind. The same happened with Bruce Dern and The Great Gatsby (1974). You play an irredeemable asshole once and if I saw it young enough, you never outlive the stain. No, I think it’s to do with their lack of range. McMurray has never played against his type: clean cut, cold behind the eyes, and smug. \n",

I’ve been meaning to see The Lady Eve (1941) and it looks like Barbara Stanwyck plays another crook in that. \n",

Like fiendishly adept at wriggling her way out of and yet into trouble, drop her right down with boy scout McMurray and have them drive each other crazy. More screwball is what I’m asking. Lots of cut downs, playful toying with each other, and ending up in glorious love. \n",
      "Instead this is a rather nice but sappy morality tale about what lack of love does to some people. That segment at Stanwyck’s old familial home was heartbreaking and done rather well. The atavistic portrayal of a home christmas in this was wholesome yet awfully treacly. I thought it was alright, palatable for sure. \n",
      "Though I have issues with the script and especially the construction of scenes, I enjoyed parts of it. Seeing Barbara in a dress from 1908 was just amazing, a corset and everything. Even if they improperly cut away from the reveal of her descending the stairs. So many transitions in this were botched or didn’t fit thematically or emotionally. \n",

      "As a fellow Hoosier, any movie that takes place in Indiana will always peak my interest, but I was determined to watch this movie when I found out that one of my favorite filmmakers of the classic Hollywood period, Preston Sturges, wrote the script for this movie. Sturges got his start as a screenwriter, but eventually worked his way up to director after a good decade in the business and getting annoyed with the changes to the script he wrote, including this movie. As a Sturges fan, you can tell traits of his style in here, but it lacks that tight pacing and cutting wit that his films would become known for, as this is more akin to the style of someone like Frank Capra with his more sentimental work. That isn't to say Remember the Night is lesser, as this is a very charming holiday romance from two legends of the screen, but my expectations were completely different to the final product as something akin to the Lady Eve or the Palm Beach Story. Anyways, Remember the Night lives and dies off of the two leads, and fortunately both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray deliver. This was the first of four collaborations, and it is easy to see why as both play off of their types very well and you believe their growing romantic relationship later on in the film. Stanwyck in particular really shines here, as the material she was given really does showcase the dramatic range she had, and filling out the complicated role rarely given to women at the time with such grace. There are plenty of fun supporting roles too, including Beulah Bondi as another mother type and of course she kills it, and it features Sterling Holloway in probably the most on-screen appearance I had seen him in a movie. I can kind of hear Pooh and Kaa, but not really. The movie isn't really all that funny, which I feel is where that Sturges touch is sorely missing the most, but Remember the Night is still very irresistible as a solid romance and a good message about kindness and compassion for others. Which is a perfect message for the holidays!\n",

      "The plot of the film is a bit far fetched but the gist is Stanwyck is a woman on trial for shoplifting theft, and MacMurrray is the hard nosed prosecutor. He is concerned the jury will acquit her of the charges because of Christmas so he asks for a continuance until after the holidays. When he understands Stanwyck will spend Christmas in jail, he kindly put some wheels in motion that she can be out on bond for the holidays. You'll have to watch the movie to see how that decision plays out!\n",

      "I have a vague memory of seeing a bit of this on TV about 40 years ago, so I had a memory that it is about an upstanding law man (Fred MacMurray) who for some convoluted reason ends up taking a woman he is prosecuting (Barbara Stanwyck) back home for Christmas. And that is the basic plot, but I had forgotten so much of the details that I won’t click the “watched before” button. \n",
      "The film was written by Preston Sturges, but except for certain misunderstandings that people have about their relationship, there isn’t much of the “that’s the way the world works” cynicism usually found in his work. Instead, the film has a lot of pathos, as Stanwyck finds acceptance and more from MacMurray’s family. \n",
      "The film was directed by Mitchell Leisen, who also directed another Sturges’ script (Easy Living). Reportedly, Sturges demanded that he be allowed to direct his own scripts because he was so upset about Leisen’s work, something I’ve never understood. \n",

      "One other little thing that I can’t stop thinking about:  in one scene, MacMurray makes popcorn, putting a lot of butter and salt on it. As he and others take a few nibbles, someone says “don’t eat it all, we’re going to string some and put it on the tree!”  And I can’t stop thinking of putting popcorn with all that butter and salt on the tree.\n",

This film, along with The Shop Around The Corner, make a great pairing. Wonderfully written romances with a hint of melancholy.\n",

The story is your typical rom com so it’s kind of the cliches you’d expect although I’ll be nice to this movie since this was made way before the cliches really started since this is one of those movies that was early on them. One thing that makes it more charming is the chemistry between Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck is infectious and both are extremely charming together with some really engaging conversations they have. One thing I also kind of like is they are kind of criminals, well at the beginning the lady is one while Fred eventually does, so they are like a way cleaner Bonnie and Clyde (sadly not as good).\n",

The completely earnest touch is actually exactly what it needs, it has to to be incredibly warm and tender and needs to not bring any note of irony to the idea of the all-importance of being raised in unconditional love. Stanwyck's performance just melts my heart, all sass and smarts but the vulnerability just below the surface is always tangible. Her line reading of \"I'm afraid so\" while she pauses brushing her hair and looks into the mirror might be the finest moment of her career (you'll know what I mean when you watch it). Not that It's A Wonderful Life is any less perfect, but in terms of my pick for favorite Hollywood Christmas movie of all time, Remember The Night is it.\n",

I found some version of it on Youtube with lyrics that seemed to match what I thought I remembered hearing. I saw a comment from someone saying they loved the song and how movingly Barbara Stanwyck sang it in Remember the Night. I looked it up, saw that it was a Christmas movie and kept it on ice in my watchlist for a few months.\n",
      "A couple weeks ago, I was in the Christmas spirit and decided to watch it. It wasn't streaming anywhere, so I rented it on blu-ray from a local video store. It looked as pristine as a crisp winter's day in Pennsylvania, but to my displeasure, there were no subtitles available on the disc. And I really depend on subtitles. I had to turn it way the hell up to understand what they were saying (Preston Sturges wrote it, and Fred MacMurray muttered a lot, so the dialogue was really fast but also really quiet). I probably understood about 45% of what was said, but it was sweet and I liked the sentiment. And Barbara Stanwyck sure sang a nice rendition of \"The End Of A Perfect Day.\"\n",
      "Well anyway it's two weeks later and the Criterion Channel has uploaded Remember the Night, complete with subtitles! This always seems to happen when I rent a movie from the video store. So you're welcome! Enjoy Remember the Night, and check out Passages while you're at it. Merry Christmas!\n",

      "I sadly was left bitterly disappointed with Remember the Night. Individually as performers, I love Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Together they also have fantastic chemistry as shown in Double Indemnity and There’s Always Tomorrow. This happens to be my least favourite film of the three. I thought MacMurray was okay here but not his best. Barbara Stanwyck to me carried the film. She was amazing and proved to me once again why she’s my absolute favourite actress of all time. \n",
      "Remember the Night is a romantic comedy for 95% of the film and then the ending turns into a drama with a very serious tone. I don’t mind the ending actually to be honest but the rest of the film missed the mark for me. I didn’t find it to be funny, really at all. I think it’s a nice good feel movie (again, 95%) but I was just left wanting more. It was written by Preston Sturges who’s done some great work previously. I’m not sure, perhaps I’ll revisit this around Christmas time again to see how I feel but I was so excited to see this pairing again and they were good and the story was solid but I think just overall, it’s a dull film. \n",

      "Four years before the classic noir Double Indemnity, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck starred in this romantic comedy, though the comedy is in a surprisingly minor key. MacMurray plays a prosecutor and Stanwyck plays a thief he's prosecuting, and they both improbably end up on a road trip back to Indiana for the holidays. MacMurray and Stanwyck are believable enough together that they help paper over a variety of weaknesses in the script -- ethnic stereotypes, so-so comical misadventures, overly sentimental depictions of small-town life, etc.. The story has a few unexpected twists interwoven with familiar cliches, and there's an unusual air of melancholy that runs through the film. Certainly not on par with Double Indemnity, but has a little more heart than you might expect.\n",

      "이 영화를 보고 프레스턴 스터지스가 이후 자신이 직접 자신의 각본으로 영화를 찍겠다고 결심했고, 그 해 <위대한 맥긴티>로 데뷔를 하게 되었다고 한다. 그 이유는 이 영화의 각본 중 여러 부분이 스터지스의 동의 없이 감독 미첼 레이센의 임의하에 잘렸고, 그런 부분 또한 잘 묶여진게 아니라 어딘가 중간에 끝난듯한 느낌을 준다. 가령 검사인 잭과 피고인인 리가 중간에 사유지를 모르고 침입하였을 때, 치안 판사에게 데려가는 순간 치안 판사가 보는 현상 수배범의 사진을 클로즈 업 하더니만 이후에 그와 관련된 일이 전혀 나오지 않을 뿐더러, 엔딩 또한 중간에 끊겨 이후 재판 과정의 일이 나오지 않고 엔딩 크레딧이 올라온다. 더욱이 프레스턴 스터지스 본인이 감독한 영화와의 차이가 많이 드러나는데, 만약 그였다면 인물들의 카우보이 숏이나 혹은 풀 숏으로 인물들의 코미디를 찍어냈을 장면같은 것들이, 가구나 인테리어 등을 전경에 배치해놔서 오히려 사람은 가려지고 소품들이 강조되는 일들이 꽤 많다. 하지만 아이러니 한 점은, 미첼 레이센의 전작이자 스터지스가 다른 각본을 쓴 <이지 리빙>에서 처럼 이러한 방법이 주제면에서 꽤 잘 맞아떨어진다는 것이다.\n",
      "영화의 오프닝에서 부터, 미첼 레이센은 도둑질 하는 바바라 스탠윅의 모습을 찍는것이 아닌, 그녀가 보석 팔찌를 차는 장면과 손이 사라지고, 그 자리에 있던 종업원이 다른 보석을 찾는 것을 진열장 사이로 보여주며, 카메라가 빠지면서 종업원의 말과 표정으로 그녀가 보석을 훔쳐 달아났음을 보여준다. 더욱이 이후 그녀를 곧바로 포착하는 것이 아닌, 팔에 찬 보석을 클로즈 업 한 쇼트로 넘어간 뒤, 카메라가 점점 트래킹하면서 뒤로 물러 나면서, 그녀의 모습이 드러나는 방식으로 찍었다. 더욱이 그녀를 변호하는 변호사가 배심원들에게 보석의 마력과 그것을 원하는 사람들의 심리를 이야기하는데, 이 때 레이센은 단순히 보석의 아름다움을 표현하려고 하는 것이 아닌, 그것으로 인한 사람의 도덕의 이중성을 보이려고 한다. 물론 그것을 훔치는 것은 잘못되었지만 반대로 보석에 대한 이끌림을 표현하고자 하는 것이다. 게다가 아이러니 하게도, 이후 이어지는 리와 잭의 고향으로 향한 여정은 보석에 대한 이끌림이 아닌 그저 환경 때문에 훔칠 수 밖에 없다는 상황을 역설하기에 정반대이다. 이후 이러한 보석에 대한 사람들의 동경과 같은 쇼트는 미국 시골의 전원적인 인테리어로 대체된다.\n",
      "그 이후 잭의 집에서 풀 숏을 찍은 구도를 보면 대부분 전경에 가구를 배치해 그러한 시골집의 분위기를 자아내는 쇼트들이 많다. 반대로 리의 집에서 리의 어머니가 그녀를 보고 싸늘하게 대하는 장면 또한, 인물들을 찍는 와중에 어두운 집의 조명과 반대로, 전경에 놓은 램프의 불 빛과 같은 경우로 표현된다. 여기서 왜 스터지스가 레이센과의 결별을 선언했는지, 그리고 빌리 와일더가 그를 가장 싫어한다고 했는지 이해가는데, 미첼 레이센은 소품들을 사용해 분위기를 자아내려고 하며, 심지어 그것을 위해서 각본을 어느 정도 희생하는 경향을 보인다. 하지만 아이러니한 점은, 반대로 그렇기 때문에 오히려 각본에 다른 강점이 생긴다는 것인데 보석을 훔치며 살아가고 또 그 보석에 매혹되는 여성이 반대로 그런 부와는 정반대인 시골의 집과 그를 대표하는 검사인 잭과 사랑에 빠지게 되는 모습은 앞서 보석을 강조하며 그것의 매혹을 뽐내었던 연출들과 같은 방식으로서 제시된다는 것이다. 물론 이는 <이지 리빙>에서도 보였던 레이센 특유의 인테리어적 미적 감각과 연결되는 것일 수도 있다. 인테리어 디자인만 따진다면, 당시의 영화들 중에서도 몇 십 년은 앞서있는 것이 많으니 말이다.\n",
      "하지만 그렇기에 <이지 리빙>과 같이 그러한 보석에 대한 매혹과 분위기에 매혹된 여성의 모습을 보여줌으로서 <그 날 밤을 기억하라>의 연출은 그 효용을 얻는다. 난 이것이 <이지 리빙>의 예외라고 생각했는데, 이 영화를 보니 아마 이것이 미첼 레이센의 스타일인거 같기도 하다. 더욱이 그에 대한 글에서 처럼, 그의 영화는 도덕에 대한 양면성이 그 스타일과 어우러져 있다. 잭과 리가 다시 뉴욕으로 돌아오기 위해 거치는 곳인 '나이아가라 폭포'에서 잭은 리와 신혼 여행으로 나이아가라 폭포에 오겠다면 좋겠다고 이야기하지만, 리는 이미 여기가 나이아가라 폭포라며 키스한다. 그리고 바로 다음 쇼트에서 나이아가라 폭포의 물줄기들은 뉴욕의 마천루로 변하게 된다. 어느 정도 이분법적일 수도 있겠지만, 여기서 미첼 레이센은 도덕의 양면성을 보석과 전원적인 생활로 나누어 보여주고 있다. 하지만 그의 연출 스타일과 동일하게, 우리 모두는 그것에 끌린다. 물론 그것을 훔치거나 하는 것은 영화 속에서 계속 언급되어진 것 처럼 환경이나 인물의 문제일 수도 있겠지만, 리가 정말 배고프면 빵을 훔치겠다는 잭의 말에 \"당신은 정말 정직하다. 나 같으면 레스토랑에서 풀 코스를 먹고 지갑을 잃어버린척 하겠다.\"는 말처럼 그것은 상황의 문제이기도 하다.\n",

Add Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray to the proceedings, and the screen will be as combustible as a trash can full of paper hit with a lit match.

While he didn’t directed, you can tell that it’s a Preston Sturgess script, because the dialogue between the two of them is very fast, paced and very modern. It was also cool to see, stirring Holloway, who would later voiced Winnie the Pooh and the snake from the jungle book in this movie. Once again, Barbara Stanwyck can do no wrong.

      "A tepid and tonally haywire festive drama of romantic redemption with strong but capricious notes of screwball comedy at its beginning and very end. It was in and around the courtroom, on the day before the Christmas recess, and the day after it, that the film thrived, the sly manipulation of the system and the commentary on the practicalities of convicting someone during the season of charity and good cheer drawing chuckles if not belly laughs with their cutting cynicism, but during the road trip and the family reunions which constituted the Christmas bit of the film proper, the slapstick was half-baked, then eschewed in favour of some rather too easy and ultra-predictable invocations of love and graft.\n",
      "The start was a promising one, and a very Christmassy one, too, light glinting off jewels, shop frontages busy, and Jingle Bells integrated into the score; the contrast with the clipped, sanguine conversations about strategies for prosecuting repeat offenders taking place in the much staider professional interiors suggested a screenplay well attuned to the comic potential of souring the Christmas spirit, and which was only going to get funnier as the plot found more ways to counterpoint the wholesome and the pragmatic; this was not quite what happened, however. Fred MacMurray’s demon lawyer had a black manservant who was slow-witted to an extent and deliberate in his enunciation in a manner which accorded exactly with the racist stereotype, miring the film down for a time, before prosecutor and perpetrator set off on their seven hundred and fifty mile road trip of what seemed set to be madcap misunderstandings and smart one-liners delivered across the dashboard (if cars of the era had such things) from opposite sides of the legal fence. The screeching to a halt before diversion signs on icy roads was carried off rather well, with the vehicle apparently genuinely out of control for a stretch, although the cow-milking and citizen’s-arrest routines the closures ultimately gave way to were each one or two calamities or awkwardnesses short of inducing hilarity. The odd droll development, an ungainly crouch or a preposterous cover story, got a titter, but these were not compounded with further insults or injuries before the scenes came to their mildly underwhelming ends.\n",
      "Having arrived in Indiana, the thrown-together couple’s first stop-off all of a sudden indicated that their tale was absolutely no laughing matter, despite the fact that that was very much what it had been being presented as for well over half an hour by that stage. The chill villain of the piece had a few too many details to hand to have convinced fully even in a melodrama, but it was more that melodrama was the genre in which they plainly belonged, not the knockabout stuff of Remember the Night, which proved so off-putting about their appearance. After that, it was on to the film’s goodies, who among their number featured another Hollywood simpleton type, the purified ‘Willie’, this one’s interventions coming nasally and at a high volume, plus a character who was the perfect host except for repeatedly forgetting that things were in the oven, precisely as someone with her wherewithal would not have done. Things became extremely relaxed upon this rendezvous, with singing and present-opening so sincerely serene that the temptation was to leave them to it, and to have a snooze. Events which might have been grand comedic set-pieces, the jumble sale and the New Year’s Eve dance, were permitted to pass with only a brief look-in to check that all was well, which of course it was. The recollections concerning corsetry and the associated dressing procedure from the house’s elderly resident offered some astonishment at what was by all accounts the historical standard, but there was no intrigue to be found in the question of whether there would be an acceptance of a criminal brought into the upstanding citizens’ midst, nor in the question of whether criminal and attorney were going to be sharing a kiss come the end of the holiday period. She seemed to have forgotten that she was given to stealing things, and even if she had been given to slip a candlestick into her handbag, the tolerance of those adopting her knew no limits, while MacMurray was hardly given any opportunity for reckoning on the now-serious situation, merely falling into the pair of arms which had been positioned next to him and stage whispering to the face above them.\n",
      "It took them a while to get back to the courtroom, via some studio space vainly aping some majestic exteriors, and some dialogue which skated over the tough moral quandary which had been contrived for them. The final darkly comic sequence did go a little way in terms of restoring the film to our hearts, as the bite returned to the principal tongues and a situation was allowed to become unbearable. Overall, though, slow and draped-tinsel loose as it was, Remember the Night did not provide a night to remember.\n",

      "If you were to ask someone their favorite thing that comes along with the holiday season, you might hear answers such as the gifts (giving or receiving), the time spent with loved ones, the spirituality of it all, or even for some simply the day off work. However I believe one of the greatest qualities of this time of the year is the forgiving of past wrongs from loved one to loved one (even if it’s just for a few days) for nothing more than the sake of a holiday. Almost no other time is this kind of apathy practiced, but for those few days out of the year it’s such a beautiful thing to see people look at each other with such innocence in the face of all potential prior ills. However, before tonight I’d never found a film that properly represents this wonderful aspect of the holiday season. This constantly charming film fills that void in such a moving & emotional way that I couldn’t help but smile with satisfaction, knowing I now have a piece of art in my life that represents one of my favorite aspects of the season. I could go on and on about the technical aspects of the film (this is one of my favorite pairs of lead performances ever!), and maybe later I’ll do that, but for now I just want to sit back and appreciate this endlessly special film. Forever thankful to Preston Sturges❤️\n",

      "Four years before making Double Indemnity, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray filmed this enjoyable romantic comedy, directed by Mitchell Leisen from a Preston Sturges script. The story is far-fetched – lawyer MacMurray prosecutes shoplifter Stanwyck, feels bad about leaving her in jail for the holidays and bails her out, only to be stuck with her on a Christmas trip back home, and you know they will fall in love. Stanwyck is wonderful as always; some of the best moments in the film are when she doesn’t say a word but expresses a range of emotions with her face. MacMurray is solid as the decent guy trying to do the decent thing. Sturges was unhappy with the film because they cut some of MacMurray’s speeches to make him more laconic, and that convinced him to direct his own scripts, so there is a second reason to celebrate this film.\n",

The only negative about this one is the unfortunate and racist characterization of MacMurray’s Black butler at the beginning of the film, a problem that plagues countless films of the time.

      "Four years before their legendary pairing in \"Double Indemnity,\" Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray teamed up for the first time in \"Remember the Night.\" Written (but not directed) by Preston Sturges, it features many of the trademarks he'd come to be known for - quick banter, sizzling chemistry, and a skillful mixture of comedy, drama, and romance.\n",
      "The premise: It's Christmastime, Stanwyck is in court for shoplifting, and MacMurray is the lawyer opposing her. He realizes the jury is much more sympathetic during the holidays and likely to acquit her, so he convinces the judge to continue the case after the new year. That means Stanwyck will spend the holidays in jail. The sympathetic MacMurray calls in a favor and bails her out. As far as \"meet-cutes\" go, this is a pretty good one. One thing leads to another, and they end up on a road trip together to meet her family and then his. But it's strictly platonic, of course. Or is it? Of course it isn't!\n",

Terrible! There is also a vile joke about Chinese people eating dogs, which is an old chestnut that's unfortunately still repeated today. This type of outdated \"humor\" sometimes makes an unwelcome appearance in older movies - and Sturges was especially guilty of it.\n",

Not sure if this was a message that the U.S. government asked Hollywood to actively inject into their films around this time to make law enforcement officials’ jobs easier or what. Moonrise is ultimately the stranger, more interesting of the two and, as an added bonus, its single African American character is at least treated with respect by the filmmakers, unlike in this film.

Leisen’s softening of Sturges’ madcap bent works wonders; I marveled at the balancing act between comic set-pieces and heartbreaking sincerity. Truly, the highs and lows are (sometimes) unbearably polar in their opposition: Stanwyck confirming her mother’s steadfast disdain for her before arriving at MacMurray’s home of origin, a home whose picturesque family, location and tone are located at the intersection of sweet and warm. (Spoilering: And then, in reverse, the downright moving litigious action MacMurray takes to get Stanwyck cleared of her legal trouble and then her insistence that their connection be forged in the pureness of honesty subsequent only to her having faced responsibility for her crime.) \n",

      "Calling it: Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray together are one of our greatest screen couples. Here it’s not the savage seduction of Double Indemnity, nor the mature melodrama we saw in There’s Always Tomorrow, but a third mode – I suppose you would call it a romantic comedy, though the mode is really only comic for the first half hour or so, and built into the slightly contrived bunking opposites setup. But that arrangement doesn’t generate the usual steamy tensions and flirtatious sparring - instead the lightness disguises a layered drama full of hard edges and outright cruelty. The dynamic between them has the same basic shape as always - he's a domesticated professional, perpetually befuddled but drawn towards Stanwyck's hungry outsider, lonely and a little desperate - but Remember the Night puts them on a journey of dawning possibility and growing empathy. Sturges and Leisen put a lot of work into nailing the warm and tender scenes, both between the couple and (especially) in MacMurray's hometown, and all of the genuine decency is both moving and really lets the filmmakers twist the knife when they need to - Stanwyck is twice rejected by families in deeply painful ways, both entirely unresolved by the film's ending. It's terrific, tonally fluid plotting, culminating in the kind of obvious home-run climax (MacMurray throwing the case by purposely being too cruel to win it, with Stanwyck unaware until partway through) followed by a more grounded bittersweet final moment. Beautifully calculated throughout - good things do exist, but compromise is everywhere, people don't easily open their hearts, but love can and often does win out.\n",
      "Other thoughts:\n",
      "- I gave measured praise to Sturges for allowing black performers to be somewhat funny within but not because of stereotypes in The Palm Beach Story; that is decidedly not the case here, with a reasonably unobtrusive but still embarrassing and crudely treated figure played by poor Fred Toones.\n",
      "- Looks like there's one more Stanwyck/MacMurray partnering out there: a 3D western called The Moonlighter that has no reputation I'm aware of. Something tells me it won't be as rich as their big three, but I'll seek it out anyway.\n",

      "I think films like this prove that the strengths and weaknesses of certain genres can be a fairly timeless constant. There are the hiccups more befitting of the era, like problematic depictions of minorities and an occasionally indulgent hokey tone, but honestly the majority of this films are highs and lows you see in a lot of romantic comedies. Endearing, if generally unrealistic and rushed romance at forefront, with a foot dipped into a more dramatic pool of water, yet still too shallow to really prove anything substantial for the plot. The comedic aspect kind of swings back and forth on this one. The beginning of the film is hilarious, with biting dialogue at every moment, but as it gets further into slapstick territory, it never really comes back to its Zen state of humor for more than a brief, intermittent one-liner. The way the plot progresses near the end is more meaningful than the average romantic comedy, but at the same time, predictable. Fairly sweet, but at the same time, I don't think I'm the intended demographic.\n",

      "_ The same way Lee says she wants to stay at Jack's apartment when he shows no intention of keeping her there, Lee decides to confess her crime precisely when Jack starts secretly acting in favor of her acquittal, in other words:\n",
      "the only way conceived by Lee to achieve her freedom, the only way she would no longer be indebted to Jack (since he had not only paid her bail but also was about to be responsible for her acquittal) would be subverting the role of justice (as performed by its male commissioners): making bourgeois law operate out of the way chosen by those used to controlling it, that is: making it fail, at least for once, to serve as an instrument of legitimization of male/class control over her destiny. It is as if Lee was unconsciously saying: “I am going to jail and I may marry you, but I hope one day I get out of it owing my semi-freedom to none of you moral/law-enforcers”.\n",
      "_ Maybe the “happy ending” here is achieved not by the fact that the couple finally acknowledges their mutual love and promises to get married, but rather by the fact that the social fiction of law and order can still go on unharmed despite its obvious gaps and contradictions;\n",

      "Minus the racist remnant of the era—a portrayal of a black servant so outdated that every line he spoke repelled me away from the film—it’s one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen. Something about the holidays that causes the resurfacing of repressed memories and feelings, and if lucky, makes possible a catharsis through confrontation. (Though I must say, I can’t help but be unsatisfied by the succinct manner in which their visit to her mother’s summarizes her character, though the subsequent deed of inviting her to his home makes for such a sweet gesture—perhaps the sweetest even, in a film filled with many such gestures—that I more or less don’t mind.) Somewhat rocky early on, as it starts off rather odd with how abrupt it is, then settles—though not before a longwinded court scene—into a romance at its first stage(perfect!) then rocky again once they take their road trip when they start driving through random forests and hills and fences, sleeping in the middle of nowhere and milking random cows, etc. Whatever effect is intended with the consequent escape—whether it’s thrills or character-motivated—doesn’t really land or register for me. (Though it's functional too I guess, as it serves as a direct precursor to their later traverse through Canada.) It picks up again once they get to his home though, making for a picture filled with warmth and embrace and every jolly quality that you could ever hope for from this period of the year. Sort of conflicted by the mother's—gently delivered—wary addressing of the quixotic situation going on though, as it ostensibly comes to inform much of the critical choices made in the last portion of the film. I very much like the choices and the manner in which the finale plays out, but it would resonate more if it was a self-arrived destination. Of course, it’s possible that Lee would have come to her senses on her own, but as it stands, mama Sargent points us towards that inevitable direction a little too hard. In any case, this is truly as tender and—at the risk of overusing this word—sweet as any film could be without becoming saccharine. It had a great effect on me, though my response was unfortunately dampened heavily by other factors (some actually invoked by it, others mostly external) and their consequent long pauses.\n",

Opens with cum tribute ready shot of a foot mannequin with lacquered nails and anklet. Court room scenes bookend the movie, in the first one there’s a gag of hammy defense lawyer claiming his client was under hypnosis, kinda funny but runs too long. Rufus the black valet is mistreated at every turn, and that turns my stomach, but he’s given a hype malaprop. This is all gristle, the real movie starts when they make it to Indiana. On the 24th Stanwyck and her estranged mom fail to make nice—love one dimensionally evil mom’s ghostly silhouette listening in as daughter sobs out in the cold. On the 1st in a town 50 miles away Stanwyck and her brand-new momma have a difficult but kind of lovely talk, best scene in the picture, think I teared up. Stanwyck didn’t make one false move during the shoot, Wikipedia fact. Oh there’s also the corset scene with the aunt, that’s another high point. Stanwyck’s face during the Christmas Eve piano performance; panning through the barnyard during the nye hoedown; Niagara Falls, calm before the storm. So, like I’ve been saying, works primarily as terrific showcase for Stanwyck’s abilities and warm salute to that last week of the holidays spent in a flyover boomtown with sense of community.

      "This summer I am once again presenting on behalf of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the Hudson Institute in Washington a series of six movies. The general theme this year is Middle America and the Movies. The films are being shown at the Hudson Institute, 1015 15th Street N.W., Suite 600, and you can go to the Hudson website for details or to register to attend. The series began on Tuesday, June 10th with a screening of Remember the Night of 1940, written by Preston Sturges and directed by Mitchell Leisen. It stars Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, Along with Beulah Bondi, Elizabeth Patterson and Sterling Holloway. Before showing the film, I spoke for a few minutes about it as follows.\n",
      "Welcome to the Eighth Annual Summer Film Series, jointly sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the Hudson Institute, which we thank for the use of these facilities. My name is James Bowman, and I am the film critic for The American Spectator, as well as a Resident Scholar at EPPC. I would ask you, before we start, to turn off your phones’ ringers and any other electronic noise-makers you may have. I’m going to say a few words about tonight’s movie before we see it, and afterwards, as those of you know who have been to the past years’ series, I invite you to stay around, if you can, for a brief discussion of what we have seen.\n",
      "This year’s theme is Middle America and the Movies, and the first of the six films which we are to see is Remember the Night, starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, four years before they starred together in Double Indemnity of 1944, the classic Billy Wilder picture that we saw in our third series, in 2009, on \"Crime and Punishment.\" This one is directed by Mitchell Leisen, who was a Michigan native and a well-known director in Hollywood for nearly 40 years, though he is all but forgotten now. Better known is the screenwriter, Preston Sturges, himself someone who would go on to become one of the great directors of the Golden Age of American movies. If he had directed his own script he would surely have done things differently, though not necessarily better.\n",
      "He is also, probably, the one we ought to blame for several instances of egregious political incorrectness which require me to make, by way of preface to tonight’s screening, what certain highly sensitive and politically-trained academics these days are said to call \"trigger warnings.\" Accordingly, I am grieved to report that this film includes an appalling racial stereotype by a black actor calling himself \"Snowflake\" (real name, Fred Toones) who got his start shining shoes on the lot of Republic Pictures and became one of the busiest character actors in Hollywood, appearing in over 200 films between 1928 and 1951. And then there is the hasty and gabbled repetition by Fred MacMurray of an old rhyme that, in his version, goes:\n",
      "A woman, a dog and a hick’ry tree\n",
      "The better you beat ‘em, the better they be.\n",
      "Pretty clearly he is intending to make a joke here, but I don’t need to tell you that it is the kind of joke decent people no longer make. I hope you can find it in your hearts to overlook such examples of chronological ignorance for the sake of the many good things about Remember the Night.\n",
      "The story, briefly, is one of an attractive woman shoplifter, played by Barbara Stanwyck, whose name is Anna Rose Malone but who is rather oddly known throughout the movie by her alias of Lee Leander. She is put on trial in New York just before Christmas. John Sargent, the assistant D.A. played by Fred MacMurray, knowing the difficulty of getting a conviction at Christmas-time, especially against a woman, contrives to get a continuance until after the new year. Feeling guilty that he has condemned Lee to spend Christmas in jail, he then bails her out, only to find her, through a series of improbable misadventures left in his charge as he is about to drive home to spend Christmas with his mother and aunt in Indiana. Even more implausibly, he decides to take her with him. I don’t think it can possibly count as a spoiler to tell you what is clearly signaled almost from the start, namely that the two are destined to fall in love.\n",
      "As an example of \"Middle America and the Movies,\" the first thing we ought to notice about this movie is that it is unabashedly a look at Middle America as seen from the coast, and in particular the East Coast. And, in even more particular, from Manhattan — though it is the Manhattan of 1940 and, therefore, it no longer exists, which I would like to think is not true, or not entirely true, of the movie’s sympathetic version of Middle America. At least the latter is not an idealized portrait. We are given three separate glimpses of the country west of the Hudson, two decidedly unflattering while the third is a mixture of good and not-so-good with a tilt of the balance to the former. Though the movie is about goodness and where goodness comes from, it is under no illusions that people, even midwesterners, can be easily classified as merely good or bad.\n",
      "The first of the movie’s three different takes on the American heartland begins in the cow pasture of a Pennsylvania farmer, where the car containing the prosecutor and the thief crashes through a road-closed barrier and the couple are forced to spend their first night together uncomfortably dozing in the front seat. Then, when the shotgun wielding farmer puts them under citizen’s arrest, it shifts to the home office of a justice of the peace in a nearby small town. \"Looks like business, Clyde,\" says the wife of this local magistrate as she sees our two heroes, covered by the farmer’s shotgun, being marched up to her house.\n",
      "\"With that new detour he gets them all the time,\" says the JP, who is presumably in cahoots with the farmer in fleecing passing motorists from elsewhere.\n",
      "Here the D.A. and the shoplifter become minor law-breakers together, and we are encouraged to take their side against corrupt authority. We also admire the shoplifter’s clever trick to cover their escape — one which, we may suspect, she has found occasion to use before in perhaps less propitious circumstances. John Sargent doesn’t even know it’s a trick until later, when he disapproves. We are reminded of Lee’s earlier wondering observation: \"You’re so sweet. You never think of anything that’s wrong.\" Though that doesn’t remain true for very much longer.\n",
      "The movie’s second take on the heartland comes at the gloomy home of Lee Leander’s gloomy mother, played by Georgia Caine, a religious fanatic who long ago disowned her daughter for some childish misbehavior and thus (so, I think, we are meant to understand) launched her on her life of crime. It’s surely significant in a comedy that the first item in the mother’s bill of indictment against the daughter — after \"she’s just like her father, she is\" — is that she was \"always laughing at serious things, she was.\" So, I can tell you, was Preston Sturges and the audiences that flocked to his movies.\n",
      "Lee’s mother’s house looks a bit like Edward Hopper’s famous \"House by the Railroad\" of 1925, and we hear a train whistle as she and Sargent approach it. Hopper’s painting is said to have been the model for the Bates Motel in Hitchcock’s Psycho and, as it does there, its middle class Victorian domestic architecture turns it into a ready-made symbol for what at the time would have been called Victorian Puritanism — or the kind of stern moralism that had gone out of fashion at least two decades earlier. Hollywood at this time, as we’ll see even more clearly in King’s Row next week, was already coming under the influence of what the journalist and commentator Anthony Daniels calls \"the hydraulic theory\" of human sexuality, derived from popular Freudianism, namely that sexual \"repression\" is the worst thing in the world for human happiness and well-being and the source of many if not all of our social problems.\n",
      "In Remember the Night, however, the authors’ attitude towards the Victorians was more nuanced, as we shall see. The house serves as the backdrop to John Sargent’s moment of revelation, when he sees in Lee’s bitter and loveless home, maybe more clearly than she does, the point at which their two experiences of Indiana and Middle America diverged and the germ of her criminal career. It also provides the occasion for him to show his sympathy for her not only in their first embrace, at this point a non-sexual one, but also by inviting her to spend Christmas at his own Indiana home, which is much more like the \"vision fair I see\" that \"casts a spell o’er me\" from the song, \"My Indiana Home,\" which is the movie’s musical leitmotif.\n",
      "The warm, loving home kept by Sargent’s mother, played by Beulah Bondi, and Aunt Emma, played by Elizabeth Patterson, thus becomes the movie’s third and most attractive scene of midwestern life and values. There we learn that there was in John Sargent’s younger days a parallel crime to that committed by Lee Leander in hers but that, unlike her, he was allowed by his female parent’s love and forbearance to atone for it. \"You made me understand,\" says to her now, referring to the development of his mature moral sense.\n",
      "\"No, dear,\" she replies. \"It was love that made you understand.\" So it is also natural for her to believe, when she is told of Lee’s rap sheet, that \"she probably didn’t get enough love as a child\" — something that the earlier stopover at the Hopper house has made us, too, predisposed to believe. As a general explanation for criminal behavior this would, of course, have seemed simplistic even at the time, though in the mouth of this Indiana farmer’s widow, about another Indiana farmer’s daughter, it seems to make perfect sense, as the film is so constructed to make it seem so. I think we should allow ourselves to accept that the warm welcome Lee receives and her experience of the gently comic goings on in and around the Sargent house at Christmas-time should work some kind of moral transformation in a woman who hasn’t had much love or luck in life. At any rate, it’s not the most implausible thing about this picture.\n",
      "As in Fargo, which we also saw in the \"Crime and Punishment\" series five years ago, the transparent decency of the good characters here has the effect of isolating and overwhelming the badness of the bad. Also as in Fargo, the power of goodness appears to rise out of the country itself, or that slice of Middle America — there, Minnesota, here, Indiana — which the art of the film-makers has caused to be ever present before our eyes and thoughts as the backdrop to its human story. The \"love\" which is supposed to have a transforming effect on Lee is thus not merely that of Sargent’s mother and aunt, but that of a whole culture which has put the family at the center of life even if, in such cases as that of Lee’s mother, it doesn’t always work out that way. This almost imperceptible generalization from one family to a recognizable way of living also helps us to believe in the morally healing touch of Middle America itself on someone who really didn’t get enough love as a child.\n",
      "That third idea of Middle America is meant to stand for the rest, it seems to me, but the first and second remain with us and remind us of the dark side — Remember the Night! — which was to become more prominent in later films. It’s a rather facile moral and psychological lesson for us, but rendered with humor and with such a light touch that we hardly notice the taste of the medicine going down. To me it is also interesting that this moral drama plays itself out at the same time as, but often in contrast to, the sexual dance between the two main characters. Just as the architecture of the Victorian house suggests an older, rather forbidding attitude to moral rectitude, so does the Victorian corset into which Lee Leander is painfully laced for the barn dance suggest a deliberately archaic, Victorian approach to relations between the sexes. Yet that, too, works a kind of magic, as both she and John Sargent have to put on the respective costumes of their grandparents in order to realize for the first time, and with the new year, that they are in love.\n",
      "As one does in each of the next three movies in this year’s series, one has the impression here that the film-makers are looking back on a period thirty or forty years in the past as a touchstone or a model of what Americanness means in a time — as all times since have been — of rapid social and cultural change. The deliberately archaic context also has the effect, as their falling in love in New York presumably would not have done, of locking the two would-be lovers into a world where, in the words of the Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen song of a few years later, \"Love and Marriage/Go together like a horse and carriage.\" Sargent’s suggestion after the dance that Lee come to his room for a smoke clearly stands for something else that New York women might do that Indiana women might not, and it is his mother’s reminder of what Sargent’s Indiana values of hard work and moral steadiness have done for him and, therefore, what he stands to lose by forgetting them, that persuades Lee not to go.\n",
      "For her own chances of turning her life around depend on the same moral steadiness and are by this time beginning to seem real to her. We’ll see the more usual approach of the 1930s and 1940s to Victorian sexual customs in our next two movies, King’s Row and The Magnificent Ambersons, both of 1942 and both taking a less than benign view of the beliefs and customs of our ancestors. But here there almost seems to be the same kind of nostalgia for whalebone and silk hats that there is for the moonlight on the Wabash of \"My Indiana Home.\" The Victorian parlor song sung by Sterling Holloway, \"When you come to the end of a perfect day,\" which had been immensely popular thirty years earlier, adds a touch of Victorian sentimentalism to the movie’s Victorian moralism, but I confess I find it charming. The sense of the family as the vehicle not only for rearing children with love but also for an essential continuity between the generations is what I think the movie is getting at here, though you may not agree.\n",
      "For we are also made aware that things have already changed a lot since father courted mother in the cornfields of Indiana. Moral ambiguity abounds here, as it does in the big city, which makes the romantic dénouement by no means the sure thing that the Hollywood comic idiom of the period would seem to predict. One of my favorite parts of the picture comes near the beginning when Lee is brought up to Sargent’s apartment by the bail bondsman Fat Mike, played by Tom Kennedy. Fat Mike, \"because he’s got a mind like a sewer,\" as Sargent says, assumes that he must have expected a consideration for bailing out this pretty shoplifter, and so does she. The sparkling, Preston Sturges-penned dialogue between them as they sort out this misunderstanding is a delight. \"One of these days,\" says Lee in persona as one of the brassy dames of so many contemporary films, \"one of you boys is going to start one of these scenes differently and one of us girls is going to drop dead from surprise.\"\n",
      "But of course the \"scene\" does start differently, and it leads them both to some place which is — in the real world, at any rate, then as now — much more surprising than Lee can imagine. The slightly odd use of the word \"scene\" can also be taken together with several references to acting and the theatre as self-conscious pointers to the artifice of the movie scene’s construction. After Sargent at first offers to lend Lee his apartment when he goes home to Indiana for the holidays, she observes that \"it sounds like a play.\"\n",
      "\"It sounds like a flop,\" says Sargent.\n",
      "But by calling attention at this point to its own implausibility, the script helps us to forget just how much it, too, sounds like a play. My favorite line comes here, too, when Lee realizes that Sargent genuinely expects nothing in return for his generosity to her — which, as he later admits, is partly owing to guilt at the trick he has played on her lawyer to effect a conviction. \"Now,’ says Lee, \"there’s nothing as dangerous as a square shooter. If all men were like you, there wouldn’t be any nice girls left.\" It’s a lovely paradox and also an indication that Lee, however improbably and whatever other wicked ways she has fallen into since coming to the big city, still considers herself — as does Sargent — to be a nice girl.\n",
      "Of course the Hays office would have frowned on any suggestion that she could have been anything else, yet this is not the first or the last time in our experience of these old movies when we may suspect that the censor’s demands could, in some instances, have made them better than they would otherwise have been. Those of you who are able to make it to next week’s movie, King’s Row, will see an even clearer example of what I am talking about. Almost a decade before the Kinsey report, we can be pretty sure there was already a widespread awareness that the ostensible social and moral norms assumed by the censor were no longer normal, if they ever had been. But then and for some time yet to come the ordinary people for whom the movies of Hollywood’s Golden Age were intended, could still see the point of imposing a moral discipline on popular art, along with the expectation that sexual continence, in particular, should be treated as if it were still the norm — as it may even, once, actually have been. Long ago. In Indiana.\n",

I like it better in that MacMurray is just a decent guy, he intends to do his job and put her in jail, but doesn't believe he's better than her. And Stanwyck is a girl running away from cruelty, with nothing but her wits to live on, but no real malice. I guess that makes it more modern; it's ditched the antiquated ideas about \"those kinds of people\" while keeping the dramatic tension of two people with no intention of falling in love.

      "The idea of having to spend Christmas in jail seems like an old conceit, but I'm hard-pressed to think of a filmic example aside from the occasionally cinematic-sounding song by The Youngsters (here's a link to it on YouTube: youtu.be/cM38kN4AOys ) wherein they're pulled over for drunk driving, whereas Stanwyck faces time for shoplifting. MacMurray - the prosecuting attorney - has sympathy for her and takes her to his home for the holidays. His down-to-earth and charming-right-out-of-Norman-Rockwell family have a sobering effect on Stanwyck's character and - you guessed it - the two fall in love.

      "Easy Living is an absurd bit of fluff, but at the height of the second half of the Great Depression, the idea that a hard-working everyday gal (Jean Arthur) could have a mink coat thrown on top of her while riding the open upper deck of a city bus, be given a swank penthouse apartment (by Edward Arnold), and fall in love (with Ray Milland), might have seen like a great bit of escapism. At least it has a great cast.\n",
      "Then again, screwball comedies of the 30s that I could watch again tomorrow are thin on the ground. It Happened One Night, yes, but My Man Goddfrey and Bringing Up Baby, no.\n",
      "The 1940s have the 1930s beat here. Remember the Night, 1940, is a much better movie than Easy Living. His Girl Friday is 1940 and The Lady Eve is 1941; between the two of them they pretty much have the entire 1930s beat. Born Yesterday feels like a 30s movie, but it's 1950 (and adapted from a Garson Kanin play by Albert Mannheimer).\n",
      "It's easy to forget that Remember the Night is a Christmas movie. Not only do Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck get together because he (as an assistant district attorney) doesn't want her (as a petty shoplifter, but a three-time loser at it) to have to spend the entire Christmas week or more in jail before her trial comes up, but when they return to their hometowns, it's the different ways in which Christmas is celebrated that highlights the differences between where they came from and who molded them.

      "Stanwyck gives a marvellously chameleonic performance here, anchoring the character's changing personality which moves smoothly between the film's three acts without jumping jarringly between disparate moods. Stanwyck shades the character with a cunning intelligence which makes her behavior seem calculating at first before tapping into a deeper, emotional register to capitalize on the darker elements of tragedy the film brings to her backstory, ably laying the groundwork for a third act turn towards more traditionally sentimental, moralizing ground. Stanwyck is stunning in all the various forms of the character, from the lustrously sexy con-woman who shrewdly uses her sex appeal as a tool in getting ahead, to the unsympathetically frank street-wise petty criminal that openly admits her base motives to MacMurray's stodgy prosecutor, or the soft, vulnerable young woman at the heart of this jaded exterior who slowly falls in love with MacMurray and the promise of forgiveness and contentment he represents.\n",
      "The film's slyly cynical first act is followed by a striking turn towards darker melodrama on the way towards the schmaltzy return-home stretch of the third act, but this turn towards the expected does not betray the more daring first third as it offers no easy escape for Stanwyck but simply provides an opportunity for slow, moral awakening and accepting her guilt.\n",
