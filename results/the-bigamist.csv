“of course i support men’s rights. men’s rights to shut the fuck up.” - ida lupino,3.5
"""When a man, even with the best intentions, breaks the moral laws we live by, we really don't need man-made laws to punish him.""
I hate to saddle the only female director in the film noir universe with the ""sensitive"" descriptor, but it's one of the first words that come to mind when considering this. Lupino has such sincere empathy for all of these characters, and this has to be one of the most dramatically ambitious movies of the studio era for the way it sets up a situation for which no emotionally satisfactory resolution is possible, then follows it to the bitter, unsatisfying end.
In its own way, this is almost as tense and suspenseful as The Hitch-Hiker.",4.5
"In the Code-era, a film like this should really not have ended this way. The implications of it are far more complex than I would have expected of a film forced to punish bigamy (though I assume it would have probably done so anyway). It dares to hint that love might be more complicated than marriage, and it has a fairly strong condemnation of the hypocritical view of adultery vs. bigamy (though it seems to suggest condemning adultery more than loosening the condemnation of bigamy). I feel like I am spoiling it, so I will stop the roundabout analysis. Suffice to say, the film's view of love is more intelligent, if not the ideal I'd like, than I expected.

"""I never expected to see Phyllis again, but I knew I'd remember this day—when two strangers helped each other through a lonely Sunday.""
Though by 1949 Ida Lupino had already assumed the remarkable mantle of being the only woman directing theatrical features in Hollywood (with Dorothy Arzner having retired from filmmaking in 1943), she staked a further claim to history in 1953 with The Bigamist—in which Lupino became the first woman to ever star in an American feature film of her own direction. In a brazen demonstration of the proverbial dictum to ""write what you know"", the screenplay fashioned by producer Collier Young (with Lawrence B. Marcus and Lou Schor) provocatively excavates biographical details regarding his former marriage to Lupino as well as his current marriage to her costar Joan Fontaine—though interestingly their corresponding roles are inverted in the film.
One of a few notable noir elements that make their way into this winding melodrama is its non-linear structure, with the present day serving as a framing device and the majority of the narrative being conveyed via flashback. The film begins with the married San Franciscans Harry (a chunkier than usual Edmond O'Brien) and Eve (Fontaine) seeking to adopt a child. Following a cursory interview, the congenial Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) seems ready to approve a new addition to the Graham family until having misgivings about Harry's conspicuous apprehension at the mention of a background check. In fairly short order Mr. Jordan tracks Harry to an undisclosed Los Angeles pied-à-terre that he supposedly keeps owing to the frequency of business travel, whereupon Mr. Jordan discovers the presence of an additional family complete with newborn child! The disgusted adoption agent's first impulse is toward immediate legal action, but an evidently contrite Harry convinces him to first weigh his tale before blowing the whistle.
The film not only revolves around Harry but also assumes his psychological perspective in the form of his subsequent narration. Through this irrefutable prerogative he implies that when informed of her infertility Eve was overcome by a bitter feeling of emptiness, which she channeled into an occupational diversion by joining Harry at his business. And though he concedes that the business doubled its profitability shortly thereafter, his discontent is nonetheless evident in the terseness of his closing remarks on the subject, ""Our marriage had become a business partnership."" In keeping with the mid-century obsession over pop-psychology, Harry seems to ascribe their marital woes to a sort of Nietzschean ressentiment on Eve's part. For what it's worth, this viewer felt it was Harry's palpable sense of emasculation that poisoned the well (this feeling was only reinforced later by his shameless proto-Hannah and Her Sisters justification that his philandering stemmed from an unmet desire to feel needed).
While killing time on a Beverly Hills tour bus one day, Harry awkwardly attempts to entice a strange woman who at first puts him dead to rights (""If this is a sample of your work, you're not very good at pickups"") but with persistence relents somewhat—pretending to make a lunch date with Harry while in actuality he walks her to work. What of course emerges between Harry and Phyllis (Lupino) is a coyly platonic bond that inevitably turns sexual. Naturally Harry's intention is to come clean with Eve, but he just can't find the right moment—especially once her father undergoes a debilitating heart attack—and instead agrees to adopt a child together, privately resolving to recommit himself to Eve.
But wait! It turns out Phyllis is pregnant, thus compounding his matrimonial infraction to the nth degree as well as necessitating a secret marriage to legitimize the child in the eyes of the law and such. Having now married Phyllis, Harry feels even more of an imperative to bring Eve up to speed on the updated facts of their married life—namely that he wants a divorce, notwithstanding all that she has done for him. But with the passing of Eve's father Harry once again judges the vibes too adverse for a confession, so he resolves to navigate both marriages in secrecy until such time as Eve establishes legal guardianship over their would-be adopted child—at which point he will seek the long-delayed divorce. Mr. Jordan is fairly dumbfounded by Harry's account, and though he remains ambivalent to say the least, he declines to report his findings to the police. This detail proves immaterial however, as the police are nevertheless awaiting Harry on his return to San Francisco.    
The acting from O'Brien, Fontaine and Lupino is terrific; Gwenn is characteristically hammy, as are most of the strained references to his role as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street. Young's script sides tendentiously with Harry, which can be extremely off-putting. For instance, witness Eve's apology for reversing Harry's flagging professional trajectory, ""When I learned I couldn't have a child, that's when I became the little efficient, white-collared girl—I forgot some things."" Just the same, the film features terrific location exteriors from both of the major cities in question, runs a tightly paced eighty minutes, and is studded with moments of expressive grandeur—like the one directly following the first illicit kiss in which the shadows from the staircase railing parallel the bars of a prison cell. End of actual review.
Near the middle of the film Harry says, ""We're goin' to Acapulco."" What I obviously need to know now is: did Bob Dylan see The Bigamist? It was released in the first week of December in 1953; he'd have been twelve at the time—a feasible filmgoing age. Could it have rolled around in his subconscious for fourteen years and spilled out in a marijuana & Beaujolais-fueled ad-lib fest at Big Pink? If I had the privilege of interviewing Dylan, this might well be among the first things I'd ask him about.

"Action! - Female 4 Front: Breaking Grounds With Ida Lupino
One of those creations that, in some way, reflects reality. Essentially, you have a film directed and co-starring Ida Lupino, who directs Joan Fontaine, who at the time was married to screenwriter and producer Collier Young, Lupino's ex-husband. Also, according to Wikipedia, this is the first film of the sound era in which the protagonist directs herself.
The performances are all quite good, with each contributing the qualities that they have managed to cultivate and work effectively as performers by that time. Fontaine is excellent as the career-focused woman with aspirations, but she also manages to convey the character's empathy and a sense of frustration over unfulfilled desires. That scene in which O'Brien's Harry confesses his desire to this other woman to his wife says a lot about these characters, thanks in large part to their performances. Lupino's portrayal as the mistress is intriguing because, rather than passing judgment, the film tackles the issue of adultery and treats it as a more complex and nuanced matter.
All in all, although again it can fall into the melodramatic, thanks in large part to the performances and take on the matter, this is one worth watching.

The Bigamist
Homegrown
Daddy and Them
Babylon AD",3.5
"""Let's not wait, Eve,"" says Edmond O'Brien's traveling salesman to his wife midway through The Bigamist. He's enjoining her to take a trip with him, wishing she'd pull him away from California and the other woman he's been seeing. ""Our marriage is the only thing that really matters."" Joan Fontaine, playing Eve, smiling up at him from her separate bed. She's framed so that she stretches diagonally across the screen, in a shot so tight you can see the sinews in her arms and where her nightgown bunches around the middle. ""I love our marriage,"" she replies, yawning, and rolls away from him and the camera to lie facing the window.
That only describes about ten seconds of this noir melodrama, but perhaps that snippet of pillow talk gives you some impression of the movie's sensitivity and even-handedness. Most of it takes place in flashback, as the title character explains himself to an investigator who's just learned about his secret double life. He details his gradual descent, as mere loneliness during Los Angeles business trips blossoms into a fling, an unplanned pregnancy, and eventually this sordid arrangement. Director Ida Lupino, who also co-stars as the love nest's occupant, extends the salesman plenty of sympathy, but also spares enough time to record the longing on her and Fontaine's faces. No party's pain goes unacknowledged as the film spirals into hushed tragedy.
Despite the bold, tabloid-ready title, nothing in The Bigamist is depicted as especially weird or perverse. As far as the film's concerned, this string of events is a logical outgrowth of people groping for financial and romantic stability in postwar America. It just happens to be expedited by the husband's selfishness in relying on another woman's companionship, and then the cowardice that prevents him from telling either wife. He wants to keep them both living in fragile, unknowing happiness, which might be the most touching and unexpected aspect of the movie. A status quo based on dishonesty can't be maintained, no matter how comfortable it may be, and that's exceptionally heartbreaking to realize.",3.5
"this is either a dull defense of awful misogynist behavior or a very subtle critique of it, a strong argument could be made for either, which is pretty fascinating. it mostly comes across as an indictment of the oppressively busy world that makes people lonely rather than of the man who can't help himself. Edmond O'Brien thankfully comes off as much less of an entitled asshole than he does in D.O.A., and the movie never paints him as some sort of tortured soul in a ""bitches be crazy"" situation who's acting heroic by doing a terrible job of covering his ass (for that plot see: LOCKE). the worst thing this guy does isn't falling in love with someone else, it's thinking the women in his life are too fragile to handle the truth - especially considering his first wife is clearly more capable than he gives her credit for, and this very narrowly avoids blaming her independence for driving him away. that's possibly the closest thing to anything resembling feminism this has to offer, the idea that treating women as delicate objects on a pedestal, in need of male protection, isn't much better than treating them as lesser beings. again, it's hard to tell what this is trying to say, because you know this guy is a selfish idiot but he's also just that...an idiot. not evil, not immoral, just truly in love with two different women and completely clueless as to how to take care of them both (and who could blame any man for falling in love with Ida Lupino?). but the women are equally sympathetic (and more interesting), and it's not much more than a sad situation that got out of hand, and everyone involved will come out broken. the ending is a little heavy handed, with a judge giving a verbal wrap-up explanation that we've all figured out for ourselves in addition to some lame thing about what happens when you disobey society's Moral Code, but there's also a last minute ambiguity that works well. basically, most people are genuinely doing the best they can, but a lot of the time our best sucks.",3.0
"2nd Ida Lupino (after The Hitchhiker)
Part 4 of February 2024
-Marry both of us? But, that's bigamy!
-Yes, and it's big of me, too. It's big of all of us.
Margaret Dumont and Groucho Marx, Animal Crackers
Happy 28th birthday to me, happy 106th birthday to Ida. Ringing in a new year in style with as potent a depiction of loneliness and self-inflicted emasculation as I’ve ever seen. Edmund O’Brien seemed to have a good line on pathetically appealing men in the early 50s, what with this and D.O.A. He’s a man tortured by the spectre of his own uselessness, a weak link in his wife’s chain of successful business ventures; ventures he, in the ultimate act of humiliation, set up himself. Does Phyllis represent a lost soul to cling to or someone to salve his wounded ego, a woman who wants nothing but his presence? Most likely. Harry never means to hurt the modern women he loves, but by not making a choice between them, he spoils it all. He’s despicable and he’s pitiable, but he’s palpably human. Think Micki & Maude but so much sadder.
That tension is beautifully scripted by Collier Young, crafting a melodrama in the pulp noir vernacular that mines Young’s own complicated relationships with the female leads. Imagine working with your wife and your ex-wife two years after you changed partners. That speaks either to a deep maturity or a man afraid of conflict, willing to bend himself into a pretzel to smooth things over. I wonder if he saw himself in O’Brien’s hangdog salesman. Maybe he thought himself a weak accessory to the burning success of his wives, an interloper in their success. Perhaps. Something about The Bigamist’s sympathetic depiction of pathetic decency rings so painfully true that it must have come from deep within him. “Still I felt her closeness”, Harry wistfully remarks in voiceover of Phyllis. By the end of play, he’s put them a thousand miles away.
Lupino in Order:
1. The Bigamist
2. The Hitchhiker",4.5
"Featuring a fiendishly clever screenplay co-written by Collier Young (the ex-husband of director and star Ida Lupino), The Bigamist brilliant lays bare the anxieties of the postwar United States as it encounters the world through the eyes of a frightened man, struggling to find his place (Harry, played by Edmond O'Brien).
Harry's wife Eve (Joan Fontaine, who is so beautiful in this that I want to die) is everything 1950s America was warned against: a woman whose decision to work has stripped her of her femininity, and transformed her into her husband's competition, not his mate. What makes the character of Eve so effective is that we see her almost exclusively via her husband's characterization, reliant as we are upon the narrative he's presenting to Mr. Jordan, Edmund Gwenn's adoption agent. So all of her competence (her cleverness; her ease with business; with men) is framed through his fear and weakness. Eve has become alien to him because she doesn't rely upon him anymore; the danger she poses is rooted in her self-sufficiency.
Perhaps the best scene in the film comes right on the heels of a dinner in which Eve's business acumen shines, one that leaves her fairly fizzing with pleasure at the success she's achieved for the company her husband owns. Her ability and joy are, as ever, a threat to Harry, who wants her to leave work behind, pleading with her to go away with him, because ""our marriage is the only thing that really matters!"" The scene is striking for a number of reasons, including the vast emotional gulf between the two — Eve's success makes Harry miserable; he feels unneeded, and immediately decides their marriage is under threat. It's nearly identical to a scene in 1947's The Arnelo Affair, except there, the genders are reversed; in both films, the conversation opens the door to the straying of the neglected-feeling spouse.
It probably goes without saying, but Harry's characterization of his experience was mirrored all over the US as the country recovered from war, with men coming home to wives who had been running thriving households all on their own. The result was an epidemic of the fear Harry feels, men with a sense of having no place in their own homes.
In the case of Harry and Eve, however, Harry frames everything ""bad"" about Eve as being rooted in her inability to have a child. The fact that she cannot perform this fundamental feminine duty is what pushes her to work — loss of femininity leads to further abandonment of gendered responsibility — and things get better only after she realizes that motherhood is her true destiny. Harry has Eve call it ""selfish"" not to have a child, and tells Mr. Jordan that she explicitly asked for forgiveness for her failure to embrace the duty of motherhood.
From that point on, Eve becomes Harry's perfect wife, needing his support and approval, and dedicating herself to her duties, including abandoning work (just as he'd previously asked her to do) to make sure she could be with him on their anniversary.
The problem, of course, is that Harry has already found an alternate wife in Phyllis (Lupino), a woman who can not only fulfill that most important feminine obligation, but who also needs him and, in Harry's telling, is so devoted that it is she who begs for forgiveness after he strays. To Harry, he's Phyllis' perfect man, always saying just the right thing and teaching her how to love again, after being abandoned by another man hardened her heart. Lupino's incredibly flat delivery of Phyllis' allegedly smitten ""you kill me,"" however, suggests Harry is not quite the prince as which he frames himself; that things aren't as dreamy as he claims. (It's worth noting that we see not a second of Phyllis and Harry together that doesn't come through the filter of his POV.)
The end of the film is fascinatingly ambiguous, expressing sympathy for Harry but also revealing that he was too cowardly to actually confess what he had done to either of his wives. The collapse of his fantasy of masculinity leaves both women on their own, abandoned by the selfishness of a man who had built his identity upon being needed by women.

"This was an interesting watch. It didn’t play into any of my expectations going in— something along the lines of a thriller or an intense drama. Instead, Ida Lupino offers a more psychological angle to this story, and I appreciated this approach so much more than if the film had met my original expectations. The whole thing worked for me, especially in the way it explored taboo subjects in regards to the contemporary times. Lupino is of course the key to all of this. Judging by the reviews, perhaps her execution of this film wasn't as effective to many viewers, but I dug it quite a lot.",3.5
"Prefigures Mad Men in a lot of interesting ways -- the ennui-filled businessman torn between various women who can't fulfill him. Always consuming, never sated, doomed from the start and trudging along any way he can. Neat to see this perspective arise from the period itself and not retrospectively. Ida Lupino is astounding.",3.0
"Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine are so good in this you wish they were fighting for each other!
There are some Hays Code surprises in this movie, particularly how marriage is viewed as a transactional business scheme, but perhaps most interestingly Lupino doesn't direct this movie as a horror critique of bigamy or patriarchy. Instead there's little judgement, just how man-made laws can make love feel criminal. I like that Lupino, who's obviously starred and directed a number of noirs, doesn't turn this into a noir melodrama with murder to get rid of secrets. But most importantly, the bigamist behaves like a a big lug, incapable of explaining thoughts, and just wanting some attention, and the women are defined individuals who are not defined by being married or having a child but rather how they've managed their marriage to work for them and how that drives the simple man away. And it's not a critique. We're all supposed to have the same reaction as Dr. Jordan about the man with two wives, ""I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck."" because he's only defined by his lack not his being. There isn't a sense that either woman would be missing out by not taking him back because he is a lack... But I dunno about that court scene other than it just being there to tell the audience that the movie has no judgement, that's up to you when you leave because Ida ain't tying it up neatly for you.",4.0
"Directed and starring English-American actress, singer, director and producer Ida Lupino, The Bigamist is raised from mere melodrama to a delicate portrayal of one man and his two marriages because of its components in characterisation. Associating here with Lupino is Joan Fontaine, Edmond O’Brien and Edmund Gwenn, and which amusingly includes several in-jokes citing Gwenn's most well-known role, portraying Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street. This is a striking even-handed movie that unexpectedly stands upon an emotional neutral ground scarcely seen in Hollywood movies from this era.",4.0
Ida Lupino toying with sexual morality under the nose of the Hays Code is extremely my shit.,3.5
"A simple story of a man living a scandalous life of bigamy, The Bigamist is surprisingly ambiguous and thoughtful. It presents heartbreak and a moral crisis, but lingers on the emotions. For a film about multiple wives, it feels very lonely. The opening act is conspiratorial, as the bigamy is revealed through a ridiculously thorough investigation required to adopt a child. The Bigamist is well made and driven by definable emotions. It is not a massively complicated film, but it hits most of the right notes.",3.5
My wife would castrate me.,3.5
"Not actually about polyamory; I was kinda hoping I could pass it off as a dated look at something we have a much better understanding of now, but instead it’s just about a man whose fatal flaw is loneliness and actually has a pretty nuanced perspective on love (for the time)
Plus it’s actually quite an interesting marriage (if you’ll pardon the pun) of film noir and romance, with the traditional detective role played by an investigator at an adoption agency
Great character work—I wasn’t expecting much and actually almost went to Mary Queen of Scots instead, but the longer it went on the more invested I became

Some thoughts on seeing old movies in theaters. I love it, but I find it to be a complicated experience. I like seeing beautiful prints of the films, and being able to get fully immersed in the story as it unfolds. But I find that sometimes the audience doesn’t have the same respect for older film as me. There were a lot of people laughing during The Bigamist, and sometimes it was laughing at the movie, and not laughing with. It feels condescending. I don’t think we need to take anything too seriously, but just because a movie is old and therefore made in a different style doesn’t mean we should be laughing at it.",4.5

just such a mature film even though the premise could come off as completely ridiculous and dated. both ida lupino and joan fontaine’s characters are fascinating women who never once feel only like functions of edmond o’brien’s life; they each have their own desires and aspirations and strong personalities. and as a result it is devastating and hits so much harder that either of them get mixed up with this embarrassing man and his mess!!! anyway so glad i got to see this in a theater <3,4.0
"Film School Dropouts Challenge -
Week 1 - Actor: Joan Fontaine
This is a very tasteful and empathetic treatment of the morality of its plot. It's a complicated scenario, and the film has the emotional nuance to tackle it properly. Harry Graham isn't perfect- or anything short of pathetic really- but the film understands that he isn't necessarily a monster. He's a man riddled with insecurities about women's changing role in the workplace and his own loneliness.
(Very mild spoilers here) What seals the deal of the movie still resonating today is when the two women in Harry's two lives share a glance. In most films of the time, and probably even now, the focus would be on the rivalry between the two women and a fight over the man who has been lying to them both. One look is all the two women share together in this film, and it's a look of understanding and solidarity.",3.5
"I love it when I rewatch a film and think better of it. ""The Bigamist"" is one of those rare films from 1950's Hollywood where it may look like as just another drama from the filmmaking machine, but with a director like Ida Lupino and a cast consisting of Ida Lupino (once again), Edmond O'Brien and Joan Fontaine (the leading character with less screen time seemed to me) it becomes something unique. The moral compass is completely broken and it is filled with maturity. It doesn't try to be a fight between good and evil, it puts us on the awkward position of rooting for the person that would usually be the bad guy of the reel. It does that in a very smart way and it analyzes this man and what he represents thoroughly.",3.5
"“I’m glad she means something to you. She can be hurt, just like the rest of us.”
A masterful blending between noir and melodrama, and it’s so evident that a woman is at the helm of it. There are two women with depth far beyond the ‘mysterious beautiful woman’ that’s typical in noirs, theres both a pregnancy plot and one woman is infertile, plot points that can so easily ruin a melodrama in the wrong hands, but neither character is defined by that in the slightest... it’s just so refreshing. The bigamist that the film revolves around and is named after is really just a passive observer through which these two women’s stories can be told. Ida lupino was such a unique voice in her era of Hollywood ugh. Genius. Also this poster is horrendous.",4.5
"I’m a person who cares a lot about morality, so I tend to see things in black and white when it comes to a lot of things, cheating being one of them. The Bigamist tells a really tragic story about cheating that managed to break down these walls for me, and I felt myself sympathizing with a man who cheated on his wife, which was very strange for me. The truth is, sometimes it’s not always black and white. The protagonist of this story has done a horrible thing, but that doesn’t make him a bad person.
He was living in a loveless relationship with a woman who didn’t care about him, so he searched for something else when he goes on his business trips. He planned to tell his wife before he was in too deep, but when exactly is a good time to break bad news? His wife’s father died, so he didn’t want to drop that news on her additionally to protect her, but he ended up hurting her more in the end. After he made his decision that his original marriage was over, things actually started to get better in the original marriage, which put him into a very difficult situation. One character, upon hearing his story said “I despise you, yet I pity you,” which summarizes the way I felt the entire way through.
Additionally, this was directed by a woman, so the women in this film were written with care. It touched on how this effects them, and how they are really people too. It’s sad that this is somewhat of a weird thing given its time, but that’s just the way things were, and I wouldn’t say this is necessarily a feminist film, though it has undercurrents of feminism sprinkled throughout and it made it a wonderful film.",4.0
"On the surface, The Bigamist may seem pretty straightforward--a man living a double life. However, this turned out to be so much more. At a time when Hollywood was under the critical eye of the production code, Director (and star) Ida Lupino manages to create an ambitious film that bends normality. Under the code, sexual relations outside of marriage were to be portrayed negatively, and neither the crime (bigamy) nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Lupino manages to break all these rules. 

Harry Graham (Edmond O’Brien), out of loneliness from the absence of company during his travels as a salesmen, becomes friends with Phyllis (Lupino) after they meet on a Hollywood tours bus (I was honestly so suprised that even in 1953 people payed to drive by stars' homes). When Graham realizes that Phyllis is just as lonely as he is, he can't help but try to be a part of her life. He became her friend with the most innocent of intentions, which later turned into something more. Despite the fact that Graham has the gorgeous Joan Fontaine (playing Eva) waiting for him at home, you feel sorry for him and Phyllis. You want them to be happy and find comfort with each other, even when they decide to get married. I think that the sympathy for Graham is easy to achieve when his wife, Eva, is portrayed as such a strong and independent business woman. None of his wives' pain is ignored; however, Lupino paints the picture of a man who genuinely wanted the best for both of the women in his life and didn't wish to hurt either of them. His cowardice doesn't go unnoticed, though, when the time comes for a confession.

Despite its short run time and bare-bones storyline, Lupino manages to turn this into something bigger. She's a real trailblazer for female directors.",3.0
"Ida Lupino directs and stars in this sensitive melodrama. Edmond O'Brien is Harry Graham, the bigamist with a heart, with Lupino and Joan Fontaine playing the two women in his life.
There's a nice in-joke: Lupino's and O'Brien's characters meet on a Hollywood sightseeing bus touring the homes of the stars in Beverly Hills. The driver points out ""behind that big hedge lives a little man who was Santa Claus to the whole world, Edmund Gwenn - remember Miracle on 34th Street"". Gwenn appears in this film as Mr Jordan, an adoption investigator, whose checking into the backgrounds of O'Brien's and Fontaine's characters (because they want to adopt a child) leads to the exposure of Harry.

"Three main takeaways, actor-wise:
I hate Edmond O’Brien’s face; actually, I hate his entire head. It’s like a big block of cheese somebody plopped on his shoulders. It’s fine when he’s in The Wild Bunch, or The Killers, but O’Brien playing a bigamist is unrealistic on a couple levels. He went in for eight to ten kisses with Lupino, but they almost always turned into neck-brush half-hugs. Awkward!
I love Ida Lupino. I’ve enjoyed the films she‘s directed (only seen three thus far), and she has such a presence on screen. Beautiful in an understated way, confident without needing to show it off, and intelligent in a sharp but often world-weary manner.
I found out a few days ago that Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland were sisters, and their rivalry caused an extended estrangement. Well, nothing against Joan Fontaine,  but I love Olivia de Havilland.  If I ever meet Joan, I’m gonna be as cold to her as Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca. (Olivia is the one that’s alive, actually-at 104!)

The performances are very good, especially by its three main leads. Everyone does a good job playing all the emotions and adding up to the suspense.
The script is very good, balancing the romance with the thrills. I wouldn't say it balances well as personally it all felt a bit misleading, especially by the score who seems to belong to a whole different movie. Also the ending was a bit disheartening but also half assed.

"The 52 Films Directed By Women Project
5/52
The first disappointment in what has been a thoroughly enjoyable project so far, but one that is at the very least an interesting 'failure'.
The problem with Ida Lupino's film is really the way it tells its story. I felt the flashback device that takes up in the middle three-quarters of this film wasn't really the way this film should have been done. Obviously the title gives away what Edmond O'Brien has done, but if they could have changed that and instead had the start of his relationships at the start of this film, only for Edmund Gwenn to come nosing around later on, this would have been far more effective.
Watching O'Brien juggle two relationships with no real tension in the story just makes for a rather dull experience unfortunately. I also didn't think this was O'Brien's strongest performance, which didn't help. While Lupino and Joan Fontaine sparkle in their roles, and Gwenn is a delightfully nosy old codger, O'Brien doesn't really get across the anxieties of his character, nor indeed the enjoyment he's having at being together with two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood at that time and perhaps any other. Normally a reliable actor, the complexities of this role just seem beyond him.
Also, the way the story is framed means that Gwenn is portrayed as not really having much reason to be poking around into O'Brien's affairs from the outset. What I did enjoy was the ending, which was amazingly positive and forgiving for its time and even bordered on being quite a happy one. While this is the weakest of Lupino's films as a director I have seen, this last few minutes perhaps more than anything in her better films show what a talent she was behind the camera. How she crafted, and was allowed to get away with, such an ending is beyond me. It's just a shame that what proceeds it makes it seem like an act of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.",2.5
Where's the sequel where Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino go all John Tucker Must Die on his ass?,3.5
"A remarkably compassionate and sensitive film that belies its opening, its periodic speechifying, and a credit that screams, “… and Edmond O’Brien as The Bigamist”.
The film kicks off with a noir-ish framing device that’s fun but also tacky and unnecessary, saddled with a hysterical music score and one-note playing from both a peevish and shifty O’Brien, and Edmund Gwenn, wooden as the adoption agency investigator who begins to smell a second marriage. But then the film settles into its flashback and into itself, aiming at – and reaching – a truthfulness of characterisation, and empathetic understanding of frailty and weakness, that was as unusual on screen then as it is now.
It’s ultimately a movie that cares deeply about all three of its main characters: O’Brien’s decent, lonely travelling salesman; his pretty blonde wife (Joan Fontaine) who throws herself into a business career when she’s unable to have a child; and his other wife (Ida Lupino), a waitress whose vulnerability is cased beneath a carapace of stereotypical toughness. Though there are implausibilities in the story and script – O’Brien constantly thwarted from ‘fessing up by crunching plot gears – there are none in the film’s relationships or emotions, and each scene builds to a natural, memorable climax that often consists of a resonant line from Lupino.
As an actor, she arguably reached her zenith in They Drive by Night (1940), with the most memorable ‘mad’ scene that side of Agnes Moorehead in Ambersons, but she was one of the most interesting performers on the American screen for at least two decades, and by the early ‘50s had developed a more naturalistic style that suited a new wave of offbeat crime films, from Nicholas Ray’s On Dangerous Ground – which decamps to the countryside after just a few minutes – to the oddly overlooked noir, Private Hell 36, which she co-wrote (with Collier Young, who also did The Bigamist), and which surely influenced James Ellroy’s innumerable excursions into the genre.
Lupino often said that she got the roles Barbara Stanwyck didn’t want, and there’s a neat in-joke about that here, after a bus tour of movie stars’ homes, as well as a none-more-meta gag about Gwenn, who is himself an unseen character in the film. The first conversation O’Brien has with Lupino is partly about how much he enjoyed Miracle on 34th Street.
Their chemistry is terrific, and I think it’s because she isn’t just a great actor but a great re-actor, who has conversations instead of trading dramatic moments, and yet can sell an epiphany as well as anyone – and in noir, an epiphany is everything, because it’s where the hand of fate taps you on the shoulder. Both actors are just excellent in this, gradually dispensing with their characters’ insecurities and brittle, even dislikeable facades, to become instead idealised versions of themselves – which is what love is. Fontaine’s self-deceiving businesswoman is less expansive but I think that’s intentional, because she is what O’Brien is escaping from, and periodically reconnecting with – out of pity, protectiveness, or some echo of what he once saw in her. You still feel her pain.
Lupino had made her debut behind the camera in 1950 – becoming only the second major female director of the sound era, after Dorothy Arzner – and has already made one highly successful B-movie during 1953, The Hitch-Hiker, featuring a memorable William Talman as the titular psycho. Here, her style is recognisable right from the off: terse and economical (both in terms of style and budget), but with an intrinsic integrity, and some lovely grace notes that augment the characterisation: like the moment in which Lupino heads to her room and O’Brien clasps her hand, then holds on to it for just a little too long, and we know that he’s in love.
You wouldn’t mistake the film for an Irving Thalberg production, though, and occasionally the penny-pitching does detract: there’s a curious shot early in O’Brien and Lupino’s relationship where they’re walking along with their arms around each other, and it feels completely incongruous in terms of the way their dynamic is being developed; then you get near the end of the film and realise that they’d re-used a bit of footage that they shot for a later scene.
Because of the censorship restrictions of the period, the film inevitably turns a little preachy at times, with Gwenn and a judge rather sticking the boot in, but you’d struggle to watch the rest of it and fail to sympathise with O’Brien’s plight. The Bigamist simply feels more honest than almost any other film of its period – and yet you can also read it as a genre movie: a film noir in which all the violence is emotional.
It has a patsy, a heavy, a good girl and a fatale, but the good girl unwittingly lures the anti-hero into adultery, the fatale is the wife who drags him back from the life he wants, and the heavy is just trying to make up for the time he let something happen to an adopted child. And Robert Towne thought he was being clever with Chinatown. (To be fair, he was.)",4.5

"When I went into watch Ida Lupino's The Bigamist the first time, I didn't have very high expectations. I assumed it would be a sensationalist piece of celluloid. Instead, I got an interesting and fairly nuanced movie about a man (Edmond O'Brien) with two families who don't know about each other, with Lupino and Joan Fontaine starring as the wives. While the movie doesn't exactly give O'Brien's bigamy a pass, it does offer a surprisingly sympathetic perspective on his actions. I prefer this one to Lupino's heavy-handed Outrage, which, while important, is a soppy melodramatic mess. Even if The Bigamist more or less avoids these miscues, it's nowhere near as good as Lupino's brilliant, nihilistic noir The Hitch-Hiker (which also stars O'Brien).",3.5
"The Bigamist is often praised for its realistic and humanistic approach to the subject matter. Rather than demonizing the central character, the film presents him as a flawed individual grappling with the consequences of his choices. It examines the emotional toll on all parties involved, exploring themes of loneliness, desire, and the complexities of marriage. The films visual style, while not as visually striking as other film noirs of the era, effectively captures the contrast between the two cities where Harry's double life unfolds. San Francisco and Los Angeles serve as symbolic backdrops, reflecting the divergent worlds in which the protagonist finds himself.
Edmond O'Brien performance as Harry Graham, the conflicted bigamist, was widely acclaimed. Edmund O'Brien effectively conveys the inner turmoil of a man torn between two families, and his portrayal brings depth and sympathy to a character that could easily be judged harshly. Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino also deliver strong performances as the two wives, each bringing their own emotional complexity to their respective roles. Critics generally responded positively to The Bigamist upon its release. Ida Lupino direction was commended for its sensitivity and restraint, with many appreciating her ability to handle the delicate subject matter with nuance and empathy. The films narrative structure, which utilizes flashbacks to reveal the protagonist's dual life, was also praised for its effectiveness in building suspense and emotional depth

"What Ida Lupino’s overlooked film noir The Bigamist lacks in visual splendor, it truly makes up for in emotional and cerebral texture. At first, you might fall victim to the tropes pertaining to the genre and think of the struggling husband, played immensely sympathetically by Edmond O’Brien, as a hardboiled, cynical man. I must confess I had that very thought. Then Lupino advances. She pounces on our preconceptions of the genre. She ups the emotional interior by revealing that the very man we had come to loathe because of the double life he’s leading has, in fact, been suffering from existential ennui. His wife is sporting a career, which in and of itself is interesting, but she is actualizing herself in a way that alienates her husband.
It sounds banal, and perhaps too obvious an attempt at gender-role reversal. But mind you this is the 50s, and this is film noir. The streets are filled with post-war men, cynical in heart, hardboiled, and corruptively insatiable. Except for the bigamist in question, he’s very much in love.",3.5

"Structured as a noir wrapped up in a domestic drama, somehow managed to be extremely tender and kept me on the edge of my seat at the same time. I really dug this. Don’t know why it’s taken me so long to see any of Lupino’s work but this was a great introduction, plus she gives ridiculously charming performance to boot.",4.0
"Knowing zero about this and with its lurid title, I expected The Bigamist to be either a screwball comedy or melodramatic trash. It is neither. Ida Lupino directs this as if it was a grim noir rather than a relationship drama. As Harry/Harrison slips further into his self-made nightmare, it takes on a sweaty tension reserved for something involving murder. The film is also incredibly empathetic and complex. It doesn't excuse terrible behaviour, nor does it paint its titular bigamist as a mindless monster. The film's final act is distressing, and I didn't want to see any of the characters go through the pain they are forced to endure. Great film.",4.5
"There are two things that particularly impressed me with Ida Lupino's The Bigamist.
Firstly there's the simple fact that Lupino managed to even make this film. Without resorting to cheap melodrama she sketches a very sympathetic portrait of a bigamist, the kind of person whose story isn't even talked about that often today. She never really chooses sides, never condemns or applauds the man's actions and instead tries to dive into his conflicting feelings as a man who genuinely loves two different women and has to face the consequences of those feelings.
Secondly, it amazed me how naturally Lupino directs. Visually the film is very clean. The imagery is natural; Lupino often shoots in medium shots and rarely in close-ups. The camera only moves when absolutely necessary and the acting feels almost neo-realistic. While it's clear that most of the actors are trained in that typical, more overstated kind of acting that 50's Hollywood was known for before method acting became a thing, Lupino seemed to be a step ahead of the curve with the performances she helped create here.
Anyhow, a solid little film that makes hungry for more.",3.5
"At long last, I've watched a film directed by Ida Lupino! The cast includes 4 Oscar winners as well as the director. I was expecting a noir (not sure why), but this was a melodrama.
Interesting bits:
A number of meta moments mentioning how much Edmund Gwenn looked like Santa and even an actual mention of him in Miracle on 34th Street.
The San Francisco wife's home is decorated with Chinese decor, and the LA wife worked at a Chinese restaurant. No idea why this similarity existed.
Asian actor at the restaurant had a name, Sam, and lines which weren't stereotypical or racist which was refreshing.
Lots of exterior footage which was fascinating since I've lived in the LA area for 22 years. Fun to see actual stars' homes in the star tour from '53 (still exists!).
The screenwriter had been married to Ida Lupino and during filming was married to Joan Fontaine! Perhaps a not so subtle art imitates life detail?
Which brings me to the plot--the title pretty much gives that away, eh? Still, it was interesting in 1953 for this film to be so overtly sympathetic to polygamy/polyamory. I was bothered that there seemed to be an implication that the career leanings of wife #1 led to her husband's loneliness. Still, there was no real villain and all three main characters were treated with sympathy. Perhaps more than they deserved, in the case of the husband? Or less, in the case of the wifes? In any case, I was never quite sure how I was supposed to feel which speaks to a subtly in the direction that felt uniquely female. I am truly impressed that Lupino, at 35, had already directed 6 films, but saddened that this would be her last until Trouble With Angels in 1966. Still, that she became a successful television director while also continuing acting is a testament to her tenacity and talent.",3.5
"It’s kinda like a more straightforward version of Varda’s Le Bohner making the viewer empathize with the man instigating the extramarital affair, but with a b-movie Noir structure. And similar to that Varda film, this would never work if a man directed had directed this.
Lupino gets such incredible naturalistic performances from the women, the audience feels their tragedy even though the story (apparently written by Lupino’s ex and Fontaine’s current partner) follows the cheater. The structure was a bit tired and it doesn’t match the wit of Varda but the naturalism pulls this out of dull melodramatic moralizing into a place of actual subversive tragedy (at least for the time) about gender roles and how they effects desirability.
I wish Fontaine and Lupino had some actual scenes together though. They really kill it here but they’re stuck acting against someone way out of their league.

"A lot more complex and morally ambiguous than your typical Hays Code era domestic melodrama. The stakes feel really high and the emotions very real, no aspect of the inner or outer conflicts is depicted too simplistically, or in a scandalized way.
Even though it's essentially focused on psychological motivations more than the actual incidents themselves, it has this noirish, detective-like quality in the forefront that works really well too.

I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.
Summarises well the moral conflict felt when watching this. It's puzzling how the best of intentions can land results worse than the worst of intentions. Ida Lupino teaches us empathy through forcing us into the uncomfortable position of watching the rationale behind the main character's actions, so that we may no longer judge solely based on outcome, which makes the ambiguity of its ending even more befitting.",4.0
"To come to deal with fragile subject matters from social behaviors and physical tragedies was already far from being a big of a challenge for director Ida Lupino to handle by that time in her directorial career. But just as equally investing, though one step above on its complexity, The Bigamist stands out quite peculiarly amazing in the midst of the director's entire filmography, just for the quite ingenious way she approaches to deal with bigamist relations here in a complete unconventional way, even for today's standards of complex dramatics. Because first and for most, she doesn’t present the heart core of the drama and the title itself really half an hour or more into the film.
Luring around the character of Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien) and his sweet loving wife Eve (Joan Fontaine) making an attempt to adopt a child while the head of the adoption agency, the chubby old sweet Mr. Jordan ( Edmund Gwenn), suspects the certain suspicious uncomfortable behavior of Harry when they meet in the same room talking about the adoption subject, and decides to go on a deep investigation to know what’s wrong about this peculiar and apparently ordinary middle class citizen and if he is capable of being the legal guardian of an adopted child along with his wife. All that forms this assembling of initial scenes that doesn’t even look like to belong in this complex melodrama that the main plot later reveals because Lupino makes it all feels like that we are watching a crime Noir thriller.
A male main protagonist being persecuted by a supposed crime he may have committed all the while its morals are questioned are every turn of the thrill ride, is kind of what we are watching as well with the character of Harry is going through and the investigation that begins around his personal life. Even the really great soundtrack from Leith Stevens here helps to enhance the Noir tone that the film carries, making all feels like that there’s an awful immoral crime being committed by the character of Harry, which by the end we know it is, don’t get me wrong,
But right on that point is also where Lupino shows to find a real and unbelievably dramatic understanding towards the character of Harry and his attitudes of having a bigamy relationship outside of marriage with Phyllis Martin (Lupino herself) and even having a child between them and not with his first and still current wife Eve, maintaining both marriages alive for a certain time of events, feeling as if he were really committing a heinous and immoral crime, with doubt eroding in his heart, the same heart that says he can nurture and have real love by the two women of his life while is cheating both.
While the director and the film itself by the end may condemn the actions of Harry, as usual in Lupino films dealing with this sort of matters while criticizing it, but it never comes to the point of demonizing it or making the character of Harry an unredeemable guilty monster. Rather showing that all which happened with Harry and the start of his affair with Phyllis, in the long sequences of flashbacks that structures the strong narrative together, departure from situations of pure occasional chance, out of the control of their characters' feelings and desires.
Be it with the marriage between Harry and Eve that gradually dismantled in distance; the chemistry and affection that rises and connects Harry to Phyllis and the son they end up having and later their legal marriage; and later the son that Eve seeks to have with Harry for them to rekindle the happiness of their marriage. Leaving the plot only to thicken even more in its heavy melodramatic nature that seems to be leading towards an inescapable sorrow tragedy of the characters inner-selves, specially of Harry and the wrongs he’s doing with both women’s lives he so clearly cares and loves.
Deep down we the audience may also know and see all of this as complete wrong, but can’t neither blame nor Harry or anyone, because of how much authenticity and honesty is displayed by the so real dialogue written here, by the real rain of complex emotions that its characters possess, that any director at that time wouldn’t have the slight of guts to touch upon, and here was Lupino exploring it in a complex drama with complex characters trapped in a occasion that could easily happen to any person or social status, of terrible consequences where there may not be one guilty someone to blame nor a simple fact to serve as an answer.
It was her creative audacity flaming in ambition yet again, that unfairly got little to no recognition, nor her previous films for that matter, which made her fell in oblivion on the director’s chair for a long time after this, but while here she was definitely achieving a new height. All of her films feel cinematic enough with the visual or narrative exploration that seemed completely original for its helming, and The Bigamist is full of them, not only for that Noir-ish treatment of its tone throughout the film, but also in the way she directs some scenes with a different aspect of tonality.
Let it be in the scene where Eve says goodbye from Harry on the airport before going on a trip, saying how when she comes back their lives will be different and everything will be ok, while Lupino shots the scene with the camera so close to the couple while the sweet-almost corny music plays in the background leaving it to look like an ironic copy of Casablanca’s ending, or the scene where Phyllis and Harry meet on a bus going on a tour ride through a bunch of the real houses of famous Hollywood stars, serving to kind of make an acid allusion to the fact that these invisible stars are just as ordinary common people such as us and the characters, only to imagine if bigamism is a big thing among them too, oh well…
But again, all in tune with what the characters are going through in their personal dramas at that moment, and all feel immensely genuine thanks to a handful of great acting packed in here. Edmond O'Brien is absolutely superb, his actions are questionable to the core bone of everything, but never for a moment we leave to feel real sympathy and condolence for what he’s going through, displaying a palpable humanity of a real ordinary someone caught in a situation that soon gets off of his control, and no matter how well intentioned his intentions and feelings were, the pain and consequences will inevitable leave to affect every single of the pivotal characters.
From Lupino’s usual strong attitude woman but with a soft heart and sensible personality that really makes you want to care for the poor woman for how fragile she shows to be, while showing how broken by the world and the harmful word called love she got in her life. And also Fontaine’s Eve, conveying as the perfect common usual wife with a real attractive docility in her personality and presence on screen, which very well convinces the level of difficulty it becomes to Harry for not wanting to break her heart, because just from us looking at her we can see how sensitive and pure his young wife is.
And how weird is the fact that Lupino was acting opposite to Joan Fontaine as Harry's other wife, who at the time Fontaine was having an affair with Lupino's ex-husband and partner Collier Young , who signs the script and production for the film. Well, I guess it was making the emotions on screen more believable I guess. Jokes aside, that’s the real strength behind Lupino’s style, her honesty, her care and real humanistic fondness she shows even to the worst immoral man of all, the cheater, showing that even him have a heart and reasons for falling into the sinful act. And for a director to accomplish that in the time that she did, is revolutionary by default, and the result is timeless as its theme is humanly real as it can get to show relevance till today.
It can be argued over if this is her best or not, going against the through-hell-ride Noir-Road-Move of The Hitchhiker, but sure is definitely one of her greatest masterpieces that NEEDS to be rediscovered!",4.5
"Empathy for all involved is the end goal of The Bigamist, a film which purposefully, through its plot revealing title alone, sets up Edmond O'Brien's cheating two-timer as the villain and then systematically goes about peeling away our prejudices until we're left strangely sympathetic yet also unforgiving for what is still inexcusable behavior in an unusually ambiguous court sequence.
Ida Lupino directs this domestic melodrama with the atmosphere, style and structure of film noir, so in that sense it functions like a transitional piece from her earlier female led social issue dramas into grittier, male dominated territory that would be followed by The Hitch-Hiker that same year. Lupino also stars alongside Joan Fontaine as one of the two women and thus was directing herself, that alone is mightily impressive and indicative of her position as a pioneering female auteur working in a stiflingly male dominated industry.
There's just something unique and refreshing⁠—not to mention quite odd about her work, these are films made with remarkable compassion and foresight which look and feel modern whilst being engaging on an emotional and intellectual level⁠—to have both is rare in classic Hollywood and Lupino's refusal to be pigeonholed as a feminine director speaks volumes about her ambitions as a filmmaker.

"Still thinking about Ida Lupino's hushed, reverent plea to Edmond O'Brien: ""kill me.""
Two startling words are the root of the latent despair of this picture. The bleak atmosphere is absorbed by sudden swinging camera movements that range across Lupino's compact frame, a low budget grim focus that only exists in a barren Los Angeles, the jukebox in the vacant ""early American Chinese"" restaurant where Lupino is resignedly employed (the emblem of her inability to lift herself out of her self-acknowledged worthlessness), the treatment of infertility, subtle poverty, and loneliness that women specifically face with and without the monetary or emotional support of a romantic partner - all contribute to a mounting narrative unease as the plot is peeled back to reveal the cruel lack of choices women have over their own lives when confronted by a man abusing his agency. To add insult to injury, The Bigamist is the product of Collier Young's screenplay two years after his divorce from Ida Lupino and one year into his marriage with Joan Fontaine. Even under Lupino's purview, both women's lives are messy and irrevocable, tangled as they are by the moral descent of their shared husband. The suffering rings true.",3.5

"Heartbreaking. Only Lupino would be able to make a film on adultery feel so much like a noir, while systematically twisting the genre's codes to fit the subject she is treating. So beautiful and despairing, displaying an ambiguity that lies a lot in the tenderness and preciseness of feeling Lupino is able to express through her concise dramaturgy and intelligent mise en scène. Spectacular framing, and very insightful symbology - chinese furniture on a couple's room near a clock, stairs and doors and windows and other people's babies. For those who understand the complexity of morals and life beyond society's reductionist and pragmatic moralistic codes, and who can atune with deep feelings and true humanity, this is an astounding piece of work that clearly does not get as much praise as it should.",4.5
"A very clever film noir by perhaps the only female director of the genre in the 1950s, Ida Lupino, with her starring the ""mistress"" role of Harry in the film. Intriguingly, Collier Young, the screenwriter, was her ex-husband when she made this, and the supporting actress, Joan Fontaine, was the then-new wife of Young. So Lupino herself swapped roles with Fontaine here in the film, as contrary to what happened in the reality.
The Bigamist, the film title, is a crime to be questioned vis-a-vis adultery. When I watched this, I amusingly imagined that if this took place in pre-modern China or the Middle East harem, then nothing wrong would seem to happen to the man lol In postwar America, the gender norm, instead of people, was to be blamed or at least questioned, by Lupino here. This evokes Julienne Moore's role in The Hours, where she was a good mother who wants to leave her seemingly flawless home to become a librarian (and she did, and her family fell apart, etc.).
Here we have a framed story of Harry's relationships with the two women, Eve (Fontaine) and Phyllis (Lupino). Both are attractive physically, but Eve appears less so at the point when Harry found that she excels in running his business more than him and she was infertile. He doesn't feel needed, nor masculine, as he cannot take up the role of a father. So one day he was wandering around on the street and on a bus, she meet Phyllis, who attracts him physically and they have a spark going on between them. Later, Phyllis has Harry's child, til then, Harry still hasn't told Phyllis that he has married - not because he is a ""bad guy,"" but more of a feeble-minded one. I wonder if it's the norm that in film noir we found feeble-minded male protagonists like him who are a bit chunkier than a dashing protagonist, and then his feeble-mindedness causes a series of mistakes with beautiful women that bring us the suspenseful and mysterious qualities of the film. But at least it's the case here. At some point, Harry wants to tell Eve that he would like to divorce her, but then her father dies. Instead of showing sympathy for his father-in-law, I think Harry feels needed and relied on at that point, hence he puts the divorce proposal on hold. At another point when he wants to bring it up again, Eve gives Harry a watch that her grandpa left for Harry ($), so Harry puts the proposal on hold again. So we see Harry's feeble-mindedness and his inferiority complex regarding masculinity is really the problem - no one among the three is a 100% villain, like in the court, the lawyer said he's just an ordinary man.
So like another reviewer here suggests that the framed story leads us to rethink the crime of bigamy (legal condemnation), which pertains to adultery. Yet adultery is complicated in reality and only the third party, eg Mr Jordan, can jump to the conclusion after hearing the entire story and still very clear-headedly calls the police to fetch Harry to court. This reminds me of the HK film The Sparring Partner - what the court decides is not necessarily what should be ended up (penalised). And this film also evokes Sophecles' Antigone, which is famously a Greek tragedy about how wrong manmade law is vs. natural law.
Lupino as an empathetic female director who had just gone through divorce channelled her understanding of relationship complications into making this film, and the ambiguous ending is both unusual for this era's Hollywood film and film noir in general.

Ida Lupino is a bit of an underrated treasure. The first I watched from here, The Hitch Hiker (1953), was a low budget horror road trip into post WWII American paranoia through a keen masculine lens.
The Bigamist is a far different type of film, an extended flashback about a man we are never asked to like, or even really sympathize with. We are merely asked to give our attention and let this man plead his case.
Hell, even while I don't find the guy's action's in particular good moral the film allows us to see how events, and reactions to those events can lead us to grave mistakes. The best some can hope to do is make amends, and because the lead character isn't necessarily a horrible person (in that he never truly intended to hurt anyone) you can tell in the end that the guilt of his actions is going to far outweigh any sentence handed down by the judge. Which is summed up in a wonderful quote at the end.
""When a man, even with the best intentions, breaks the moral laws we live by, we really don't need man-made laws to punish him.""
I think this movie is often misinterpreted as being sympathetic toward Edmond when in fact it's merely trying to examine and understand the how/why of a seemingly good man living a double life. It's simple in approach but deep in implication. Especially for a film in the 1950's. It takes a look at love being something much more complex than marriage, and marriage being an often complicating and possibly even pointless social expectation.",4.5
"An interesting story centered around 3 good people caught in a bad situation, treated realistically but sympathetically. I liked the ambiguous ending, which considers the complex emotions and potential responses each character has to their shared plight. Lupino and Fontaine are both great as a traveling salesman's unknowing, very different wives, and Edmund O'Brien is fine as the titular protagonist, if a little flat. Also his suits never seemed to fit him correctly.",4.0
"Very good character study of loneliness and the taboo of breaking monogamy. Interesting as we have the first major female American director telling a tale that isn't at all judgemental of the man who leads on two wives - if anything, the film is highly sympathetic to his situation, and ultimately we come to pity the central character (a great performance by Edmond O'Brien) rather than dislike him. He's not an evil character, but a pitiable and weak one. It's sensitive material that Lupino handles extremely well, and her performance in front of the camera (like that of the wonderful, recently passed Joan Fontaine) is great as well. It's a really interesting film that I liked a lot, plus I can't say no to some great meta-irony - the two wives in the film also shared a husband in real life - the screenwriter Collier Young had divorced Lupino a year earlier, and was married to Fontaine! Also, the house of Edmond Gwenn is shown, even though he acts in the film. Great stuff.",4.0
"i was expecting a more film noir aspect to this film but thankfully, this wasn’t the case. my first film from director and actress Ida Lupino and i can’t wait to watch more of her work.
i appreciate the fact that the women in this weren’t pit against each other. instead, this film shows how this situation would just have an effect in their lives. though the husband IS an idiot, strangely enough, you can’t help but feel empathy for him (and his wives too), thanks to Lupino’s gentle direction. in the end, the ending was quite satisfying, what’s done is done and now, he has to figure out what’s next.

"Really great, it was delightfully cringey to watch this guy scramble, and Lupino creates some pretty dimensional (for the time) characters in the two women.",3.5
"My recent fascination with the career of Ida Lupino continues. Lupino set her sights higher than most women in Hollywood were able to. Together with her writer/producer husband, Collier Young she formed a production house and directed seven feature length movies.
Lupino directs and co-stars in The Bigamist, a straightforward story of double infedility set between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Even though it's direct in terms of story, I like how there's no judgement on the characters. Most women having a child out of wedlock would be demonised in a 1950's film, but not on Ida Lupino's watch. She's more interested in male fragility and that's what makes her films and this film unique.
We are never led to boo-hiss Edmond O'Brien, despite his blatant ways. He's in a perfect position to lead a double life, being a travelling salesman. His love is split, and he's weakened by it, but again, he's never judged by the movie.
Lupino is an interesting person to follow in this period. She subverts noir with all shades of grey.",3.5
"This movie treats a very controversial subject (polyamory/cheating/etc.) with great nuance, compassion and thoughtfulness which is quite astonishing as it was made in 1953.

"Ida Lupino is giving me 1953 Maggie Gyllenhaal.
Interesting noir-tinged domestic drama centered on a man who, you guessed it, is married to two women. I find it impossible to believe that anyone would sympathize with the protagonist, who spends much of the film trying to rationalize his behavior. The issue with bigamy is not only that it's illegal, it's that it is a form of fraud perpetrated against a number of unsuspecting, innocent people. I'm glad the film doesn't try to demonize either of the two women.",3.0
"where loneliness is lodged by another, a deep connection can be found in its familiar gestures. The Bigamist, tight and tense, openly confesses of its mistake beforehand but it doesn’t care of the repercussions. not really. instead it realises of the decisions and reasons where it wouldn’t rationalise themselves. further contradiction and ambivalence cower the man whilst the unknowing wives wait in their homes; the turmoil brews; the indecision chokes; no secret gets away undisclosed. what now? the complexity of The Bigamist lie in its characters and not so much with its plot. it is a riveting study not only of loneliness but also of longing—the kind that refuses to communicate itself that it ends up embracing the first touch and feel of foreign affection and attention. and it wrecks everyone involved.",3.5
"An unusual blend of melodrama and noir tropes that zags from what I would have expected from a 1953 social drama. The emotional turmoil and passivity we see in Edmond O'Brien's character would have been more typical in a woman's melodramatic role, and while there's moralizing, it's not a purely puritanical morality. It does still function as an anti-career woman story, with Joan Fontaine portrayed as basically driving her husband into the arms of another woman. While I didn't care for The Hitch-Hiker, it's clear Lupino and The Filmakers were a groundbreaking and skilled group, and I'd like to see some of their earlier films.",3.5

"""I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.""
For a fifties outing draped in noir aesthetics, The Bigamist is far from what you'd called hard boiled. In fact it's actually very soft and tender throughout. Edmond O’Brien's character could so easily be waved off as a selfish creep but Ida Lupino goes to great lengths to give him his day in court (literally by the end of the film). I'm personally not sure if the flashback framing devices is necessarily the best way of delivering this kind of story, though.",3.0
"There are no easy answers in Ida Lupino's The Bigamist. Our lead protagonist has clearly done something pretty awful  in lying to the two women in his life and allowing things to reach the level they do by betraying them both. His narrative is driven by a very particular type of cowardice. He fears loneliness. He fears hurting the people he cares about. He fears that he will be unable to provide each of these women with support and the things they want. These fears drive him further and further into an unmanagable situation in which the ultimate irony is that the longer he keeps this charade going, the more pain he will inflict on both women he cares about (which is the one thing he seems to genuinely want to avoid). The true mastery of the script is that it does not let him off the hook for any of this, yet still manages to allow us to feel empathy for him as someone who made some very bad decisions and whose life is fairly unbearable as a result of his weakness. He is a flawed human being who really has no idea what to do and makes decisions that seem designed to buy himself a few extra moments at a time. The people he cares about pay a large emotional cost for this. The Bigamist is an admirably nuanced look at how complex human relationships can be and a good warning that sometimes when you are feeling lonely you should probably just suck it up and stay inside and learn to chill out on your own.",3.5
"only my second film in lupino's filmography and thus far i'm quite impressed. she sure knew how to make a viewer's skin crawl. an absolute master tension builder.
it has a barbara stanwyck reference and an ambiguous ending, so of course it's good.",3.5
"This is kind of a weird movie. It's focalized through the perspective of the titular bigamist, and has a great deal of sympathy for him even though he treats both of the women in his life like shit (through being too ""kind"" to be honest with either of them). There's also a whole part of the plot that hinges on how he's unfaithful to Joan Fontaine because 1) she can't have children 2) she funnels her grief about not being able to have children into becoming a successful career woman and running the shit out of the company they are co-owners of. There's even a phone conversation where he's all ""hey I met this other woman I'm attracted to"" and she's all ""cool but IDGAF; hey babe gotta go castrate someone (probably you) with the the paper cutter in my office since I Only Care About Business."" Joan Fontaine does her best with this underwritten collection of misogynist cliches. Ida Lupino's ""little mouse,"" however, brings something else to the movie. I love her introduction, where she's totally bored and annoyed with the guy. Once they fall for each other, she doesn't ask anything of him, in the classic self-sacrificing martyr way, but you get the sense that it's because she knows men don't have anything to give so why bother trying. When he does try to step up and actually care for her it's a complete lie, a story made out of happily ever after fantasies, but even after she realizes that she accepts it, because what else is there? By the end of the picture you can really feel the desperation and hopelessness of women who have to depend on men for money, social legitimacy, love. This is true for Joan Fontaine's character as well, since she wouldn't be able to adopt the child she wants so much without her husband. This is why I'm thrown by the movie's focus on the bigamist: his story is the least interesting and sympathetic. But maybe the point is that women don't get to be the center of the story; their lives are narratively and politically peripheral, contingent on the whims of the men in their lives. Anyway, I hope that after the final shot of the movie the two women went off to raise their children together in a lesbian seperatist colony.",3.0
"Ida Lupino remains in a league of her own, having tremendous talent both on-screen as well as off throughout her lengthy career. Behind the camera, she achieves both stoicism and sympathy in staging and perspective -- firm but never unfeeling, adding an additional depth that was all too often absent from the work of her peers. Like Arzner before her, Lupino upended stringent de facto societal gender conventions to establish herself as a pioneering director just as competent as her male contemporaries.
THE BIGAMIST offers the rare opportunity to observe and appreciate her efforts as both a director and actress in one, and a crowning exemplar of just how profound and bodied her ideas are. She plays opposite Joan Fontaine, embodying everything the former lacks: a rapacious earthiness that ultimately seduces the sex-starved Edmund O'Brien. The set-up is seemingly ideal, as O'Brien is a traveling salesman and Fontaine is disinterested in him -- that is until Lupino discovers she's pregnant, prompting O'Brien to kowtow to societal chivalry and marry her as well.
Lupino famously drew heavy inspiration from her own life in crafting this film, yet they remain at best subtle touches that, in turn, yield stupendous substance. Further still, her ambiguous appraisal of O'Brien's conundrum intones a gentle understanding, one that can only be ascertained and cultivated through lived experiences. This quiet acceptance of deviant behavior signifies a tolerant -- even kind -- appraisal of queerness, fortified all the more considering Fontaine's character and her larger effect on the story.
A highly recommended watch, and one that has me itching to explore the rest of her repertoire as a director.",3.5
"""I can’t figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you. I pity you. I don’t even want to shake your hand and yet I almost wish you luck.""
Star and director Ida Lupino breathes life into a two-bit script through a domestic noir about the combustible secrets we live. I liked the ending, as it didn't explode into a storm as I expected, but rather carouseled into painstakingly emotional decisions built upon a moral foundation. The performances are outstanding, and they support the notion that the film asks the audience: is it conceivable to have sympathy for a lying bigamist living two secret lives? Honestly, with the facts laid out meticulously from O'Brien's character, I hesitate to say 'yes', but I understand why.",3.5
"It’s hard to watch The Bigamist without equal parts frustration and sympathy towards the characters, and that speaks to Ida Lupino’s marvelous depth as a director.
Harry Graham (Edmond O’Brien) finds himself 8-months deep in bigamy at the beginning of the film, and even as you’re rolling your eyes over how a guy could get into such a mess, you realize that human relationships are easily just as straightforwardly complicated as Lupino presents them. The post-war world is hard on a lonely business man with basically good intentions, but Harry isn’t the only one who’s lonely and walking around with a pocketful of good intentions.
Harry’s relationship with Eve (Joan Fontaine) is an interesting one to dissect, because it’s more or less a gender-swapped “neglected housewife” trope. Eve is unable to have children, and at Harry’s suggestion, she enters Harry’s business and becomes a successful businesswoman herself. The only problem is that while Harry still loves Eve, he no longer feels “needed” by her, and he finds himself begging her for some quality time together. She’s not reluctant or disinterested—life and business just keep getting in the way, and Harry gets lonelier by the minute while Eve, by her own admission, uses work to distract herself from her desire for children. Harry feels neglected at home; Eve feels inadequate at home, and they both turn a blind eye to each other’s anxieties when it comes to keeping up with the nuclear family Joneses of the 1950s.
Then, on a sales trip to Los Angeles, Harry meets Phyllis (Ida Lupino), and an innocent dinner with a stranger eventually leads to a one-night stand and an unplanned pregnancy. Phyllis is not quite a counterpart to Eve, because her presentation is one of even more vehement independence than we see in Eve—she’s living on her own far from home, working her own job, paying her own bills, and initially, she even dodges Harry’s attempts to talk to her. When consulting with Harry over what to do about Phyllis’s pregnancy, her doctor tells Harry that her tough facade is “not the real Phyllis” and that Harry should know that better than anyone. Despite being the only character that best (at least from what we can see) navigates her life both inside and outside of the home according to 1950s standards, Phyllis is still a victim of underlying anxieties that aren’t sufficiently addressed—for example, her own imagined guilt over her pregnancy “trapping” Harry in a marriage he didn’t want.
All three main characters in The Bigamist suffer form a fierce need to project independence and satisfaction—things that none of these characters actually feels—and as a result, the real needs get buried. In the booming 1950s, post-war happiness and security were the social norm, or at least the narrative of the social norm, and those who weren’t thriving obviously weren’t doing something right. I think Ida Lupino does a marvelous job of tapping into the dissatisfaction that can happen even in the midst of material or social success, where good intentions are present and yet crucial emotional needs can still go unspoken or unmet. In fact, the question of need is raised consistently throughout the film—whose needs are most important? Whose are justifiable? Whose should be prioritized? There’s no easy answer, but there is sympathy for each type of need and the kind of neglect that each character faces.
At the end of the film, as the bigamy case is being examined in court, Harry begs the judge not to debate the case any longer and plainly admits that he’s guilty. It’s a painful line to hear, because it’s true—he is a bigamist—but at the same time, his admission of guilt is, ironically, a sort of absolution, and Lupino leaves it at that. The final scene is ambiguous; Harry isn’t made to choose between one wife or another, just as the audience isn’t led to make a choice. We end with a tangled mess not too dissimilar from the one we had at the beginning, but the hope for positive momentum is at least present now after the matter is out in the open. You can’t solve a problem that you keep behind closed doors, even if those doors are surrounded by a nice 1950s white picket fence.",3.5

Much like that noir masterwork Lupino strips down everything to its bare essentials and simplistic structure - has all the hallmarks of a modern Lifetime movie but without the endless bloat or sense of falseness, every emotion here feels genuine and real and the film's ability to sympathise with every single character is easily its main selling point as to one of the reasons why it works so well.",4.0
"Absolutely wild that the writer/co-producer of this movie was currently married to the movie’s star Joan Fontaine at the time this was made, and that he was previously married to the film’s other star and DIRECTOR Ida Lupino. Old Hollywood was crazy. I don’t know how much that helped inform the quality of the work from all involved, but it seems like it must have, as The Bigamist is a pretty fascinating breakdown of how this event unfolds in a more naturalistic way that doesn’t try to simply paint the guy as an adulterer. Of course he is, and he’s a piece of shit, and I felt icky about some of the ways that the movie’s POV seemed to be trying to get us to empathize with him, but to a degree that feels like it’s part of the point.
This is a really difficult movie to unpack, with some things that I think made me feel intentionally uneasy and others that maybe weren’t so intentional, but the fact alone that a movie with these themes was made in 1953 is pretty astonishing. It’s a far more nuanced and multi-dimensional take on marriage and gender dynamics than the large majority of what movies are putting out today are. And Fontaine and Lupino both deliver fantastic performances. Edmond O’Brien ehhhhh not so much.

Joan Fontaine is someone whose fragile persona tends to get on my nerves, but here she's brilliant (although it surely helps that, unlike in Rebecca, she's playing an actual character with an actual personality). Edmond O'Brien is perfectly cast, bringing just the right amount of hangdog despair to a role that, ten or twenty years earlier, would probably have been cast with someone like Joel McCrea or Gary Cooper. I admit that I'm not a huge fan of films that hang their entire structure on an extended flashback, but that wasn't too much of a bother here, especially since the film's treatment of its central theme is so nuanced and mature. I particularly like the decision to emphasise how genuinely he loves both his wives, and therefore how sad it is that his scheme inevitably has to end.",4.0
"A well acted morality tale which dealt with a very taboo subject at the time. The story follows Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien), a ordinary man trying to start a family with his wife Eve (Joan Fontaine) when it is discovered that he is living a second life with another woman named Phyllis (Played by director Ida Lupino). Though it is pretty obvious how it will end, this film does deserve credit for it's ambiguous approach to dealing with the theme of adultery and instead tells a rather human story about how a man stuck between two women. You don't like Harry but as the film progresses it's easy to understand a lot of the choices he makes. The finale is well done, especially that final lingering shot of Eve watching Harry walk out of the courtroom.
The performances are excellent. Edmond O'Brien is fantastic as the Harry while Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino are great s the two women he is torn between. Edmund Gwenn also provides decent support.",3.5

Edmond O'Brien's shlubby travelling salesman is in a loving but childless marriage with Joan Fontaine, when he falls for waitress Ida Lupino. When he and Fontaine try to adopt the vetting process unearths his secret life.
Leaving aside the plausibility of that central idea of lupino and Fontaine both being into Edmond O'Brien it's a very interesting picture. Lupino is, as always, a unique screen presence, lacking some out and out star power but bringing verve and intelligence and a more modern sexiness than you would expect and an absolute knack for knowing dialogue. The idea of her being a waitress at a cheap chinese restaurant is maybe as big a leap as the central triangle but she is still a delight and her scenes with O'Brien do work. I loved their meeting on a hollywood tour bus and the injokes it throws in, none as good as the constant references to Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus.
Fontaine is a little under used but the film remains a genuinely interesting and largely unjudgemental look at a man caught in two relationships and it leaves me wanting to see more of Lupino's work.

"Here's to Ida Lupino, helping me kill two birds with one stone. Another noir crossed off the list, and I'm closer to my goal of watching 52 films directed by women this year.
Noir doesn't feel lile the best descriptor for this film, even though it ticks off several genre boxes. Maybe I'm too used to those films involving crimes far worse than living a double life and having two families. But the hook here is the very human drama, as Collier Young's script and the performances by Edmond O'Brien, Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine work very well together to draw us in to the emotion, with O'Brien carrying the load well. He makes Harry a sympathetic character, which I imagine was a tight rope to walk in those times, given his actions.
Behind the camera as well as in front of it, Lupino presents this study of marriage with an even hand, and shoots it in a way that adds tension right when it needs to (such as the great moment where Harry's lie is first discovered by Mr Jordan when the baby wails from the other room) and adds undercurrents of emotion to fill out its characters. Watch how Harry reacts to each of the women in his life suffering a trauma and how his responses impact those relationships moving forward. There's a lot of tragedy in these scenes.
On a lighter note, I smiled hard at the Miracle on 34th Street reference, with Edmund Gwenn playing such an important role in this film as well. He may be the best Santa of all time, but will he allow Harry onto the ""Nice List"" this year?
I loved the way this embraced the moral gray areas that noir really unlocks when done correctly. And, minor spoilers ahead, the way the last scene plays out is very strong. We may not know the extent of Harry's sentence by the time the credits roll, but the more important question is which woman will stick with him once he does his time. One walks out of the courtroom, potentially signifying that ties have been cut, while the other stays behind.

"TWO wives? In this economy?
Baller move by Ida to cast both her and Fontaine in light of their shared history with screenwriter, Collier Young. This is a bizarre little drama that takes great pains to empathize with our bigamist. Although, since the film is told almost exclusively from Harry’s point of view, perhaps it’s no surprise that he comes across as decent, even sympathetic. Eve and Phyllis’ telling of this story may sound very different from the film’s. Another reading is that Harry, feeling neglected and having his ego bruised by a wife with superior business acumen, finds refuge in someone vulnerable and lonely. In other words, Harry desperately needs to be needed, and he’s willing to risk jail time in order to meet that need. Anyway, whatever your reading, all of this is done with the utmost sensitivity to the three leads. 
Unclear what to make of the ambiguous ending with Harry being escorted out of the courtroom as Eve watches from the doorway, which makes The Bigamist an interesting film to wrestle with if not to watch.",3.5

"Seen as part of 52 Films by Women.
This was so watchable. I know it’s pretty short already, but I was kind of tired when I started last night and still had to watch through the end in one sitting.
This is worth watching on its own for the bizarreness of producer/co-writer Collier Young putting together a script where his ex-wife (director Ida Lupino) plays the other woman to his then-current wife (Joan Fontaine). Given that and how the script at times does make you want to feel that Edmond O’Brien’s Harrison/Harry Graham is just too nice for his own good, you may think this is an apologia for adultery. And … it’s actually not. Sometimes I felt like it was, or at least a defense of Harry’s behavior, but to be honest I think the film talks enough about how a lot of Harry’s actions come out of cowardice as much as not wanting to hurt either women that I don’t think one should come away with “He’s just a poor good guy” conclusion.
Still, after the kind of preachiness of Not Wanted and Never Fear, it is nice to see Ida Lupino tackle some more even-handed material. And what’s really great is that there’s no “good woman” and “bad woman” in this movie. You could argue that the film does kind of look down on working women given that Harry seems so hard on Fontaine’s Eve for taking to the business, but he also admires her for it and he keeps making bad decisions after she does the traditionally feminine things like agree to adopt a baby and take time off to care for her sick family. Also, Lupino’s Phyllis works as well and values her independence and tough veneer. They’re both victims but not doormats, and that’s pretty awesome.

C’est en quelque sorte la version « film noir » du Bonheur de Agnès Varda.,4.0
"On the surface, Ida Lupino's The Bigamist turns a controversial social issue into an uncharacteristic film noir. Underneath, however, Lupino has constructed an especially brilliant layering of perspectives.
A common trope of noir cinema, The Bigamist is told non-linearly, specifically through an extended flashback narrated by the titular character. Like many adulterers, Harry Graham's recounting of his infidelities seeks sympathy through self-criticism and attempts at justification. The flashbacks - as a representation of Harry's memory of the events - represent that attitude, treating him as a lonesome loser and depicting the women he's in relationships with as cluelessly in love with him. Lupino seems to be showing us one thing - Harry's version - only to give us a counter narrative in the body language and omissions in the narrative, however. Think of the phone call between Harry and Eve, where he admits he went to dinner with a ""mousey"" other woman; Edmond O'Brien delivers the news matter-of-factly and Eve's dialog treats it as a joke. However, Joan Fontaine's performance - no doubt shaped with Lupino's help - suggests that she knows it's not a joke and is choosing not to engage. In this way, Lupino is giving us both Harry's version (""Hey, it's no problem! I told my wife and she didn't raise a fuss"") and, subtextually, Eve's version (""I'm a woman in the fifties who knows her husband is cheating, but cannot say anything for fear of reprisal"").
In a Classic Hollywood system where the female perspective would have been deemed financially unviable, Lupino manages to deliver both a male-centric film (Harry's unreliable narration) and the experience of women in the fifties dealing with a patriarchal system. Though not stated outright, both Eve and Phyllis can be read as sticking with Harry (who would want to be with this lump of a man without good reason?) for ulterior purposes: Eve is profiting off of the business (she's better at it than Harry) and Phyllis - a struggling waitress-cum-single-mother - is looking for financial support.
The heavy shadows of noir cinema only really come in once the film descends into Harry's flashback, separating it from the present; it looks like a movie Harry would have seen at the time (and set in Hollywood), suggesting his own fictionally-tinged remembrance of the events. Lupino even drops in a few meta-references to Edmund Gwenn's - co-starring in this film as an adoption agent - role as Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street, breaking the illusion and calling attention to the manufactured nature of Harry's narration. The film may be giving us his perspective, but, if you read between the lines, Lupino is showing us his delusion through the unspoken responses of the female characters.

Less noir ruthlessness, more empathy and nuance than I was expecting, coming from a film called THE BIGAMIST. Both women are just magnificent here—and you know that means Ida Lupino gives a resonant performance, in order to compete with my all-consuming adoration for Joan Fontaine.",4.0
"It's an interesting film to look at. It's a noir in some ways but not in others. Or at least, not in ways that I'm used to. On one hand, it's easy to dismiss the film for involving a protagonist who deserves no sympathy because he cheated on his wife, and because the whole film is self-explained via the title. But there's also a struggle in the film, a quiet struggle, that adds a level of engagement I can't quite put my finger on.
- One thing I noticed about Eve and Phyllis is that they both have a mature, wry sense of humor. A cold outlook on life. When Harry calls Eve after his first outing with Phyllis, he truthfully reveals that he was with another woman the whole day. And Phyllis plays along with him, completely comfortable with the joke. The idea that her husband could propose such an idea to her doesn't upset her, instead she turns to dark humor. Phyllis as well puts up a wall against Harry, critiquing his pick-up methods when they first meet, completely aware of what men try to do with women when they are lonely.
-- Despite being two strong-willed, insightful women, Phyllis still falls for Harry, and Eve lingers on in the courtroom after Harry's trial (where the movie ends). Despite their fronts, these women seem to be just as lonely as Harry. Or at least, capable of possessing such loneliness.
- That's why the film makes it hard to completely fault Harry for his ill-decision making. Though the film, in noir fashion, depicts the fragile male ego in a post-war era of rising female competence, the film also depicts these women in a way that attempts to detail the complex nature of this competence. Neither Eve nor Phyllis are femme fatales, scheming to have their way. They possess wit and wariness around men, yet are imperfect.
In other words, Harry is a typical noir male character, an in that way unremarkable. But what director/star Ida Lupino has done here is show a more complex view of the post-war woman in a noir environment. Maybe that's why the plot is so unremarkable, with little surprises. The plot gives way to noir themes, but does not take the focus away from the women trying to navigate a world of sensitive, bruised male egos.
- I also want to remark, that there are quite a few instances in the film where men attempt to disturb a woman's work productivity. Such as on of Harry's female co-workers being CONTINUOUSLY coerced with an afternoon shot by a male co-worker, even after she DECLINES NUMEROUS TIMES. The sabotage is uncomfortable. What's even more interesting is that, though Eve begins working for Harry as a secretary, and begins to make more money for both of them than he ever did on his own, she still never tries to surpass him. She is aware of her role as his wife and secretary, and genuinely does not wish to stray to far out of these bounds - being a successful businesswoman, as a worker under her husband, is only an extension for her as a dutiful wife.
The Bigamist is just really fascinating and produces some emotions that reveal a complex post-war environment. It's a weird noir but it's focus on human female characters make it an important one to note.",3.5

This is such a special, nuanced look at loneliness. All three corners of this triangle are given equal understanding and weight to their characters. Something I think could have only happened with Ida Lupino. You might have a few other directors working at this time to give such a humane gaze to this story without sensationalizing it, but Lupino is the juice both in front of and behind the camera.

"Ida Lupino directs herself, Joan Fontaine, Edmond O'Brien and Edmund Gwenn in The Bigamist, a gripping noir that wrestles openly and honestly with themes considered taboo at the time. One of the smartest elements of Lupino's films is its ambiguous, grey-area morality, avoiding harsh condemnation of O'Brien's character despite the circumstances in which he finds himself. Perhaps this is because the script was written by Collier Young, who in real life divorced Lupino and left her for Fontaine. It was quite bold of Lupino to direct such a film, but her personal connection to the material provides it with an immediacy that can't be faked, particularly in the knockout of a courtroom climax. The acting is superb across the board, with Lupino herself shining the brightest.",4.0

Finally, I can say that I truly thought this was a great film. Once more, there is a raw sensitivity to Lupino's direction that wasn't often in Hollywood features. She never painted any of the major characters as one note, and gave us reasons to like all of them, aided by the fact that all three (and Edmund Gwenn) deliver great performances. Wonderfully presented as well, The Bigamist was a satisfying ending to my box set and I can't wait to find her other movies.",4.0

"This 1953 film from Ida Lupino is one that is ahead of its time in its portrayal of relationships and the subject matter presented. Edmund O' Brien is perfect in portraying a man who is taken down by loneliness and tries to find a cure to his situation. Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino give amazing performances as Eve Graham and Phyllis Martin respectively. Edmund Gwenn provides a solid performance as Mr Jordan, the character whom the audience follows the story through. One of the things I love about this film is how it never chooses a side and each character is treated with empathy. The film manages to be quick, precise and tense within its 80 minute runtime.",5.0
"The Bigamist relata el drama de un hombre casado que se enamora de otra mujer. Pero Ida Lupino comprende que lo importante no es el contenido (el qué), sino la forma (el cómo) y nos brinda una película profunda.

Le desprecio y le compadezco. No quiero estrechar su mano y casi le deseo suerte"". El film no demoniza la infidelidad, sino que nos hace empatizar con Harry (y también con las dos esposas) teniendo en cuenta que uno no elige de quién enamorarse.",4.5

"As thrilling as there can be of a marital melodrama, viewed through the lens of film noir. Lots of sheer star power with Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino herself, and the final scene with Jordan sums it up: “I despise you but I pity you. I don’t even want to shake your hand, but I almost wish you luck.” Great, sensitively emotional stuff. I ached for him as he spiraled more and more.

"What’s clear about Lupino was that not only was she attempting to break the gender barrier in cinema from a who gets to do what, she also was interested in subverting the melodramatic form. In the hands of other Directors this film would end much differently, not as complicated with the central character not redeemed and everything seemingly unsolvable, it is what it is. It breaks a trend that was popular of the period of the lead character needing to figure out the dilemma in a way that gives some positive closure, the closure here is that he failed, and society will punish him for it and none of the people involved will receive anything of worth from the whole ordeal. It’s an honest picture in a time that didn’t value it. Another example why Lupino was so important beyond her gender.",4.0

"The greatest aspect of the film is how Lupino stresses the fact that there's lot in stake here and it's not as simple as it may seem. She tries to portray these characters as tenderly yet as objectively as she can so that we could make our own decisions. The cinematic language doesn't seem to do a lot to emphasize the points and that is where the film probably suffers the most. Though there's one point where it sticks out: even if the speech at the end might feel too straightforward (there's similar but not this direct pieces of monologue all over) and preachy, Lupino does great job suggesting with only image and silence (though music is playing but it feels as if we don't hear it) that there's actually no conclusion. It is clear that everyone suffers but who eventually did get hurt the most?",3.0
"Its interesting how passive a character Edmond O'Brien plays here. Lupino is often criticized for the passivity of her female leads, but her male leads can be just as passive. It makes one think that she was just particularly fascinated by how ordinary unassertive people are affected by the forces of life around them.
O'Brien seems unable to choose between Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino (the real-life contemporary wife and ex-wife of the producer/writer of this film, Collier Young, respectively) who both represent different paths in his life at this stage. Its pretty unique to watch a man with two families just sort of bumble through life and hope nobody finds out about them, and hating himself all the while. He never really makes a decision, life just keeps getting far enough along that life makes choices for him. Which, of course, is a type of decision all itself.
Really enjoyed the ambiguity and performances here. Also, the meta meet-cute where Lupino and O'Brien bump into each other on a Hollywood bus tour of the homes of famous stars like Barbara Stanwyck and Jimmy Stewart is absolutely adorable.",3.5

The secret to Lupino's magic is that she doesn't pass judgment on any of these characters, even the ineffectual and cowardly Harry. The thing is, none of them are bad people. There's no antagonists and no portrayals of evil. Instead, everybody here is just a little broken, and it ends up bringing hurt and pain to all involved.
Also, that framing of Harry's picture frame next to the phone as Eve receives the news of his double life is absolutely heartbreaking. The pain on her face sharing a frame with a reminder of their once-blissful marriage.",5.0

"When it comes to the conversation regarding trailblazers for women in Hollywood, Ida Lupino should be omnipresent, she was the first woman to direct a noir film and just direct in general, and tackled social issues in her films, with this one, a taboo form of marriage.
Featuring some lovely cinematography of the sloping streets of San Francisco, this subtlety noir-tinged melodrama is heavily narrated in flashback by the films protagonist, as he details how he wound up with two wives. It's an interesting way to show the ebb and flow of his relationships, falling out of one wife and falling in love with Lupino, and his growing fear as his double life nears total unmasking. Lupino gives the strongest performance undoubtedly, charming but vulnerable, which adds more weight to the lie her husband sells her from the day they meet.",3.5
"My second film seen by Ida Lupino and, while I wouldn't be able to call out directorial signatures or anything, I think it's striking how this film of hers also has a touch of thriller about itself and about how it presents the central conundrum of the man who has come to be living with two wives.
What's also apparent here, as in The Hitch-Hiker, is that there is no feeling of superiority or moral judgment made by the film but it very much advocates for trying to put oneself in the shoes of the eponymous bigamist and understand how he ended up in a situation he didn't actively seek out but felt compelled to stay in nonetheless.
The film manages to accomplish this by way of a very gripping emotion, one I'm personally drawn to very much as an introverted person, and that's loneliness. Harry Graham has a marriage that feels like a business relationship and while it's functioning, he longs for human touch and connection, for feeling something again you could say, and that's what makes the film particularly unique for its time as it turns gender tropes on its head and creates a vulnerable, likeable man instead of a hardened shell, directing his emotions inward.
I particularly love the way Harry Graham meets Phyllis, played by Ida Lupino, on a bus tour to see where the Hollywood stars live and how clumsy he is at picking her up, how compelled he feels to try regardless, and how enamored Phyllis slowly but surely becomes with him.",4.0
"part of my favorite films directed by women list
this is the fourth film i've seen from Ida Lupino, and with every film i watch from her i love her more and more. she was probably one of the best directors of her time, a time where female directors weren't very common, and i wish more people knew about her because i think she's really underrated.
i feel like there's something very feminine about her films, often centered around female characters and struggles (particularly in Not Wanted and The Trouble With Angels) that is so refreshing to see in older cinema.
what i liked about The Bigamist is that the film revolves more around the characters rather than the plot itself, and they're really well developed even with such a short runtime.
i will definitely be checking out the rest of her filmography very soon.",3.5
"Finally, after a long time being on my watchlist, I have the opportunity and take the initiative to dive into some of the work of the only female director I know of in the golden age noir genre. Ida Lupino, the famed actress turned director/screenwriter, paved the way for women working in the film industry, and she did it rather prolifically. The Bigamist is one of her more domestic “noir type” stories, showing the complicated depth of domestic and women’s lives.
The major shining element of this film is the radically progressive story for its time, a story that its hard to imagine being produced in a moderate studio post Hayes code Hollywood. The ideas that it puts forward about marriage, monogamy, love, affection, desire, and all of the complexities of it are incredibly radical for 1950’s America. What is even more radical, is that although the trailer set up of “a detective discovers that a man has another wife and child from his wife” seems extremely accusatory and villainous, the film does not portray the events that way at all. Rather the man in question is given a platform to explain and dissect all of the nuanced complexities of his feelings and actions, both good and bad, why he did the things he did, and what he feels about them. He is seen showing intense emotion, intense vulnerability in times of need, as are many other characters. The most incredibly progressive part of the story is the ending, which I will not spoil for those who want to watch it, but it does not seem like a film written and made at this time should be allowed to end in such a way. 
After talking all about how incredibly interesting and progressive the plot of the film is, the reality is that it just isn’t that amazing of a film in itself. Conceptually it is there, but the way it is executed its not too impressive. Visually there isn’t much interesting, the score is pretty standard, the dialogue has its moments of being lovable and funny (particularly with Harry and Phyl's banter) but a lot of it is narration which gets kind of repetitive. Unfortunately this brings it all down a bit. (I think it’s important to note that this is one of the films that while she directed it on her own and starred in it, she did not write the screenplay. I also wonder just what kind of films she could have been able to make 20 years down the line, perhaps if she had had full creative power over decisions. Who knows.) The last aspect that I felt did shine through were the lead performances, from all four members of the cast, but particularly Joan Fontaine as Eve Graham. She did a really amazing job and I wish she had been in more of the movie. 
(Also side note: the running gag that Mr. Jordan looked like Santa Claus, played by Edmund Gwenn the man who famously portrayed Santa in Miracle on 34th Street, was hilarious. Strange thing to include but it was good. Especially when I’m the flashback scene they recognize that within the universe of the movie Edmund Gwenn played Santa in Miracle on 34th Street on the Hollywood house bus tour, and Harry says it’s one of his favorites.)",3.5
"Soooooo.....a dude cheats on his wife, impregnates a woman, then lies about it and we have to feel bad about him?

I appreciate Ida Lupino as a director. She is of course one of the first successful female directors and paved the way for her successors. She has a way of tackling taboo subject matter, similar to like a Samuel Fueller. I think those two would make for a very great double feature.
What I like about this film is Lupino's ability to make a complex character who you feel somewhat sorry for despite his hurtful acts. It's a fine line to walk across for 80 minutes and she does it very skillfully. The acting is really good as well.
This film for me doesn't ever reach a boiling point. Or any great climax. I wish that we would've seen that, especially since the main character is being so torn in half by his mistakes. I wish that element was emphasized in some way a bit more.
Still, this is definitely worth a watch and pretty good overall.
Double Feature Suggestion: The Bigamist / The Naked Kiss",3.5
"An interesting film with some unique insights and a broader view of morality than most films of the period. It’s quite limited and I wasn’t that enamoured with tele characters but it’s telling that female directors often make the most perceptive films about masculinity (though this is but one facet of a wider film). Thinking about it, it’s probably because women have to consistently deal with masculinity while most men never really grapple with it.",3.0
"“Hay ironía en este caso. Trágica ironía”.
Del título y la temática podría esperarse una película exploitation con toda una serie de detalles escandalosos a lo Glen or Glenda (que no hubiera estado nada mal), pero el enfoque no es ese en absoluto. Y lo más interesante tal vez sea, justamente, el modo. Cómo rehúye tanto la comedia absurda como el drama sensacionalista y adopta una narración de tipo más bien naturalista, como el drama de un hombre corriente, eventualmente capaz de sucederle a cualquiera en su lugar. De hecho, la película no es más que una explicación minuciosa, por medio de flashbacks, de cómo algo tan peculiar puede ocurrir. Y es menos la historia de un hombre de moralidad dudosa que de un pusilánime. “No consigo definir lo que siento por usted. Lo desprecio y lo compadezco. Ni siquiera quiero darle la mano y, sin embargo, casi le deseo suerte”. Las palabras que el empleado de la agencia de adopción le dedica al protagonista, después de actuar como detective y desmantelar el engaño, podrían sintetizar la relación del espectador con el personaje. De la misma manera que el discurso final del juez previo a la sentencia podría reproducir el balance que la película se imagina por parte de un espectador algo atónito ante las acciones del bígamo, aprovechando el momento para darle una lección que a nadie se le ocurriría necesaria sobre decencia y leyes morales. Pero “hay muchos más matrimonios bígamos de lo que nos imaginamos”.
PD: Hay una bonita escena de un paseo en un micro turístico por Hollywood en la que el personaje de Lupino no podría mostrarse menos interesado por todo el lujo y el espectáculo de las estrellas. No podemos dejar de sentir que algo de eso hay en la aproximación que elige para contar esta historia.",3.5

"Ida Lupino from the director’s chair lets Ed O’Brien hoist himself with his own petard; gently telling this story of the fine mess he gets himself into; aka plain old fashioned adultery. You might get the impression that he’s going to get away with it in a way reminiscent of Le bonheur. Joan Fontaine is refreshingly able in a manner I haven’t seen before and it’s the strength of the two ladies, which Lupino allows to abrade against, perhaps, O’Brien’s natural charisma as a nice chap. The noir element to an otherwise straight melodrama is the slightly bloodthirsty desire for this man to severely get his comeuppance. The fifties seem more connected to the worlds of Mill on the Floss or Tess, where scandal gathers pace downhill and dumps on the female, somehow missing the bloke. Victorian values haven’t changed much at all and it’s a man’s world.
A touch of class in a really unusual detective role for Edmund Gwenn, who articulates the cleft stick position of the Bigamist- difficult to spoil a title isn’t it- and adds to the suspicion that O’Brien is going to slip this noose; Gwenn thinks he’s a slime ball but feels sorry for the state he’s gotten into. Lupino lets the boys be boys; and lets the audience make up their own mind. In other words if your dumb enough to think O’Brien isn’t a complete git then Lupino lets you rot in your own misery of stupid; Lupino knowing men well enough to know any excuse will do.",3.5
"Edmond O'Brien and Joan Fontaine play a seemingly happy couple save for one thing, they don't have a kid and Fontaine's character is infertile. They try to adopt a child from Edmund Gwenn, who plays some kind of adoption agency person. Gwenn has a feeling that something isn't quite right with O'Brien and does some digging.
Turns out O'Brien's character has another wife (Ida Lupino) and kid in LA. We get the backstory as he takes Gwenn through the circumstances that led to this situation.
It's an interesting movie, not quite a film noir and not really a woman's picture either. None of the three leads are young by 1953 standards (Lupino was 35; Fontaine 36; O'Brien 38). Lupino isn't some hussy. She's a lonely, interesting, intelligent woman. Fontaine isn't a shrewish wife; she's struggling with her own feelings of inadequacy. And O'Brien isn't a heel. He's legitimately in love with both women and not willing to hurt the other by making a clean break.

"Ida Lupino was so fucking awesome.
I'm finally checking out her directorial work (besides her assistance on Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground), and I have to say I am really impressed so far! I started with the dark and kind of shockingly grounded The Hitch-Hiker, which was a great early true crime flick that plays out with surprisingly dramatic, emotional depth. On the flipside, going into The Bigamist I did not expect a 1950s family drama to be drenched in noir-ish overtones or propelled by genre picture suspense. This is such a forward-thinking, innovative movie as far as its story goes, full of emotional and moral complexity on the subjects of love, romantic relationships, personal fulfillment, and the psychological nuances of human connection. But Ida Lupino brings The Bigamist together with a nearly experimental combination of humanistic observation and crime drama stylings, all adding up to a fascinating and utterly engaging experience.",4.5
"This movie getting meta about Edmund Gwenn's unforgettable performance as Santa Claus not once but twice was truly amazing.
The Bigamist is an effective and straightforward melodrama. The meat on its bones is definitively the oddity in the morality of its central character, in which he lets a very bad situation snowball out of control in the hopes of doing the right thing. As terrible a person as this dude is, there's a sort of earnest sincerity to his feelings - conveyed quite convincingly by Edmond O'Brien - which allows for a certain compassion for his character to form, despite his actions.
The best performance of the film, though, is of director Ida Lupino herself, who acts the heck out of Phyllis. Her touching portrayal of loneliness and that empty demeanor that slowly becomes more lively made her very sympathetic. And she directs this with a lot of flair, as well. Her staging is undeniably very cinematic. Especially in the more intimate romantic scenes, where the dance between the camera and the performers extrapolates the sentimentality quite exquisitely.
The Bigamist is a fine soap opera movie. Melodramatic and somber, with great focus on the feelings of the characters. The highlights are definitively O'Brien and Lupino's pitch-perfect double-duty.",3.5

Factor in that the dude gets a woman pregnant while his wife is unable to have children and they're in the process of adopting and then also factor in that he marries his now pregnant mistress and it's even more off putting and makes me not sympathize with him at all, a real issue given that he's the protagonist.
I did really like the ambiguity and that the women in particular were well developed and felt like real people as well as no one being made to be the bad guy even if the guy himself was bad for what he did there was a certain amount of empathy extended that was unusual for the time. I also liked all of the actors with Ida Lupino pulling double duty as star and director and she did a better than average job at both, I wish Joan Fontaine was given more to do as she seemed very interesting in helping to run an insurance business with her husband but it kept cutting away from her just when I thought it would start delving into her as a person. I'll also add that Edmond O'Brien's Harry was dull as hell and how he got one, let alone two women to fall for his Humphrey Bogart impersonator looking ass (and not a good one) I'll never know.
Overall the whole thing fell flat for me as a film even if I could appreciate how ahead of its time it was in so many respects.

"I have had this in my watch list since 2019 and was finally in the mood to give it a go. Ida Lupino is outstanding as a director and knows exactly how to bring characters to life. Lupino also delivers an exceptional performance as she so often does. Joan Fontaine as well is a standout making you feel for her not long after meeting her especially knowing what will unfold. The only thing I disliked was the fact Edmond O’Brien, The Bigamist, is kinda painted in a sympathetic light which I honestly don’t think he deserves.",3.0

"""I can't figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.""
Edmund Gwenn's Mr. Jordan might not be able to figure out his feelings towards Edmond O'Brien's Harry Graham, but the film certainly can. The Bigamist is a startlingly sympathetic piece of work: Graham's actions are clearly illegal and the film doesn't shy away from the very real pain his actions have on his wives, but the script and O'Brien turn him into a complex, guilt-ridden, likable protagonist. O'Brien's not the only great performance in the film, too -- the reverberating violence of his actions is felt especially sharply thanks to the strong performances from Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino.
Lupino, of course, also directed The Bigamist, which makes this, I imagine, the first time a woman directed and starred in the same film. This same year, she also directed The Hitch-Hiker, a tightly wound thriller and a markedly different kind of movie from The Bigamist (plus with a more effective Edmond O'Brien performance). Both films make it clear that Lupino was a master filmmaker, and one of the very best of her time. Her performance is wonderful, too: luminous and charming and brittle.
This is a great, great film from an undersung American titan. I can't wait to revisit it.",4.5
"I never could understand bigamy, or the fact that it’s happened even way before the 50s. It must be exhausting to live a double life. I imagine that these days it’s probably easier to get caught.

"An interesting and well-crafted sentimental drama, which manages to show without moralism but rather with strong empathy the involuntary cruelty of the male protagonist and the subtle and never recognized sexism that drives his actions, always motivated by an apparent good faith.

"Love - the wrong Way.
A moving piece about love and its many forms. There are probably movies that tackle the themes of loving multiple people, cheating, deciding between families, being torn in the pursuit of love, better. ""The Bigamist"" derives its watching value mainly from two points:
1. Ida Lupino as a frontrunner of female cinema and a powerful voice of the female vision in her movies. She excels both as a nuanced and powerful actress as well as a innovative and emotionally delicate director. One can not help but to adore how well she did in a male-dominated industry so early on.
2. Interesting but not convoluted story. To be clear, if you read the synopsis on LB, you know most of the stuff happening here. Still, the way of delivery, the character outline and good use of music and camera work create some quite suspenseful moments and some others that feel quite touching and intimate. Quite the accomplishment given the small scope and overall runtime of the movie and especially in regard to the small number of characters and the subjection of personality to purpose.
Not a masterpiece of the 1950s but a very interesting piece of film history. Only watch if you want to see a film that was an important step in female movie progress. Definetly see some Varda oder Akerman afterwards.",3.5

Eis que em 1953, a Ida Lupino, uma mulher, dirige um filme super ambíguo sobre traição e matrimônio, cuja narrativa mostra tanto o lado bom e ruim do protagonista, cuja encenação parece romantizar e ao mesmo tempo repreender o romance proibido, com uma atuação do Edmond O'Brien extremamente complexa em termos de personalidade.",3.5

"You want loaded? One female star is married to the guy who wrote and produced it. The other female star used to be married to him, and she's directing it. In the movie they play two women married to the same guy at the same time.
That's a lot of baggage for a movie that's also the first time any woman directed herself. However, it's really good! A pretty short character-building thing with a payoff, weighed down mainly by a sort of unmotivated non-linear structure with some cumbersome flashbacks.
Ida Lupino, making her second of 1953's cream of the crop films, outdoes The Hitch-Hiker very slightly with this story bigger in scope and packing more punch in the end. Her performance is a big part of why, and so is Joan Fontaine's, though the poster makes you hope for way more of them together than you get.",4.0

And every time, EVERY TIME, its with more nuance and complexity that their male contemporaries. 
The Bigamist is a film that begs for a simplistic interpretation. And Lupino refuses to give it one.",4.0
"The backstory to this film is just incredibly fascinating, and it's really kind of a miracle that it exists at all - because of the practical matters of Lupino herself making it, but also because the wild improbability that a film in 1953 would even tell the story it does. Regarding the backstory, I'll just quote from TCM's write-up:
""Imagine for a moment that you are a woman in a man's world: an actress turned director, with your own production company. Your company has overextended itself into unfamiliar territory, and its future rests on you. You assemble a bunch of Oscar®-winning actors and convince them to work for free, in exchange for a share of the profits. But those profits are in doubt, thanks to your decision to venture into self-distribution.
Now, let's say that your investors for this no-budget marvel have rejected every one of your story ideas save one: a story about a man with two wives. And just for toppers, let's imagine that you've cast yourself as one of these wives, and as the other woman you've brought in your own real-life rival in your own, very public, romantic entanglements.""
With the film itself, it's moreover something like a miracle that what could have been pushed toward the lurid and sensational is treated with such matter-of-factness, sensitivity, and even a kind of generous grace. Frequent noir figure Edmond O'Brien is married to Eve (Joan Fontaine), unhappily rather because of the gusto with which she's thrown herself into working for their deep-freeze business - and if that's not already hitting the nail a bit too closely on the head regarding her status as blonde ice queen, she's found to be infertile as well. And so he gets involved with the more sultry, mysterious, and emotionally real Phyllis (played with remarkable world-weariness by Lupino herself, like a character from an especially jaded noir - maybe Lupino's own The Hitch-Hiker - thrown into a staid domestic melodrama like a small bomb), their one night of passion producing a child, just as he's trying to adopt one with his wife.
And Lupino's remarkable feat here is treating this tabloid fodder with such restraint, asking essentially, what does a good man do in a situation that's largely the result, not of lust and desire, but merely of lonesomeness, boredom, and simply responding to an act of everyday kindness? As a judge says to our put upon hero, during the final segment's unfortunate moralizing grandstanding, ""I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck."" And the film's greatest strength (despite being at times perhaps too subdued in its telling) is that it's happy to exist in this inbetween area, rushing neither to heavy-handed condemnation nor implicitly condoning sensationalization. Just a man, neither good nor bad, and an unlucky situation. No one wins or triumphs, and no one's damned either, but we're all left like Eve at film's end, simply reflecting on the strangeness of what life can do, and pondering where some future judgment might be able to fall.",3.0
"""Did you think you could live this lie for a lifetime?""
For her final film in the director's chair for a decade, Ida Lupino casts herself as the ""other woman"" in the life of traveling freezer salesman Edmond O'Brien (re-upping from The Hitch-Hiker), who splits his time between San Francisco (where he's married to the barren Joan Fontaine) and Los Angeles (where he picks Lupino up during a moment of weakness). What's funny is that the whole thing unravels thanks to adoption agent Edmund Gwenn, whose scrupulous vetting process uncovers O'Brien's double life and whose most famous role (in Miracle of 34th Street) is explicitly referenced not once, but twice. (Fontaine even comes right out and says he ""looks like Santa Claus."") A curious choice.",0.0
"""I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet... I almost wish you luck.""
The plotting is clunky, the dialogue reinforces its themes too often, and only Lupino seems to really have a sense of how to craft a performance for this sort of film, but there's something very compelling about how the film resolutely avoids turning the eponymous character into a playboy. He's walked back from every obvious stereotype (e.g., he's a traveling salesman, but one who is overly attached to commitment).
Lupino's direction emphasizes frontality, so when we get a shot-reverse shot during a key conversation over two conversationalists' shoulders, it's a shocking break. So too, the final scene bounces from character to character in a full circle, having worked along two perpendicular axes as the scene builds. These quick cuts and odd spatial orientations give a few scenes a rhythm that contrasts strikingly with the theatrical staging of the majority of the film.",3.5
"An unfairly overlooked work, The Bigamist was likely cast aside for its self-serious take on taboo subjects, lacking the exploitative elements that the production companies and audiences of controversial pictures expected.
The direction is modest, building most interior scenes around simple staging, unassuming medium shots, and an often stationary camera. Close-ups, tracking shots, and dramatic camera angles are rare, infusing scenes with calculated meaning in their occasional challenges to formal expectations. Lupino's most consistently effective visual approach involves an unconventionally wide composition to introduce a new interior space. The camera then tracks in to isolate the film's subjects only after they've been established within a wider context. This approach omits the interruption of editing, allowing the camera's movement to shift the audience's proximity to the drama. The technique is responsible for the moving yet muted revelation of the truth to Fontaine. The camera keeps its distance, tracking in as her husband's lies are exposed on the telephone, then returning to its wide location to present Fontaine in a vacant loneliness.
Such confidence in these effective formal touches prove Lupino's talents behind the camera, but unfortunately there are a handful of bland scenes lacking breaks from conventional style. The conversations between the investigator and Harry are equally banal in content and form. This is a film about women, with Lupino and Fontaine both stealing scenes from O'Brien. There's something inherently subversive about Lupino's own role in the film. Allowing herself to be called ""not very beautiful"" and a ""funny little mouse,"" she's cast against Fontaine's conventional allure. The collision of reality and fiction must have been a gold mine for the tabloids as each had been married to writer Collier Young.
Despite the built-in exploitative potentials of Lupino's personal life, The Bigamist treats its tale of infidelity with a somber aesthetic and tone, avoiding simple moralistic judgments or sensationalized sexuality. Never fully committing to the limitations of noir or melodrama, Lupino employs the traits of both genres only as prescribed by the narrative. A noirish voice-over and a dreamy melodramatic score blend in an impressive example of genre mixing, resulting in a minor but memorable feature from the singular artist Lupino.",3.5
"The film is about a man (Edmond O’Brien) married to a woman/work partner (Joan Fontaine) who wants to adopt a child in San Francisco. He tells his story to an adoption agent who by investigating the life of the couple finds out that he has in fact a double life : not only he's married to another woman (Ida Lupino) in Los Angeles, but he's also a father of their child. Both women don't know the existence of this double life.
It's quite amusing to know that Ida Lupino (director and actress here) and Joan Fontaine actually had the same husband (but not at the same time, Joan Fontaine married Collier Young - the scriptwriter of the film - in 1952 a year after the divorce with Ida Lupino).
The bigamy isn't a subject very much explored, especially in the 50s, but here it seems Ida Lupino was more interested in how someone can be confined in one's life, and in the sentiments, loneliness, weakness & lies of each characters, which I found are here very well depicted.

"Considering the subject matter of this film, I was rather surprised to find that this was directed by a woman. On first inspection this film comes across as sympathetic to men like Harry, framing him in this, oh so terrible dilemma of not being able to chose between two beautiful women and can't help but stir feelings of contempt in the audience of it's director, especially the audience of 2021. It's also stylistically a noir piece, maintaining a dark and shady atmosphere throughout. 
So I pondered. Why exactly did Lupino create a domestic noir that aligns us with an unfaithful man? And my conclusion is that Lupino was parodying the unfaithful person. The strong noir persona of Harry is done ironically because, he is essentially weak. Weak in the fact that he wants what he can't have, and continues to juggle two lives that will inevitably crash, all because he doesn't have the balls to commit to one of them. The swagger of the noir aesthetic is purposefully unnatural to the plot and serves to juxtapose Harry's needs and desires. This is further reinforced by the director's own participation in unfaithfulness. She filed for divorce with her husband while pregnant with another man's child! 
So, my take on The Bigamist is that Ida Lupino was expressing shame for her own actions but portrays the shame as a result of a society that enforces monogamy and the need for reproduction. It exists as a critique and as a empathy story for the unfaithful. The last scene in the court room is my case and point - it is drenched in guilt. It's overwhelming. The judge looks down Harry, condemning him, while Harry gazes back; filled with pity, because he has lost everything. 
A good film from Ida Lupino.",3.5

"As I was watching this, I was wondering how it would have been perceived had the genders been reversed and instead would have had a woman involved with two men. It actually makes it better that this was directed by a woman, because I’m not sure how well it would have translated if directed by a man.
The male character’s explanation makes sense as he does tell his wife at the beginning that he’s met someone else. It was odd to me how she just seemed to brush him off when telling her that he’s met another woman. In his mind he seems at ease with pursuing the relationships because he’s tried to explain to each woman that the other exists. This movie shows that not all things are black and white in terms of morality, but when something skews towards being in the wrong, you just know.

"The Bigamist is refreshing, it’s nice to watch a noir movie which isn’t also a crime film, it may not be all guns and white collar crime, but that doesn’t mean it skimps on moral ambiguity and manipulation of the animalistic desires we try our best to suppress. Ultimately, I feel the issues start to show when the film gets into motion, mostly from our protagonist, who I find completely unsympathetic. It’s just too simple of a conflict to resolve, even to the point where the narrative starts with the conflict which motivated Harry's affair being almost resolved. But the simplicity is more than made up for in the performances, which are all classic noir, not in the classical sense of femme fatales and men leading double lives, but in the sense that our major players wear their emotions on their sleeve, yet are constantly trying to pull the wool over each other's eyes. Simple, to the point, but unique noir. Solid stuff.",3.0
"Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien) is a successful businessman but a bit of a schlub, married to Eve (Joan Fontaine), who seems to be the real talent behind their company. Eve's focus is on business until she decides the two should adopt a baby since she can't have a biological child.
There's a problem as Harry has already picked up Phyllis Martin (Ida Lupino, who directed the film) on a bus tour of Hollywood stars. He woos her even though she isn't initially interested. They fall in love, she gets pregnant and they marry - hence the name of the picture: The Bigamist.
This is considered the first sound film in which a woman directs herself. Lupino does a good job directing though it's obvious she wasn't given much of a budget.
She and Fontaine are good, O'Brien is fine though a step below the two women and there are some amusing inside jokes here that you'd appreciate if you're an old Hollywood fan.
It unfolds like a film noir, though it isn't one, with voiceovers and flashbacks largely telling the tale after we learn Harry is a bigamist fairly soon after the movie starts. If we didn't know, the title gives it away.",3.5

"The Bigamist was the riskiest picture Ida Lupino ever directed, financially and critically, and it only paid off in the latter. Along with her partner (and ex-husband, more on that in a minute) Collier Young, Lupino wrote and produced The Bigamist under her own production company The Filmakers (no typo) which had a distribution agreement with RKO, until that agreement fell through, leaving The Bigamist in a precarious state. They decided to self-distribute. To ensure the film had ample star power (aka market value), Lupino assembled an A list cast: Joan Fontaine, Edmond O'Brien, Edmund Gwenn, and Lupino herself. Joan Fontaine signed-on at the eleventh hour when Jane Greer dropped out, as a favor to her new husband, Collier Young. Yes, art really does imitate life, and this juicy tidbit came in handy for the film's publicity. Fontaine also agreed to star in the film on the condition that Lupino direct, which inadvertantly gave Ida Lupino the distinction of being the first American actress to direct and star in her own film. Both in front of and behind the camera, Ida Lupino handles the story with her signature directness, maturity, and sensitivity. Although the subject matter is notably salacious, it's never exploitative. There are no villians in this story, only victims; most ostensibly the two women (Fontaine and Lupino) who find themselves alienated by their mutual husband (O'Brien), but even he is treated with an empathy that is usually denied other film noir Joes. After WWII, men returned to America with new anxieties about the economic power of women; this is one of the tenets of film noir, but where other films might pitch this to a murderous climax, The Bigamist handles it in realer, more human terms: loneliness and its consequences.",4.5
"Apparently, The Bigamist holds a place in people's hearts, which is fascinating, as I'm sure 20 years ago it would have been regarded by most as an antiquated and moralist fable about a man who can be described as tragic at best (and a woman who stands an antagonist because of her infertility and threatening talent for business; that particular beat is moldy in comparison to Arzner - nay, Weber even!) --- alas, time moves in circles, not forward; while some of Lupino & Young's social dramas still deal with issues more or less taboo, and while some (even despite antiquated context) find areas in social structure that are still intriguing, others are more fully defined by their time and frankly I think The Bigamist falls into the latter category - the presupposition of the film is that marriage is an institution that cannot be broken (it's not a critique of marriage or monogamy but an examination of it; if it were a critique, it wouldn't have ended with a stern-but-benign judge laying down the cards) and the message of the film is that a) men whore around all the time so its wrong that the ones who ""care"" for their mistresses (i.e. provide them money and means) are punished b) a man is only guilty of ""one mistake"" if the other woman becomes pregnant and he marries her and c) naturally, the women themselves have no say in the matter, all providing they are ""decent"" of course, becase were the movie about white trash or people of color there'd be hell to pay... but indeed, amazingly, there is something to the film's suffocating moralism that has perhaps become chic today, when it often feels like people compete in who can act the most helpless even before a problem is formulated, at least as far as public sentiments go - but remember, there was no social media in 1953 so the sadsack bigamist O'Brien is doing his bigamy under the skies and with noone watching him; he is not ""haunted by loneliness"", he is unable to speak his mind and take responsiblity for his own actions and this baby behavior is protected, by ways of patriarchal laws (or, to quote the movie, ""the moral laws we live by""); with its underdeveloped psychology and maudlin sentiment I find it to be certainly one of Lupino's least rewarding films.

"Ida Lupino directs and co-stars in this emotionally charged melodrama which sees a man having an extra-marital affair which leads to him being married to two women at the same time. The story is told mostly through flashbacks after an adoption agent discovers the main characters infidelity.
The films central plot device, of the lead telling of his crime in flashback was a common one in this era of film noirs/melodramas, but here it is telling a different kind of crime; rather than it being a murder or theft, it is a crime of the heart.
Edmond O'Brien plays the lead character, Harry Graham, who plays his character with little charm or charisma, emphasising his characters cowardice. Joan Fontaine, as Harry's wife Eve, is bubbly and kind; Lupino, as the 'other woman' is hard and distant at first but eventually lets down his guard. The three main case are great in their roles, and it only helps to make Harry more detestable.
One thing that I did find really intriguing that I didn't realise until I did some research after the film is that it has a very interesting real world parallel. The producer of this film was Collier Young. He was married to Ida Lupino until 1951 and they divorced after she had an affair. In 1952, Collier married Joan Fontaine. This gives Lupino and Fontaines' characters an almost meta quality because of this personal history.",4.0

It has endless sympathy for the main male protaganist but I was surprised by the portrayal of the female characters mainly Fontaine who seems to be made the ""villian"" of the piece from the fact that she couldn't bare children which set the plot into effect. The man happens to be a victim of circumstance and there is nothing worse than lonliness.
This film shows how hard it was to buck a trend of a male dominated industry and social outlooks of that time in America. Although, Lupino bucked the trend by daring to make movies she couldn't quite go against the grain of social stigmas.",3.0
"Almost as a rule, I don’t like noir films. I respect their craft and influence, but quite frankly, I find them emotionally impenetrable. I don’t care about the characters which makes it hard to care about the mystery because I don’t care about whoever the macguffin is affecting. But The Bigamist skips right on past all that and instead locks a full scale melodrama into the structure of noir. The result is a film where the mystery is the people. It’s a film about what drives one to create a mystery in the first place, not the mystery itself.
This is a film that would be considered complex today, let alone when it was released in 1953. How many films have you seen that take one look at a cheating husband/wife/partner and immediately make them the bad guy? How many films genuinely approach the troubles in a marriage from a place of empathy? A place of understanding? Harry is a coward, sure, but at no point are you unclear on why he’s making the decision he’s making. The same goes for Eve and Phyllis. They’re both well rounded women with their own ideas for themselves. They have their independence and it’s that lack of need that leads Harry to feel isolated.
But even when Harry makes his bad decisions, the film doesn’t let the women off the hook either. It knows Harry is to blame for his infidelity, but he also makes genuine, vulnerable overtures to both women to be seen for who he is. He’s ignored. While there’s an argument to be made that this is the film “blaming women’s careers for men’s loneliness,” Lupino’s direction is far too nuanced for that reading alone. Eve and Phyllis have their own inner lives and their own concerns. They get wrapped up in that just as much as any other living breathing adult sometimes can. They’re only human. Harry makes a bad choice but there’s enough blame and ignorance to go around. Three people isolated in their own little worlds, bumping up against each other, never fully able to break through. 
It’s the type of film that the term “plays with audience sympathy” was created for. Structurally the film is rock solid in building out the see-sawing drama. Every character is so thoroughly drawn, every desire and goal is crystal clear. I really loved how it swapped the traditional gender dynamics to focus on Eve and Phyllis’ career and personal ambitions while taking Harry’s emotional turmoil seriously. I could write a novel about how much I adore that choice- both for the agency it gives Eve and Phyllis and for lack of credence traditionally given to men’s interior emotional lives on screen. So much of the latter is often reduced to a pained smile and a dismissive line, but Lupino and the writing team don’t flinch. They take the time to invest you in Harry’s conflicted emotions. They force you to look, even when it’s ugly. The entire film rests on that portrayal. 
It’s all pulled together by Lupino’s breathtaking direction. This is the directorial equivalent of winning a boxing match with both arms tied behind your back. Through finely tuned performances and character chemistry, she manages to make you care about: A) A cheating partner B) The relationship the cheating partner has with this new woman and C) The crumbling relationship with his wife who is moving on without him but also unreceptive to his attempts to fix things. Not only does Lupino masterfully juggle all of those sympathies simultaneously, she plays them like notes on a piano. Mixing and matching sympathies, not just on a whim or based on narrative needs, but in cohesive, emotionally sound arcs that crash desperately like waves on the rocks. 
My lone complaint is with the slight fumble in the back 1/3 of the film. Despite taking a while to get going, the film chugs along wonderfully through its brisk run time. But the occasions where it loses a slight bit of steam are the back sections that retread previous information with little gained. I understand it as a mirroring function within the script, but these scenes really bring down what’s an otherwise water-right narrative. The transition into the court room also feels jarring and almost unnecessary. It certainly feels like an explainer tacked on after a bad test screening.
All told, this is a film that really struck at my core. In trying to watch more older films the past year and a half, I’ve been amazed at how modern many of them tend to feel. The vocabulary, dress codes, and gender attitudes are all of their era- but the recognition of human behavior. Of how our needs and interpersonal troubles are still the same across generations.The Bigamist gets at those same essential truths, even (nearly) 70 years since its release.
Stray Notes:
-S/o to this review for helping me understand this film more clearly. 
-The sound of the baby crying is probably one of my favorite oh shit moments I’ve seen on screen in a long time. Caught me totally off guard, yet makes total sense. A perfect reveal.
-I was really torn on the visuals of this movie. Sections of it look straight out of a 50’s TV show, but then there’s other incredible shots like the one of Harry reflected in the building marble, or the close up of Harry and Phyllis dancing. 
-I spy with my little eye just a touch of the female gaze in certain sections of this film.
-This film packs A LOT into one hour and twenty minutes. Shorter than most comedies but still packs an insane punch.",0.0

DUDES SUCK AND IDA LUPINO ROCKS,0.0
"Ida Lupino directed and co-starred in this and I believe it made her the first woman to direct herself in a Hollywood production. This film and another that she directed, “The Hitchhiker” both were released in 1953. Both films starred Edmond O’Brien.
This film was shot in a tight and efficient way. But it was unusual in the way it depicted the subject of bigamy. There was no outright condemnation of the subject and it treated all three of the main characters in a somewhat sympathetic light. It could easily have veered in one direction or another.
Lupino was not above having some fun in the film. Edmund Gwenn plays a relevant role as someone investigating the backgrounds of potential parents of adoptees. As anyone who loves films knows, Gwenn portrayed Kris Kringle in “Miracle on 34th Street”.  So in a couple of scenes, people refer to him as Santa Claus. And in another scene, a couple is taking one of those bus sightseeing tours through Beverly Hills and as the bus driver is announcing the famous people who live in the houses, he points at one that Edmund Gwenn lives in.
Back to Lupino. As I watching this, I remember being struck watching “The Hitchhikker” and how dark and how noir it was. Watching this and recalling that film, it’s too bad that Lupino didn’t get an opportunity to make more films.",3.5

"- You know, we’ve been together seven hours and I still don’t know a thing about you, except that you’re the nicest stranger I ever met on a bus.
- Well I don’t know anything about you either. Let’s leave it that way, huh?
A traveling salesman, upset that his wife has doubled the company sales, pursues a several month's long affair leading to a child and a fake marriage. All while his wife is dealing with the pain of her infertility as well as sudden health issues in her family.

#9 for Noirvember, a marginally noir melodrama directed by (and starring) Ida Lupino.
The adoption investigator tells us how we're supposed to feel about our chump protagonist - ""I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck."" That's how we're supposed to feel. I just feel that the guy's an ass. He claims that he never looked at another woman before in his life, but as soon as he sets eyes on Ida Lupino's Phyllis he's immediately leering and jumping into her personal space, and conveniently not wearing a wedding ring. She pushes him off, repeatedly, but he keeps pursuing - this on the day his wife tells him her father is suddenly ill.
There's something else you should know about traveling salesmen.... They have very large expense accounts and frequently buy dinner for pretty girls they meet on buses.
Our chump disappears from his unknowing mistress's life for months, then when he shows up tries to kiss her and gets all snotty when she pulls away. ""Why didn't you want to see me?"" he asks, conveniently forgetting that he's the one who ghosted.
Just ugh.
Other than that - there's some nice noirish dialogue, though softened up a bit with a more realistic execution. There's some amusing 'homes of the Hollywood stars' footage cut into the bus tour scene. And the ending is impressively ambiguous. It's certainly aiming for a nuanced look at the situation, though that's undercut a bit by presenting most of the movie via self-absorbed flashbacks from our protagonist. Who, I'm not sure if it's clear or not, I don't like.",2.5

"You can't draw a perfectly straight line between Lupino's real life and that of her female characters, Phyllis and Eve, in THE BIGAMIST, but you can draw a squiggly one.
Lupino's second husband and ongoing business partner post-divorce, Collier Young, wrote the screenplay. Lupino directs and stars (the first woman to do so). Collier would later decide to self-distribute the picture under his & Lupino's indie outfit ""The Filmakers"". This proved disastrous, tanking the company, and inducing a 13 year directing hiatus for Ida.
It's totally insane that this film couldn't play enough theaters, get in front of enough eyes, to become a hit or at least turn a profit. What Ida does to the noir genre with this film is a perfect representation of why she's considered an auteur, a pioneer of independent filmmaking. Her complex takes on infidelity, morality, loneliness, seduction, empathy, desperation, and masculinity (woo buzzwords!) make me eager to revisit THE BIGAMIST again soon.

I find that Ida Lupino has managed to walk a fine line in this, neither praising nor condemning, but instead, quite simply, discussing what absolutely has and still does happen.

It’s a slow or more of a routine start then of course it begins to pick up...the three main characters are likable...but you have to question O’Brien’s character...I could understand trying to keep the hurt to a minimum...to use the expression; but he jumps out of the frying pan into the fire.",3.5

"A wholesome story about a cheating bastard? Ida Lupino playing around with the question of bigamy, framing it in a sense that paints it as nihilistic act out of loneliness but almost as an act of mercy for the three characters involved. Lupina as a duel threat writer-director is the best aspect of this experience. She's a scene stealer every time she's on screen. It's a low-budget, extremely short film but puts the morality of these characters on full-display here and it's easy to appreciate the depth of the story.
The ending to Harry Graham's (Edmund O' Brien) arc in the court room with Eva Graham played by the powerful Jane Fontaine and ""the other women"" (Ida) in the courtroom is a fantastic conclusion. It's drags early on developing this story, but the final act is something special.
Rating: 79",3.0
"Wow. Please hand it to Ida Lupino for making something this good out of something that shouldn’t have been. I really went into this expecting tawdry excess and condemnation of Edmund O’Brien’s character. What I got was a fairly nuanced story about a flawed person making bad decisions for somewhat understandable reasons and spending 85 minutes both scrambling to get out of a hole and digging it deeper each and every day. Yes, there is plenty to judge and feel superior to but the screenplay and Lupino’s direction refuses to let it be that black and white. You may not condone O’Brien’s behavior, but you will certainly feel his angst. All of it brought to a wonderfully ambiguous ending that affords all involved just a shred of dignity on which to continue their lives.",3.5

""The Bigamist"" non è un film su una semplice rivalità tra donne, quanto piuttosto un film sulla comprensione della loro condizione (anti-tetica) nella quale entrambe si trovano irrimediabilmente bloccate, psicologicamente parlando. La Lupino riesce a fondere noir e melodramma proprio per far prevalere la solitudine degli affetti e creare un film totalmente basato sul dualismo, dove gli elementi stilistici tipici del genere urbano (tra sequenze in piano sequenza in strada, tagli di luce espressionisti e campi lunghi con la metropoli e i grattacieli sullo sfondo) si fondono in modo intelligente con la staticità degli interni casalinghi di San Francisco, dove la regista smonta la propria estrosità per andare a creare delle inquadrature precise, radicali e quasi ""televisive"" (con uso insistito dei primi piani e finale ""sospeso"", in stile serial anni '50) che ben palesano la condizione costrittiva della donna all'interno delle mura casalinghe.",3.5

This film Is so noir that It seems a production from ten years earlier.
But then It flips everything again and you realize she's telling the story of this man through his words because She wants to talk about the woman She Is acting. And She does all this in such a subtle way, with such controlled and dimmed down performances from the actors, that It all becomes instantly heartfelt and real!
And what a nuanced view of an unfaithful man, what a complex and thus human idea of people!

It's tempting to laugh at a narrative which feels such pity for a man who found himself with two wives and one baby on the way, but how can I hate on Harry's self-pitying monologues when he is vulnerable enough to admit that his relationship with Phyllis was out of loneliness and a desire to be needed in order to fulfill what seems to him to be a quintessential part of the masculine experience?

"A surprisingly, perhaps even shockingly, sympathetic portrayal of the titular bigamist, especially when you factor in that it was directed by a woman. A landmark film as well, since it’s the first known instance of a woman directing herself in one made in the US. It’s a quiet, almost contemplative film, filled with lots of longing and sadness. There are glimmers of joy too, but Edmond O’Brien’s Harry/Harrison’s deep loneliness is the real centerpiece. Both Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine put in gripping performances as the women on either end of the betrayal and the script does a lot of work to show how such a thing could happen with the best of intentions. A final courtroom scene pulls everything together and contextualizes it, but there’s naturally no happy ending here.

"The summary for this movie is very deceiving: this isn’t about a woman finding her husband has another family, but rather about the crappy self-serving ways such a man might end up here — and by telling himself he meant well. It’s more nuanced than I expected, tbh. 
This still isn’t what I’d consider to be a great film, but it’s clear that Ida Lupino (a great actress who’s also great here) directs this as a way of sneaking an old pre-Code movie under the cracks. This applies the name and shame as the consequences the Code demands, but the guts of this thing feel notable in how lightly non-judgmental it is towards the central guy. 
Don’t get me wrong: the movie is clear that he sucks. But it’s sort of fascinating that it has a complex, pre-Code presentation of how a man — again, a weak one, who this doesn’t sympathize with — might end up there. How life might rope him into certain actions, and how his own weakness might land him in spaces that escalate. 
It’s easy to mistake this light touch for sympathy, but I think it’s Lupino exercising some empathy: he sucks, these guys suck, but isn’t it worth wandering through a tale of how they might find themselves in these worlds? That the women are clearly shown as suffering too doesn’t excuse any of it either. 
It’s a movie that only a woman could make, I think; a guy would make this feel self-serving. It dares to attempt a pre-Code examination of bigamy, and does so with some confidence. 
Did I love this? God, no. It’s still a touch too pat, the technical work too loose, and my own latent feelings still too bitter. I appreciated what it was trying to do, and I looooved Joan Fontaine here, but I’m not sure there’s a version of this that would do a ton for me.

"On August 5, 1948, Ida Lupino, one of the biggest, and really only major, female filmmakers in Hollywood at the time, married her second husband, Collier Young, a prominent producer at the time. As was, and still is to be fair, common in Hollywood, the marriage didn’t last long. Within three years, they were divorced. When they were divorced, Lupino was already two months pregnant with the child of her third husband. At around the same time, Joan Fontaine, one of the leading actresses of the time, was filing for divorce from her own second husband. Just a little over a year later, Fontaine and Young were remarried… to each other. It’s a strange little twisty affair that showcases the baffling nature of relationships among celebrities, but it’s noteworthy mostly because of what Young did with this whole set of circumstances.
Young went on to write The Bigamist, a film that was then directed by Lupino and starred both her and Fontaine. The only way this whole situation could get even crazier would be if Young had starred in the film as well. But regardless, the real life wild affair was translated to this equally wild film about a man caught between two women, both of whom he loves, or loved. But as sensational as the e story may be, the film never feels sensationalist. It would have been easy to go one of two routes with the film. The obvious would be to villainize Harry Graham, played by Edmond O’Brien, to simply present him as an obnoxious playboy only out for his own pleasure. Another route would have been to villainize instead Eve Graham, played by Fontaine, or Phyllis Martin, played by Lupino, to depict one of them as evil and holding him trapped and thus presenting the bigamy as an escape. Neither of these routes are actually taken, though both are played with in the film. And they’re played with going all three ways. That’s what makes this such a phenomenal movie, is just how well the film manages to flesh out all three characters in this affair, to make all three fully realized people. Fontaine gives a fantastic performance, one of her best, as Eve, the somewhat cold and distant first wife of Harry. The easy route would be to make her so distant and cold, so focused on her business, that she never thinks about Harry at all. That she’s self absorbed and absent. The film instead shows how her distance is born from grief, and that she does still love Harry, but she’s processing the fact that she can never have children. And when she moves past that, she warms up. Lupino, apart from being a brilliant director, also gives a fantastic performance here and perhaps the only tragedy of the film is we don’t get to see her in a scene beside Fontain where they interact at length. But putting that aside, it would have been easy to make her evil too. To have her be using Harry, for his money or status, and to try to trap him into marrying her. The film subverts that and even has her character outright say she wouldn’t do that. And so instead, we get a woman who’s had her heart broken and is afraid of becoming dependent on anyone, a woman who’s never had anything of her own and just wants her own happy life. It’s no surprise that Lupino makes her women so nuanced and layered of course though. But if the film were trying to showcase the idea of men taking advantage of women and to criticize the serial playboys of Hollywood, then it would have been easy to villainize Harry too. And in fact again, the film lints out how easy that would be, such as in the fantastic courtroom scene where the lawyer points out the hypocrisy in condemning Harry when society lets cheaters go by with nothing more than a wink. But it doesn’t condemn Harry. The film instead showcases how Harry got to where he is, showing why he cheated on the first place, sympathizing with his need for attention without condoning his affair and showing why he stays with both despite knowing it’s wrong. The film is careful in how it fleshes out all three characters, never taking a single side, and always allowing the thoughts of all three be clear enough to understand why they all do what they do.
Overall, this is a surprisingly layered film about a topic that has an easy villain to condemn. Harry’s an easy character to make hateable. But the film never goes there, instead choosing to make its whole cast intelligent and nuanced.
Favorite Line: “When a man, even with the best intentions, breaks the moral laws we live by, we really don’t need manmade laws to punish him. He’ll find out that the penalty of the court is always the smallest punishment.” - Judge (John Maxwell)
Favorite Scene: The Courtroom Scene. It’s not a long, drawn out trial, but there’s a lot to this scene. Every line, every exchange, seems very carefully handled. From the defense attorney’s words, as he points out the hypocrisy I mentioned earlier, to Harry’s self condemnation, the judge’s remarks about the case where he acknowledges Harry’s intentions but points out the moral failings and how he’s hurt the women he loves either way, every bit of dialogue is fantastic here. As too is every look. Between Harry and his wives and the only exchange his wives ever have with each other in the whole film. The look they give each other as they’re walking out of the courtroom. So much in that single look, conveyed perfectly by these two actresses. So much clearly drawn from their real life experiences as they acknowledge the hurt of having shared the same man.",4.5

The most compelling character is the prickly adoption agent portrayed by Edmund Gwenn--who is the subject of several in-jokes throughout the run of ""The Bigamist"". An odd and provocative mish-mash.",2.5
"A melodrama with a noir cast: Edmund O'Brien and Ida Lupino, who also directs. Here's a double whammy: female director directs story about male infidelity.
It works, the story is engrossing, the subtext is interesting: there's an obvious class analysis that is strong but subtle. It probes male psychology without moral judgement. 
The first woman is his business partner: they run a successful business selling refrigerators (hey, it's the 50's). On the other hand, his mistress is not as glamorous: she is a waitress who rents in a rooming house close to the Chinese restaurant where she works. He met her on a Beverly Hills tour bus. They discussed celebrity houses.
It's fun to see the husband gradually fall in love with the waitress. She plays hard to get, and it lights a fire under him. He succumbs to romantic clichés (dancing in a Tiki bar, walking her home). When she announces she's pregnant, he confesses that it makes him feel needed. 
The truth is that very few stories rationalize sexual impulse as random and chaotic. Men are not noble, they are animals with the compulsion to procreate. This character flaw doesn't deserve compassion.
So what can be said of these sad fools who cheat on their spouses and have panic attacks about it? They should stop wallowing in confusion, that's a submissive trait. 
Ida Lupino looks great, her understated, hesitant acting style belies a sharp intelligence. She plays the mistress, yet she also directs, and bears the child of the protagonist. That's a lot of accomplishments. That's who I'd pick if I had to choose only one girl.",3.0
"the best of both worlds is unsustainable. at a certain point, when you selfishly try to avoid hurting anyone, you end up hurting everyone. the bigamist is a tale of one unremarkable man’s extreme immaturity. a lack of communication and honesty on his part, justifying deception and infidelity, having a CHILD??? he’s a mfing sociopath… and yet you almost empathize with him. can you really be in love with two people at once? how do you choose? who are you responsible for? who are you responsible to? i wish there was more exploration of marriage vows and how each betrayed woman felt when they learned of the truth",4.0

"Stray phone notes I wrote watching Ida Lupino's The Bigamist:
• (During the first scene in which the married couple signs over permission to investigate every aspect of their lives) ""Hahaaaaa this is gonna be a real problem if either of them is secretly a bigamist.""
• Sort of the movie version of the ""me reaping / me sowing"" meme
• Spent the whole runtime wondering why it used a noir-y flashback structure explaining why this guy ended up a bigamist, rather than the IMO more dramatically fertile territory of three basically kind-hearted people forced into an untenable position by his passivity...
• ..Right up to the point where the truth comes out and the cops show up and I remember that bigamy is, like, an actual criminal offence for some reason and the hypodermic needle theory means the last half hour of the movie has to be him getting prosecuted.
• Speaking of which, some next-level nonsense court procedure in the final scene?? It's not a trial because Harry's clearly pleaded guilty, and it's not sentencing because we're told that'll be in a week, but for some reason both lawyers have gotten up and done some oral advocacy anyway? At what I presume is a criminal call-over (i.e. purely administrative) of some sort??
• Also very funny that this film features not one, but two authority figures effectively congratulating The Bigamist for being nuanced in its portrayal of the titular character.
• Lupino herself a lot of fun to watch, almost Allison Janney-ish persona. Only got 10 minutes into Not Wanted before accepting it was too late to start a movie, but hoping the goofy flashback ""how did I come to be [hot button social issue]"" structure is not gonna feature in all of these.",3.5
"Starts with a strange hook - the adoption agent is a curiously menacing PI. I waited for that tension to realize. By the end of Act I it was clear that wasn't the direction the film would take. The two women give empathetic performances, but the plot is a bit lifeless, so my attention drifted. The signs of the times - unnecessary frame story/narration, court room moralization/resolution - felt quaint. A weird topic, to be frank. Was secret bigamy common enough to warrant such a soft-hearted after-school special?",3.5
"“I liked movies, though I really didn’t care where Clark Gable lived.”
The Bigamist takes an interesting route in revealing the narrative, though one well worn in noir. Edmond O’Brien’s Harry Graham taking the adoption agency man through his path to infidelity is one of the most well distilled examples of an unreliable narrator I have come across; with everything presented as eminently reasonable, almost inevitable that such a put-upon man could make a mistake and fuck a lady he met on a bus and badgered until she’d let him buy her dinner. It was a one-time thing, but she got pregnant, he couldn’t just leave her alone. Isn’t he really noble for how he handled it?
Following this with a lamentation on how hurting someone you love by telling them the truth would be worse than compounding the lie is such a classic rationalisation of the unfaithful. Of course, the knowledge is not what causes the pain, but the act itself. Withholding knowledge isn’t to spare his wife pain, it’s to spare him from consequences. He even shirks the responsibility of telling his first wife what happened, leaving her to deal with the revelation on her own as he’s arrested.
The recasting of noir tropes onto a story of a man with two wives is such an interesting choice. The villain of the piece isn’t a murderer or a thief, but a liar and pathetic man, pining about being needed. It reframes the way that men in noir let situations spiral; it doesn’t always have to end in death, even when it does result in a crime of passion. Then the sleuth isn’t a hard-boiled gumshoe detective, it’s a friendly, amiable old man best known for playing Kris Kringle.
The ending is also rather compelling, opting for a more low key moralistic discussion rather than focusing on punishment for ill deeds.
I am definitely going to continue to seek out more Ida Lupino films, having really enjoyed both this and The Hitch-Hiker, though they don’t seem to be easy to find.",4.0
"What I love about this film is the genuine sympathy and empathy for the three main characters.

"A little reminder that I need to get a book about Ida Lupino one of these days. She had such a fascinating career.
This is not a Noir film as I had always expected but a drama with the occasional Noir style elements.
At the time this production must have been downright transgressive even within the limits of all the conservative Hollywood codes and studio rules. These days, with a distance of close to 70 years, it is very hard to fathom how it is best to be interpreted.
Several characters voice their opinion that the male character arouses diverse sets of opinions within them and it is true that Edmond O'Brien's character is neither a slimebag nor a hero or even sympathetical character.
In comparison to the two strong and confident women (one played by Lupino herself; the other could have easily have been turned into a caricature of an ambitious career woman), he is however, a spineless little weasel who genuinely doesn't deserve the love and attention bestowed upon him.

"A man (Edmund O’Brien) secretly married to two women (Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine) feels the pressure of his deceit. 
One thing I’ve noticed since getting the Criterion Channel is the relationship between film noir and melodrama, and how interchangeably the two genres are sometimes classified. Both IMDb and Wikipedia classify The Bigamist as a dramatic film noir, and the film is even included in the Encyclopedia of Film Noir. Now I’m far from a film scholar, but I tend to associate noir with gangsters and criminal activity like murder and heists, but that could admittedly be shortsighted of me, because The Bigamist is definitely a dark, heavy movie about a serious crime, which in this case happens to be bigamy. Plus the score definitely fit the noir genre, and like A LOT of noirs, most of the movie is told in flashback.
The most surprising thing about this movie is how sympathetic the movie makes its protagonist, Harry Graham. You actually feel kinda bad for him because he never actually set out to be married to two different women, and obviously cares about both them. It’s also quite surprising how delicate and nuanced a movie from 1953 handles such a serious subject matter and the sexual politics of the age. A classic noir might show a married man falling in love with another woman and then conspiring to murder his wife, plus this movie doesn’t do that. Harry hopes to maintain his secret double life long enough for the adoption process with Eve, his first wife (Fontaine), to be finalized and divorce her, so she’ll at least have her child while Harry starts a life with Phyllis (Lupino) and the child they had together. 
Anyway, all three actors are very good, especially Edmond O’Brien, and the movie is masterfully directed by Lupino. It might not be a traditional noir, but it’s still a taut, muscular, controlled movie, and definitely worth a watch to Criterion Channel subscribers before it leaves at the end of the month.",3.5
"“I can’t figure out my feelings toward you. I despise you, and I pity you. I don’t even want to shake your hand and yet...I almost wish you luck.” 

The above line is spoken by the gentle and puzzled Mr. Jordan, an investigator who, having uncovered the secret of a mild-mannered bigamist, Harry Graham, functions as both the conscience of this movie and as the viewer’s advocate. What an odd journey Harry, a traveling salesman, takes us on: Depressed about his imperfect marriage to Eve, he begins an affair with Phyllis that, through a series of unlikely circumstances, eventually becomes a second, simultaneous marriage. Throughout the film Harry has plenty of chances to stop his double life from snowballing — but he never does, instead passively choosing to let confusion and inertia deepen his dilemma. Mr. Jordan’s observation about Harry also describes this strange film’s great accomplishment: creating complex, even sympathetic, feelings for a man whose behavior is both despicable and pathetic.
Director Ida Lupino strikes this balance by getting perfect performances from her leads (and from herself, as Phyllis). As Eve, Joan Fontaine is vibrant, successful, and charismatic. Everyone likes her, including us, though she makes Harry feel overshadowed and left behind. Phyllis is witty and charming, never affecting quite enough hardness to hide her vulnerability, appealing to Harry’s need to be needed. Edmund O’brien, who is in almost every scene as Harry, does tormented resignation really well (see: his performance in D.O.A.) and manages, somehow, to keep us from giving up on him and hoping he’ll eventually do the right thing. (Mad Men obsessives take note: Don Draper is a direct descendant.) 
It’s a deceptively difficult act of filmmaking, but Lupino has a sure hand and we almost never feel the effort, except during the film’s late-inning attempts to tidy up Harry’s morality through exposition and unlikely turns of events. I’ll have to read more, though it feels to me like there are Hays code tensions at play, as if Lupino threw in a few rhetorically unambiguous scenes to keep the censors off the scent.
That aside, it’s a truly novel effort (and must have been even more striking in 1953). Applying her legendary noir auteurism, Lupino makes scenes of Harry talking on the phone or signing his name on a form as suspenseful and charged as any set piece in a detective or horror film. I suppose we could call it an emotional noir, showing us how hazardous — and natural — it is for people to see what they want, and willfully overlook what they don’t, in even the most intimate relationships.",4.0

"Lupino’s melodrama is capable and nervy, managing great empathy for all three points on the love triangle. It may be titled for Edmond O’Brien’s lead, but she ends on the women, both wounded, both survivors. 
On screen, Lupino’s strength is her blithe attitude, treating many lines as throwaways and letting her gaze and the context do the heavy lifting. Fontaine gets saddled with the cliche of the working woman who can’t balance her home life, and she has enough dignity to rise above it, mostly. She comes off as strong and canny.

Ida Lupino profundiza e indaga -y no responde- con ambiguedad el terreno de aquellos que rompen las reglas por motivo que sea y, lejos de juzgarlos, plasma la idea de los grises: sobre las conductas humanas, tanta certeza no hay.
Y el mejor acierto es no dar una respuesta clara, fiel al concepto de la película, permitiendo al espectador cerrar (o no) la misma o minimamente plantearse una situación así. Se revisiona la idea de la monogamia y no de manera crítica, sino desde un lugar libre, donde todos los personajes implicados tienen sus puntos válidos.

"Criterion Channel
It really says something about the lack of representation in past Hollywood films when its shocking to learn a film was directed by a woman, and to see an Asian American character with any lines at all who isn't being played by a white person or something. There is still a huge lack of women directors on the 1001 movies list as I've come to find while trying to complete it, that is something that definitely needs to be addressed.
Especially now that women are ""allowed"" to make movies and there is an insane amount of quality that still isn't being recognized just so another D.W. Griffith movie can be kept on for history's sake. I dunno, I prefer to enjoy my movies rather than watch racist trash for its historical significance.
What a great subject this is to do in a noir style, I'm not sure if it was taboo to talk about this kind of thing in the 50s, but I'm pretty confident it was just accepted that there was a lot of cheating going on. The Bigamist tries to differentiate cheating from what's going on here, and it raises some pretty interesting questions.",3.5

"A movie questioning the societal pressures to settle down with one person for the rest of your life, questioning whether monogamy is realistic, whether love can be shared equally among more than two people, almost being in support of polyamory. And it came out in 1953! Ida Lupino is one for the ages, never shying away from the hard topics. In The Bigamist she’s not necessarily making a direct comment on any one of these themes, rather she’s bringing them up and letting the audience judge how they feel for themselves. It’s quite the amazing film, one that is both heartwarming and soul-crushingly lonely. It was completely unpredictable the whole way through, and by the end I was quite sad. The ambiguity of the ending is really the icing on the cake here further cementing the fact that Ida Lupino is one of the greatest directors ever. She’s not a bad actress either.",0.0

There’s an early mystery set up in the beginning but once we find out he’s a bigamist (spoiler alert!) things get pretty boring.,2.0
"The only film that Ida Lupino directed that she herself starred in (making her the first female director to do so), The Bigamist is a deliberately ambigious, nuanced character study of a man defined by weakness, and however good one’s intentions may be, if they are founded on lies, only ill will come of it.
Lupino, already firmly a trailblazer in near every sense of the word, having become an independent filmmaker of her own devising, directs the film with her trademark focus on getting into the minds of the characters, as she tells the story of the weak-willed Harrison “Harry” Graham (Edmond O’Brien), a traveling salesman, who’s wife of eight years, Eve (Joan Fontaine), is incapable of having children, and while there is hope in the form of an adoption, the strain is there on the marriage, and so, while on one of his business trips, he meets the plain spoken Phyllis (Lupino), and not only has an affair with her, but one that results in pregnancy, and so Harry chooses to marry Phyllis, all while never mustering the true courage to come clean to either woman, until a determined social worker (Edmund Gwenn), discovers his secret.
Told as flashback, Lupino focuses strongly on getting into the mind of Harry, and while she provides him with an aura of sympathy and empathy towards his sense of ennui and general weak-willed nature, she never lets him off the metaphorical hook for his actions. Instead, she merely shows him as a man who is incapable of making a choice, and in the process, only makes the problems in his life worse, as his inability to come clean means that the two women only discover the truth by accident, and Lupino deliberately ends the film without a proper “Hollywood Ending”, but rather on a bitterly ambigious note, as Harry is off to jail, and the guilt he has to live with due to his spinelessness is now forever going to haunt him, as are it’s consequences, such as a child without a proper father, and an eight year marriage destroyed.
Edmond O’Brien, a staple character actor who’s projects ranged from The Barefoot Contessa to White Heat to Seven Days in May, plays the fragile, brittle Harry as a truly tragic, pathetic figure. O’Brien doesn’t beg for audience sympathies, nor does he try to magically absolve Harry of his actions, but rather protray him as the weak, guileless man who would get himself into such a situation, and then be only capable of digging himself deeper, due to his own lack of proper personal morality. The worst part is that he is not a malevolently uncaring man, but rather one who never properly thinks things through, and not unlike the protagonist of many a film noir, has countless moments to choose the higher road, only to collapse in the face of the moral challenge and potential consequences that facing his mistakes would make, which only makes the problem worse.
Joan Fontaine meanwhile plays Harry’s first wife, and one he’s been married to for eight years, the gentle Eve Graham, who has stood by Harry as he steadily built his business as a salesman, and even in spite of her proving barren, wishes to nevertheless be the best mom she can to the child she wishes to adopt. It’s a heartfelt, almost tragic performance, as we see her genuinely caring and giving herself to Harry, while we in the audience know he has another woman, and she is tragically unawares, which makes the increasing joy she feels about their adopted child almost viscerally painful.
Ida Lupino, who when directing preferred to remain strictly behind the camera, chooses to step in front of it this one time, and not only delivers a dynamic performance, but became the first woman to direct herself in a motion picture (predating Jodie Foster and her film Little Man Tate by a whopping thirty eight years). Lupino plays the plain spoken waitress Phyllis Martin, who Harry happens to meet on a bus ride, and due to a current cool period in Harry’s marriage to Eve, becomes a source of solace, as Phyllis is equally lonely, and seeks companionship as well, and soon becomes pregnant with Harry’s son. Lupino plays the role with a dignity and subtle strength that she always seems to embody when in front of the camera, as we see her genuine affection for Harry, and in the film’s final courtroom scene, her conflicted emotions as she tries to process the truth. It’s an honest, sincere performance throughout.
Edmund Gwenn meanwhile, best known as Santa Claus from the beloved classic Miracle on 34th Street, plays the stalwart and determined Mr. Jordan, a social worker tasked with doing background checks on would-be adopted parents, something he takes with great seriousness, even if his cleaning lady (an ever amusing Jane Darwell) thinks he takes it perhaps too seriously. Gwenn’s performance is supporting, but vital to the film, as he’s the first to spot the cracks in Harry’s facade, and eventually becomes an audience surrogate of source, expressing his mixture of sympathy and revulsion at Harry’s plight, all in a subtle, dignified manner.
George E. Diskant, who shot On Dangerous Ground, gives the film a plain spoken but effective look, working within the relatively small budget yet not stumbling into cheapness, instead keeping things straightforwards from a visual standpoint. Meanwhile, Leith Stevens gives us a sincerely emotive score, that captures Harry’s fear and sadness at his own pathetic nature, while also underlining the sense of tragedy that his actions enact.
A psychologically complex, strikingly ambigious film, The Bigamist doesn’t take it’s titular character and string them up to jeer, mock, or deride, but rather show the deeply human propensity towards failure and stumbling into foolish situations, and how a man’s lack of concrete moral fiber can only lead to tragedy and pain for all involved. It’s a human, empathetic film, and a true mark of Ida Lupino’s skills as a director.
5 out of 5 stars.",5.0
"Again Lupino uses a noir template to tell a story of a generally ignored social issue outside of the Hollywood mainstream. This time, she's mostly successful, though it's very difficult to empathize with her protagonist the way she wants us to. This is especially the case because the film's reason for its lead to cheat on his wife is her implied ""emasculation"" of him by being better at his job than he is. The ending pretty effortlessly merges a didactic treatise on looking at the complexities of bigamy and the complicated emotional entanglements of the affected parties that make any moral lesson more ambiguous than a typical Hollywood picture would allow. And this is where Lupino shines: not only can she present her characters devoid of the kind of easy good guy/bad guy delineations, she can sidestep the neat gift-wrapping the studio system demanded in her peak era, allowing her films to feel like a needed salve in an era of bows and spoonfed morality. I don't think the work here elevates the picture beyond its basic niche, but it's nevertheless an admirable addition to the cinematic landscape surrounding it.",3.0

"Reminded me a lot of Mad Men, but if Don Draper was less of a sociopath. A much more intelligent and sympathetic look at a man balancing two lives than I imagined it would be. 
The movie itself was in rough shape at times, with some of the frames during an important scene completely missing. Watchable, but still sometimes difficult to follow because of its condition.",3.0
"Typically i'm not a huge fan of stories that are structured like this, with the start of a build up, and then a long break into the whole backstory of the plot, and then back to the present to tie everything together. However Lupino manages to make this pretty entertaining throughout.
This is the look into the life of a man who ends up married to two different women in two different cities. This is discovered during the adoption investigation to discover if him and his first wife are suitable parents to have a child. The film uses the Adoption Agency investigator to cast judgment upon the man, but then provides a long backstory to be told from his perspective to perhaps earn some sympathy back for him.
This does tip over into some melodrama at times, and the dialogue leaves something to be desired during some key scenes, but competent direction keeps this interesting enough to enjoy.",3.5
"“You wanted to run roughshod over all of society’s rules”
Lupino conducts a masterclass in feminist meaning-layering here. If you read this film in a prototypical patriarchal lens, it’s an empathic examination of a noble failure of a man, telling his story of sympathetic intentions and plans gone awry. Seen from a more caustic, progressive point of view, you get an intricate depiction of toxic masculinity that always excuses itself from true responsibility, a portrait of man as coward. It’s amazing that these two readings don’t even push against each other that hard. And infused into it all is a deep belief in the corrupting power of capital over romance. I just wish that the movie had a bit more grain outside of that, a bit of joie de vivre to the proceedings, the way that Lupino’s The Hitch-hiker did.",3.5

"sorta whiffs the ending but otherwise a really beautifully rendered melodrama. lupino the director’s own attitude towards o’brien’s titular bigamist remains pleasingly nuanced throughout, eschewing easy moral condemnation in favor of an earnest exploration of petit bourgeois monogamy and its emotional discontents. at any rate, it’s really all a springboard for the situational complications that ensue, which as recounted to the adoption agency man, remain highly compelling and, dare i say, eventually quite heartbreaking despite the built-in luridness of it all. my favorite moment, small but immensely effective: phyllis and harry kissing on the stairs for the first time, the camera starting in a medium and then suddenly dollying out into a wide, both out of functional necessity (phyllis begins to walk up the stairs) but also to signify that the scope of both their worlds has suddenly expanded, perhaps irreversibly",4.0
"I too can relate to making $20,000 a year and being in love with Ida Lupino.",4.0
"There's some significant daring in Lupino's non-judgmental depiction of the three key players in this story of a traveling salesman with two wives in two California urban centers. Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien), the titular protagonist who, unbeknownst to his San Francisco wife Eve (Joan Fontaine)—with whom he's trying to adopt a child, the impetus for the background check that winds up unearthing the truth—has a second spouse in Los Angeles with whom he has a little baby already? Terrible behavior, surely, but as the provocative closing court sequence notes, turn Harry into a serial adulterer and observers would likely just smile and bemusedly shake their heads; if his only desire to ever stray from his wife involves love, though, it's 90 times worse! (Plus, Harry finds his masculinity threatened out-of-the-blue when Eve's natural gifts at his profession explode through upon her joining him to, ostensibly, run the book. Definitely not an excuse but it's evident Lupino thinks it's a viable partial explanation; Harry desperately wants somebody to take care of properly, at least within the contours of what that meant at the time.) And there's a clear restless loneliness present in all the players, albeit from different places; I liked how Phyllis (Lupino) introduces us to her place of employment and lifestyle (""Do you like Chinese food?"") and her initial meeting with Harry on the crowded bus, and the fact that Eve took to her job so quickly speaks volumes about her own dissatisfaction with the union, even if it's mostly unspoken and expected at the time. (Husband out at work, wife waits at home; there's some dialogue that's essentially subversive in its contempt for the fact that was the norm.) All this said, the conceptual and substantive richness here are somewhat drowned out by a mundane structural approach, which mostly involves a found-out Harry recounting his story in flashback form to the head of the adoption agency (Edmund Gwenn) who discovered his secret—it's a pretty banal way to tell such an explosive story (and as we know from the The Hitch-Hiker, Lupino can do explosive!), and it makes the extensive middle portion somewhat of a chore aside from some choice individual scenes. Perks back up at the end for the aforementioned court scene and the pull-no-punches ending and I love that this was told from a female perspective—even if it's ultimately a man's story, there are uncommonly clear eyes around it—but this could have been a fascinating classic. Instead, it's probing and insightful...and flawed. Rats.

"I'm coming up with a rule where directors should try out a cut of their film without a courtroom verdict scene before deciding the story really needs it.
I'm guessing the didacticism of the ending to The Bigamist was the result of some kind of studio compromise where spelling out the the moral -- even an ambivalent and nuanced one -- was necessary. It is a bummer to see the movie wrap up as it does, if only because I felt like the scene adds nothing Lupino doesn't already firmly, even deftly, establish.
You feel Lupino's sympathy for each character, even as you wonder whether the script means to shift some of the blame for Edmond O'Brien's transgressions to Joan Fontaine's ""bitterness"" about not being able to bear children, and her subsequent career focus. But as it plays, both through the roundly sympathetic performances and in Lupino's interest in how characters behave irrationally in the moment, The Bigamist is a successful feat of moralism without feeling overly didactic. Each character gets to make a the case for their complicated self, and each performance feels like a product of the actor's full-fledged commitment.
It's mostly a shrewd, smartly-directed character drama, which is why it's tempting to pretend like that final scene in the courtroom doesn't exist.",3.5

"A surprisingly nuanced depiction of love as a thing that is not so easily tamed by institutions, a thing that can morph and breathe and splinter, a thing that is destructive and life-giving, all at once. Ida Lupino doesn't do anything really distinctive with this formally, other than shoot with a real tenderness, a refusal to easily demonise these flawed, lonely people. If it ends before it really has the opportunity to confront its own ideas, that's a shame, but that fade out also saves the main man from simple condemnation - a coward, sure, but one driven by more than just simple lust. It helps that Lupino herself is magnificent, so charming and witty that it's so easy to fall in love with her alongside Edmond O'Brien. A real gem.",3.5
"Gloriously gutting; what credit due Lupino for this beautifully pitched piece, with all the wrenching emotion of Brief Encounter dressed up in noir trappings. The way she plays with the genre is fascinating; see how the manner in which she shoots herself and Fontaine works with the familiar framing device to give a slyly subversive perspective on noir's enigmatic troubled men. And yet there is such a depth of empathy here: Lupino's not one for moral absolutism, and in the sadly inevitable denouement of this marvellously difficult story there is only the terrible tragedy of lonely souls caught at the mercy of love's whims. I'm smitten.",4.0

"66/100
Starts out creaky, and a little more as one would expect from the tabloid title, with flat exposition delivered into tape recorders and Edmund Gwenn waddling/investigating the domestic crisis as an overdetermined score plays. Once the framing device does its framing, however, the film turns out to be the most restrained of melodramas, benefiting mightily from its director's estrogen in turning its lurid plot into a non-judgmental moral conundrum. The characters' relationships don't feel at all weighted towards a single party: the first marriage drifts apart just thanks to busy schedules and inadvertent apathy (cue Fontaine rolling over in bed, yawning as she says ""I love our marriage.""), while the second is founded on a lot of fumbling eagerness and hesitation. And Lupino is superb under her own supervision in portraying an honorable, insecure woman; it's a performance that presages that by Alison Wright in a similar role on The Americans by sixty years. Not consistently startling, maybe too hesitant, and a bit preachy, but fascinating, and preaching a message altogether different from other films of the period.",3.5
"The duality of women compromising their identities to the wavering gaze of their beloved male object of desire. It's telling that the poster has the two women looking directly at each other since they are, after all, two halves of the same coin.
Eve presents herself so traditionally as the prototypical 50s housewife. Except she's not *just* a housewife, she's the co-owner of a successful sales business with her husband. And not only that, but she's obviously the one that takes the lead with the business, which, as we all know, would bruise any fragile male ego, let alone her own husband. Yet Eve strives to be both identities to Harry as she desperately wants to bear children while continuing their business. She is, in this period of time, the living feminist ideal. Except for one thing - she is infertile. She wants to solve this through adoption. This point of contention is never mentioned in the larger context as a legitimate problem for Harrison but given where the film goes, I can't fully believe that (more in a moment).
Phyllis, on the other hand, is street-smart and sassy, on the surface, her bucking of the trends seems progressive as a female identity at that time. Yet, she lacks the financial prowess that Eve has - her lack of empowerment renders her easy to fall back onto the traditional gender roles when things turn south for her. I don't mean to pass judgment on Phyllis, as a matter of fact, Eve has come from a wealthy background while Phyllis has not. It's in this manner that the film questions whether or not true empowerment can come without financial means.
Regardless, Harry feels needed by Phyllis, the other woman, and not Eve, his wife, who seems to have checked every box on the ""have it all"" list. I mourn for Eve the same way I mourn for Phyllis. Perhaps a symptom of patriarchy is that men are threatened by a woman that ""has it all"", where their own presence isn't vital for the woman's survival or thriving. Or maybe that's just a symptom of all human relationships. Harry needs to feel needed, being wanted is simply not enough for him. So he runs to Phyllis, the surface-level empowered woman who, sadly, nevertheless fits all the conditions for an attractive woman at the time (lack of financial means, no immediate familial connections, fertile). She becomes pregnant, which creates an urgent need in the man, moreso, it's implied, than any kind of adoption agency would provide, at least in regards to Harry's fragile male ego.
Yet, with all that said, I find it difficult to completely hate Harry. He is a product of his time. He doesn't have an easy way out. Lupino, as writer/director, is certainly undecided, leaving the film to a single question that both women have to consider.",4.5
"""I can't figure out my feelings toward you. I despise you and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet, I almost wish you luck.""
Those words, said by the man who finds out the truth about the bigamist, sum up the character and his ordeal very well. I was impressed by this one, acted superbly by three Hollywood heavyweights; Edmond O'Brien (the bigamist), Joan Fontaine (the first wife) and director Ida Lupino, who plays the second wife. Things quickly get very complicated for Edmond's character Harry Graham and the story does its job of making you want to find out where everything will end up.",4.0
"It's a movie, as the title implies, about a man married to two different women. In one marriage his wife is also his business partner and they are trying to adopt a child. In the other, he already has a child. It's a fine setup for melodrama, and Lupino exploits that exceptionally. The film begins with the mystery of what this man is hiding, and though we already know the secret is due to the title, the film's insistence on going full-detective for its opening scenes is a masterstroke. The audience is put in the position of being ready to judge and judge harshly. But when finally the second marriage is revealed and the man tells his story of genuinely loving two women and not knowing how or having the moral courage to extricate himself from either situation, we as an audience are forced to weigh the ambiguities. Lupino heightens the ambiguity at every stage by reminding us always of the various characters' humanity. The final scene, set in a courtroom, refuses to put a clean button on anything, equally privileging the pain and damage caused to all involved. The final shot of the film, of a woman, heartbroken and unsure what to think of the man she's loved for so many years, is haunting.",0.0

It's not at all the sort of film I'd expect for the 1950s, and while I thought it was good, I also do see how it is that this film wasn't considered successful at the time. It's provocative, but in a very optimistic way.",3.0

"Eve (Joan Fontaine, Rebecca) and Harry (Edmond O'Brien, 711 Ocean Drive) Graham are looking to adopt a child. Filling out paperwork in the office of Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn, Miracle on 34th Street), Harry seems reluctant to sign the ""yes you may investigate my entire personal life to see if I will be fit to raise a child"" form. What secret could this man possibly be hiding, in a film titled ""The Bigamist""?
The answer is of course Phyllis (Ida Lupino, High Sierra), which Mr. Jordan tracks down rather quickly. The vast majority of the rest of the film is a flashback, with voiceover from Harry, covering how his relationship with Phyllis came to be.
And it's a considerably more touching story than one would expect of a 1950s film tackling the subject, a sense which stays with the film all the way through its ending.
The film doesn't bother to try and demonise any of the three parties, instead opting to lay out their individual flaws - whether those were within their control or not - and the circumstances that played into events. Sometimes everyone makes the best decision they can see for their situation at the time, and things still fall apart catastrophically.
There is of course no question that Harry is most culpable, and the film never shies from that perspective - and as the narrator Harry is obviously afforded every opportunity to lean the story in his own favour - but instead examines his motives, and how he came to find himself in that situation, and how one small moment of weakness can spiral into a truly inescapable conundrum.",2.5

"Picture me surprised to watch this wonderfully complex film, turn on the Film Comment podcast episode about Ida Lupino’s career, and hear them dismiss it as the misguided dud of her filmography. I get where that reaction comes from, this film was not what I expected from the premise, but this one’s close to being a standout of the whole era. The easy take on the premise would be a Hitchcockian tale of trapped-women realizing their horrible circumstances, but instead Lupino focuses on the man in the middle and manages to humanize him while you still abhor his deceptions. She leaves the moralizing at the door, and instead realizes this confluence of cowardice and masculine duty to provide for one’s wife and protect women’s oh so fragile feelings, it’s so spot on. How many other Hollywood films were doing this? If we’re gonna heap praise on The Searchers for boldly portraying compromised men, let’s at least recognize how clever Lupino was with this one.",0.0

"Lessons in honesty.
The Bigamist's frazzled protagonist lives a life fractured by dishonesty and inconsistent values. He is a successful businessman juggling two wives in different cities partly (if not totally) because his first wife could not bear children. (Note: this is much more of a dilemma today than it was then.) When he is caught in an inescapable web of deception, he experiences existential collapse. Lupino takes this potboiler concept and creates a short, but fascinating character study about the dehumanizing cost of self-compartmentalization and cowardice. In trying to have it all, the bigamist has fractured his very identity into dissonant halves haunted by crushing guilt.
On a deeper level, The Bigamist posits a wake-up call about taking personal responsibility for how we construct our personhood through our values and daily behavior over time. Do we live with integrity, or make inconsistent personal exemptions that warp our identities into unsustainable fictions? Are we self-aware, or are we playing unconscious roles that atrophy our core values? Without any real answers all we're left with is an unresolved moral reckoning.",4.0

The two female leads are great and neither one is painted antagonistically. Still confused why O’Brien turns to bigamy. Flashback structure and voiceover seem to ape Noir, and perhaps meant to telegraph (in this era) how wrong it is to fall in love with two women. Weird, meta references to “Miracle on 34th Street,” since Ed Gwenn was Santa in that movie and is compared to Santa in this one.",0.0
"Sure, there's the bigamy angle in this picture, but I am also into the fact that the Edmund O'Brien character and his wife, played by Joan Fontaine sell deep freezes. This, in 1953, is cutting edge domestic technology, right? The deep freezer unit is only really available for home use in the late 40s, early 50s? It is a small part of the picture, but somehow the themes of domesticity in the film are complemented by this further element of the home and technology.",4.0
"Did you hear the one about the traveling salesman? ""The Bigamist"" is an overwrought melodrama suffering from a seventy-nine minute identity crisis. The charisma challenged Harry (Edmond O'Brien) is a San Francisco-based traveling salesman married to Eve (Joan Fontaine). Eve and Harry are looking to adopt a child, and are assigned to caseworker Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn). Jordan notices Harry's terminally constipated expression every time the term ""thorough investigation"" is used, and goes to Los Angeles to find some of Harry's clients. He also finds Harry, living in a modest home with his other wife Phyllis (the film's director, Ida Lupino) and their infant son. With halting narration, Harry tells Jordan, and us, how he became involved with Phyllis, and his inability to break things off with Eve, whose heart attack stricken father has horrible timing. He seems to take ill or die every time Harry wants to ""talk."" Jordan doesn't know what to do with Harry, as both wives learn of each other's existence.
A woman directing a motion picture in the 1950's was unheard of, but instead of admiring Lupino's ground-breaking spirit, I was disappointed with her choice of material. ""The Bigamist"" is a film noir-soap opera-black comedy that does not work as any of those genres. With all the cigarettes, booze, shadows, neon, coffee, and terms like ""big lug"" tossed around, I half-heartedly waited for Harry to spill his secret to Jordan, slip him a mickey, plug him full of slugs, then dump his bones in Encino and carry on with both the dames, see? The noir elements are heavy here, except for the plot and actresses. Joan Fontaine is Eve- EVE, get it? The first wife who we should be rooting for. Unfortunately, Eve is a moron of the highest order, not noticing Harry's almost convulsive behavior whenever she comes close to the truth. It doesn't help that Fontaine's constant facial expression is the same as someone who has just stepped in dog mess at the park. Lupino's Phyllis is such a bitter pill in her opening scenes, it is hard to see what Harry sees in her. Despite being in almost every scene, O'Brien is only fourth billed. If the screenwriter was going for the soap opera, they should have centered the story around one or both sympathetic women, not the sweaty schlub in the middle. I tried to accept the film as comedy. The hand wringing, the heavy narration, the discussion about chop suey not being a Chinese dish- there is plenty to giggle at, but was it done all in jest? No, the film is so deathly serious it might eventually trigger chronic depression in the viewer. Even the film's ""light"" moments are overdone. Jane Darwell's cleaning woman cameo is just plain weird. Inside jokes about Gwenn's triumph in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" isn't dragged out once, but twice. He played Santa Claus, we get it, can we just move on? Lupino the director does a plain job with the terrible script. She does nothing spectacular, in front of or behind the camera. The screeching musical score underlines every ham-fisted emotion threefold. I wanted to appreciate ""The Bigamist,"" but I wasn't sure what to appreciate about it. It's not the worst film ever made, but it does make for a slow seventy-nine minutes, camp value notwithstanding. Find ""Micki & Maude"" instead. At least that film wanted to be a comedy.",2.0

It sort of does the Hollywood thing where it broadly gestures at a moral lesson, but it lets the ambiguity hang there. Lupino takes great pains to make Harry a sympathetic character who gets caught up in a terrible sin, which is itself a symptom of his diseased spirit. He is a terrible man, but he is not a playboy, and at least he isn't treating his terrible behavior like a game. Nonetheless, he's a coward, indicative of the masculine frailties of a bygone era (at least I wish we'd completely left them behind). He doesn't even really need to travel for work. He is a bigamist as a kind of therapy. He commits his horrible deceptions just to assuage an irritation while making it worse at the same time.",3.5

however, the ending. who? what? where? when? why? how? i’m usually all for ambiguity, but i feel as if there’s something missing. surely, instead of abandoning your only child & mother of said child, you would instead just leave your original wife in order for her to fulfill her own dreams of becoming a parent by adoption (a thing he clearly never truly wanted).

"This was surprisingly interesting. While I found Harry unlikeable and annoying with with the way he blamed all his marriage problems on Eve and hit on Phyllis in such an uncomfortable way, I quickly got invested in the story for the women’s sake, curious for the resolution. I thought the film did a good job at explaining how the two marriages came to be and portraying Harry’s dilemma without trying to make him overly sympathetic or excusing his behaviour. 
“You may laugh, Mr. Jordan, but for the first time, I felt needed. I loved Eve, but I never felt she needed me.”
My two major issues are a matter of personal taste. While the film does not give Harry a clear happy ending, it leaves open the question of whether either woman will forgive him, something that seems at least possible given that Phyllis was so ready to forgive his cheating the first time, which I personally found very frustrating. The character of Phyllis is disappointing in general, especially in comparison with Eve. Both women appear to be strong and fairly independent when we meet them, Phyllis living independently and Eve successfully co-managing the couple’s business. In this context, I thought it rather underwhelming that Phyllis falls for Harry’s cheap and pushy pick-up and is so quick to forgive his cheating after she first insisted she didn’t need a man/didn’t need him to marry her, especially as we don’t get to see her final decision.",3.0
"I'm no screwball comedy aficionado, but what little I've seen is a lot more conservative that what others have purported. Women are witty, they're capable of holding their own in the workplace: but don't worry, all that banter is a prelude to domesticity. For my money, it's Lupino's The Bigamist that manages to confront workplace conflict unflinchingly. Our hero, Mr Graham, is less a person than a series of divisions: two wives; two names (Harry or Harrison?); two cities that he endlessly drifts through. Ultimately, it's his inability to resolve the complexities of life that put him in this position---in the end, the judge addresses him as if he were hardly conscious. He's most at home at a Hollywood tour bus, or a Chinese restaurant: images of American glamour and exoticism. As the salesman rubberbands, his destruction is inevitable. But the film is far from fatalist: it seems that it's only when Graham falls apart, that he can begin to see the women in his life as more than images of ""coworker"" and ""mother"".",4.0

Ida Lupino does a great job directing, and is just as good as Phyllis, Edmond O’Brien, despite his rough situation, just oozes sympathy in the main role, and the movie always managed to keep me heavily invested through the 80 minute runtime thanks to some great pacing. The characters are rich, the music is nice, even if a little repetitive, but for my money, an excellent romantic drama.",4.0
"A few things bugged me about this movie. First, is Edmund O’Brien such a hunk that two really attractive women fall head over heels for him? Joan Fontaine, married to people like Cary Grant and Lawrence Olivier in other films, and Ida Lupino too? Not super believable since he looks like a middle-aged schlumpf and seems to have the personality of a traveling home freezer salesman (his role in the movie btw). 
Also, why the hell did he propose marriage when his girlfriend got pregnant? It doesn’t take a genius to see that that was not going to work out. And then try to adopt a baby with his real wife? Just insane.

Le choix du casting est très intéressant aussi. À part Joan Fontaine, que je trouve fascinante, nous ne sommes pas sur des visages très connus, ce qui nous rapproche, en tout cas ici, à mon avis, des personnages. 
J’ai été très frappé par la modernité du film (rien que son sujet) qui parvient à ne jamais juger, ce qui pourrait être impardonnable. 
Je regrette un peu le choix du titre qui révèle immédiatement le secret du héros… mais dès lors que le flash back démarre (film noir oblige) et que Harry (Edmond O’Brien) raconte le délitement de son couple et sa rencontre avec une inconnue qui l’ont conduit à cette double vie, étonnamment presque, le film devient bouleversant. 
Lupino parvient à retranscrire à la perfection les sentiments de tous ses personnages et à les rendre tous, tout simplement humains.
Mais la vraie force du film, c’est la vision de Lupino sur le mariage et tout ce qu’il implique. Pour les années 1950, c’est très précurseur.",4.0

"It might be an ironic thing to say given the morality of the subject but I must say this film is pretty decent! I'm quite impressed with the way this was made and the way it delivered its message.
The film kind of has a TV quality to it which was both interesting and a bit bothering at the same time. I just happened to notice that there were too many wide shots and it somewhat hindered me to focus on the characters' emotions, but this aspect isn't so much of a deal breaker anyway. I still liked it.
As for the way it handled the subject and its message to the audience, I don't want to say I'm pleased with it but I guess I'm just content that it was ambiguous and they left the decision up to the audience. I'm glad it didn't force a certain ideology since the film serves as either a vehicle for sympathy or a strong critique of bigamy.",3.5

"(Went from a 4 to a 3.5)
While I initially found The Bigamist to be a simple, plot focused thriller, a rewatch has shown me the psychological depths that this intense drama goes through. Although I found the short runtime to feel awkwardly expansive, the distinctive emotions displayed by its characters make this movie worthwhile. It is also the first American feature length film in which a female director directed herself. A feat which happened over 50 years after the birth of cinema.
Edmund O'Brien plays a married man who describes himself as lonely, his feelings being brought on through his lengthy work trips away from his loving wife (played by the beautiful Joan Fontaine). He impulsively finds a ""companion"" apart from his wife to solve his emotional crisis, a new relationship, which blossoms into love. After doubting his choice, planning an escape, and being dishonest for months, he is caught between the agonizing glance of the two separate women while in court in a powerful ending scene. The female characters realized emotional pain is only truly witnessed in the finale.
Looking at her work, Ida Lupinos movies typically feature a primary female protagonist that deals with a crisis (unwanted pregnancy, assault, disease) The Bigamist is different, as it features a male main character dealing with his destructive inner desires. The crescendo of passion in this film boils over in the end, as a insignificant mans problem affects the two women he loved.

"A lovely little film from Ida Lupino. So much more thematically complex than most films of its era. It's really annoying that Lupino doesn't get the kind of mainstream credit that other 50s directors do, even though her work is just as unique and interesting as theirs. The characters here are all great - I especially loved Edmund Gwenn as the mild-mannered investigator. Lupino is willing to ask some difficult questions in this film, and I'm not sure she has good answers for them. Then again, how could anyone? I'm not sure it's possible to love two people at once, and though Lupino does a great job cultivating sympathy for Harry, I just can't bring myself to understand his decision. Maybe someday when I'm a jaded adult I'll get it a little more. I certainly hope not, though.",0.0
"Film #7 of the Noirvember Femmes of Film Noir Challenge: Ida Lupino
I did even worse than I expected watching these in November, but I'll keep going. Lupino directs herself and is great in both roles. This isn't a traditional noir story, but it certainly has the moral complexity. The film has a lot of connections to the actors and filmmakers' real lives. Writer Collier Young was married to both Lupino and Fontaine (at separate times, but there wasn't much time in between), and there are references to Edmund Gwenn's role as Santa Clause in Miracle on 34th Street.",3.5

"Edmond O'Brien plays a salesman who makes frequent trips from his home in San Francisco to LA. His wife is very involved in his business and also the couple struggles with fertility issues and aren't able to have a child. Eventually O'Brien starts a relationship in LA with another woman and marries her as well. We get this information early on, and the story unfolds on how he could have made such a dumb mistake. Lupino could have played this with daggers, but instead paints a much more sympathetic portrait of O'Brien's character. He makes mistakes and is at time heartless, but Lupino always manages to shine a good light on him, or at least color him a shade of gray. That's ultimately where I struggle the most. The actual things he does and how I feel about them are out of line with how the movie wants me to feel about them. Still a great domestic drama and compelling watch. Each of the three have strong personalities and good chemistry.

The Bigamist es una película muy interesante al tratar un tema donde no deberían existir dos discursos, dándole una complejidad que es todo mérito de la directora Ida Lupino, que también tiene unos de los papeles protagónicos.
Edmond O'Brien interpreta a un vendedor viajero que, en un matrimonio de altos y bajos, termina conociendo a otra mujer. Tal como el título lo indica, termina llevando dos vidas paralelas.
Lupino no narra una trama lineal ni carente de matices, nunca excusando las mentiras de O'Brien, pero sí dándole complejidad a un tema que simplificado no daría para reflexión alguna. También Lupino entrega dos personajes femeninos que resaltan por ser independientes y modernas, pero subestimadas por el propio O'Brien. Y esa subestimación, de poder estar solas o aguantar un divorcio, es la primera trampa que se crea el protagonista para caer en su pozo de mentiras sin salida.
Sólida película, trata un tema complejo y sin caricaturas.",4.0

"""The Bigamist"" turned out to be completely different from my expectations, but didn't disappoint me one bit. I thought that we will know the story from Joan Fontaine's perspective (who is so wonderfully dynamic and delicate at the same time!), but then it was in fact the man, who tells this story. Edmond O'Brien's narration brings so much beauty and suffering to this story... and yet, I'm conflicted. There was a great dose of honesty in a confession of a man, who genuinely falls in love with two women, but yet, I would like some kind of confrontation... Ida Lupino gives herself space to talk about the Other Woman, just to... apologize to her unfaithful husband. I needed some more drama. ""The Bigamist"", even if it unfolds as a particularly beautiful melodrama, is being too apologetic about its topic. Bringing no despise for the bad deeds, only understanding.",3.5

"This is an outstanding drama and deserves kudos for everyone involved, especially Lupino's direction, but I really wish people would stop categorizing it as a crime film.",3.5
"Overall, I liked that the way the topic developed throughout the movie. It doesn't made that mistake of just throw dirt over the crime, but instead approached it more relaxed, without jumping to conclusions since the first minute –even when that conclusion, no matter how you approach it, is always the same.
Ida Lupino's direction could be one of the greatest things the movie has; she did an excellent job expressing the protagonist's big emotions through the images, something kind of difficult to achieve. Apart from that, the divided situations with their comparatives are well written and interpreted, but here's the thing: sometimes all the great scenes felt like justifications for the bad action the protagonist made; the movie sometimes feels more ambiguous than it needs to be, and that could damage the experience for some folks.
Even when it didn't ruin the experience for me, I think some parts could have been better handled. The protagonist inconsistencies, the sometimes extreme romantization, and some other little things, made this unable to reach its real potential.",4.0
"Excellent drama has husband and wife Harry and Eve (Edmond O'Brien, Joan Fontaine) trying to adopt a baby so Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) must do a background search. While digging into Harry's past the man realizes that he's actually also married to Phyllis (Ida Lupino). Harry finally sits down to explain how it all happened.
The first time I heard of THE BIGAMIST it was in a topic about film noir. After reading the plot I thought there was no way this here could be considered a noir but after viewing the film I realized that you could consider it that. Sure, it's mostly a drama but the story structure is told in a noir fashion as you've got a man torn between two women and an investigator trying to figure out what's going on.
I was really surprised to see how effective this film was on a number of levels. The topic of bigamy was certainly rather taboo but the film does a terrific job at playing it serious and it actually makes you care about all three characters. I thought the screenplay did a marvelous job at showing how the Harry character got into this mess and it all coming from him having a good heart. Of course, I'm sure many women might not see it the same way but having a woman direct the film gave it an interesting twist.
Lupino, the director, does a very good job here at laying the story out as well as developing all three of the characters and really giving the viewer a complete story. It also helps that you've got such a terrific cast with Lupino playing one of the woman. Both her and Fontaine are wonderful in their roles as is Edmund Gwenn as the investigator. There's still no question that it's O'Brien who steals the picture with a rather demanding and multi-dimensional role that he nails perfectly. That ""guy next door"" vibe O'Brien has works perfectly here and he really makes you believe the situation this guy is in.
At just 79-minutes the movie doesn't extend itself out nor does it become preachy. Instead we've just got a very good story told with care from the director who was lucky to have a terrific cast at her disposal.",3.5
"This was my first Ida Lupino directed and film and WOW!

Worth the watch for checking out more of Ida Lupino's work in film, though, especially after seeing The Hitch-Hiker and wondering what else she had done to subvert the conventions of cinema in her time.

His justification was basically...he was lonely and bored? I mean, I saw that he tried to reach out to her a couple times and sort of tried to save their marriage. But still!!!

"A character study, a film noire and an exploration of love and morality all served in the guise of a marital drama. An adoption agency clerk investigates a couple to clear them for adopting, but uncovers something troubling about the housband. With a flashback structure resembling Double indemnity it is hard not to compare the two, but here the stakes and crimes committed are purely moral and emotional in nature. Harry Graham is the picture of a coward unable to do the right thing, hiding his self serving behind the idea that he is protecting the women in his life. Yet he also waken sympathy, showing how he is capable of emotions beyond monogamy. The result is a nuanced and honest depiction of masculine emotion with an epilogue that encourages viewers to put themselves in his place. Orbiting around Harry are two women, key performances both played wonderfully. Ida Lupino is of course significant as Hollywoods first female actor/director, and here she shines both behind and before the camera.",3.5

Shout out to Agatha Christie for teaching me what ‘Bigamy’ meant when I read ‘Death on the Nile’ three weeks ago. 
The film itself is boring and frustrating. This is a good example of how a framing device can significantly impact a narrative for the worst.
If you rearranged this film chronologically, I think not only the film would be better but it wouldn’t have been nearly as much as a slog to get through. The way it’s presented now just grates on you over time. We watch our milquetoast protagonist make increasingly inane decisions as we wait for the pieces to fall into place by what we already know because of the framing device. 
It just slowly bleeds a lot of the tension right out of the film when you realize the entire film is just explaining why the Bigamy occurred, rather than dealing with the consequences/fallout of his actions.
There’s an interesting story here but ‘The Bigamist’ is just so dull. Watch ‘Mad Men’ if this is anywhere near your thing. Similar tale of loneliness and infidelity just, yknow, interesting.

"→ 94th film in my Women Directors 2020 Challenge
This is now the third Lupino picture in which the plot's moral dilemma is summarized in a final speech where the protagonist is face to face with the justice system (be it a court, a police chief or an attorney). This sort of heavy-handedness is my least favorite thing about her films, which otherwise have all been totally engaging and thematically fascinating.
One thing you've got to give to Lupino, really, is how her movies didn't turn out. The themes and scripts she directs would almost certainly fail miserably in other, less empathetic and realistic, hands. In The Bigamist you can feel how genuine and convincing this story and these characters are thanks to a director that steers as far away as possible from sensationalism. However, in a severe attempt to be evenhanded about the film's topic, everything is incredibly straightforward, bordering on uneventful. While it can have tension, the way in which the plot is framed detracts from the suspense this story could've had.
At the same time, a real quality of Lupino's artistry is her economy. If the runtime isn't clue enough, this story is really kept to the essential beats and doesn't linger at all. However, the plot's shenanigans sometimes take over to the detriment of real character progression. Instead of the subplot about Eve's father's heart attack, which is included for the story's convenience, a much more interesting approach would be to get to know better Eve's daily life and feelings about her marriage. The same could be said of Phyllis, since the film is really from Harry's perspective.
The ambiguity and complexity of The Bigamist's point of view ultimately make it an impressive film. The final image is striking and rightfully recenters the story on Eve and Phyllis (Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino also far outperform Edmond O’Brien). In the end, this is another competent picture from Lupino, although I still hope to find out she made a full-on masterpiece.",3.5

"Ida always coming through with the social topics, and I love it. This time, she takes a look at bigamy with a very heavy bias towards the bigamist.
It was very effective at invoking empathy from the viewer. As I am hormonal and currently miss being with my husband, seeing him falling in love to the second woman was 😍😍 Haha, forgive me, wife 😅
Despite the wife not realising their emotional connection was dwindling, and that he was miserable in the marriage, he was so damn wrong for that. Whilst I understand he tried to work on it yet was sadly met by a lack of care or thought, he still could've handled everything so much differently.
So we know from the beginning that the situation is messed up on his part. No one denies that, even in the film itself. However, it easily leads you to being rather considerate of him nonetheless. You may even find yourself wanting the best for him.
His wife was thriving by herself too. So that helped make it better better, I guess 😂
Great stuff. Plus Ida herself stars in it! I knew she was an actress, but I have only known her as a director. She was great!

"Really simple concept but Ida Lupino's ""twist"" on the tale was groundbreaking in that it sought to illuminate the double standards around bigamy while humanizing the bigamist. Essentially, an exercise in seeking normalization. She succeeds by creating three well-rounded characters with believable instincts and motivations, and throwing in the sleuth-like Edmund Gwenn to simultaneously permit some exposition while acting as an effective audience surrogate. It all works very well, and at a swift 79 minutes to boot (and that includes a closing court scene that is wholly unnecessary). Much preferred this to The Hitchhiker.

"Surprisingly tender handling of material that has Edmund O'Brien married to two different women at the same time, but struggling with it as he loves both, but also knows his true loyalty should be towards his original wife.
O'Brien lives in California and is a traveling salesman who goes back and forth between his home base in San Francisco and the office in L.A. (at least he keeps his wives all in one state). In S.F. there is Eve (Joan Fontaine) with whom he is attempting to adopt a baby, but it is through the investigation by official Edmund Gwenn that it is discovered that he is not only married to Ida Lupino in L.A., but also has a child by her. O'Brien knows he has to do the right thing but struggles because of the situation he has put both women in. With Fontaine, he has a solid business partner and friend. The marriage feels more like a business arrangement than love. With Lupino, he has intimacy and ultimately the family he wants so he gets the best of both worlds except that it's completely illegal.
Told mostly in flashback the picture has two very interesting meta moments where Edmund Gwenn is referred to as a sort of Santa Claus, and then later on a tour of the Stars homes in L.A., the home of Edmund Gwenn, star of Miracle on 34th Street is pointed out. Yes, you aren't hearing wrong they are referring directly to one of the stars in the picture and his most famous role. It's an odd choice and almost jarring (the Santa Claus one almost works though, it just made me chuckle like ""hey, he was Santa Claus"").
O'Brien is solid and extremely sympathetic in this role, and you get why he's having so many problems doing the right thing. You see the advantages of both women but alas, he can only have one.
It's a solid picture that handles what could be tawdry material maturely.",3.0

"Collier Young wrote and produced this film, and he was also married to both Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino (obviously not at the same time) and Ida Lupino directed it - WOW... and there I was thinking the most meta thing about The Bigamist was the Edmund Gwenn Miracle on 34th Street reference during the see-the-stars-bus-tour scene.
Knowing this after watching The Bigamist makes the ending feel all the more real, especially the way Fontaine and Lupino look at each other in court as they knew in real life what it felt like to be married to the same man. This film, whether it's a good thing or not, makes you feel sympathy for Edmond O'Brien's titular bigamist (who was also great in Lupino's The Hitch-Hiker made in the same year!) and how his loneliness can be understood in bringing about the sorry affair, and even when he tries to be decent and do the right thing, the timing would never be right, which ultimately will lead to even more sadness and helpless pity in the long-term. The ending itself is pretty ambiguous, which I really liked, and I've been spending the last hour thinking what may have happened to all these characters after the final scene.
Even though it's billed as a drama, this film is surprisingly suspenseful like a noir, especially how most of The Bigamist is told through flashback which is a common narrative device of the genre, and the music also highlights this. Although it sounds dumber than it is, I quite liked how the film framed Edmund Gwenn as the detective of this film even though he's just the nice old man who works at the adoptive agency. Makes me wonder if adopting a baby is this pulpy and hard-boiled.",4.5
"Ok, it just needed a more charismatic bigamist.",3.0

"With the blunt title hitting at some kind of shocking melodrama, The Bigamist isn't a film that you go into with expectations of subtlety and twists. Director Ida Lupino still manages to do a bit more with the material than others might have done, working diplomatically with the screenplay by Collier Young to make something arguably better than it has any right to be.
Edmond O'Brien is Harry Graham, loving husband to Eve Graham (Joan Fontaine). The two are looking to adopt a child, which puts them under the scrutinising gaze of Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn), and it's not long until that man discovers that Mr. Graham has a secret, another wife (Phyllis Martin, played by Lupino). In fact, he has a whole second life, something that he surely knew would be discovered when he began the adoption process.
Interestingly, especially considering the time this was made, The Bigamist takes time to show the various little moments that lead to the main character making some very foolish decisions, but it does so without constantly judging, and tutting at, all of those moments. It also lets a fairly silly plot unfold in a way that feels grounded and realistic, thanks to Young's script, and, again, I'd say that's a very pleasant surprise for the time it was made. The hardest part to swallow is the ""framing device"" which allows the morally-unshakeable Mr. Jordan to learn the full details of the story.
O'Brien is a decent enough lead, he's not a special man, he's just managed to get himself in a very unique situation. Fontaine and Lupino are both excellent, showing two different personalities with enough similar appeal to the lead, and it's impossible not to feel sympathy for both as you see things heading towards a third act that needs a revelatory moment on the way to some kind of punishment. Gwenn is fine, he does what he needs to do, which is mainly listen with interest as O'Brien unburdens himself of a secret that has been weighing on his mind for some time.
It's interesting to think of how this would be perceived if directed by a man, and how the material would have been executed. Lupino, an excellent director, and a woman with one of the most interesting careers to incorporate the glowing past of Hollywood (in terms of the path she took at a time when women had even less opportunities than they do today), allows everyone to be viewed with compassion. There's a man who battles his feelings until he thinks he can make everything work, and there are two women who both love that man, and are both unaware that their very presence would be a cause of pain to one another.
You know exactly what you're getting into with The Bigamist, and yet it also delivers the central message, the expected cautionary tale, with a surprising amount of care and understanding.",3.5
"A married couple decides to adopt a child when they can't have one biologically. However, it's revealed that the man has another wife in another city, whose child is biologically his. A story that's shockingly ambiguous for the time, place and genre.
The nuances of which might've come from a very interesting fact: writer and producer Collier Young was married at the time to actor Joan Fontaine, and had previously been married to director and actor Ida Lupino. The two wives in the film. It would seem impossible not to tell the story with empathy for all parts in this case. Lightning in a bottle, so to speak.
And speaking of Ida Lupino, what an absolute legend. Directing this ""out-of-nowhere masterpiece"" and The Hitch-Hiker in the same year.
The Bigamist wastes no time telling this story, but still has time for blink-and-you'll-miss-it details that makes it great. Such as the man confusing which of his wives takes her coffee with cream and who takes without.
Fantastic for many reasons. Packaged consistent and solid.",4.0
"The Bigamist gives us a look at different kinds of love. One love draws Harry in and entices him - exciting, romantic and easy. The other is deep, comfortable, and familiar. The film is refreshingly sensitive about the nature of each relationship, transforming Harry's character from a adulterous villain to a loving friend and partner, even when his actions are misguided.
Motherhood, which is too often entangled with womanhood, plays an important role in the film too, as a way to explore the female characters, but also to explain (justify?) Harry's behaviour.
The final scene in particular is handled with maturity and understanding. It excellently demonstrates the complexity of emotions within each of the three main characters without needing dialogue.
And that's what we call cinemaw.",3.5

After enjoying Lupino's The Hitch-Hiker today, I was eager to take advantage of MUBI's double bill offer. The Bigamist was the other film on offer, so I went for it.
This was another extremely interesting film; instead of tackling hidden sexualities, this one attacks toxic masculinities and unsurprisingly, bigamy. However, I must say, that in itself is quite a surprising topic for a film for of this age to be tackling. In a system that certainly had a patriarchal system in place, for something that I'm sure many of them committed to be at the forefront of any Production Code film is quite impressive. Lupino is, once again, excellent behind the camera with great framing and lighting. It of course follows the typical style of a Production Code era film with a linear narrative and editing around a very overt flashback. However, the goal of the 'protagonist' is a little more muddled, arguably it's to be approved to adopt but it may also be to be caught as someone clearly caught up and struggling with his double life.
The four leading performances are all great, O'Brien was just as solid as he was in The Hitch-Hiker. The film does feel the need to qualify and explain Harry's actions which can feel a little reductive as you never really feel that his actions were justified, as understandable as loneliness is. However, it punishes him in the end, something that certainly needed to happen and he comes to accept his wrongdoing.
The Bigamist was another solid Lupino film and has encouraged me to search out some more of her work. This was also some more progress in watching some Classical Hollywood era films, and I had a good time doing it. Solid watch, and a great example of the clinically underused narrative technique (at the time) of allowing people to directly sympathise and understand the female perspective.",3.5
"A drama about O'Brien's decent man and how he came to be living a double life, told mostly in flashback. Comes across as too obvious to start with, but soon reveals itself to be rather sophisticated. With a focus on the emotions it's swooningly romantic in places, with music to match. Strong roles for the two leading ladies, but it's all seen from the man's point of view.
For a film from the director of The Hitch-hiker it lacks toughness, but still a very fine movie.",0.0
"However, the blowout never really comes and Harry doesn't really get his comeuppance bar a couple of looks that weren't overly sinister. It's unsatisfying but also does describe the way in which affairs like this end, the spouses come off a whole lot worse. With the 1950s Hollywood lifestyle, this clearly could be seen as a commentary on relationships, with many bouncing between partners - including Lupino herself. Scarily and weirdly enough, Lupino released this film in 1953, written and produced by her second husband Collier Young, who she was divorcing in 1951 after she got pregnant from an affair from her third husband Howard Duff. It would be safe to say that 'The Bigamist' was a depiction of real-life events she endured, which may explain the lack of a payoff to the man who played these two women.

This 1950s melodrama, directed by, starring, and financed entirely by Ida Lupino, seems pretty ballsy for its time. It's about a salesman named Harry, torn between two women: Eve (Joan Fontaine), a post-WWII career-focused gal, and Phyl (Lupino), a lonely, harder-edged lady whom Harry gets pregnant. When Eve, unable to have children, wants to adopt, an investigator from the adoption agency starts to unravel the double life Harry tragically created for himself.
All three leads have a deep sense of melancholy and a yearning for closeness that is never fully requited. Although on paper, the film's scandalous story seems like it would be a classic Hollywood version of a Lifetime Original movie, it's better than that thanks to the performances and noir-ish tone.",3.5

This film can take some work unless you’re a really big fan of O’Brien because he is in pretty much every frame. 
Say what you will about showiness of The Method, something had to be done to counter the expression Joan Fontaine used that was a cross between pained wistful longing on the verge of hysteria even when she’s happy. 
Her mother, also in this film, has the same thing (as does her sister de Havilland elsewhere.)

"The Bigamist is perhaps more interesting for its historical context than as a movie. It's pretty fascinating to see a film made in the thick of the Production Code tackle a story of adultery, following a married man who ends up impregnating his mistress and tries to do right by both women. Of course, what makes the film interesting is also what makes it compromised. Director Ida Lupino approaches the material with a degree of subtlety and nuance, depicting the titular bigamist as something of a well-meaning and kind man who nonetheless finds himself unfulfilled in his marriage and falling in love with another woman. But the film still needs to adhere to the Production Code, so we get numerous scenes stressing how horrible and selfish the protagonist is, complete with an ending where the offending party is punished for his transgressions.
What's frustrating is that it feels like Lupino had a more thoughtful story she wanted to tell but had to water it down to cartoonishly simplistic levels. The film is compellingly made and features some strong performances, but is best viewed for historical curiosity.",3.0

"To state the obvious it's surprising to see a film from this era deal with what normally would be a rather salacious subject matter with such sympathy for all the characters involved. Edmond O'Brien's just keeps digging himself in deeper and deeper and realizing there is no good way out of this, just keeps going like the schlub he is. It reminds me of a Jean Renoir film (not one specifically) in the sense of how the material is presented and how the characters are portrayed, as one of his main skills was in presenting people for what they are with little judgement of their actions. It's a real shame this was Lupino's last film directed for a decade, I've seen the Hitch-Hiker which is pretty awesome so that's two for two now.",3.5

There is a groundedness to the melodrama here which makes the tragedy feel lived-in instead of exploitative. There isn't a lot of visual flair to this movie until the very last shot, when the final row of dominoes fall. Tragedy usually feels preordained, but with this one it seems like somebody should have been able to stop this from happening.

"Directed assuredly by Ida Lupino, The Bigamist is not- as the title may suggest - a pulpy piece of shock cinema. Instead, it's a measured study of love, marriage and societal expectations that gently explores 3 nuanced characters.
Edmond O'Brien plays a salesman who is increasingly dissatisfied by a life spent on the road, away from his wife and business partner, played Joan Fontaine. Their relationship is not on the rocks, but rather, worn in. Fontaine is successful, capable, sophisticated - a true partner.
But on the road in Los Angeles (captured very pleasantly) O'Brien is led by a mix of loneliness and curiosity to Ida Lupino, who in her signature way plays a guarded, yet vulnerable woman who is also touched by loneliness. In her, he finds someone who doesn't just love him, but needs him.
A persistent adoption liaison finds out O'Brien's duplicity, but the court (and the film) is able to see that the case isn't black and white. Lupino doesn't damn anyone, but gives them space to experience.",3.5

"Imagine just being too nice of a guy to divorce your wife, before you marry someone else.

Neither of them are made out of be the villain of this story, Joan Fontaine's character isn't the ""bad wife"" and Ida Lupino's character is never painted as the seductress who lures a nice man away from his wife, both of which would be expected from a movie like this.
Visually, the movie looks great and this being my first Ida Lupino film, I definitely want to watch more movies directed by her. The performances are also all fine. But god I hate the way, it was structured. Maybe I just have a personal vendetta against movies told primarily through flashbacks, but god damn it... The movie just mostly lost me, as soon as it became clear to me, just how long that flashback was. What helps is that Joan Fontaine's character is absolutely fantastic though.",3.0
"Joan Fontaine deserves some kind of Lifetime Achievement Award for all the shitty husbands she had to put up with in movies.

There’s no sympathy for the bigamist, but no outright condemnation either. She knew exactly how to make this movie in 1953 and get away with it.",3.5

I always forget how fantastic Joan Fontaine consistently is, and if any actress were the best fit for a woman needing a demure face to front a misled heart (think Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Letter from an Unknown Woman) it's her. Ida Lupino plays her ideal non-antagonistic opposite; unassuming where the other is affected, content where the other is ambitious. But both are equally as collected and reassuring, the commonality keeping Edmond O'Brien ""loyal"" to each. His performance is pretty marvelous, his reticent and despondent expression all the more poignant in its discord with the prosperous attitude now inundating their generation, the tragic baby-boom irony and all.",3.5
"Sympathy for the devil.
Edmond O'Brien play Harrison ""Harry"" Graham, a traveling salesman who is married to Joan Fontaine's Eve. We are introduced to them as they are attempting to be approved to adopt a child. But when the condition that Harry's past will undergo scrutiny, he becomes nervous, and with good reason. For the past couple of years he has been living a double life, with a double wife (couldn't help myself).
The adoption agency busts him pretty early in the film, and his situation is explained in flashback for the majority of the runtime of the film.
It seems that his marriage to Eve started to sour when she began taking a more active role in their sales business. The marriage became one of convince and professional courtesy, more than of love. While traveling Harry meets Ida Lupino's Phyllis character. She is a spunky, independent woman. Harry is attracted to her, and he is lonely on the road, not to mention that Eve hasn't been there for him like he would like.
The affair with Phyllis starts innocently enough, but it escalates as you would expect over time. What you might not expect its that Harry's relationship with Eve also strengthens as the business does better, and as her father has health issues, making her appreciate Harry a bit more.
When Harry finds out that Phyllis is pregnant with his child, he feels like he must do the right thing by her, and marry her. This lines up nicely with he and Eve beginning the adoption process.

This movie is a anxious nightmare. Harry makes so many poor decisions. He constantly hides behind ""the right thing"", and each time a situation arises that would allow him a way out, he only buries himself deeper. The movie ultimately punishes him, but with the most minor of slaps on the wrist.
The real interesting thing here is that Ida Lupino directed this movie. Women directors in Hollywood are rare now, but in the 50's Lupino was about the only woman getting any kind of regular work behind the camera. So to have a woman direct, and star in a film about a man married to two women, and to not have it demonize the man, is noteworthy to say the least.
The movie is well constructed, and performed. The subject matter, still taboo to this day, is handled delicately. I would say too delicately for my tastes. I respect that they tried to take an even handed approach, but I wish the the film had more of a point of view on the issue.",3.0

"A woman discovers her husband has another family in another city. ""The Bigamist"" would be a lot better if the title philanderer weren't so unbelievably dull. You'd think for someone who is able to get two different women to fall in love with him and marry him, he'd be remotely smart, handsome, or witty. Sadly, Edmond O'Brien, usually a solid actor, doesn't exude any of this with his characterization.
The women of the film are alright. Joan Fontaine's okay and Ida Lupino is good as usual, but these roles and performances lack what make their more notable performances so much more worthwhile. The level of ferocity Lupino is noted for is missing and Fontaine seems to be slumming it being sweet and sad. This film is missing a heavy dose of camp. If we could get a ""Baby Jane"" showdown between these two, we'd be cooking up something excellent.
I'm really sad that this isn't better. Ida Lupino was the one major female director in Hollywood in the '50s, and she deserves to be remembered for this. Sadly, she won't be because the films aren't all that great. Maybe she was handed the projects nobody really wanted like they did with Jean Negulesco, and I make that comparison because, when handed good material (like ""Johnny Belinda""), Negulesco and, assumedly, Lupino could be great.
But ""The Bigamist"" is a bore. It isn't too bad. Some of the conversations are fairly absorbing and Lupino was never not radiant, but it's pretty barebones and shrugworthy.",2.5
"This well-made drama scores points for being sympathetic toward all involved and for resisting easy judgments of a taboo situation. Furthermore, it has a light touch, winking at audiences with unexpected bits of humor, such as Jane Darwell’s eavesdropping cleaning lady, the line of dialogue, “Mr. Jordan (played by Miracle at 34th Street’s Edmund Gwenn) looks a lot like Santa Claus,” or the scene later on where a tour bus drives past Gwenn’s real-life home. After taking all of that subsidiary detail into account, though, one still has to contend with the stodgy, moralistic core of the movie, which doesn’t ever go away. Lupino’s own acting is especially good.

This is a rather thoughtful noir-infused romantic drama. It feels like some light hallmarks of noir are present, the flashbacks and narration, technically crime as well. I find the portrayal of the titular bigamist rather interesting. As the investigator states, we have a mix of empathy and disgust at him. He lacks the moral conviction and the cajones to do the right thing in some instances, but in others he is honorable. He is unfaithful to his wife, but the film also acknowledges the idea that people change over time. They seemingly did not actually prioritize their marriage, they simply drift and Harry is content to sadly watch the the gap widen. Eve is not guiltless, of course it's the responsibility of both in members in a relationship to work on it. However Harry's character also touches on this evolution of the woman. Eve becomes powerful, competent, better than he is at his own vocation in his own company. While part of the conflict is the distance, part is also his difficulty in resolving this change. In a way he's caught between old and new, one modern problem of the successful woman and one older problem of the dependent woman.
I do enjoy the romance with the secret wife. The way they start off slow is important given that the film is emphasizing that need for companionship in a marriage. They weren't even making babies yet, for a while he was just yearning for someone to heal his loneliness. I liked the little twist on their ""first date"" at the restaurant. Their overall dynamic was rather fun, and again it's a solid contrast to Eve. Both of them sort of don't care what he's doing, he makes some amount of effort to give himself away in spots betraying his guilty conscience, but they both ignore it in a different way. Eve ignores him because she's consumed with other things, but Phyllis does so because she's just content with him in that moment.",3.5

A kind-hearted bigamist explains how he came to have two wives in this melodrama directed by and co-starring Ida Lupino. In the director's chair, Lupino composes some great shots, most notably Edmond O'Brien standing against a window with a flashing neon sign outside just visible through the slits in the blind. Viewed for a second time after more than half a decade though, The Bigamist still registers as a disappointment given its rather star-studded cast and intriguing premise. The biggest problem is that the movie tries to shine a sympathetic light on both the bigamist as well as his wives. Edmond O'Brien is, however, never likeable as the title character; he severely lacks charisma and his attempts to woo the woman who would become his second wife come off as rather creepy.
Edmund Gwenn is also a bit creepy as the adoption agency worker who crosses all sorts of lines to expose the skeletons that O'Brien has in his closet. A part where a bus passes by Gwenn's actual house (announced as so during a tour) is a fun touch, but Gwenn has a weirdly underdeveloped character. Early on he mentions having made a mistake in the past, hence why he is so determined to properly vet all potential adoptive parents, but this is never further elaborated on, which makes him seem more nosy than inquisitive. The female cast at least come off well, particularly Lupino herself and Joan Fontaine as the respective wives. There is even a heartbreaking moment when O'Brien tries to confess being unfaithful to Fontaine over the phone, only for her to repeatedly write it off as a joke.",2.5

"Daily Decade Films | A Letterboxd History 2023
A rather risqué film for the time, Ida Lupino's drama of Edmond O'Brien's gradual infidelity from his wife, Joan Fontaine, and Lupino offers a relatively mild-mannered approach to the subject matter, not so much painting O'Brien's Harry negatively for his indiscretions but also not serving much in punishment for his actions.",3.0
"The plot: a couple are looking to adopt a child, but before he can approve them, the conscientious man from the agency has an inkling suspicion about the husband. His investigations lead him to discover the husband’s double life in California where he has another wife and a child. So, in flashback form, the husband tells the story of how his bigamy started.
Ida Lupino directs and plays the second wife. Curiously, the script goes out of its way to portray its bigamist lead as a “basically decent” man who was lead astray. The judge at his court sentence spells out an ironic fact that because he wanted to make an honest woman out of both his loves he was punished more than if he had just kept a mistress and illegitimate child. Both women are remarkably sympathetic and forgiving towards the man.
The Bigamist applies that old film noir trope of an ordinary fella being led towards his destruction by one misstep combined with cosmic misfortune and the seduction of a femme fatale. The viewer will differ on how appropriate that trope is to a story of a man’s infidelity when he has two passive wives making no demands on him.
It’s a unique approach at any rate. The acting is nothing special; Lupino’s blocking is competent enough to slide by without notice, but her direction never rises above the task. The LA backdrop of The Bigamist is of historical interest, especially the slight detour in the plot to showcase the houses of Lupino’s friends in Beverly Hills (including Edmund Gwenn who stars in the film).
To a modern viewer, there might be some interest in where The Bigamist differs from other films of its kind directed by men. Well, The Bigamist was written by a man, and there are no films exactly like it, but there are slight difference to the way the female characters are presented. Mostly this is because Lupino was in control of her own image, giving a sympathetic performance, furthest anyone could be from a fatale.",3.0

"Miss Lupino’s masterpiece, The Bigamist can also be the materialization of the so called ‘“female gaze”.
What is it? Maybe something like The Bigamist itself: an interest in all the characters of a film, main or secondary, male or female.
Told from the point of view of a man (Edmond O’Brien, endearingly “normal”) who is discovered by an adoption agent (Edmond Gwen, part cop part Santa Claus) that he has two wives (Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine), it is a sublime inspection on American society and the American dream as much as an anatomy of a couple. With a touch of thriller or film noir given by the main character’s voice over.
This man and his wives are so poignant in their humanity that their modernity is an epiphany.

The film is mostly told in a flashback set up where you get to see the man in question develop feelings for another woman. I think the ending has a little too much explanation putting a finer point on a film that up to that point had been quite subtle with its story. I want to love this film more because of the performances and story that is being told, but even with that there is still a lot to enjoy.",4.0

"Film Historians typically crown John Cassavettes and Shirley Clarke as starting the American independent film industry, but Ida Lupino deserves just as much credit. The Bigamist is far too sexually frank to have been helmed by a major studio in the early-1950s. It isn’t that the film is obscene, it’s just that it discusses bigamy, pregnancy, and infertility in an era when even the word “virgin” was demonized by the censors.
The film is slight, only 80 minutes long, and clearly has a low budget. But Lupino used her Hollywood connections to secure major stars like Joan Fontaine, Edmond O’Brien, Edmund Gwenn, and herself. These stars work to ground a film that would otherwise feel too bare bones for the average audience. Yet, the intelligent screenplay, hinging on a noir frame that fades into an extended flashback, makes for one of the most emotionally intimate melodramas of the era. The O’Brien character, despite being a bigamist, is not wholeheartedly villainized, but neither is he heroic. He is real, flesh and blood, and it is up to audiences to pass judgement. The emotion reaches a climax when Edmund Gwenn discovers the child in the house, a faint cry in the background that reveals a living room full of toys. It’s good storytelling that combines a strong screenplay with interesting direction. 
Perhaps the film could have benefited from being a bit longer. But in its present state, it’s still an amicable melodrama that pushed boundaries in Hollywood, boundaries that were probably harder to cross with the filmmaker being a woman. 
P.S. look out for a tour bus scene. You’ll see homes from celebrities like James Stewart. Jack Benny, Barbara Stanwyck, Jane Wyman, and Edmund Gwenn (an inside joke, I’m sure).",3.5

"There’s definitely something in this to Lupita’s directorial fingerprint where the movie can make such an effort to flesh out the whys and wherefores of how it all happened in a fairly soft way, more social realism than melodrama, and still spin up a noir feeling out of Edmund O’Brien’s increasing effort to keep things clear in his head, even if it’s not coming with a lot of drama. It’s a very smooth sort of genre-twisting affair, just plainly well done all round with empathy but still with a solid dose of judgement in the end. It is fascinating to think what could have been even further done here outside of the Hays Code though.",4.0

Ida Lupino brings empathy and restraint to a story that could easily have been another melodrama.

"The way Harry scoots across the bus seat without asking should tell you everything you need to know about his capability for murder . . .
and that's what Ida Lupino directing gets you.
This movie is progressive in a few ways, including not being anti-poly or anti-open or anti-anything *but* cheating. Every excuse Harry gives for his lies, every way in which he's an unreliable narrator in regards to his (first) wife, is EXACTLY what a fuck-boi of any gender and any relationship-construction would say to a prospective partner they're lying to, or to their friends / relatives / colleagues when trying to excuse their cheating. His disregard for how it will drastically impact not just two women he claims to love, but the children he is actively chasing under pretext, is in keeping with his other selfish actions.
Of course the whole film is wrapped up in an amateur investigation and subversion of social norms, but I was waiting for the other noir shoe to drop, and it never exactly did?

"Was really expecting more from this. It starts off with a character investigating a mystery that is solved in the title-card. Then it goes to great lengths to justify the main character's cheating-- by showing his loneliness and genuine feelings towards his ""mistress""-- but mostly by laying the blame on his wife-- who's committed the terrible sin of being good at business and unable to have kids. It all feels a bit outdated. Another problem is that he's just not a very compelling guy. I had imagined the movie would be more like the final fifteen minutes where he has to juggle two lives and go to sleep every night knowing it could all come crashing down. That sort of paranoia and constant lying is more interesting to me than the milquetoast romance with Ida Lupino. I guess the movie's OK. I could take it or leave it.",3.0

"Bigamie, tout aussi distant mais bien plus intéressant, est moins un récit qu’une enquête morale soucieuse de bien prendre en charge le public fifties en donnant à chaque personnage d’indiscutables raisons, en se faisant l’avocat de tous, et en anticipant par la voix-off l’inconfort du spectateur. Ce permanent statu quo ne crée que des scènes contrites, toutes entières centrées sur un gêne, un souci, une souffrance (le jeu nerveux et rentré d’Ida Lupino, ruminant mille douleurs, en est le meilleur emblème). En résulte un film intriguant, à la fois empathique et distant, comme un trait d’union entre le mélodrame et le drame psychologique à thèse des années 50-60 (qui n’aura pas souvent, comme ici, ce souci sincère de chaque personnage).

Harry Graham has it all. A great job as a traveling salesman, a devoted wife, a nice apartment. No kids, but when the couple approaches an adoption agency, their investigator soon uncovers an unsavory truth: that Mr. Graham has a secret second family.
This drama draws a lot of influence from film noir, but it stops short of seedy characters and criminality (or at least, conventional criminality). Instead, it allows Harry to explain himself. Through flashback, it illustrates the breakdown of his first marriage and the motivations inciting the illicit second marriage.
These characters are treated with sympathy and tenderness. The situation is complicated, as should be expected, and the whole time you keep hoping that they'll find some sort of happy resolution to all this. And Lupino does her darnedest to make it as happy as possible, given the constraints of the Hays code. This film pushes those limits, and its resulting ambiguity makes this a much more powerful film.

Henry Graham é qualquer um que optou pelo caminho mais fácil em um casamento longo, onde a intimidade parece ter se perdido de vista.

"...i was very harsh on this the first time i watched it.
the visceral reaction harry's action promoted from me led me to somewhat dislike it the first time, but that's the point. how you feel about what harry did, and how he treated phyllis and eve, is an indicator of your own moral standpoint, which is what the movie is about- moral standpoints. harry is described as ""an ordinary guy who did the right thing"", but what he saw as the right thing ruined the lives of two women, and got him in trouble with the law, but here is where morals pop up again. was it right of harry to not tell phyllis that he was already married, and was it right of him to later not tell eve that he had been cheating on her...seeing as him not telling either of those factors to either of those women hurt them both more so than a simple explanation would have. though, from all indications, eve seemed to genuinely love harry, despite his absence, which makes the way the story falls into place hurt more...the slight drop of joan fontaine's eyes, the change of expression in her words when she mentions how she's let him down oh gOD DON'T DO THIS TO MEEE
the above factors are what make the ending and conclusion's suddenness so uncalled for and unsatisfactory, which was another factor i remember disliking upon first viewing. the poster seems to put phyllis and eve against each other, but all they get is a long glance at each other and that is it- not even any words spoken. there is no hair-pulling catfight, there is no ""jilted wives become friends"" when ladies meet style, there is no clear resolution in general other than a vaguely heartbreaking final shot of eve with her back to the camera that leaves the viewer feeling almost...empty. maybe we are supposed to feel what eve feels now that her entire life has been ruined, after being told what her husband had been doing to her over phone call instead of admitted to by him? i don't know..",3.5

"Ida Lupino stars in and directs this 1953 film touching on a topic almost never touched on even today in film: Bigamy, the criminal (in the United States) act of having two separate marriages at the same time. The title uses the word as an accusation when coupled with the poster, with a pointed finger directed at the man committing the act in question, but the film itself shows empathy for him without failing to condemn his actions.
Harry/Harrison Graham is struggling with his marriage. His wife Eve is emotionally distant after discovering they cannot have children, and as a result he seeks another woman to alleviate his loneliness. Harry is telling this story in flashback to the adoption agency investigator who has found his double life, so the entire story of how he got into this situation is from his perspective, and nothing from Eve or Phyllis's perspective. The film doesn't question or interrogate his perspective, so we must assume it to be true, not a fabrication or exaggeration. More than that, it's the only perspective that can include all of it. Harry's actions are not wholly flattering to himself and even within his telling, it is apparent where his faults and mistakes lie.
The first key moment is in the first meeting of Phyllis. Phyllis is at first cold towards Harry, unfriendly on the bus. When she first shows a hint of friendly conversation, Harry lunges across the seat to sit with her. He asks her, ""do you mind if I sit here?"" and she remarks ""do I have a choice?"" Harry makes the conscious choice to strike up a relationship of sorts with Phyllis, and once he's in it, and hiding his wife from her, he's set the wheels in motion for Phyllis to help push them forwards. In a sense, she is responsible for their relationship progressing too, but she only knew he was just a man, not a married man. Along the way, Harry sets up excuses for himself to feel less guilty, asking Phyllis why she doesn't care about his past, maybe a secret family is waiting in the wings. She gives him that excused feeling, saying she doesn't care.
Harry does do the right thing in the end, but only when he is forced into a corner. He must be given no other option for him to be able to end the double life he's leading: guilt and conscience alone will not do it. This is the ultimate condemnation of him as guilty, and though he does plead as such in the courtroom, it's a mark on him that he wouldn't or couldn't do it on his own, despite trying. The investigator even remarks he had an out, at one point, but wouldn't take it. Harry is a coward and after being outed, will be marked as such for life, but Lupino has pity for him. He made mistakes and hurt the women he loved, but he is a human being, put upon by pressures we all face in love and life and marriage. The women are given less development but perhaps this is the point: we understand very well the choices they made and why they did what they did. That Eve is depressed from her inability to bear children speaks for itself. That Phyllis is guarded because of heartbreak in her past is a cliche backstory of sorts, but no less true to human behavior. The women are not the focus of this story because they are understood. It's Harry who we need to understand, not to support necessarily, but to understand.",0.0

"Lupino ne juge jamais l'homme infidèle et nous offre même des raisons d'avoir de l'empathie pour lui puisqu'il est le narrateur qui revient sous la forme de flash-back sur toute l'histoire. L'humanisme prend le dessus sur la morale en nous exposant à chaque fois les faiblesses de chaque personnage en 1h20 top chrono (quelle joie de ne pas voir plein de surcouches narratives inutiles).
Par contre je ne suis pas certain du propos du film à l'arrivée car Lupino a la matière pour faire un film très moderne sur le ressenti de ces deux femmes qui tendent à toujours justifier l'action de l'homme voire même redouter ses réactions. Phillys va jusqu'à dire qu'elle l'a forcé à se marier et préfère ne rien lui dire sur l'enfant par peur de sa réaction etc. Je sens que Lupino aurait bien un truc à dire sur ce conditionnement de la femme et de surcroît avec ce mari teinté de bon sentiments mais qui, en fait, n'assume jamais ses décisions. Mais Lupino ne le juge pas ni au travers de l'homme des adoptions ni par ces deux femmes et toujours pas au procès. Comme si elle trouvait les relations humaines complexes et les agissements du mari plutôt «nobles» et «louables» en dépit des conséquences certaines. Et à ne pas vouloir le «condamner», elle finit quand même par le juger à terme, ce qui fait de The Bigamist, une œuvre faussement moderne plus ancrée dans son temps que je ne l'avais anticipé. Elle justifie totalement les actes de l'homme en relayant les femmes au-second plan???? Après ça reste particulièrement stimulant dans sa construction des ambiguïtés et pourquoi devrait-on demander à la seule femme réalisatrice connue du Old Hollywood d'être irréprochable et d'avoir littéralement trente ans d'avance sur son époque ? On sent qu'Ida Lupino est en quelque sorte aussi conditionnée et c'est toujours important de comprendre qu'on est le produit de son époque quand bien même l'œuvre aimerait s'en extraire.",3.0

"More sophisticated than the ""social issues"" tag suggests, Ida Lupino's THE BIGAMIST extracts the love-triangle conceit from CASABLANCA, domesticates it and reverses the genders. The film itself invites this viewing: ""Here's looking at you, Phil""; the foreigner's restaurant with its own Sam; the unbridgeable divide between two continents/lovers/cities; a love affair in flashback. The result is a greater psychological penetration into a man's need to be loved and a woman's willingness to receive that love.",5.0

"Ida Lupino war eine der wenigen Frauen, die nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg in Hollywoods Männer-Phalanx an Regisseuren eingebochen war. Mit ""The Bigamist"" greift sie ein heißes Eisen an: ein Mann mit Doppelleben, zwei Frauen, zwei Familien - die nichts voneinander wissen.
Interessant ist aber vor allem, wie Lupino diese Geschichte inszeniert: zu Beginn entwickelt sich ""The Bigamist"" wie ein Film Noir. Ein Vertreter einer Adoptionsagentur stellt Nachforschungen an und entdeckt, dass Harry Graham wohl nicht nur der erfolgreiche Sales-Mann und treusorgende künftige Familienvater ist, als der er sich ausgibt.
Doch Lupino geht nicht den erwartbaren, einfachen Thriller-Weg, sondern wählt nach Aufdeckung des Geheimnisses den Weg ins Melodram. Weder wird ihr Harry Graham von seinem Lug & Trug freigesprochen, noch wird er als hinterhältiges, gaslightendes Monster beschrieben.

"52 Weeks, 52 Films, 52 Years Challenge - 2022
Week 16: The Bigamist


This really is - as everyone notes - a surprisingly non-melodramatic look a this topic given the year. The protagonist is portrayed as genuinely loving both of the women he is married to, and is positioned much more as a victim of circumstance than any kind of opportunist.
What I'm surprised more reviews didn't talk about was that this is generally all because the movie is essentially an hour long self-narrated story of a man positioning himself as a victim in a story about how he started cheating on his wife because he didn't ""need"" him enough - ie. she wasn't subservient to him and was actually better at business than he was - so he found a woman who would be totally self-sacrificing and need him more. It's all pretty pointed, though of course not surprising given the year.
What is perhaps the most surprising is that Ida Lupino was allowed to direct a film inside a system that had pushed the many pioneering female directors out of the business after the end of the silent era. Her work here - both as director and performer - is very good and I'm so happy this movie exists to showcase her.
The other two leads are also very good, giving a lot of humanity to these characters that could've suffered in the hands of lesser actors. That's true of the writing too, which is a lot better than you'd probably expect from a Hayes Code era movie about bigamy.
That's the biggest takeaway from this probably: This could've really been an exploitative mess, and it's more just a male-centered victimhood tragedy. Worth a watch.",4.0

"Lupino takes a very humane, empathetic approach to all of the characters in The Bigamist. Particularly for the era, this feels more nuanced than most films would have been. It looks at feelings of infertility guilt in a relationship, loneliness, and escalations of infidelity. Even at an Asian restaurants, the actors aren't made to have over the top accents and the main point of discussion is how inauthentic the food is to the actual cuisine. The film dives a bit into melodrama at times, while also taking on film noir trappings with the narration style and crime aspect. In some ways, the narrative framing is one of the weakest aspects, mostly because it makes everything from the point of view of the man (though this is counterbalanced by Lupino being behind the camera). Overall, another great effort by Lupino, continuing to show she's one of the more interesting directors of the era.",4.0

Insane this was made during the Hays Code era, which just further confuses me as to what's allowed.
A truly wild fact I learned minutes after watching is that the writer was ex-husband of Lupino, and left her to marry Fontaine before this movie was even made, which sheds this movie in a whole 'nother light (it also makes the viewpoint of this movie make a bit more sense)

"""Harry Graham is in no sense a hero, but neither is he a monster. He's an ordinary man.""
I think this statement encapsulates Harry's character. Truly, he is nothing but ordinary. There is nothing glamorous nor interesting about him. But also there's nothing remarkably devious and/or wicked? Like it's almost like a petty crime he committed (not to overlook what he did to phyllis and eve). But I really think that it's really just his indecision, lack of self-confidence, stupidity, and incompetence!!! He's one hollow, uninteresting, ordinary man - and this is the worst kind of man to be attached and associated with. Who said that quote that's like ""It's a crime to be boring.""

"I'm not sure what point The Bigamist was trying to make, but I like the fact it can be interpreted in many ways. It could be about how the horrible decisions and lack of self-control that Harry made regarding his monogamy and love for one woman that eventually lead to consequences - and as aptly put by the judge at the end: consequences that come about from breaking the ""moral law"", not from the court.
It could also be about how the antiquated traditions in our society cause worst outcomes than are necessary - in this case, the lack of a polygamous society leads to three people heartbroken and a child that will grow up in a broken household. The Bigamist is a film that's morally flexible, but falls short when it comes to casting and likability of characters. I didn't really like them, and there was no connection at all - especially between Harry and his first wife.

"On the one hand, Lupino shows a bold treatment for bigamy (rather than an obvious take on ethical consequence) and whittles it down to three people who were tragically in denial. On the other hand, she also treats Harry and Phyllis' affair as occasionally swooning, which is unproductive for a scandalous topic. (Only a masterpiece like Brief Encounter can bring pathos because the liaison is already cemented as fatal.) I did become riveted at how the narrative is opened up by the cry of a newborn baby. That said, because Phyllis is in the adjacent room, it's easy to recognize how Harry's extended flashback to Mr. Jordan will play out.
Loneliness is the main reason. Though he's married to Joan Fontaine's infertile Eve (who gets promptly introduced at Mr. Jordan's adoption agency) it's suggestive they haven't discussed the distance in their marriage. He's a traveling salesman that goes to L.A. often, while she's at home in San Francisco managing the paperwork, but her chipper naïveté doesn't seem to notice if their relationship is strained. He's certainly feeling it, though, and the headstrong approach to get closer with Phyllis (which is also telling that she's unconcerned about Harry's past life) makes for a subversive case on blithe ignorance.
This began with a funny coincidence for Edmund Gwenn, who'd later appear in The Trouble with Harry, and is investigating the troubled Harry. Nor did its amusing self-awareness escape me when Gwenn's name is mentioned on the Hollywood tour bus for his role as Santa in Miracle on 34th Street. (No doubt, by learning of Harry's double life, he won't be providing fatherly kindness at all!) Afterwards, his role is sidelined for Edmond O'Brien from The Hitch-Hiker (which Lupino also directed) and she stars as Phyllis who he'll take under his bigamous wing. Try leading that life when you're married to another woman.
Of the performances, Fontaine's casually effortless mix of resolute, sensitive and obtuse did make me empathetic. Her screentime is less pronounced (and it's possible she could've been balanced out) though Lupino's fetching work as someone who's resistant to experience heartbreak again is equally strong. Meanwhile, O'Brien's capable enough as a careless nitwit, essentially the maker of his own trap. I've now seen two films that Lupino directed, and her skill is functional, which ultimately gets negated by speechifying Harry's predicament in the courtroom. By depicting a taboo topic, though, it sporadically turns complex. The end result is around that fair-to-middling range.",3.0
"A classic melodramatic situation: A man loves two women, both love him. One cannot have children, the other can. Problem: He has been married to the first one for eight years. An even bigger problem: He marries the second one as well.
This is exactly the situation of Harry Graham, a respected salesman from San Francisco. He wants to adopt a child with his wife Eve, but because of this his private life is being investigated. In the process, the officer in charge eventually comes across his second life in Los Angeles, where he already has a baby. This double game is not only questionable from a moral point of view, especially towards the women. By marrying, Harry is also officially breaking the law.
And that is already a jumping off point for Ida Lupino's film. ""The Bigamist"" is not a classic melodrama and especially not a moral lesson. Instead of artificial construction, the director and actress of the second wife Phyllis builds here on consistent realism, which is, however, much more tragic and absurd. None of the characters is really bad, after all. Harry has become somewhat estranged from his wife as she devotes herself more and more to business due to her inability to give birth. He still loves Eve, but now has a certain surplus of love left over and feels lonely on business trips. That's why the shrewd Phyllis quickly wins his heart, who is equally lonely. Everyone loves each other, no one has any malicious intent. Of course, Harry makes a short-sighted mistake that puts him in a moral dilemma. But far be it from Lupino to condemn him for it. On the contrary, she empathises with him, both the high of romantic love and the low of hopeless pain. This is precisely what makes the whole thing so tragic: There is no bad guy, only a guilty one. One whose best, even pure intention brings misfortune for all.
Lupino's realism, however, is not only characterised by a complex humanistic understanding of morality. Rather, it is also her skilful directing. In what is probably her best-known film, ""The Hitch-Hiker"", this is characterised by concentrated minimalism and concise visual language. Here, in keeping with the genre of melodrama, it is particularly the acting and dialogue. Ironically, the latter are so realistic precisely because they in a way anticipate the postmodern speech of Godard and especially Tarantino. Harry's conversation with Phyllis about Chinese food could have been had by Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield. But it gets even better when they rant about films and stars on the bus tour during which they get to know each other. The highlight: Harry is a big fan of ""Miracle on 34th Street"" with Edmund Gwenn. But Gwenn also plays the official in charge of adoption in this film.
These are everyday conversations that you would also have in person, but that's why they are so unusual for Hollywood. You believe every other emotional, profound word the characters say, because they talk like real people. But what makes this even better is the outstanding ensemble. The aforementioned Gwenn is delightfully old-fashioned, in an appropriate way, but basically just a supporting character. At the centre, of course, is the love triangle. The ladies are both terrific as usual, especially in their contrariness. The American ideal clings to Fontaine, the somewhat bourgeois, but she gives it something exceedingly human through such fundamentally authentic honesty. Lupino is not at all the ideal type, but all the more likeable because of her perky charisma, her sovereign femininity and her melancholy passion. Both are not mere halves of a personality or puzzle pieces that fit into each other, but real people. Secretly, however, Edmond O'Brien as Harry steals the show. His performance is quiet, introverted, even inconspicuous. Yet he portrays such a deep and sincere emotional life that one feels so deeply for him in his self-inflicted tragedy. He has no star appeal, is no one extraordinary. As his attorney puts it in court, ""He's certainly no hero, but he's no monster either."" Harry is simply a real human being.
And with this simple fact, Ida Lupino creates a small masterpiece. Her production is sensitive but not fragile. She looks very closely at the silent yet screaming with thought and emotion faces of the characters, but also always keeps track of the whole. Rarely has American cinema been so empathetic, so real. Even before Cassavetes and almost more than Fuller, Lupino here defines an independent American cinema that simply tells of life. At the same time, she already anticipates the cinematic reflection for which her male colleagues are later celebrated like gods. One must rewrite the canon in two ways. Lupino, Fuller, Cassavetes, but also Tarantino, Godard, Lupino.",4.0

Depois do casal protagonista ter uma entrevista com Mr. Jordan, tendo em vista avançar com o processo de adoção de uma criança, Eve diz alegremente que gostou do entrevistador. “Mr. Jordan looks like Santa Claus, just like a man who gives babies away”, refere a esposa infértil de sorriso na cara. A frase faz pouco sentido, uma vez que o Pai Natal, apesar de estar associado à celebração do nascimento de Cristo, não é exatamente conhecido por ser uma cegonha que leva recém-nascidos ao ninho de pais jovens. Essa linha de diálogo é proferida com o intuito exclusivo de piscar o olho ao espectador, sublinhando o facto de Edmund Gwenn, que interpreta Mr. Jordan, ter sido o ator que interpretou o célebre Pai Natal de Miracle on 34th Street (1947). Se esta alusão me pareceu de mau-gosto setenta anos depois do lançamento de ambos os filmes, imagino que na épica tal referência extradiegética tenha feito revirar alguns olhos. Mas o estranho é que o argumento insiste nessa nota! Aquando da visita de autocarro a Beverly Hills, o motorista diz aos passageiros que eles estão a passar diante a casa de Edmund Gwenn, o famoso ator que protagonizou o filme Miracle on 34th Street. Menciono estes dois episódios que podem passar despercebidos para mostrar como o argumento de Bigamist (1953) está repleto de frases fuleiras dignas de um melodrama de segunda. A questão é que Lupino tenta desviar a atenção do espectador com uma banda sonora próxima daquela de um filme de terror e com um arco narrativo que assume a forma de um pseudo film-noir. The Bigamist nunca assume aquilo que verdadeiramente é: um melodrama assente num dilema moral. A voz-over mascara a trama em tons de noir, mas os resultados são quase paródicos por vezes, o que não me pareceu propositado. Ademais, os próprios contornos do melodrama são corriqueiros: o elemento que mais me cativou foi a emasculação de Harry face ao sucesso da sua esposa e a maneira como ele procura, sob o bode expiatório da solidão e distância, reconquistar a sua masculinidade ao trair a esposa.",2.0

"Ida Lupino entende a importância do rosto diante de uma câmera. Uma face tem, no cinema, um veículo de extremo poder. Mais que a fotografia cuja tecnologia congela um momento em particular, o cinema conta suas histórias através das nuances de nossas expressões, sejam elas mais contidas ou não. Na entrevista para a adoção de uma criança, Harry e Eve carregam em seus rostos expressões distintas. A segunda é a felicidade em pessoa, enquanto o primeiro, ainda que esboce um sorriso, parece reticente, confirmando-se quando Mr. Jordan comenta que precisa vasculhar a vida de ambos os pais para confiar uma criança a eles. A forma que a estória é contada nas imagens prima pela sutileza e melancolia, indo da felicidade à tristeza, do alívio a culpa de uma cena a outra, mas se incorrer de qualquer excesso, tanto narrativo quanto imagético. Harry não esconde, através de falas e comportamentos, seu desejo por uma mulher que precise dele.
Ao contar a história a Jordan, um flashback nos leva para meses antes, para o bígamo andando nas ruas de Los Angeles, sozinho, sentindo-se inútil. Ele atravessa uma rua, anda em uma calçada enquanto comenta, na narração, que seu casamento se tornou uma “sociedade anônima”. É quando Lupino o faz observar um manequim feminino na vitrine de uma loja. O desejo do homem, naquele momento, está expresso no movimento de câmera. Jordan, assim como o espectador, ouve toda a história, conhece cada um dos envolvidos– o que transforma o filme num grande estudo de personagens – e profere que não consegue definir seus sentimentos por Harry e seus atos. Somos levados ao julgamento e ali, o juiz, diz que a sentença sairá na semana seguinte. A sentença é do espectador e ele dará na próxima semana, ou daqui a um mês ou ano. É por isso que o cinema vibra, assim como os rostos que contam essas histórias.",0.0
"52 movies by woman.
Após dirigir ""O Mundo é o culpado"", Ida Lupino produziu outro filme de um assunto polêmico, nesse caso: Bigamia. O roteiro é bem esperto, principalmente por não escolher ir pelo lado mais fácil ao vilanizar completamente o protagonista ou ir pelo lado mais idiota como justificar essas ações (Igual a ""Todas as mulheres do mundo""), o filme prefere apenas mostrar por quais razões o protagonista tomou essas desições e as consequências de seus atos.
Não vejo nada de ruim pra falar da direção da Ida Lupino nesse filme, os primeiros 20 minutos do filme é algo completamente diferente que eu esperaria de um filme sobre esse tema, o que foi uma boa supresa, o elenco é ótimo, as atuações da Joan Fontaine e da própria Ida Lupino são as minhas favoritas, mas sinceramente não existe ator ruim nessa trama, todos muito bem escalados.
Os 20 minutos iniciais e um certo momento lá pro final do filme demonstram o quanto que Ida era uma diretora talentosa e como poderia se arriscar em outros gêneros e se daria muito bem, mas ela não decepciona nesse melodrama.
""The Bigamist"" é tudo aquilo que você espera de um filme da Ida Lupino numa história dramática de moralidade, ética e personalidade.",0.0

13. The 1950’s
An interesting tale about, you guessed it, a bigamist in the 1950’s. I am curious why they chose to name the film The Bigamist, as they could have added about half an hour of suspense. It’s about a man and woman (Edmond O’Brien and Joan Fontaine) who want to adopt a child so are getting investigated by the agency. It’s then that it’s uncovered that the potential father is already married to Phyllis (Ida Lupino).
This is the first film directed by Ida Lupino that I’ve seen and I really enjoyed what she did with it. She used unique shots and stillness & quiet to make a very uncomplicated story much more interesting. I also felt that she drew out a much different performance from Fontaine than I’ve seen before. I’m a big Fontaine fan but rarely has she appeared as confident, or commanding.
The only issue I took with the film was O’Brien. He was nowhere near charming enough to convince me that he’d get one woman to marry him, let alone two.
I can’t wait to check out other Lupino directed films now though!

The last shot, where eve is alone (as opposed as when she was about to sign the papers for adoption) powerfully expressed how women can’t never have it all - they have to chose between independence and career and a family life.

"Ida Lupino masterfully handling delicately balanced subject matter — finding the interesting but not overly-melodramatic space between noir, realism, and morality play. The realism gives this its grounding, and the fact that Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine are acting in each others roles in relation to their mutual partner writer/producer Collier Young is very intriguing and I wish I had a bts... not to mention Lupino starring in and directing this picture. It's not perfect, it has some clunk to the pacing and I wish O'Brien's character had a little bit more to him... I enjoyed watching the actor, but the story was really about the two women and I felt he was taking up a little bit too much space to be acting simply as a framing device. My instinct is more depth to the character but a version of this with him less in the center could be interesting. Great performances from Lupino and Fontaine, and some fantastic unreliable narrator stuff when describing his marriage to Fontaine (which never appears quite as bad as he describes, but which I believed enough to go along with until later in the movie when I realized... ""that was it?"").

"As others have often suggested, The Bigamist distinguishes itself from other films and the entire culture of 1950s American with its willingness to submerge itself in moral ambiguity. While it seems at times that the film takes romanticized leaps in the establishment of its relationships in order to avoid painting any of its characters in a negative light, Lupino was still daring in her attempt to portray an adulterer as anything other than utterly contemptable in the era in question. With the majority of the outcome determined relatively early in the runtime, there remains an underlying suspense as the audience follows the tired, moderate protagonist in his increasingly difficult situation, with lies piled on lies to preserve his veneer of respectability. Toes the line between an exploration of human weakness and simple melodrama, but overall remains effective thanks in part to a short runtime.",3.5
"Expected/wanted a lurid, melodramatic shocker - ""look how evil and disgusting this man is for having two wives!"" - but this is actually a very sensitive, even-handed, and even moving drama about a cowardly but basically decent man in a complicated situation. Which is far more shocking for 1953 - this seems like it must have barely gotten by the production code. Everyone is taken seriously, the women aren't blamed or pitted against each other... it's just really sincere and solid.
Matters of historical note:
- With this, Ida Lupino became the first woman to direct and star in the same American film. She's incredibly confident in front of and behind the camera - her performance is really wonderful and layered and you have to imagine that most male directors making domestic dramas around this time would have flattened her character out.
- This movie was written and produced by Lupino's ex-husband, Collier Young, whom she divorced in 1951 while pregnant with her next husband's child. Young then married this film's other star, Joan Fontaine, in 1952. So this is probably the first (if not only) Hollywood film in which two women who had been married to the same guy played two women who were married to the same guy. I have no idea how they all dealt with each other during production but considering the circumstances, the fact the film ended up feeling so emotionally mature goes from being impressive to damn near heroic.

This is very good; Ida Lupino was a super bad ass woman. On-location LA, noir voiceover/structure, and a psychological warfare that’s almost more on the viewer than ol’ Eddy boy or his wives. Hollywood tour bus scene mighta been my favorite; the sloppy desperation of Harry’s flirting came alive, especially with Phyllis’ chainsmoking and lonely irritability. The adoption detective might go a lil more hard in the paint than is believable but besides that, everything clicks. It’s almost like being on a torture rack, especially since Joan Fontaine’s Eve is a smart, dominant 50s female character who is completely devoid of any conventional deviousness which those things were always inextricable with in Hollywood at the time (and if not devious, you’d be hard pressed to find a smart, dominant, AND gorgeous woman in the so called Golden Age)... yet, come on, who’s watching this and not telling Harry to dump her and tie up Ida. I mean, she’s IDA. Lady was directing some bangers in ‘53!",4.0
"For an older film, The Bigamist’s editing and cinematography combo is on fucking point. A lot of it’s thrills and drama rely on it, and the way it reveals information is incredible. For example, there’s a phenomenal scene where the the adoption counselor visits Harry’s second home she talks to him at the door about why his changed his name. The whole time there’s this ominous music building up to something, but you don’t know what until it crescendos into a baby crying. Suddenly, everything is dead quiet, and the camera that’s been focused on the two’s faces revealing so little about the house zooms out and shows a room full of children’s toys and a stroller. I’m a little mad I never got shown this in any filmmaking classes I’ve taken.
It also takes quite the interesting and surprisingly ahead of its time approach to the subject of adultery. It by no means shows it in any positive light, but during a time in which you could get arrest for it, The Bigamist bravely aims to showcase the psychology and people behind this family destroying tragedy, and finds the truth in that it ultimately doesn’t come from any dissatisfaction with your partner, but rather oneself.",3.5

"There is an air of emotional desperation to The Bigamist that hews closely to the other Ida Lupino films I have seen (The Hitch-Hiker and On Dangerous Ground, which she directed part of when Nicholas Ray had medical issues to attend to). Its protagonist is a man who fancies himself a relatively straight shooter yet who finds himself, almost against his will, with two families in two cities. The film largely takes place in flashback, after he has already justified his actions in his mind (though not quite forgiven himself for them), so the narrative pacing is assured and matter-of-fact. And yet there's a dissonance between the events we see unfold and the assumed moral stance of the character as he lives them, resulting in a noir-ish atmosphere despite the volatility being all emotional and the only crimes relating to contract law. Lupino herself is the acting MVP as the man's second wife, her steely coyness belying passionate fear in a way not too dissimilar from the film itself.",3.0

Exclusivity in love, albeit the conveniences that come with it, is one of the most normalized ideas in life that I find myself at odds with. The film follows a man who marries two different women in two different cities, and leads a double life. Since all three characters are given ample opportunity to tell their own stories and since nobody is demonized, the well-constructed drama puts us in an impossible position to pick sides, which incidentally is the basic idea of polyamory itself.

"I might be a bit of an outlier here, but this is quite extraordinary. Had this realization in a class discussion, but this film doesn’t work as it is if any of the three main characters can be characterized as either hero or villain. They have to be people who stumble into their circumstances, understandable in each individual action, even as it builds into a scandalous big picture.
For me, this is most interesting for what it does with genre— Lupino uses so many of the stylistic hallmarks of noir, the story wants to be a noir, but the protagonist is so not a noir protagonist that the film never gets there. He’s too passive, too (ironically, as the judge points out) honorable. There are so many other roads this plot could have traveled, and it’s those left untaken that make what Lupino does with it so fascinating.",4.5
I was having hard time getting into this one. Not sure if it was the cramps or the nausea.,0.0
"I like Ida Lupino as an actor. Her characters always feel intelligent. The fact that she seldom got the films she deserved and was often at odds with the studios adds to the charisma: it gives a sense of an unachieved greater talent. But, apparently, she was a reluctant actor, feeling she was pushed into it by the traditions of her theatrical family. She thought there were more interesting things to do. To become a film director, however, she had to found her own company, The Filmmakers. This was a joint enterprise with her writer-producer husband, Collier Young – they continued their creative partnership after they were divorced: by the time The Bigamist was filmed Young had married Joan Fontaine. I’m aware that Lupino has been championed at least since the 1980s as an under appreciated director: in a way, there are still many voices acclaiming her talent, while there is still the sense that she is under appreciated. I don’t know many of her films, just three from the first half of the 1950s, and I’m as yet not fully convinced by the claims of her importance. They are all small budget melodramas and crime movies – and I like small budget Hollywood melodramas and crime movies, so I am sympathetic to the sort of films Lupino made. I have seen her compared to Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller as a film director smuggling a bold modernist aesthetic into Hollywood genre movies…but I’m not sure. I find her more of a no-nonsense director, her style a simpler method of getting the story done. Of her contemporaries she is closer to Don Siegel and looks back to an older Warner Bros style. The Bigamist begins with Harry Graham (Edmond O’Brien) and Eve Graham (Joan Fontaine) applying to adopt a child; the counsellor (Edmund Gwenn) says he will be running background checks – at first Harry seems reluctant about giving permission: the film’s title gives away why he is a little shifty. A travelling salesman, it turns out that Harry has another wife, Phyllis (Ida Lupino), in Los Angeles. When caught out by the counsellor, the film goes into a long flashback as Harry explains what happened. The film is surprisingly sympathetic to the law breaker. In a way Harry is similar to the weak man in film noirs who get lured into criminality, but here he is not lured, rather he is emotionally split between two women and allows himself to passively follow events. Eve, unable to have children, throws herself into her career and is perhaps dominating at home: she organises Harry. And he is away a lot and then she is away when her father is ill – Harry is lonely and meets Phyllis. There’s would be a fairly conventional Hollywood romance if we didn’t know Harry was already married. Harry marries Phyllis when he finds out she is pregnant – in a way he does the ‘decent’ thing in marrying her. This is an interesting situation, but I’m not convinced the treatment gives it any great intricacies. The ending is surprisingly open: Harry gives himself up and is put on trial, but we don’t hear how the court finally treats him: the future is open…and the emotional entanglements haven’t been fully resolved. (There are a series of annoying in-jokes about Edmund Gwenn: maybe they were a modernist distancing device, but they were probably cringy jokes.)

"Alongside noir The Hitch-Hiker earlier that same year, 1953’s The Bigamist would be actor Ida Lupino’s final big screen credit as a director until the Hayley Mills family comedy The Trouble with Angels (1966) over a decade later, though she became a fixture of directing rosters for major television series of the time, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Thriller and The Untouchables. Lupino’s work as an actor in thrillers and comedies remains well remembered and regarded, but just as much of her filmmaking career was driven by a passion for writing, producing and directing. An independent production company she established facilitated much of this before it closed shop and the TV work started, and its existence outside the traditional studio system factored into the unique body of work produced...

"Could be one of the most honest and heartfelt looks at loneliness in Los Angeles. Ida Lupino’s Phyllis is every single woman in that city, working some lackluster food service job, not looking for love in the wrong places but finding it anyway. Sometimes you don’t have a choice when you’re trapped on a bus with a docile, dough-faced and domiciled Edmund O’Brien. She does her best though. Her best being cagey and wary of any and all kinds of hucksters (Which Ida might’ve been the best at. No one gave better side-eye) who mask their inappropriateness with the excuses of loneliness. But that’s what this movie is about, really. Loneliness in large cities. And how they encroach and overlap onto each other.",5.0

When I first watched this last year, it was on the DVD release from a few years ago, which is a good print overall but has some scenes with missing frames.
This time I watched the new Kino Lorber Blu-Ray, which had no hint of missing frames anywhere. The only odd-thing is that the blu-ray was presented in wide-screen aspect ratio (close to 16:9) while the older release was the typical-for-1953 4:3 aspect ratio.  I’m not sure why Kino Lorber did that trimming — very puzzling.  Fortunately I don’t think it had any significant impact on the film experience.",4.5
"I really enjoyed this. Feels very modern for something made 67 years ago. The performances are probably the stand out parts of the film.
I've been watching Marvellous Mrs. Maisel a lot recently, so female stories set in the 1950s is something I've seen quite a bit of, so it was really interesting to see one of those sort of stories actually from that era. It's a crime more women weren't given the platform to tell more of their stories in the 'golden age' of cinema, I feel we've definitely missed out on a lot masterpieces as a result.",4.5
"I didn’t expect much from this movie: another story of how horrible men are. But here, the director plays on your expectations and reveals the truth about double relationship very quickly. Instead of how, she answers why. And leaves you with very mixed feelings about the whole thing.
It has all pitfalls of a melodrama, but it’s short and doesn’t have much fat on the story. With good acting and classic cinematography it was a surprisingly good movie.",4.0
"Y'know, I'd probably better believe the film's insistence that poor beleaguered Harry genuinely loved both women if either of them were given greater depth than the usual surface-level reflection-of-male-protagonist's-desires most film noir women are characterised as, and if Edmond O'Brien could out-perform the guy in a secondary school play who has robotically learned all his lines and exact stage placement with accompanying facial expressions yet delivers them all like he'd rather be anywhere else.",2.5
"Phwoooooar. Just loved this. 78 minutes of noir-ish guilt and despair. All the leads are excellent, particularly Lupino, lurking off-screen until she absolutely needs to show up, and the film likes all of them. The Bigamist himself, rather than being a scheming monster, is weak and blundering and unmalicious, and looks like he's going to be sick with guilt for most of the film. Both Fontaine and Lupino's characters seem to know more than they're letting on, and his crisis is both convincing and funny. He needs them both, but neither of them seem to need him all that much. A glance towards the end is a sly acknowledgement of the real lives of Fontaine and Lupino (Lupino's husband left her for Fontaine just before this was shot), and you just wonder how this might have ended with no Hays Code to make sure everything was Morally Upstanding. Really excellent.",5.0
"A simple story but filmed and written with great empathy for all the characters, they arent victimised but respected as individuals in a tough situation. It surprisingly strays away from too much moralistic condemnation of the man, rather showing us the growing effect his deceipt has on him and his partners and their families, this giving him guilt enough.",3.0
"Marriage Stories
I have mixed feelings about The Bigamist. It's a good film. The three core characters are sympathize-able. The performances are all good. The chemistry between Harry and Phyllis (whose actress directed the film) is came off as genuine. The story's good and interesting. A problem it does have though is the framing device. The story being told in past tense kills a few scenes drama.
I guess my core problem is with trying to redeem the title character John Bigamist to an extent for his bigamy. The movie presents arguments for why he wasn't too wrong and it made me see polygamy as not as bad as before. But I still have a problem with it. Maybe I just didn't enjoy watching it. Check it out though. It is worth watching.",3.5

"While you would expect a Code-era movie to be completely of condemning of bigamy, but Ida Lupino takes a fairly psychologically realistic take of the emotions that could lead a man to live two lives...and with an ending as morally ambivalent as the time would allow.
Though The Bigamist is far less visually striking than her masterpiece The Hitch-Hiker, the movie should serve as an example for the sort of emotionally complex film that a good filmmaker could smuggle into a Hollywood melodrama",4.0

"A film that jumps straight into the story, and keeps going at that pace for the duration of its short run time. It wastes no time setting the scene and we're straight into the set up, an adoption investigator (not a PI - but pretty close, for what is pretty close to a noir in tone), is investigating a couple trying to adopt a child, and is suspicious about Mr Graham.
Because of the title, we know exactly what Mr Graham's secret will be, the film doesn't attempt to tease it out and by the ~20th minute, we've seen his second family.
From here we then flashback to how he got himself into this situation, and the film takes an unusual approach to this, ""morally"" speaking. Considering the era and country, you might imagine that an American film from the early 50s about a bigamist / adulterer would make him out to be a villain, or a monster. However, he comes across a lot more sympathetic, looking like a lonely man who falls in love with two women simultaneously - treating them both (in some form) well and honestly. There's no rivalry between the two women, and there's no sense that the film is playing them off against each other - a weaker film might have shown the two women as opposites, one maternal, the other a floozy etc, but not here.
The film's close with the judge's speech supports this, with a nuanced conclusion that Mr Graham may be more honourable for marrying and attempting to provide for two women, than keeping one as a mistress. We see lingering glances from both Eve and Phyllis, hinting at some sort of redemption for Harry.
There's no filler or fluff here, the film has no superfluous scenes or digressions, just cracks on with the story.
The version I saw on MUBI was a little bit cracky, with what appears to be frames missing at times, which gives it a bit of a jumpy feel. Certain sections and scenes appear less preserved than others, which is a shame - but it's not a visually stunning film, so perhaps less critical.",0.0
"A very smart noir-melodrama (not many of those), which balances the two on a razor-thin line that doesn't falter much. The cast is excellent, helping to sell the bizarre tone of the film and making everything grounded, especially the two females and Edmund Gwynn. It makes you really wish that Lupino would have had more opportunities to expand her scope because she could have made some monumental films if given material to work with (imagine, for example, her Peyton Place). She has real respect and balance for all of the characters -- even the bigamist isn't vilified here as he is understood, if not forgiven.",4.5

Instead of the film directly condemning the leading male for his bigamy, we as the audience are allowed to make a decision for ourselves. A very smart, interesting little film - can't wait to check out the rest of Ida Lupino's work!

"I called her, but we didn’t talk about us. She was in one of her executive moods. Anyway, when I got off the phone, I was twice as lonely
Things I loved about this movie:
—The adoption agent Mr Jordan’s horrified reaction upon seeing a fluffy panda toy, a key clue in revealing the bigamist’s secret wife and child (but what if he just liked having fluffy pandas around?)
— Yeah, some directors make films starring their partners during and after their relationships and I’d love to watch and compare them. But as a directorial move I simply must prefer getting your ex-husband to do just a cameo and getting his new partner (Joan Fontaine!) to play someone whose husband has an affair with you...
—The mournful music playing while the bigamist walks round town looking at mannequins in shop and his voiceover recounts how his marriage to Joan Fontaine started going wrong when she starts helping out with his business and 'doubled our sales in no time’. This picture receives the inaugural ‘fragile masculinity’ tag (created in its honour) in recognition of this moment
—When the bigamist starts talking about how important their relationship is to him and Joan Fontaine just rolls over in bed and disengages, like a cat.

It sounds a bit ridiculous reduced down to little points like this. The film is funny, and does have something of the ridiculous in it, but for me this didn’t take away from its emotional power. The bigamist is so unattractive, both physically and emotionally, and so lacking and bumbling and, as his lover says, ‘a big lug’ — and of course, he is a bigamist.
His courtship of Ida Lupino is clumsy, he is lonely, but not in a cool, aesthetic looking out of windows way; it is embarrassing. He is passive, confused, unable to express himself, wanting attention but wanting to be alone, desperate to please women without (perhaps I’m biased here by how physically repellent I find him) having any apparent ability to do so. If I were being cruel, I would say that rather than being a betrayer he is just so incorrigible of a simp that this tendency requires more than one wife to exhaust itself on.
But (and this may just be telling on myself) unfortunately for me, it’s still so fucking romantic! Lupino said, I like to do films [about] poor, bewildered people, because that’s what we are, and maybe I'm just a melt but that thought stuck in my throat (if that's even possible) a little. Fewer torrid, purely doomed or dramatic romances, more bewildered ones, please!
Oddly enough, despite all his secrecy surrounding his uh, bigamy, the bigamist confesses the start of his affair to his wife immediately over the phone, before it tips over into the criminal. I cheated on you today, I thought you should be the first to know! he smiles, but she so obviously wouldn't believe him that it turns into a joke, and amusingly but actually rather sadly he ends up the one feeling hurt at her complete lack of jealousy, even when he begins to describe their meeting.
Don’t you want to know whether I have someone in my life, whether I’ve been to jail, all that? he says as he dances with Ida Lupino.
No. I like you as you are. The way we are.
Both his wife and his lover-turned-wife don’t really want to know about him, or laugh at him when he tries to tell them. Now, of course, Ida Lupino doesn’t like the bigamist as he is, who would? He is rather pathetic and looks like something you left in your fridge, hoping it would somehow appear more appetising the next day. It’s so obvious yet glorious to me that I like you as you are means ‘I like you as I know you now, which is to say, very little. Let's keep it that way’, and that is the gift someone so fundamentally lacking offers a partner.
Someone else on Letterboxed said : He wants to keep them both living in fragile, unknowing happiness, which might be the most touching and unexpected aspect of the movie. A status quo based on dishonesty can't be maintained, no matter how comfortable it may be, and that's exceptionally heartbreaking to realize.
And yes, it’s a bit patronising of the bigamist to assume none of them can cope with the truth, but it also is sort of heartbreaking too, that it is only by lying and, more crucially, never really making himself known, that he can maintain his relationships.
In not giving anything away, particularly about his bigamy but also in just not having very much to give in the first place, the bigamist is allowing the women in his life some happiness, at least temporarily. He is not even that selfish, really, and his character is too nice and bumbling to be a ‘patriarchy is terrible’ demonstration (tbf it is a more subtle one, perhaps, but not just that). The romance feels, for me, too real as well as silly to be purely contemptuous of him.",3.5
"Human relationships are complex. People do bad things even with the best of intentions, or they don't do what they should, often out of cowardice. Though their victims are (or at least should be) the focus of our compassion, we can sometimes understand and extend our sympathy to the wrongdoer, though it's hard when you're the victim and still feel that way. The ambiguity at the end of this movie reminded me of the complexity of my own feelings in a somewhat similar situation, so I think it managed to capture something important, even though I didn't quite like how it had to spell out some of its conclusions.
What interested me the most here was what it meant to be a woman in the 1950s, to be seen and treated as one, and the importance of marriage in that reality. This is an interesting answer from Ida Lupino, who also acts as one of the bigamist's wives. I don't know of many women-directors who worked in this period, so I'm curious to see The Hitch-Hiker tonight, another one of hers, which seems to be the first noir directed by a woman.",0.0

"The Bigamist was one of eight films directed by Ida Lupino and as such it’s getting something of a re-evaluation now that people are eager to re-discover female contributions to film. As the title implies, the film is about a guy who marries two women through a series of mistakes and bad decisions. That could have been the material of a comedy but the movie is actually deadly serious and approaches the situation as something of an “issue movie,” almost like an after school special for adults. Though the film features Joan Fontaine it’s not a particularly large production and has a bit of a “poverty row” feel to it. I’ll give it this, the film does ultimately see some nuance in this situation even if it does so by laying its take out in an on the nose speech in a courtroom at the end. Don’t take this to mean I don’t think the movie is interesting, it is, but is it a classic? Eh.",3.0

"Such a pioneering film for its era! The Bigamist reveals his hand quite early in the film and so makes the audience complicit in the duplicity as secrets are unearthed when a couple try to adopt a child. Rather than passing judgement on the bigamist, the film portrays a sympathetic character attempting to be all things to the women in its life but lacking the strength of character to make an affirmative choice. The two women involved are developed well as characters with the director herself portraying one of the characters. There is the question regarding the moral ambiguity of the protagonist given the levels of censorship in film in effect during the period.
The Bigamist has aged well and its cinematography and use of lighting within the close ups are impressive. Its structure does seem reminiscent of film noir with some humorous elements which make it an enjoyable watch.",3.5

"Film School Dropouts 2020 Weeky Challenge - Week 18 – April 29- May 5 - Auteur - Ida Lupino
The theme for this week was to watch a film directed by Ida Lupino, one of the very, very few women directing films in the era and pretty much the only one to do so in the noir genre. It is probably safe to say that Lupino brought a certain sensitivity to film-making, a sensitivity accompanied by a higher degree of complexity and nuance.
I have to admit that I am a little conflicted with THE BIGAMIST. In fact, if it had to have been directed by a male director I would have been inclined to dismiss it as being a bit of an apology piece for male behaviour. In THE BIGAMIST, Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien) a travelling salesman is married to Eve (Joan Fontaine), who runs the family business. Eve is not able to conceive leading the couple to pursue adoption. The adoption agency investigator (Edmund Gwenn) discovers that Harry is also married to Phyliss Martin (Ida Lupino), a waitress who he had gotten pregnant during a brief, but torrid fling on a road trip. The portrayal of all of these characters is what gives me pause.
Eve is shown as being the business woman and it is largely implied that she blames her inability to conceive a child on her devoting herself to work rather than being an appropriately pregnant housewife. Phyliss is a kind of broken woman. Outwardly tough and unbreakable, but inwardly wanting to be loved, but believing that she is not capable of having that life. The women are stereotypes that seem to reinforce expected gender roles of the time. Harry is portrayed as being the ultimate male provider. He provides the economic and emotional support that both women require, he frets about his mistakes and he feels bad about them, but is unable to owe up to his mistakes because he is too good a guy. When he is found out, everybody has sympathy for him. Everybody! The adoption investigator, the judge in the criminal case. Even the two women whose trust he betrayed! All feel sorry for he because he is Such a Good Guy! Bullshit! He is a man that had an affair and was too cowardly to owe up to it, so he continued to lead a double life of lies and betrayal. This is why I can see this film as the ultimate, borderline misogynistic fantasy piece. But..... It is directed by Ida Lupino.
Ida Lupino developed a reputation of pushing boundaries, of making socially relevant films about controversial subjects that the studios would not touch. She was a true avante-garde, pioneering filmmaker. Because of her reputation I have to question my reaction to THE BIGAMIST as I outlined before. Ida Lupino does not strike me as the kind of director that would make a film that reinforces such rigid gender roles. So, I am conflicted, I cannot really figure out what Lupino is trying to say with this film. I am wondering if I am missing something in this film. Maybe she is making a comment that human relationships are complicated and maybe monogamy is not the ideal (that would be a hugely powerful statement to make today, let alone in 1953!). Perhaps Lupino is being deliberately ironic. I wonder if she wants viewers to have the reaction that I did. Maybe she is very deliberately making such a blatantly male-positive film that she is hoping people will say, ""Hang on a minute. This is just not right."" At least, that is what I am going to hold onto. Maybe I am missing something important about this film, but I do appreciate films that challenge me and make me think.",3.5
"Otra vez Ida Lupino se arremanga y se arma de valentía para tratar un tema polémico de la manera más compasiva posible, en este caso un hombre que ama a dos mujeres. La actuación del protagonista pero más iridiscentemente de la misma Lupino son los puntos altos de la cinta, así como el ritmo narrativo y el score. No disfruté viéndola ya que no compartí la idea de contar la historia en base a un flashback largo y luego resolverla rápidamente en una escena judicial casi sacada de una galera. Si vas a contar todo en un flashback debe resolverse en el momento presente, así creo que debiera ser, y así se procedió en por ejemplo, Double Indemnity de Wilder.
Ver películas de Lupino es un ejercicio en comprender a la humanidad, como debieran funcionar las películas y como funcionan las novelas decimonónicas.

This at first feels like it will be a creaky drama, but Lupino’s direction brings out richly textured and sensitively observed and subtle performances (not least of which from herself) and it is more naturalistic than expected. The Bigamist could have veered into being too preachy, but it doesn’t go there and is instead a thoughtful character study at heart.",4.0
"The fourth film in the Kino Lorber Ida Lupino Box Set. 
A very sympathetic detail of a man who has married two women. Focuses mainly on him while leaving any accounts of what the women go through to the side. While it doesn’t leave his deeds unpunished, the film still leans heavily in favor of understanding how he got into such a predicament and completely avoids any sense of lust. It still feels so unabashedly pure. 
I’d like to imagine a remake of this as an erotic thriller where the two women discover each other and their husband’s deceit, the women fall in love, and plot a wicked game of revenge. (This film probably already exists.)",3.0
"This one's tough. It feels like it's always walking a thin line, stretching the boundaries beyond the moral standard and not just taking its values for granted, but giving in to an ambiguity towards its subject matter that seems to be dealing with a constant back and forth, at times daring and at times cowardly.
It's definitely not without merit, there's plenty of interesting discourse among its sort of erratic/ambiguous focus and overall the whole starting point of the movie packs a lot of merit. The fact it asks questions, even if it doesn't dare to answer them clearly, is enough credit in such a deeply moralistic and restrictive environment as Hays Code Hollywood.
As for the movie itself, very good. Great performances by the three leads, with both Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine being absolutely charming in their romantic naïvety and devastating in their fear of loss, and Edmond O'Brien carrying smoothly the entire movie through his moral contradictions and self-pitiance. With a narrative structure that adds the aesthetic elegance and exclusivity of a good noir to this sort of mundane melodrama, it manages to feel both spontaneous and sophisticated.",4.0

"The central conceit of The Bigamist is an intriguing one but ultimately the film disappoints, as we become embroiled in the life of a seemingly ordinary man, albeit one with two wives. Edmond O'Brien stars as Harry Graham, in a peculiarly plain turn which makes you question how a man lacking in charm could end up wooing two lovely ladies. It feels like we are watching a tepid film-noir, without the mystery and suspense, as Harry questions his own morality whilst trying to work out who he really loves. There is a lot of wasted potential in The Bigamist - it's not totally without merit - but there is nothing particularly memorable that makes it worth seeking out this middling effort either.",2.5

The story presented, while trying to advocate for feminism in modern day society, falls short in trying to make a coherent message. This isn't a fault of the film makers or Ida Lupino but I believe a fault of the times. That being said the cinematography, editing, and score was done quite well. This film does very well when creating emotions of tension and anxiety, especially when the child adoption investigator discovers the main character's other family in Los Angeles, as opposed to his wife in San Francisco. Overall, the film structurally is done well (referencing to the previously established qualities) but fails as an effective story especially in modern society.",2.5

"The way in which it shows a suspicious man committing adultery & bigamy, and then shows his side of the story with every bit of the empathy that is usually reserved for the so-called victims in these stories, is both emotionally clever and utterly refreshing considering the time and the culture in which the film is made. The Bigamist seems to be saying that monogamy is not enough for all and it is indeed possible to love more than one person at a time.
I know nothing about the background but it's interesting to note that the screenwriter, Collier Young, was previously married to Ida Lupino (who directs and plays 'the other wife') and, when making this, married to the other lead actress Joan Fontaine.",4.0

"This movie led me down a much thornier path than I anticipated at first. The titular leading man is, if not sympathetic, then at least pitiable rather than villainous. The moral dilemma of the story stems not from malice, but from his inability to say and do what needs to be said and done — not from an unwillingness to hurt the people he loves, but an unwillingness to face them while he hurts them — and from his need to convince himself that by delaying the admission of his guilt he is actually protecting the people he has hurt instead of multiplying their pain.
That the bigamist is not a villain in the obvious way — not a predator, not a criminal, not a playboy — is the point. So is the fact that he is not really charming or charismatic, not particularly good looking, nor especially wealthy. He is thoroughly average, and his ordinariness exposes his flaws as social rather than (only) personal. You've heard of the banality of evil — well, here is the evil of banality. His evils are those of the white American male, who still perpetuates his abusive privilege even when he is convinced he has the best and purest intentions at heart.
Lupino never lets him off the hook, but also lets you feel for him if you're inclined to. But she also makes sure you pay attention to the women whose lives he has unraveled, that you never lose sight of the manipulation Harry Graham is engaging in even as he believes (and wants his audience to believe) that he just got caught up in an impossible situation, nothing he could do to fix it, poor sap. She expertly constructs a scenario in which no outcome is possible that will leave you feeling emotionally satisfied. It's complicated, ambiguous, and absolutely brutal.",4.0

In fact, the movie is shockingly sympathetic with the guy, without whitewashing his demeanor too much.
That said, this is also very, very boring. Setting 90 % of the story in a flashback, complete with voiceover narration, takes a lot of momentum out of it, and while the subject itself is fascinating to me, I always felt too much of a disconnect with the characters to really get into it.

Harry is frequently on the road and makes the acquaintance of Phyllis (Ida Lupino, the only time she directed herself in a major role). At first, it is merely a friendship between two lonely people but it eventually becomes sexual. Harry plans on confessing to Eve but finds she has changed, apologizing for being so distant as well as considering his suggestion of adoption. Things become complicated when Eve must leave for an extended period to help care for her dying father. Harry reunites with Phyllis only to learn she is pregnant and prepared to raise the child on her own. Harry wants to do right by Phyllis, proposing (and committing bigamy). At the same time, he plans to go through with the adoption plans so that Eve will not be alone when he divorces her. We learn all this in flashback when Harry confesses to Edmund Gwenn, who has been doing a deep background check because he had an uneasy feeling about Harry.

^ My thoughts exactly.

This was my first real Ida Lupino film (both in her acting and directing) and i loved it. I expected it to be a much more melodramatic tale of a vicious man with clear antagonism but as the film progressed it gets harder to hate him and you start to see things from his perspective (doesn’t excuse his stupid decisions from the beginning but at least he had the balls to not only name his wife and child but to do so in court while on trial).
I’ve always admired Joan Fontaine but for the first half of the film i just wasn’t feeling her performance; then, the phone call... you could see all the silent sadness in her eyes, like watching 8 years of her life break off into tiny little pieces. 
Yeah, i love Joan Fontaine. A lot.
Ida was amazing too, putting on the tough broad act with ease while playing the lovesick girl just as well. I’ll add that even though we only see the two women interact with each other once by sharing a glance across the courtroom, there was chemistry and i’m here for it.
(Bonus: The references to Edmund Gwenn’s character being like a Santa Claus (which he famously played the part of in Miracle on 34th Street) or the tour bus passing his home and mentioning his name and role in the movie. I died.)

"Ever since seeing some rando on Twitter talk about how modern movies are better pieces of art than films of the past, I've been trying to think about why that statement is wrong. I don't have to do any work, because Ida Lupino and her cast in The Bigamist do the work of disproving that statement. It's the talking that I find so entrancing. Film, though always a medium of action, has never gotten the art of two people talking together better than what is displayed in Lupino's film and countless other films from this time period. The dialogue may have gotten more stylized, the acting more naturalistic, but the act of talking rings truer here than in most modern filmmaking I've seen. I love how casual, how lived in the actors make the dialogue. That quality still exists today, but it was perfected in the past, and may still be even better then. I realize some people will just choose not to see what I see and hear what I hear in these old movies, but they are missing out on some of the richest art of the twentieth century.

I was interested in The Bigamist mainly because the plot sounded interesting. It's about a man who is secretly married to two different woman and gets found out. At just under 80 minutes, the film doesn't outstay its welcome, but also manages to tell its story in the given time. Edmond O'Brien, Joan Fontaine, Ida Lupino (who also directed it), and Edmund Gwenn all give good performances and overall I liked the movie.

This was a really interesting film, even if it isn’t among my favorites of classic Hollywood. It’s melodrama in the best sense, and Lupino gets really incredible performances out of her actors that helps undercut the script’s underwritten female characters. And the film doesn’t go for the easy ending - it’s a much more bittersweet and sad conclusion for everyone involved.",3.5

"'The Bigamist' was Directed by co-star Ida Lupino, which was a first for a female actor and very rare in 1950s Hollywood. So I was a little surprised to find it had arguably sexist elements. The film shows through flashback how a traveling salesman came to be married to two women, in two cities. The music and Direction work to milk our sympathies for the poor schlub as he tries to do right by both of his wives but never really points the finger at him. He cheats on his first wife, which is somehow excused because she can't have children and he feels she has emasculated him by being much better at business and even able to change the tire of their car (the scandal of it!). The dinner party scene where she is offering ""wild and dangerous opinions of her own"" as he looks at her ""with utter contempt"" was laughably close to the classic 90s 'Women know your limits' comedy sketch.
In the end he doesn't even have the backbone to confess to either woman face-to-face, which is played as a sort of nobility. It's all very well acted and Directed and even enjoyable but I just couldn't feel sorry for the main character like the film wanted me to. By the way, one of the wives works as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant, which would be a somewhat progressive setting on the surface but it only demonstrates the insidious subtlety of 1950s Hollywood racism. She calls her Chinese-American boss ""Sam"" but the script still requires him to call his employee ""Miss Martin"".",3.0
"Upon seeing a movie titled The Bigamist with a female director at the helm, I came in expecting one outcome and ended up with another. It would have been easy for the writers and director Ida Lupino to make this completely a male-bashing story that recounts the moral failings of a married man who done two women wrong. Instead, it’s a complex tale of choices that each character makes that leads to a downward path in which no one particular individual shoulders the blame.
Lupino does a remarkable job directing and playing the ""other"" woman. While that sounds like a condescending complement in this day and age, it is an incredible achievement for a woman in Hollywood at that time.",3.0
"Watched on a plane alone via MUBI on an iPad.
It's okay. I had problems with the lead male performance. The film was demanding sympathy for his actions, but he seemed so telegraphed and disingenuous that it didn't work for me. An interesting artifact of a film, though. I'm curious to see others by Ida Lupino.",3.0
"Completely unrealistic portrayal of gender and the worst possible excuse for the actions of the bigamist. Gallantry? Sorry but I don't think so.
At the least the women were meant to be (and mostly were) powerful. But only when they were meant to be which was by no means all the time.",1.5
"This is the only Lupino film I've seen so far and it's an interesting case study. The Bigamist is a studio film made by a woman in the Code era of the 50s that presumably has to punish bigamy in some fashion and yet the movie sympathizes with the titular Harry Graham more than with his wife Eve or with his uh other wife Phyllis (played by Lupino herself). The film rationalizes Harry's decision to cheat on his wife by basically blaming Eve for being too career-focused. Once the affair has happened, Harry marries Phyllis out of the goodness of his own heart and doesn't have the heart to take the easy way out. He's found out at the beginning of the film by a very thorough adoption inspector, because Eve is unable to have children (again a troubling metatextual sort of excuse for Harry's behavior). And yet, for a code film, the end is sort of ambiguous. It's not at all clear that Harry is gonna do time, or that he's lost both these women forever, despite the moralizing from the judge. It's a puzzling and unexpected angle on the film's content. From the perspective of actually watching it though, the performances are solid and engaging and you're rooting for Harry and Phyllis's relationship, despite knowing that it is wrong and doomed. Though we know the outcome, there's enough mystery on how it got to this point, and the film fills in those blanks nicely within a short and sweet runtime. This is a bit of a hidden gem.",3.5
"Is a guy cheating on his wife reason to deny an adoption? That was my thought process going in, and I mostly thought that there are too many poorly-maintained (no fault of the operators) orphanages around the country to make that consideration.

"Probably my least favorite of the three Lupino films I watched this month, but still very worthy of a watch. Most of my complaints come from THE BIGAMIST himself being a unlikable character whose point of view we watch the story unfold from.

"""I can't figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.""
This could have been an unambiguously great film rather than a simply very good one. The script is fantastic, the photography is frequently striking, and the three leads are uniformly talented. However, the big problem is that those three leads, despite their talent, completely phone it in until the last two reels, spitting out their dialogue so fast that it seems as if they think they're about to run out of film. The last two reels are amazing, as the emotional stakes are cranked up as high as they could possibly go and the actors finally take a deep breath and start really showing off their chops, but the preceding 3/4 of the film are noticeably marred by the rushed performances. I can't tell whether this is the director's fault or the actors' (it seems unlikely that Ida Lupino, an incredibly capable director, would tell her actors to do this, as well as doing it herself) but regardless I found it very distracting.
The script, however, is still one of the most interesting screenplays I've seen produced during the classical Hollywood era. Not only does it feature three incredibly well-drawn leads (particularly the two women who, despite being largely defined by their connection with the male lead, are still powerful presences in their own rights), but the sheer melodramatic sweep of the narrative is almost jaw-dropping. Everyone in the film suffers incredibly from the very beginning until the very end, and even the Edmond O'Brien character still manages to garner a great deal of sympathy for it - despite being, objectively, kind of a dick.",4.0
"I like how this film is a unexpectedly thoughtful and nuanced spin on a then-taboo subject that is trojan-horsed in a seemingly exploitative, noir-ish outer shell... that ALSO still makes time for weird meta-jokes where characters say Edmund Gwenn's character looks like Santa Claus (which doesn't even make much sense on the textual level, since he's beardless here) and then later calls further attention to it by including Gwenn's house in the Hollywood tour.",3.5
"Another unexpectedly great film, but that was just because all I knew going in was that it was a public domain movie. Without trying to be reductive, having a female director on this project was the right choice, and so was having Ida Lupino specifically on it. She was the weakest of the core four actors for me, though that’s because the other three (and one minor character) were all Oscar-winners, in a surprisingly great cast, with Joan Fontaine as the standout of the film. I really enjoyed this movie’s conception from beginning to (especially) end, and I think it took noir in a different direction than it had been, setting up a more complex version of what the genre would become and inspire.",4.0

It really is surprising how empathetic the film is for the title character.
You DO kind of pity him as he makes these dumb mistakes out of loneliness and weakness. Also, neither wife is portrayed as a terrible shrew or hussy, which was nice. (Though, I'm not 100% down with the unsubtle message that Joan Fontaine ruined the marriage by taking too much control of their finances.) The movie had room for sympathy for all three leads.

Fontaine is remarkable here, as she is so much of the time; she's never not the center of my emotional investments when she's onscreen, and it's telling that the final image is of her.",4.0
the best part of this movie is how it dangles right in the audience's face that Mr Kris Kringle is kind of playing the bad guy.,0.0
"This couldn't be more different from the other Ida Lupino film I've seen in terms of story, but there are some things in common: three main characters, a lot of travel, and an awareness of a serious problem that can't be addressed just now, or now, or now, but maybe soon. It's not a particularly complicated story, but it's thoughtful and very well directed.
There's a frame story that promises a mystery, but not for long: an adoption counselor (Edmund Gwenn) senses that something isn't quite legit about Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien), checks up on him, and almost immediately discovers the secret—not a huge surprise for anyone who noticed the title of the movie. Gwenn's real purpose, like Edward G. Robinson in Double Indemnity, is just to provide a not-very-sympathetic ear for O'Brien's narration as the rest of the movie shows us how he got to this point, and from there on it's almost entirely about the three leads.
The movie wisely avoids the lazy options of saying that Harry and Eva (Joan Fontaine) don't have a loving marriage, or that Phyllis (Lupino) is a temptress, or that Harry is an effortless deceiver; both of the relationships make a lot of sense, and Harry's character flaw is basically that he wants people to be happy and wants to be liked and doesn't dare to be honest if it would interfere with those things. His personality isn't particularly fascinating—he has no interests outside of work, and Lupino has given him a kind of schlumpy, prematurely middle-aged look that emphasizes that this story isn't about burning passion—but watching him play off of Fontaine and Lupino is, and they're both extremely good. It's basically from Harry's point of view but it still takes the two women very seriously (even when they're being more self-effacing than you might like: for instance, Eve blames herself for their marriage having cooled off due to her infertility and their decision to become business partners, but O'Brien's performance suggests that this was largely due to his own hangups), and it's excellent at showing us how well or not-well these people know each other (the scene where Harry half-tries to confess, but Eve treats it as a joke, except there's a hint that she kind of knows it isn't, is beautifully played). The intimacy of the characterizations makes it feel like this was personal for the filmmakers, and that's not unlikely: Fontaine was married to Lupino's ex-husband, who wrote the script.
As with The Hitch-Hiker, it looks kind of generic whenever we're in the frame story, and vibrantly alive whenever we're not. Faces and close-ups are central: in particular, the moment when Eve and Phyllis finally meet is very simple and very moving, using just a look to tell us where they're at without dialogue. The most dated part of it (besides the Code-mandated reticence about sex—for a movie whose plot involves an unplanned pregnancy, it's remarkably chaste) is the somewhat intrusive score that tries too hard to tell us when things are dramatic. In most other ways I was impressed that Lupino could do something like this in 1953, and it would be an impressive movie in any era.",4.0
"""I liked movies, though I really didn't care where Clark Gable lived.""
I think Lupino's most effective directorial moments occur before we get to her character. Once the story gets going, it kind of ends just as it would get interesting. It has some good acting, but never gets too far beyond 50s 'issue' film.

“The Bigamist” compartilha algumas similaridades temáticas com o primeiro longa-metragem da Ida Lupino, “Not Wanted”. Seja a questão da maternidade ou os conflitos morais e éticos envolvendo as personagens – neste filme, especificamente, é acrescentado até mesmo uma disputa de ordem jurídica. É no mínimo curioso a predisposição das obras por esses assuntos.
No entanto, há em “The Bigamist” um cuidado significativo na construção do encontro entre Harry e Phyllis. O fato do protagonista estar angustiado por causa de problemas no casamento – a esposa extremamente dedicada aos negócios da empresa e a impossibilidade de ter filhos – parece surgir como uma justificativa para ele apaixonar-se perdidamente pela até então desconhecida garçonete.
Por sua vez, a narrativa lembra muito a de “Not Wanted”: uma recapitulação dos acontecimentos a partir das memórias de um único personagem. Isso acaba colocando em contestação a própria reconstituição dos episódios, afinal, tais narrações estão à mercê da subjetividade do sujeito.
Enfim, não quero me estender demais nessas breves considerações. Acho que Ida Lupino arquiteta muito bem a encenação desse melodrama moderno. Ela busca compreender as personagens – em especial Harry – enfatizando olhares e pequenos gestos. Conforme apontado pelo crítico Luís Alberto Rocha Melo, talvez seja mesmo um trabalho que antecipa cinemas com o de John Cassavetes, por exemplo. Além disso, vale ressaltar que Lupino apropria-se como poucos das ambientações – São Francisco e Los Angeles, cidades que o protagonista visita frequentemente por causa da vida dupla.

"I feel like I would have enjoyed this more if Edmond O'Brien hadn't played his character so milquetoast. Maybe the idea was he hides his emotions so he doesn't reveal his secrets. Instead, he never seemed conflicted about his situation. Any time a new complication arose he just had a demeanor that moaned, ""Ah Jeez, here we go again...""
Randomly, after watching this I was surprised that this had been catalogued in the ""Film Noir"" section of the video store. Even if the subject matter was a bigger deal in 1953, the actual events feel rather tame. Maybe my idea of a noir is too uptight, man.",3.0

In terms of arguments about mistresses and bigamy, Le Bonheur (which I not-so-coincidentally watched in the same class that I first saw this film in) went the most interesting route with the husband’s argument that there wasn’t a noticeable change in their relationship.

"Imagine Double Indemnity, but instead of Fred MacMurray marries the other person. A Noir domestic drama. I really liked it. For me movies in the 50s were about a clear cut morality. These are the monsters these are the scientists, these are the cops these are the gangsters. Yes, there are movies that start to blur that line, like Nicolas Rey with Rebel Without a Cause and Bigger Than Life, and of course Ida Lupino. But these weren't the main stream.
I love how the movie poses the question, if marriage is such the corner stone of modern society why is it so exclusive? I know this is changing (thank god - for marriage equality) and I tend to be more on the side of that a polygamist is an insanely sexist environment. And these are issues the movie is not diving into, its 1953. It's about a man trying to do the right thing by doing the wrong thing.
And serious this is a great character actor, O'Brien with two absolute movie stars, Fontaine and Lupino both being the boss of every scene they are in. Even though O'Brien shouldn't go near Lupino but at the same time seeing them falling in love is wonderful.",4.0

"A well-acted, nuanced, and empathetically-scripted drama of infidelity from pioneering female director Ida Lupino, which makes all three points of this relationship triangle complex and believable. None of the two main female figures in the film- Eve (Joan Fontaine) and Phyllis (Ida Lupino herself)- both of whom we see be deceived by the confused and irresolute salesman Harry, are portrayed here as victims or shrews. Neither is Harry portrayed as a monster, though, interestingly, his (first) wife Eve is shown to be both his business parter and more successful at securing clients as he is; raising patriarchal jealousy as a possible subconscious factor. It is tempting to think Lupino's hand at the tiller (even if she didn't write the film) ensured that their onscreen behaviour is not put in service of simplistically justifying Harry's actions.",4.0

"At first it seems it might be a scandalous noir, but it quickly turns into a sad, empathetic melodrama about loneliness and the inevitability of the truth coming to light. Maybe best exemplified in a beautiful dance sequence, Harry and Phyllis slowly turning, each realizing that falling in love is a new kind of isolation for them.",4.0
"SPOILERS! This could have so easily gone the tabloid road. Focused on sensationalism instead of compassion. Thankfully it does not. Ida Lupino really makes us feel for the poor guy who is married to two women and running two households. Again we get the feeling that Ida Lupino really wants us to stop judging people and rather understand human nature. In other words, less ""tough on crime"" and more ""he who is without sin cast the first stone."" I like that the ending is left open. We don't know if either of these women will forgive him and one even wonders if it would not have been best if they could not all live together as one family. Not that I'm saying that that was the intention of the end back when the film came out.",3.5

"This is a strange, shoestring-budget exploitation flick. I picked it out, planning to love it, since the director Ida Lupino was the only woman to direct films during this period in Hollywood. But, man, this script by her ex-husband, Collier Young, is not only misogynist; it is clunky. He puts words in the women’s (Joan Fontaine and Ida) mouths about how dumb and needy women are – no mansplaining. The women say it for themselves.
The titular bigamist is the Edmund O’Brien. He’s a supposedly good guy caught in a situation where his gallantry traps him into a mistake. Phooey! This guy is a weakling, a liar and a cheat. Nonetheless, the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. Well, because his wife is not sleeping with him and she is infertile – what’s guy to do.
What is it with Edmund O’Brien? Why was he a star? There is nothing attractive or talented about him. Who did he know? This guy had a 50 year career in film and television. I don’t get it.
The gumby-like contortions of the script try to turn this liar into a moral man with an understandable moral dilemma but instead create an illogical and discontinuous emotional arc. A couple of times I did the cartoon head shake and uttered, “Whaaa?”

"I was very keen to check out this film directed by and starring Ida Lupino. It was written by her then husband Collier Young and co-stars Edmond O'Brien and Joan Fontaine (recently divorced from Mr. Young).
It's a quality piece of filmmaking but never fully engages the viewer. There's no real tension and many opportunities for dramatic conflict are missed.",2.5
"I almost wish this was a silent film; the dialogue is secondary. The actors' facial expressions and physicality communicate how they view themselves--lonely, afraid, well-intentioned--but the haunting score offers us a feminist lens through which we can view them--decietful, sinister, selfish--and the juxtaposition of those two elements offers us space to draw our own conclusions. This is a nuanced portait of solitude and adultery that presages IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, presenting fully-realized characters that evoke equal parts pity and disdain. Ida Lupino nails it.",3.5
"While the script leaves a lot to be desired with it's obvious tricks for getting exposition out, the whole endeavor is saved by Lupino's direction and all of the lead actors. Everyone gets a fair shake and it's over before you know it. I really loved the gag about passing Edmond Gwenn's house on the Hollywood tour. Would've loved to see a film about the case that made him such a thorough background investigator.",3.5
"Ida Lupino's The Bigamist is an odd entry in the canon of what I would describe as zero wave feminism. The story of a man (Edmond O'Brien) torn between two wives (Joan Fontaine and Lupino herself), the movie is entirely told from the perspective of O'Brien's Henry Graham. When he and his first wife, Fontaine's Eve, apply for adoption, it doesn't take long for the agency's investigator, Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn), to uncover Henry's titular transgression - most of the remaining running time is dedicated to Henry's telling the story of how he ended up married to Lupino's Phyllis as well. Henry is never really villainized for his actions, and it's difficult to find the line between his view of what happened and the movie's opinion of him. Henry depicts himself as a victim of fate, forced into a second relationship out of loneliness, but the flashback shows how eagerly he takes up with Phyllis. Male figures of authority throughout the movie don't exactly condone Henry's actions, but they do seem to feel sorry for him. The film focuses on Henry always, which would be pretty surprising from a female-directed movie in 2016 - perhaps Lupino's feminism had to be a little more subversive, focusing less on what Joan and Phyllis feel in this situation, but indulging in the meaningful glances and hard looks of these women. The Bigamist isn't a treatise on gender politics, but there is at least a little nuance to this tale of matrimonial intrigue.",3.0

"This film was groundbreaking, as Ida Lupino was the first woman in Hollywood to direct herself. Although not as impressive as the Hitch Hiker, Lupino's ""not quite noir"" work is thoroughly engaging and morally ambiguous over its brief run (80 minutes). Although lacking in star power (a fact to which the film nearly winks in the ""homes of the stars"" scene), Edmond O'Brien, Joan Fontaine and Lupino each turn in convincing performances depicting a tri-polar relationship that leaves the audience unsure of whom to root for, or against.",3.0
"It feels a little like a pre-coder in its subject matter and has some fun meta moments related to Edmund Gwenn's presence. A production of the Hollywood industrial machine in terms of its style, but its gutsy storyline constantly wows. Character sympathies lie primarily with the titular bigamist, which doesn't really offer the kind of women-centric approach you might want to locate in a Lupino film, but it serves the broader thematic goal of obfuscating not so much ethical questions as much as social judgments about moral fiber that stem from them. Both the adoption agent and the judge are incapable of condemning Harry outright. Almost more suggestive are the moments—one with each woman—in which Eve and Phyllis either dismiss or joke about Harry's interest in another woman. By way of the back door, the film is almost a critique of society's impositions on masculinity: the proverbial traveling salesman is burdened with an impossible responsibility that both his strong San Francisco wife as well as his strong (if needier) LA lady can manage. The film almost seems to say that the women only must deal with half a man each, but he must care for two women. As such, it's melodrama-meets-noir. As a noir, it recalls something of Jules Dassin's Thieves' Highway, what with the treacherous journey from San Francisco to LA. While Dassin treats the danger more literally in the space between the cities, Lupino treats it relationally and emotionally in the cities themselves (though I hate to play those cards in this context). I'm not sure we ever get a scene of anyone traveling between SF & LA, though at least three people make the journey, and one of them multiple times.
The Amazon Video description said this was the 1953 remaster of the film, but it's a total POS, so beware.
Also, I'm not saying Joan Fontaine can't act, but I am suggesting she has one face in her repertoire.",3.0
"While the film tries to sympathise with Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien), it's easy to see how another film might've had no difficulty painting him as the bad guy. He is responsible for his actions, even if he was in an emotionally uncomfortable state at the time. Still, it has some interesting moments but I wasn't just wasn't sure what to take from this film. I also don't think it's a coincidence that this film was directed by a woman, though. I'm not referring to the quality of the film but rather, the subject matter. In a male-dominated industry, it took a woman to get around to addressing the subject of infidelity and bigamy.",2.5
"While doing inquiries about the character of a husband wanting to adopt a baby with his wife, a welfare officer discovers he actually married another woman, hence the title. This is my second foray into the films of Ida Lupino. Though, like The Hitch-Hiker, this is a far from perfect film, it's still has a lot of intriguing things about it. For one thing, even though the plot just reeks of girly melodrama (frankly, this could be the pilot episode of a Filipino soap opera), Lupino shoots it like a film noir. Also very intriguing with the fact that it does not judge its characters. Edmond O'Brien gives an excellent performance as the title character.",3.5
"What elevates The Bigamist from being just another noir-styled Hollywood melodrama is its ambiguity, both in the final scene and in the feelings in all three characters throughout the film. Which woman will Harry choose? Will either woman be able to forgive him for his transgressions? Does he truly love both, or is he just afraid to ever commit to a decision? Lupino and the script choose to never answer these questions, and in doing so these choices fall in importance in service of the story getting to these questions. A great way to handle dramatic tension, and The Bigamist is better for it.",3.0
"Wicked poster. Completely different to my expectation of what the film would be, one I thought Ida Lupino was someone else, secondly despite the film being directed by a woman, it takes a surprising position of highlighting his emotional state. It's thoughtful and considered for a time when moral outrage and social conformity was present and pervasive, but it's focus threw me a little. While I enjoyed the performances, I couldn't help but feel it was a little skin deep, perhaps due to the cheapness of the look of the thing (and relatively poor quality of the tape). Snoozed off by the end so it's something of a poor review, doubtful I'll come back to it.",2.5
"Ida Lupino was way ahead of her time. Not only for being a female director, but in the subject matter she chose. What could have been an exploitative movie Lupino and her team came up with a film containing two strong female characters and a male lead who comes across as a decent guy.",4.0
"Eschewing simplistic moralizing and empty maudlin dramatics, Lupino sketches a resoundingly empathetic, morally complex portrait of a man torn between his, entirely earnest, love for two women. In treating their emotions with a subdued sophistication and giving both women a depth of character and individuality, the film manages to convincingly portray O'Brien's painfully mixed emotions and split affections without reducing either woman to caricature.
Fontaine's sharp energy and enterprising spirit are matched by a sweetness and bright tenderness that defies rote careerist stereotypes, while Lupino's hard edged cynicism and tough broad sex appeal are softened by her vulnerability and yearning for stability. O'Brien plays the suffering husband with utter commitment and earnestness that underscores his love for the two women as well as his conflicted self loathing at the pain he causes them.
The final court room scene is a mixed bag of an ending, while the cast deliver a crushing emotional blow in the beautifully played, ambiguous ending, while the judge's summation is a thuddingly on the nose statement of theme that attempts to put a neat, morally corrective bow on what has been a sophisticatedly adult treatment of the issue until those final minutes.",4.0
"With ""The Bigamist"" Ida Lupino could have easily portrayed Harry/Harrison Graham as a misogynistic pig, void of any sympathy for anyone else. It would have been the logical thing to do, and everyone, myself included, would have gone along with it. The problem is that it wouldn't have been as good of a film, and Ida was a talented enough director to realize that. Instead, she gives us a man who wants to help. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, even if that is what he eventually does. Much like Charles Foster Kane or Hans Beckert from ""M"", Harry is a man that we should revile, but can't help but feel sorry for. Mr. Jordan puts it best when he says ""I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.""",4.0

The film opens with a model couple being interviewed at an adoption agency. All seems to be going well - they are more or less a lock - until Edmund Gwenn, who plays the agency head asks them to give permission to perform a 'complete background check'. The wife signs with an air of insouciance but the husband hesitates and starts to break a sweat. No poker player he.

"What impressed me most about this movie was that it was made in 1953 and some studio head actually let a woman direct it.
The other thing that impressed me was just how progressive and somewhat gender flipped this was for its time.
The male lead is emotional, sentimental, seeks a deeper connection in his marriage and says a lot of dialogue we don't really hear men say on screen.
One female lead is consumed with her career and almost scuffs at the idea of taking a break from work to spend time with her spouse. The other female lead is fairly casual in her relationships with men and is often the aggressor when it comes to being physical.
The film spends most of its time trying to make you sympathize with the dude but in the end he's still just a plain ole asshole who I couldn't like.

And it had such a fascinating layer of moral ambiguity, limboing effortlessly under the strictures of the Hays Code to create something really special. Nobody in this is an outright villain, all of them are treated with a certain level of sympathy and interest. Harry does bad things, but he really isn’t a bad man.

Also wish Fontaine had a bit more devlopment but she's still really good. O'Brein is excellent and the best thing in this.

"This is something special: the most scandalous subject matter, handled with supreme sensitivity. This surprising noir-but-not concerns a married man with a secret double life, yet it is devoid of any crudeness; instead, it is a compassionate love story, treating every character with complete understanding.
It would make a lovely double feature with On Dangerous Ground (1951), sharing its subversive quality, empathy for loners, and one of its stars. Yet for all that director Ida Lupino has the same concerns as Nicholas Ray, hers is a markedly different style. Ray is pronounced and flamboyant; Lupino is the definition of understatement. Moreover, where Ray offers a clearly hopeful ending, Lupino leaves it to us to interpret.
The three leads - weary Edmond O’Brien, yearning and feline Joan Fontaine, and (directing herself) fragile, wounded Lupino in her cool carapace - try to stifle their turbulent emotions, only for them to reach boiling point in the final act. This is Lupino’s genius: to keep the intense feelings just below the surface until they cannot help but burst forth.
Her principal theme is postwar social dislocation, and how this relates to shifting dynamics of class and gender. Fontaine’s careerist existence amounts to hollow pleasures; Lupino’s waitressing means constraint and boredom; and O’Brien’s lonesome status as a travelling salesman is intolerable. It is significant that O’Brien escapes into life with a second wife via a Hollywood tour bus (it’s sadly not possible to escape straight into the movies); just as notable is the class distinction between his wives.
In scene after scene, Lupino captures a sense of aching longing, realised most effectively with the bittersweet dance where her character and O’Brien’s unexpectedly fall in love. Her direction and their performances are perfect. As Foster Hirsch pointed out to me, though, Fontaine has the most challenging role; and yet her acting is the finest of the cast. Fontaine’s breakdown as her life falls apart is almost unbearable to watch.",5.0

"Modern in its treatment of the subject matter yet trapped in a doldrum morality tale setup. I never truly felt sorry for this guy no matter how badly Lupino's direction and the script wanted me to. Hell, the ending is as much a nightmare scenario as what he was already doing.",3.0
"The screenwriter of this film, who was also one of the producers, was married at the time to one of the actresses playing the two women and had been previously married to the other, who was also the director. Sure. Why not.
The basic problem with all of this is that the story of how a weak-willed guy just gets pushed along into bigamy because every decision he makes gives him an easier life for the next five minutes is not very interesting. It doesn't sensationalize—not beyond the title—and that means it has to derive all its interest from a psychological study of a guy who we can read in five minutes. (Rather funny is the way that some of the devices that seem intended to make him more sympathetic in 1953, most noticeably his wife being a career woman who seems much better at his job than he is, make him less sympathetic now.) The script is also awkward throughout, and if anything his voiceover narration of most of it is stronger than the stilted dialogue which makes neither woman quite seem like a human being. The performances and direction make the most of the script, though.
At the end we get the judge in the trial saying that the irony is that the guy would have been fine if he had made the second woman his mistress, which seems to me an encouragement for society to take a harsher line with adultery. Or maybe not, considering, you know, the situation described at the top of this review.",2.5

"This movie was unexpected. The title was not a spoiler, as Harry's (O'Brien's) bigamist status was established very early in the movie. I thought it would be about Edmund Gwenn's investigation and discovery but, again, that occurred very quickly. As it turns out, the story was Harry's telling Gwenn the story of how his two marriages came about through flashbacks. Lupina ands the cast do a good job of making a philanderer sympathetic. So, we're learning how all this came to pass, and I'm seeing exactly how this will end. But, no! I'm surprised again by an ending I never expected. I won't spoil it, and will leave it to each viewer to decide whether the ending we saw was the right one.",3.0
Ida Lupino’s FERRARI,4.0
"I think the movie might feel a little too easy on the title character, who lies his way around two women always making himself a little too comprehensible. It feels wrong to follow the nice romantic encounters knowing the truth, it looks like the film is trying to let him justify for himself.
But that’s the only rational way of dealing with the subject matter in the way the script presents it - which had to pass censorship. With the man chosen as point-of-view, the film is actually a very precise, accurate portrayal of bigamy - even if bigamy is a light term for what the film represents. 
.
But the real movie happens win the eyes of the two mistaken women. Actually, more than a real movie happens in a single glare. The director Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine had been unknowingly married to the same man at the same time, and they share a glance at each other during the tribunal that condensates all their personal drama. In their eyes, and in their untold point of views, there is the real story, but one out of this film’s reach.",3.5

"Ida Lupino no sólo fue la única directora de su época, se atrevió a llegar donde otros nunca lo harían. Tratar el tema de la bigamia en plena era del Código Hays, la censura de EEUU, desde un punto de vista empático y no castigador es algo rompedor, también con la moral de la época, 1953.
Lupino siendo moderna y valiente una vez más. Mostrando cómo se construye una red de mentiras con la mejor intención hasta que le explotan en la cara a un hombre que a pesar de sus errores intentaba hacerlo correcto:

"This movie had a very intriguing premise and started out with a lot of promise, but after the first 15 minutes the film comes to a screeching halt when they decide to spend telling the rest of the story through flashbacks. It really took away from the pace, and in my mind felt like it was keeping the story from progressing since we were just learning things that technically already happened. That was easily the films biggest weakness to me, and I would have preferred the film to have started with the husbands perspective and to keep the film going instead of telling it to us backwards. I liked the cast in the film, it also gives a very sympathetic look at a cheater in an era we’re adultery could be punished by the law, but that viewpoint wasn’t really clear and I would have loved for that to have been more explored. Overall, not a great film but it was pretty solid.",3.5

"Filme sobre adultério que vai além. Um homem pode amar duas mulheres, depositar numa o que falta na outra. Uma mulher pode amar um homem que ama outra mulher e ainda assim entendê-lo. The Bigamist é um filme curto, mas denso, e é humaníssimo. Ida Lupino não o escreveu, só o dirigiu e nele atuou. O roteirista foi casado com ela e depois com Joan Fontaine, atriz do filme que interpreta uma das mulheres do bígamo. Ainda assim, Lupino dá sua própria contribuição ao roteiro, dirige com sensibilidade. Não moraliza a história, não julga ninguém. Mero julgamento é proferido pelo próprio juiz no fim do filme, cuja atitude é própria do personagem, e ainda assim é tudo muito impessoal, como se ele próprio nao levasse a sério o seu próprio comentário, pois não está num pedestal e considera-se vítima de um julgamento mais forte, o ""divino"", porque ciente das armadilhas do coração humano. Lupino filma os rostos de uma maneira a mostrar que todos são vítimas da angústia, dos sentimentos incertos, da ironia da vida e do coração.",4.5

"Directed by and starring Ida Lupino, this is the story of a husband and wife (Fontaine) who run a success business together. The wife is driven, but she also wants a child, and since she regrettably Cosby have a child, they decide to adopt. The investigator (Edmund Gwenn) however, is suspicious when O’Brien behaved he has something to hide. And boy does he.
It’s hilarious that O’Brien thinks he can just adopt a child by walking into the agency, saying he wants a boy or girl of a certain age and boom! Instant baby. Sorry. It doesn’t work this way, as the duplicitous O’Brian is going to find out.
The movie tried to make us see Harry’s side O’Brien) but it’s hard. Very hard. His jealousy of Fontaine being somewhat more successful than him makes him feel it’s all about him and how his loneliness is making him suffer. Then he brings in another woman and pulls off an act of deception while pretending she’s the only woman in the world for him. And then his lies get him into deeper trouble.
While Lupino and Fontaine are good, and O’Brien does well playing a snake in the grass, you keep thinking that if he had find the right thing by being a man instead of a sniveling selfish whiny creep maybe I could sympathize with his character a bit more. Instead his lies keep idling deeper and deeper until you just wish they’d both take turns nesting the crap out of him. He deserved nothing less because he’s hurting not just three but FOUT people. Yeah…four. Lupino has his baby after health issues. What a tangled web we weave….
I’ll give them all credit that they bring their best. And then there are the Miracle on 34th Street inside jokes and that Gwen reminds people of..Santa Claud. Nice.
Knocking a star off it. The ending was a tad flat with the protagonist getting matched iff to prison likely and his whole sordid business being exploited on the front pages. I didn’t care for his attorney’s defense, trying to make him out as a victim who just loved two women equally. Would he have been better off taking a mistress they ask? Well since he’ll be paying double spousal support AND is ordered by the court to put his baby in the will AND will have yo pay child support, it might have been better in the long run to keep a mistress instead of tearing up two innocent women because of his selfishness. No, I’m sorry for everyone but him.",2.0

"A decent drama with interesting moral dilemmas. The main character is shown sympathetically and his actions (after the cheating) are quite admirable.

The performances here are excellent and so is the cinematography here is great too. What is most impressive is the fact that Ida both starred as the lead actress and directed this stellar film. It is a film worth checking out when you have the chance to see it.

"Coming from a female director, I was looking for any sign that this film was written through the female gaze/perspective. At first, I thought it may be that a woman was being villainized for working and prioritizing her job, but there were too many flaws in that analyzation, that I had to look deeper. I feel as if this movie could be seen as gender stereotypes swapped. Harry was an emotionally aware, understanding, and affectionate man who craved intimacy and quality time. Phyllis focused more on her work, less on emotions, and her marriage basically became one big business partnership. These stereotypes in characters can usually be seen in the opposite genders these two actors are portraying. In order to see this in the film, it needs to be criticized and analyzed in depth rather than looking at things at face value. Ida Lupino may not be overtly feminist with the making of this film, but she brought a nuance to the movie that is subtle and clever, especially for the time period this film was set in.",3.0

There’s so many layers and not everyone is going to get it. Those that do will. I don’t know how they allowed her to make this movie and it’s probably because they just didn’t understand it. They don’t understand what she was truly trying to talk about, but we do. We understand. This is an amazing watch and everyone should be watching this especially if they want to know more about women in film. Eve represents the powerful women and Harry unfortunately cannot handle it. He needs to be masculine and the provider and him hey if with Phyllis he’s able to be masculine again and gives her a way to be a woman vs Eve who doesn’t get to be one because she can’t be a mother which at that time defined what being a woman meant.

"Interesting take on a noir here because, while we usually know the protagonist is doomed, we actually like this guy throughout. He’s a good guy!

Despite the bluntness of the title and a poster that suggests there will be some kind of head to head battle between Fontaine and Lupino, The Bigamist is a rather tepid affair, mostly told in flashback and with only a little flurry of real drama at the very end. O’Brien is pretty good, but both Lupino and Fontaine feel underserved by a boring script. It’s just a bit of a slog that never gets out of first gear.

"Aynı anda iki kişiyle evli olan kimselere verilen “bigamist” ismine sahip olan yapım, vasat bir melodram filmi.
Yıllardır evli olan Harry (Edmond O'Brien) ve Eve (Joan Fontaine), çocuk sahibi olamadıkları için evlatlık edinmek üzere bir kuruma başvururlar. Çifti araştırmaya gelen yetkili Eve’i sever ancak Harry’den şüphelenir. İş için sürekli seyahate giden Harry’i araştırmaya başlayan yetkili, onun diğer şehirdeki adresini bulur ve oradaki evine gider. Harry’nin bu evde diğer karısı Phyllis (Ida Lupino) ve çocuğuyla beraber yaşadığını öğrenince işler karışacaktır.
Bir adamın yalnızlığı üzerinden anlatılan film, bu psikolojiyi çok irdelemediği için yüzeysel kalıyor. İki kadını da gerçekten seven, onlar tarafından sevilen ve illegal bir şekilde ikisiyle de evlenmiş olan iyi bir adamı canlandıran O'Brien, karakterinin köşeye sıkışmışlığını izleyiciye hissettirmiş. Her ne kadar filmdeki bazı sahneler adamın davranışlarını haklı çıkarmaya çalışıyor gibi gözükse de, aslında kimsenin yargılanmadığı ve sadece hayatta verilen kararların sonuçlarını gösteren bir film izliyoruz. Yönetmen Lupino, aynı zamanda eşlerden birini canlandırıyor.",2.0
"One of the only films I can think of that's this thematically risky without leaving a shred of discourse for the audience to unpack; it has all of its conversations for you, sometimes in the form of actual conversations, and not only does it not feel at all forced but more fitting and refreshing than any other approach would, and it was made under the fucking Hays Code, by a Lady, who CAST HERSELF AS ONE OF THE TWO MAIN LADIES BEING CHEATED ON.

"A powerful examination of the consequences of deception and the complexity of human relationships. The performances by the cast are excellent, with Edmund Gwenn delivering an incredible portrayal of a man torn between two families, and Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine bringing depth and emotion to their roles as the women caught up in Harry's web of lies.
Director Ida Lupino's deft touch is evident throughout the film, as she skillfully navigates the delicate subject matter and creates a tense and compelling atmosphere. The Bigamist is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that explores the darker side of human nature and the consequences of our actions.",3.5
"Me gusta mucho el enfoque casi de cine negro que le da Ida Lupino a esta película, totalmente adelantada a su época por el tema tan controvertido que trata y la forma que tiene de abordarlo.

"„In der Mann mit zwei Frauen“ betritt Frau Lupino wieder mehr das Gesellschaftsterrain ihrer ersten beiden Filme.
Es geht um die Konventionen des Heiratens, Kinder kriegen und echtes Gefühlskino eben. Dabei wird nirgends abgerechnet sondern schon damals das Gefühl der Einsamkeit erkundet.
Abgesehen davon, dass ich den Aufhänger, dass eine „Adoptionsstelle“ auf jeden einen Privatdetektiv, gegen den FBI oder CIA ein Witz sind, ansetzt, etwas arg quatschig fand, ist das wieder ein absolut solides-gutes Werk von Frau Lupino.
Gutes und oft nachvollziehbares Gefühlskino ist in den 50ern nicht selbstverständlich und hier titt sie zusammen mit Frau Fontaine auch gleich vor die Kamera.
Warum ich ihre ersten beiden Filme etwas stärker fand (obwohl dieser hier den vielleicht etwas besseren Cast besitzt (technisch und handwerklich schenken sich die Werke alle nichts und sind nicht top aber okay)) ist zum einen, dass das Erzähltempo der ersten beiden noch flotter war und das ich die Themen dieser Filme für die Zeit noch origineller fand.
Dieser Mann oder Frau hat ein zuhause und in seiner Eintönigkeit sehnt man sich nach einem anderen, neuen frischeren Liebhaber – ist ein Konzept, was man doch schon in häufiger sehen kann (auch zu dieser Zeit, wenn es auch nicht der Norm entsprach).
Da fand ich so einen Rehafilm über schwere Erkrankungen und dieses harte Spielfilmdebüt über prekäre Schwangerschaftslagen (was auch in diesem Film wieder mithineinspielt), noch etwas bahnbrechender.",3.0
"Lupino directs here without a credit on the script (solely credited to her ex-husband and producing partner Collier Young - who was recently re-married to Joan Fontaine before this was released). Though, Lupino, for the first, rare time, co-stars as well. The acting and production value are of a noticeably higher quality here which is sad given that Lupino would only be credited with directing one more theatrical feature and it wouldn't be for another 13 years (after a lot of TV).
This is a competent melodrama attempting to humanize another taboo subject. Though, it's an uphill battle given that this guy fails at every opportunity to say SOMETHING to either of these women. I couldn't decide if it's trying to humanize the man or the situation, but I suppose it had to be that way to even get made.
It does bring some other more notably atypical-for-the-period details not the least of which is that both of these women are shown to be independently competent. Specifically, Fontaine's character is even shown to be more so in helping the couple's business and Lupino's character is literally supporting herself after being abandoned for war 'Fraulein' by a military ex-husband.
I thought the ending scene was a bit wrote, but it also shows a complexity of understanding of the situation that was surprising. The ending feels abrupt (at less than 80 minutes it could have had a bit more). Though, we are intentionally left to wonder what exactly will happen with only the faces of the women to guide us.
I suppose this is ultimately to be categorized as another message picture, but it's almost, in a way, a deconstruction of the romance genre itself.",3.5

"For some time in the mid-century, Ida Lupino was the only woman actively working as a feature director in Hollywood. THE BIGAMIST is the actress turned director's best and most exciting work, marrying melodrama with noir, social critique, and a potent undercurrent of melancholy. It's also the only time Lupino directed herself, taking on a leading role as part of the romantic triangle whose resolution ends in court. The last scenes of THE BIGAMIST are a miracle of tonal plasticity, precisely shot and cut to suggest a hymn of bone-deep loneliness that only becomes apparent in the instant of recognition. If Dreyer had ever directed an American trial drama, it might have looked like Lupino's THE BIGAMIST.

"I didn’t intend for this to be the film that followed wife vs. secretary but here we are. This take on infidelity, almost 20 years later, doesn’t focus on especially glamorous people, focusing on a couple who own a freezer business and a waitress. It doesn’t set the “other woman” up as universally irresistible either. Instead it makes the case that, despite being illegal (and as the judge helpfully wraps up, socially maligned by pretty much all parties), Harry’s actions are still explicable and possibly even sympathetic. Lupino, of course, has a lot to work with as Phyllis, and directed one of the most realistic code-compliant pregnancy reveals I’ve seen so far.",3.5

"Plot Summary: Harry (Edmond O'Brien) and Eve Graham (Joan Fontaine) are successful husband and wife partners in a business, but they are childless. They are meeting with an adoption agent named Mr. Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) who tells them they need to sign some papers for permission to check into their background. Harry has a concerned look on his face that Mr. Jordan notices (and concerns him). Harry has to often travel to Los Angeles for business. Mr. Jordan goes to LA, ostensibly for a meeting, but he's checking up on Harry and his research takes him to a house... with Harry, a crying baby... and a sick wife. As Mr. Jordan is about to call the cops, Harry asks him to listen to his (sob) story. Told in flashbacks, Harry describes Eve's infertility and wrapping herself up in their business to the exclusion of Harry. While in LA, Harry takes a bus tour of the stars' homes and meets a woman named Phyllis (Ida Lupino). He does a pretty horrible job of picking her up, but she finally relents, they start dating and fall for each other. Harry is living a double life. One night, on his birthday, after trying to give up Phyllis, she comes to his hotel room and one thing leads to another, if you get my drift. Back in San Francisco, Harry focuses on Eve, but one day back in LA he tries to find Phyllis. She's not at work and her landlady is being cagey. The landlady lets him in and he finds Phyllis is sick (she's needed transfusions?) and pregnant. He marries Phyllis and she has their son. Back to San Francisco and enter Mr. Jordan with news of possible adoption and now Harry's having problems keeping it together. Story done with Mr. Jordan, he writes a 'Dear John' letter to Phyllis, returns to San Francisco, tells Eve he has to go, and turns himself in. The trial goes about as expected. Harry's guilty. But the women? Who knows who ends up with whom.
Thoughts: I had such high hopes for this Lupino-directed movie and my hopes were dashed. Lupino has directed some great movies with some great social topics, but this fell flat for me. The topic is ripe with potential, but I think the production code got in the way. Such great actors, Fontaine/Lupino/O'Brien, that are wasted on this melodrama with overly-melodramatic dialog. There's some good moments, if you know some Lupino back-story, like the tour of stars homes (some of her friends) and a pregnancy out of her marriage. And the final courtroom scene leaves us with quite a bit of ambiguity.

"내가 알기로 <중혼자>는 니콜라스 레이와 공동 감독한 <어둠 속으로>를 제외하면 아이다 루피노의 필모그래피 속에서 유일하게 그녀가 자기 자신을 배우로서 찍은 유일한 영화이다. 하지만 여기서 심지어 주연 여성 두 명 중 한 명이면서도 아이다 루피노는 자신의 크레딧을 조안 폰테인 후순위로 두면서 배우로서 과시하는 것이 아닌 영화 속에 남게 했는데, <중혼자>를 보면 아이다 루피노가 꽤 감독으로서 야심이 있음이 보여진다. <중혼자>를 특기해서 보아야 하는 점이 있다면 그것은 아마 이것이 두 번 결혼하게 되는 남자의 모습을 가까이서 보여주려 하지 않으며 오로지 일정 거리를 두고 객관적으로 보게 하려는 의도일 것이다. 영화의 도입부, 아동 복지부 직원이 조던과 이브 부부를 조사하는 장면에서부터 루피노는 그의 모습을 그가 조사하는 대상이 있는 건물에서의 모습과 정면으로 찍어 그가 들어가는 모습으로서의 쇼트를 찍는다. 그리고 그가 조던과 필리스의 중혼을 알게 된 때에도, 카메라는 오로지 조던만을 따라다니며 그가 아이를 안는 것을 찍지만 방 안에 필리스가 자고 있는 것을 보는 장면에서도 방 안을 찍으며 아이다 루피노 본인을 찍지 않고 오로지 그가 아내가 자고 있다는 것을 보는 상황으로서만 쇼트가 남게 된다.
아이러니한 점은 이후 조던의 과거 회상은 마치 아이다 루피노가 월시에게 배운 이전 작품들의 방식과 똑같다는 것이다. <추적>에서 운명을 표현하기 위해 거대한 암석의 공간을 압축시킨 쇼트를 찰스 로튼이 <사냥꾼의 밤>에서 재사용하듯이 아이다 루피노는 도시 공간을 압축시킨다. 그리고 이 때 이 도시들의 모습은 홀로 남은 조던의 외로움을 표현하기 위함이며 그의 쇼윈도에 비춰진 모습을 따라가며 마네킹을 찍을 때 나레이션으로는 그녀의 부인이 그와 소원하다는 것을 말한다. 여기서 보여지는 특징은 루피노는 무엇인가 쇼트에 들어오면서 혹은 나가면서 이러한 관계를 묘사하는데, 조던이 자신의 과거를 회상하는 장면 부터 그의 얼굴을 찍는 것이 아니라, 외화면에서 화면으로 그가 들어오고 도시 쪽으로 걸어가는 장면을 찍는다. 특히 이것은 인물의 관계에서 주로 드러나는데, 조던이 필리스를 처음 만나면서 그녀와 가까워지는 장면을 찍을 때, 버스에서 필리스가 혼자 앉아있는 쇼트에서 외화면으로 부터 조던이 바로 옆자리에 앉는 장면을 찍으며, 반대로 조던이 중혼 관계의 위험을 겪을 때는, 그가 홀로 일하는 장면에서 갑자기 다른 지역에 있던 이브가 화면으로 들어온다던지, 아니면 그가 이브와 함께 걷고 있는데 외화면에서 그와 필리스를 부부로 알고 있던 지역 청년이 끼어들어 말을 건다던지 하는 식이다.
그리고 이와 더불어 조던의 회상을 듣게 되는 아동복지부 직원의 말을 빌어 아이다 루피노는 이를 이렇게 평한다. 그를 경멸하면서도 잘되길 바란다고. 이에 대해 이 당시 아이다 루피노와 다른 배우들의 관계에 빗댄 평도 많았다. 특히 도입부 부터 할리우드 투어 여행에서 남을 구경하고 관찰하려 하는 것에 본따 이 '중혼자'의 이야기를 함부로 재단하고 혹은 판단하려 하는 사람들에 대한 비판점이 말이다. 그래서인지 <중혼자>의 클라이맥스 속 재판관의 연설은 마치 카메라를 들여다보며 관객에게 말하듯이 연출되어 있다. 물론 그것이 이 영화의 주제이기도 하면서 직접적으로 말하는 것을 전달하는 듯한 표현이긴하지만 말이다. 하지만 동시에 아이다 루피노는 그런 중혼의 범죄에 대한 관점을 남들의 시선으로서 표현하기도 한다. 조던이 처음 필리스와 함께 술을 마시며 춤을 추게 되는 장면에서, 그는 강 건너의 남녀가 서로 머리를 기대고 바라보는 시선의 쇼트로서 그들의 장소의 설정 쇼트를 제시한다. 그리고 이 영화의 건물을 들어가는 쇼트 중 상당수가, 마치 들어가는 조던을 바라보듯이 카메라를 위로 올려 보는 장면이 많다. 더군다나 이 이야기 부터가 결국 파멸할 것을 알고 있음에도, 아동 복지사가 이것을 파헤친 다음에야 어쩔 수 없음을 아는 남자의 이야기이지 않는가.
내가 가장 마음에 들었던 것은 비록 판사가 직접적으로 주제를 제시하며 끝내기는 했지만, 영화는 그 장소에서 끝나지도 않고 직접적인 판단도 하지 않는다는 것이다. 재판의 결정은 다음 주로 결정되며 모두가 나간다. 이 때 조던과 서로 사랑했던 두 여자인 이브와 필리스는 그들간에 서로 어떤 말이나 이야기를 하지 않는다. 단지 그들은 서로 바라보며 조던을 바라본다. 이 때 아이다 루피노는 그들이 조던을 바라보는 시선을 직접 보여주지만 반대로 서로를 바라보는 모습은 그저 옆모습으로서만 보여준다. 그리고 특이했던 점은 보통 감독이 자기 자신이 주연을 맡은 영화에서는 자신을 엔딩 씬으로서 끝냈을 법도 한데, 이 영화에서는 조던이 끌려가는 와중에 원래 결혼했던 부인인 이브 역의 조안 폰테인이 그를바라보며 고개 숙이는 장면을 엔딩으로서 사용했다는 것이다. 결국 <중혼자>에서 눈여겨봐야 할 점은 물론 아이다 루피노의 감독으로서의 능력과 기술 또한 있겠지만 바로 가치 판단을 하지 않는다는 점이 중요하다고 본다. 이러한 모순에 대해 직접적으로 그 실타래를 풀려고 하거나 혹은 그 모순의 문제를 이야기하기 보다는 오로지 이 관계와 모순 그 자체를 찍으려고 했기 때문에 <중혼자>는 훌륭한 영화였다.",4.5

"Sensitive drama, considering the salaciousness of the plot. A man is discovered to have two wives, each in a different city, by a adoption investigator, and he spends most of the movie explaining why in flashbacks.

Pretty well acted, although perhaps O'Brien's character is shown a little more sympathetically than one would expect. Lupino also directed.",4.0

It's a pity an underdeveloped and rushed script never allows us to see the emotional consequences of the facts portrayed on the female characters, performed superbly by Lupino herself and Joan Fontaine.
The story sides too much with it's male lead, not giving us the chance to decide for ourselves, rather presenting him as a victim of his wife's independency straight away, it's all too conveniently crafted in his favor. A sign of the times, for sure.
Still an interesting watch.",3.5
Another one of Lupino's great films. A simple plot a man has two families and gets caught living a double life. It was a thoroughly exciting film as you never really know what will happen next. I think the wonderful thing about the film is how it just end with Harry awaiting sentencing and not really sure how anything will end for him aside from supporting both wives. It is a bit shocking that this film could get made in the 50s.,3.5
"Edmund O'Brien at his least sweaty/interesting. There is never any blame placed on anyone, any problematic action is immediately justified with some kind of soft-serve psychology -- of course he became a bigamist, he was lonely while out of town AND his wife was a career woman. Of course she was a career woman, she was barren and driven to find self-worth. I dunno, could have used a tragic death or a reveal or SOMETHING. It just kind of plods in a straight line from the unavoidable sins of its well-explained characters, to the inevitable (/predictable) ending. Not Lupino's best, admiration for her getting herself in the position to direct it at all notwithstanding.",2.0
"Eve babe you did not deserve all that, men really suck huh",3.0
"When you watch a 70-year-old movie, you have to consider the cultural milieu in which it was produced. Sometimes, though, the cultural milieu includes sexist attitudes that even female directors felt obliged to reproduce. Ida Lupino both starred in and directed this film, which endeavors to paint the most sympathetic portrait imaginable of a traveling salesman who ends up with two wives, all because he’s too nice to say no to women who need him. Joan Fontaine is Wife No. 1. (Eve), in one of many insipid roles that marked the second half of her career. After learning she can’t have children, Eve gets too excited about running the family business, neglecting poor Harry (Edmond O’Brien), who has no choice but to hit on Phyllis (Lupino) on a sales trip. After a sugary-sweet courtship, they finally give in to passion on Harry’s final night in town. 
Harry learns Phyllis is pregnant and spends the rest of the moving waiting in vain for the right moment to come clean with the two women in his life. When Eve decides to adopt a baby, she unwittingly unleashes a kindly but dogged investigator played by Edmund Gwenn, who mercifully brings the conflict to a climax. 
The only way the story can work is if O’Brien portrays Harry as a suffering saint, rather than a cad, and he gives it his all. Under Lupino’s direction, the two women come across as strong, independent and intelligent, but the story also requires them to be so wild about Harry that he can’t bear to hurt them by telling either one the truth. Maybe in 1953 audiences could swallow such contractions, but we found ourselves repeatedly hitting the pause button and yelling at the TV in exasperation.",2.5
"Lupino basically pulls a Val Lewton, taking a plot that looks scandalous and instead turning it into a an empathetic emotional drama. There are moments when it shines. But time and some questionable script choices robs it of more tension than it can spare, and even at 80 minutes it crawls.",3.0

"A traveling businessman with two seperate wives begins to crack under the weight of his secret double life. Once again, Ida Lupino pivots back to women's issues but interestingly she chooses to do so from a decidely male perspective. As the titular bigamist recants the story of how his parallel marriages came to be, you find yourself almost sympathizing with him. As the events unfold it is clear that he genuinely loves both women and was in someways only trying to protect them both despite the dispicable way he went about it. Lupino deftly takes a taboo and potentially salacious topic and delivers a quiet and complicated human drama. The more I think about this film, the more I appreciate it.",4.0

"a movie i respected intellectually more than i ultimately loved i think. i really appreciate the boldness from lupino to get such a nuanced and challenging movie regarding marriage/gender/family morals and structures across the line. but i didn’t feel the emotions/ideas coming through the fabric of the movie and maybe the performances a bit too. it’s just too functional in a way. listening to sleepy edmond o’brien narrate most of it just took away most of the potential for life and vitality and emotion to really burst out of it. i don’t feel the desperation or the paralysis in my bones, it’s neatly and explicitly spelled out for me via the script, the choice for direct narration, and the editing/narrative structure as a whole. admire the earnest and complex look at marriage and men and women but i didn’t feel it emotionally materialize enough throughout",0.0

"There is a surprising amount of nuance and moral gray areas here. No one is a villain. These are three mostly good people who just got into a messy situation.
Yes, Harry's (Edmond O'Brien) disappointment that his wife, Eve (Joan Fontaine), begins devoting herself to their shared company after they find out she can't get pregnant does come across as ""oh poor me I am so unloved"" but I think both Harry and Eve are just lonely here and they no longer knew how to connect.
Looking for thrills, Harry meets Phyllis (Ida Lupino, who also directed) an equally lonely young woman and they slowly begin an affair (Harry travels between San Francisco and Los Angeles for work so this is easy enough). Phyllis is mostly just sweet and restless. She's not someone who is conniving or cruel.
Both the women have their own internal lives and I think Harry's major flaw is he can't see that. He wants the stability of Eve and the passion of Phyllis but doesn't truly consider what either of them want from him.
Phyllis becomes pregnant and they never really explain how Harry pulls off the whole double marriage thing but it's not a big deal. He is caught by the investigator for the adoptation agency, which sets up the framing sequence.
(I did want Phyllis and Eve to decide to raise Phyllis' son, Danny, together in the end but I think that would've been too much for the '50s.)
This is fairly well made (the copy on Paramount+ -- which may just be the copy that exists -- has some flaws in terms of audio and missing frames) and an engaging 80ish minutes. I appreciated that it approached this material in such a thoughtful manner and the three leads are great. It's not life-changing but it's a surprising movie that's worth seeking out.",0.0

What a shame. Heard the name Ida Lupino a thousand times but never saw one of the films she directed as one of the very few women working in Hollywood of the 50s a s a director. It was quite a discovering! I felt like in a parralel universe where the films made in the 50s are looking like 20 or 30 years ahead of its time.,4.5
"The first twenty minutes were surprisingly well-paced as we follow a private investigator trying to sniff out any irregularities this picture-perfect couple could be hiding. Once the bigamy is revealed the flow stalls out and a puzzlingly empathetic story takes over lending this social scourge a major dose of humanity. The way this man falls into a tryst with a woman he shouldn't be playing games with seems to be shouting ""This could happen to YOU!"" at every man in a five-mile radius. He always seems to be the focal point rather than either of the women he's stringing along making for an unfortunately unbalanced tale of broken hearts. Typical for the era, but still contains a whiff of what must have felt sensational for 1953.",3.0

"The screenplay by Collier Young (first married to Ida Lupino and then to Joan Fontaine...) handles this scenario with more depth and nuance (maybe unsurprisingly given the source?) than you would expect from the sledgehammer of a title.
The Bigamist is narratively mournful, admirably avoiding the taking of sides or easy condemnation, incredible to see in the age the movie was made (a Lupino specialty) and thematically complex, refusing to handle its setup with simplistic psychology or easy answers.
Still, I feel like the real triumph of the movie is the way in which Lupino brings it to life. From the narration that was frankly irritating the hell out of me with its laziness till I cottoned on to its purpose, like a second score to the movie, lacing it with the hallmarks of film noir.
It has a sense of tortured regret, dangerous unraveling secrets, and impending doom in the air, transforming domestic strife into hardboiled melodrama.
It is creatively just so inspired, visually so low-key detailed, and all in all, further proof that there are not many better from the era.",4.0

He spills his guts to Edmund Gwenn and his story is told in flashback and they oddly take the time to work in multiple jokes about Gwenn's role as Santa Clause. Perhaps because it was directed by Ida Lupino, a woman, it manages to be a sympathetic portrait without straying into male wish fulfillment fantasy. The Noirish tinge to the visuals helps a lot too. Not my usual cup of tea, but I am an avowed Edmund O'Brien fan and that, plus a uniquely sensitive and thought provoking handling of the subject matter, carried me through.",0.0

"Ida lupino com sua câmera, uma mulher que vê o mundo 50 anos a frente, vivendo nos anos 1950.

Se você não está ciente o contexto americano de sociedade da própria época do filme , então jamais não irá compreender o quanto por entre as lacunas o porque esse filme foi corajoso em tocar em certo pontos sensíveis justamente como uma das poucas cineastra mulheres de hollywood trás.
Sim é um tema polêmico para epoca só código de hayes, o divórcio ou desquite (talvez para sociedade onde isso era algo inconcebível aos pobres), mas sim a bigamia.
Julga-se mal ao olhar o poster de início de que o filme a quem pensar que o filme irá trazer um embate colossal de rivalidade feminina munidas pela disputa de um homem e a vencedora dessa briga sairá com o seu troféu o marido. Pelo contrário Ida coloca um relevo singelo retrato da vida real e problema conjugais.
Ao invés de colocar a primeira esposa como protagonista e a segunda como antagonista, Ida sai da zona de conforto do cinema de um roteiro previsível e cheio de clichês tomando novos rumos e outros horizontes.
Não há maniqueísmo, nem mesmo por parte marido bigamo , pois não é ainda um filme tomado pela consciência radical feminista que viria na década seguinte, ele não é um conquistador barato, vulgar e mulherengo com apetite insaciável sexual. E suas respectivas mulheres no caso a segunda esposa, não é uma femme fatale perfida e capaz de tudo uma verdadeira destruidora de lares perfeitos a lá comercial de margarina
Sua primeira esposa segue o protótipo de dona de casa esmerada amável e passiva um querida tradwife da sua época , porem o que concentra neste ponto a sua esteridade na falta de um filho. O enredo do filme se desenrola através da adoção, o filho fortifica um lar é o ideal da época o casal perfeito falta um herdeiro.
Como também é da constituição da própria época o que trás a infidelidade é negativa da esposa em seus trabalhos íntimos do casal, ida também trabalha esse aspecto ao não dá formas sobre este pensamento atroz, ele no caso é minimizado e a culpa masculina é maior, e novamente aqui são pegos de sobressalto ao trabalho da diretora, em que novamente não se trata de um marido mulherengo e apesar da própria época endossar esse discurso o trabalho de ida é muito íntimo e particular. Mergulhado em uma profunda análise dos sentimentos humanos da infidelidade, vemos a culpa, solidão, melancolia entre outras emoções no tocante do enredo.
O surgimento da segunda esposa ganha um destaque maior sobre sua vida. Uma simples garçonete que apenas quer manter a sua vida simplória sem altos, e aporrinhada por um homem conquistador em um passeio por beverly hill, tem sua vida modificada.
Ao descobrir a bigamia, phyllis decide terminar o caso, mas a essa altura já é um dona de casa residente em um subúrbio comum, a história foi longe demais, há uma criança em voga agora. Mas como de uma forma com que o público notou a longa história dos dois
O surgimento de sua gravidez é algo simplório e passa-se de forma flutuante sobre o código de hayes, e com o passar de seu trabalho vai se aproximando de um realidade muito longe de um roteiro maniqueísta que procura induz o telespectador ao didatismo a saber quem é o mau e o bom, ambos possuem suas camadas de contrariedade dentro de si.
Ao final da farsa, resulta no pensamento constante de com quem o protagonista deve ficar terminando em dúvida, de fato Ida percebeu que a melhor forma de sair com o final grande desse filme seria ao cargo do próprio telespectador.",4.0

Très intelligemment mené.
Le début de l'intrigue peut laisser penser que l'on va avoir droit à une sorte de thriller façon Hitchcock, mais le titre du film éventait déjà cette possibilité.
En fait, par effet de flashback - le « bigame » raconte son histoire - on a surtout affaire à une romance autant qu'à un drame. Et c'est là où Ida Lupino réussit son affaire : elle montre le cheminement de cet homme sans jamais porter de jugement, sans jamais le dépeindre de façon manichéenne.
Au final, elle montre un homme mal dans son couple, que son parcours professionnel a amené vers la solitude, et qu'un mélange de faiblesse et de lâcheté a fini par mener là où il se retrouve piégé. Mais Lupino ne souhaite pas non plus s'apitoyer sur son sort : dans l'histoire, les femmes qu'il aime - toutes les deux très sincèrement - sont elles aussi (et plus que jamais) les victimes de la situation.
Personne ne sort gagnant de cette affaire. Mais qui accabler, sinon le destin ?",4.0
"Una de las películas más únicas y desconcertantes de su época. Ida Lupino te da una historia totalmente congruente con los códigos del cine Americano de su época, pero con un tratamiento de actores que más parece neorrealista, pero también con una sensibilidad que escapa del drama y coquetea en momentos con el thriller ( la música xd) . Y por supuesto te da un planteamiento que nunca va dejar de ser fuerte y provocador respecto a la idea de monogamia.

They have something to say and at times steer the entire movie. Maybe the fact that this had a female director was the key element? In any event, I liked it.

"Al margen de las grandes majors del cine, en los años 30,40 y 50 surgieron muchas películas de serie B clásicas. Con menor presupuesto pero mayor implicación en desarrollar ideas, estilos y asuntos diferentes y/o polémicos que no se atrevían a hacer las películas de mayor presupuesto. Ida Lupino, una famosa actriz de películas “A”, paradójicamente se convirtió en una gran directora de cine de serie “B”, apoyada por la productora The Filmakers.
Ida Lupino, una pionera por ser una de las primeras mujeres que dirigieron cine y también pionera por dotar a sus películas de una sensibilidad nueva al retratar temas tan controvertidos como la violación en “Outrage”, la presión sometida a las tenistas en el tenis femenino en “Hard, fast and beautiful” o la lucha contra la enfermedad en “Never fear”. “The bigamist” trata en primera instancia del tema de la adopción de niños, la responsabilidad de elegir un buen hogar para los huérfanos y con mayor énfasis trata el tema que da título al film, un spoiler en sí mismo o un título que no engaña a nadie, lo que prefiráis. El tema de la bigamia es tratado con seriedad y de forma reflexiva, huyendo de generalizaciones y leyes universales y señalando la especificidad de cada caso para emitir un juicio moral.
Hay dos anécdotas metacinematográficas. Primero, en una escena se compara al señor Jordan, un empleado que valora los requisitos para la adopción de niños, personaje interpretado por Edmund Gwenn, con Santa Claus. En una segunda escena visitan la casa de Beverly Hills de Edmund Gwenn (el actor, no el personaje) y citan su película más conocida “Miracle on 34th street” en la que interpreta a Santa Claus.
La segunda, Ida Lupino se divorció de su segundo marido Collier Young en 1951 ya embarazada de su futuro tercer marido Howard Duff. Por su parte Collier Young, productor y co-guionista junto a ella de esta película y de las anteriores de Lupino se casó en 1952 con Joan Fontaine, la actriz de esta película junto a la propia Lupino.
Que mejor manera de hablar de la Bigamia en la película
1953 fue el mejor año profesional de Ida Lupino debido a la realización de sus dos mejores películas “The hitch-hiker” y “The bigamist”, a partir de este año dejó la dirección en el cine excepto por “The trouble with Angels” para incorporarse al potente e incipiente mercado de las series de televisión.",3.5

"This is a drama that's very straightforward, for better and for worse. It's pretty dry, but without any material that didn't need to be there. The story is very simple, but presented with an emotional complexity that's surprisingly mature. The emotions aren't overwrought as the story unfolds- there are no huge, dramatic confrontations, no ""she DIED from being so heartbroken"". This restraint works to the story's benefit, but also keeps it from reaching a climax that the slow burn implies. I'm a tad conflicted about the way that the story is mostly told in flashback/retrospect: while the moment where the man from the adoption agency knocks on the door and we are confronted with the crying baby is brilliant, it leaves the rest of the movie with a foregone conclusion. Nearly everything we see is a confession, and I think the movie might have aided with a bit more of the ""is he going to get caught NOW"" suspense.",3.5

"A bit unfulfilling in the end. There's a fascinating story this guy is telling about how he, when trying to adopt a baby with his wife, had a kid with another woman. At that point it all revolves around how he's supposed to tell either of them the truth, and how he's unable to do that. It's told in such a great way, that you even start to feel sorry for him.
But to then have him arrested because it's the 1950s and loving two women at the same time is sacrilege feels like a cop out. The whole film is building up to his chance to redeem himself, and then the 'choice' is basically made for him...
But besides that, I'd recommend!",3.5

As a filmmaker she is assured and confident.

困局肇因於男性的軟弱，而非好萊塢常見的美麗壞女人（妙的是Ida Lupino以此形象著稱）。,3.0
"Real nice sympathetic story about a traveling salesman taking care of two different families.
All is going well with the Bigamist until his more business oriented wife (Fontaine) decides that they need to adopt a child. The person assigned the duty of looking into their suitableness for adoption decides to follow every thread in order to find a reason not to let them have a kid. This eventually leads him to the Bigamist's second home and family where the Bigamist tells the whole sordid tale.
I had to do a double take on the end because I couldn't tell what happened. But I didn't miss anything - if you're looking for some sort of catharsis, this ain't the movie. Rather, it's a very humanistic look at the ways we try to be good and do right and keep fucking up. It's nice and the Lupino touch on Hollywood and Chinese food is evident.

"Me pongo a pensar sobre si yo estuviera en otras circunstancias, la película me hubiera pegado/proyectado diferente a como lo hizo.
Tengo muchos sentimientos encontrados.
Por un lado, este tema de personajes solitarios por diferentes circunstancias que los hacen tomar decisiones ""inconscientes"" por sus impulsos que los llevan a diferentes caminos sin salida, me llego a encantar; vemos sus motivaciones, sus frustraciones y proponen algo interesante para aquella época.
Lo que digo arriba es justamente el problema de la película: propone, pero no va más allá. No existe un desarrollo ni mucho menos un interés en explorar más estas ideas sobre esta doble vida que Harry tiene, todo gracias a su soledad. La cinta se encarga de romantizar a más no poder dichos conflictos para crearnos una lucha moral sobre si hizo bien o no nuestro prota vs la época dicta que eso está mal. Más curioso todavía por que al final su resolución es: si estuvieron fatales sus actos pero lo perdonamos por el simple hecho de que el no tiene ni tuvo malas intenciones. Incluso se queda corto para hacernos empatizar y preocuparnos por nuestros personajes.
Mientras más lo pienso; desde la escena de como conoce a su amante hasta la secuencia final tan... extraña, me hace tener un sentimiento amargo. No sé si es por mi chip de la época en la que vivo que se me hace algo cuestionable todas los motivantes de nuestra historia o por que no estoy en el mode para entender el mensaje, pero simplemente no me termina de convencer.",3.0

I look forward to watching more of Ida Lupinos work.",0.0
"The Bigamist, es una película que presenta el bigamía o adulterio de una manera ambigua y bastante moderna. Es decir, no presenta una condena clara a Harry, sino que la película se manifiesta en una escala de grises morales donde se presentan los aspectos negativos de cada personaje.
También, esto puede estar vinculado a que es un relato enmarcado y esa bigamía esta narrada desde la perspectiva de Harry (su protagonista). Entonces, se observa una historia la cual está posiblemente narrada a su favor. Una historia posiblemente moldeada a su favor y utilidad del protagonista.
Asimismo, es destacable el trabajo de dirección para proyectar en ese relato el contexto social patriarcal, mediante una sutíl mirada masculina (la perspectiva subjetiva del personaje. A su vez, resulta destacable el investigador del orfanato, funciona como la figura típica del detective en el género noir, para confrontar o cuestionar esa realidad construída por Harry.
En el caso de la caracterización del personaje Harry, se observa una dualidad entre lo que vemos dentro del relato y su narración en ese presente narrativo. En los diálogos con ambas mujeres, se lo evidencia comprensivo, negociador y capaz de identificar sus propias fallas. Pero, en la conversación con el investigador se cuestiona esa caracterización. Entonces, considero que este personaje se vuelve ambiguo, conflictivo y con una profundidad interesante de analizar.
El protagonista se desgarra moralmente frente a sus decisiones y esta doble vida que lleva. Lo que es curioso es que vemos este comportamiento evidente una vez que el equilibrio que el logra se tambalea. Las relaciones con ambas mujeres sufren deslicezes, tropezones pero se fortalecen. Pero aún queda ese innevitable verdad qye conocemos al comienzo de la película, Harry será descubierto. Y considero que Ida Lupino a ha podido cargar con ese aire de paraonia y expectativa durante el desarrollo de The Bigamist.
En la caracterización del protagonista vemos cuestiones y problemáticas presentes en una sociedad machista. No siento que Harry realmente ame a Phyllis, sino que su soledad y ansías de que una mujer verdaderamente dependa de él, son mayores motivaciones en su actuar.
En este aspecto, hay una polaridad clara entre ambas. A Eve se la presenta independiente, trabajadora y desarraigada con su esposo y/o en el ámbito sexual. Y esto frusta al protagonista en un sentido tanto emocional/sexual.
Asimismo, da la sensación que Harry considera que las mujeres no son capaces de afrontar una verdad tan dura (o es lo que el mismo se convence). En mi opinión, le da miedo afrontarlo, ya que, se ha involucrado emocionalmente con ambas, e intenta aprovechar de los momentos de crisis de sus parejas para darles la culpabilidad y decisión de la separación.
En relación al final del film, no es lo que esperaba para in film noir donde se presenta una reflexión acerca de la condena social.
When a man no matter how well-intentioned, trangesses the moral laws that govern us, the law of men becomes almost useless. You will see that there is a worse punishment than the condemnation of a court.",3.5

"Wenn jemand eine Repräsentation des klassischen Hollywoods sehen möchte, dann kann ich dieser Person The Bigamist ans Herz legen. Der Film folgt einer klaren Narrative, ist für alle Zuschauenden klar greifbar, bedient sich gesellschaftlicher Themen, ohne moralisch zu aufmüpfig zu werden. Kurz um, zu seiner Zeit war das ein Film für jedermann, oder -frau. Er bietet leichte Unterhaltung, mit einer gewissen Spannung und diesen Job erfüllt der Film.
So massentauglich der Film auch ist, so uninspiriert ist er dann auch. Das fängt an bei den (natürlich notwendigen) Establishing-Shots, welche die Szenen in der Stadt verorten sollen. Dabei fühlen sich diese Welten aber so sehr getrennt an und man merkt einfach sofort, dass der ganze Film (bis auf ein paar Szenen im Park) im Studio produziert wurde. Das Ganze bietet einen faden Beigeschmack, der den Film unnatürlich wirken lässt.
Die extrem ausführliche Schilderung der Ereignisse, damit auch alle verstehen was genau hier vor sich geht, sorgt für ein Fehlen jedes noch so kleinen Interpretationsspielraums, was den Film insgesamt dann doch sehr langweilig macht. Dazu gehört das Voice-Over, das uns die Szenen immer wieder in Kontext setzen muss, was für jeden halbwegs denkenden Menschen nicht nötig gewesen wäre. Vor allem fühlt sich die Figur des „Kindervermittlers“ umso konstruierter an, weil sie (bis auf den Beginn des Films) nur eine Rechtfertigung für das Voice-Overs bietet, damit wir uns nicht direkt von der Hauptfigur angesprochen fühlen.
Zu all dem genannten gesellt sich dann noch der unausstehliche Sexismus der 1950er. Dazu gehört der Gerichtsprozess am Ende des Films, der die Taten der Hauptfigur fast schon moralisch rechtfertigt, mit dem Argument, andere hätten es schlimmer gehandhabt. Dazu gehören seine beiden Frauen, die ihn trotz seiner Taten immer noch konsequenzlos lieben und ihn immer und immer wieder zurückwollen, weil er ja so bemitleidenswert ist und es war ja dann doch nicht so schlimm. Ausserdem kann man sich mal vorstellen, wie der Film aussehen würde, wenn man ihn aus der Perspektive der beiden Frauen gedreht hätte, oder wenn eine Frau mit zwei Männern gleichzeitig etwas am Laufen hätte. Ich kann mir kaum erdenken, dass am Ende ähnlich mild mit der Figur umgegangen worden wäre.",2.5

"This was not the movie I expected at all. It takes a lot of time to establish sympathy for the titular bigamist, and in fact that's really the whole of the story. Rather more expected was the fact that neither of his two wives is simply a placeholder – they're both real characters in their own right, which is welcome.
It feels like a film that is let down by its telling, rather than its story. It wants to suggest that there's not a simple one-to-one correlation between love and marriage, which is a pretty complicated message for 1951. But this is undercut by the fact that at least three quarters of the movie unfolds in an extended flashback. Since we already know where the story being told by Harrison Graham is going – from the title of the movie if not the fact we've already seen the result by the time he starts telling it – the structure rather robs most of the film of any narrative tension.
Perhaps also worth noting that I was occasionally distracted from the movie by the livestreamed firefight around the Zaporizhzhia power plant. This is not quite fair on the movie, although at the same time, had it been more gripping, I might not have been so distracted.",3.5

"Edmond O'Brien is a happily married (to Joan Fontaine) travelling salesman who succumbs to boredom one night when away from home and meets ""Phyllis"" - Ida Lupino. It's not a hook-up in any conventional way - they meet on a tourist bus doing the rounds of the Hollywood mansions; but their relationship blossoms, they marry and have a son together. It's quite possible that this web of deceit could have gone on indefinitely but for the fact that wife number one can't have a child, so they decide to adopt and Edmund Gwenn, as the adoption investigator, discovers this double-life and it all starts to become messy. Ida Lupino directed this with more than a little skill; we never actually feel hatred for O'Brien; by the end we might even sympathise with how pathetic he has become. Does provide some food for thought as to the role of the legal system in scenarios like this...",3.5

"Definitely a nuanced and empathetic film, especially for a movie produced during the Code-era. Feels modern in its understanding of love and morality. My big gripe with the movie is that it spends most of its runtime in flashbacks, building to a conclusion that we’ve already been made aware of. Narrative structure like this sucks all the stakes from the story, obviously, because we know what’s gonna happen before it happens (except for one major plot point). We’re basically playing catch up for close to 80% of the movie. 
The first fifteen minutes though are excellent, they do a great job of building intrigue and the twist that brings us into Act 2, I thought, was masterfully executed. I just wish the movie had either taken place chronologically or just dealt with the “present” timeline after Harry got found out. The sitting-and-talking flashbacks bogged the movie down.",2.5

Ida Lupino excells as co-star and director with a refreshing tale of real relationships.",4.0
"My fourth film by Ida Lupino, the fourth in Kino Lorber’s boxset of her films. This one is a drama that begins with a couple trying to adopt a child. When the guy at the adoption agency asks them to give permission for background checks, the husband is oddly reticent to give his permission. The adoption agency guy asks around a bit and finally tracks the husband down in another city, where he is supposedly on business. As it turns out, he has another wife there, and a child, too. Before the adoption agency guy can call the cops on him, the husband explains himself. As it turns out, things are a good deal more complicated than just a guy two-timing on his wife.
The film takes a nuanced and deliberate view of the situation at hand, enough that it feels pretty realistic and truthful, although there are definitely enough plot points that come from one wife or the other not giving our hero the chance to explain himself, or from somebody having a sudden change of heart at the worst possible time. It feels kind of like it wants to show a sympathetic take on one of the most universally-reviled stock characters, the cheating husband, but the story it invents to make him sympathetic ends up a little contrived at times. I did like it, though - it’s well-written and well-acted and feels like it’s about everyday people and not about Hollywood stars pretending to be everyday people.",4.0
"A challenging film with challenging characters, a challenging premise, and an even more challenging conclusion. A film that will leave you pondering the very real consequence of its true to life circumstance, particularly when it comes to bearing this out as a social commentary on laws built to benefit the man, and subsequently drawn up by the male ego.
At its heart is an exploration of love as a necessary defining term under the law. The movement from the law to its functional role within relationship becomes the point of conversation, narrowing in on this key point of discussion about the arbitrarily drawn lines between adultery and bigamy. There is a fascinating suggestion here that perhaps it is the natural consequence of our actions that hold more power than the law itself, and yet when it comes to the law defintions always matter as they shape the way we understand these consequences. More important is our ability to recognize love as an actual value of the law. I am prone to think that viewers might find themselves torn between whether it is better to devalue love so that we can over value personal freedom and liberation or whether it is better to value love to the degree that the law can recognize the natural consequence which seems intuitive and necessary even if when it pushes back on those ideas of the truly liberated indivual. I think I tend to side with the latter here, with the caveat that we need to be extremely careful about how we allow love to define the law. One way to do this is to maybe redefine progessivism not as a linear movement towards greater enlightenment and better laws but as the constant necessary responding to the ever changing balance of power that occurs in a democtratic society chasing after liberating ideals. This is perhaps the great dance that occurs with any developing society.
There is room to consider the ways in which progressive society has long shown a tendency to progress while losing its grip on the values that drive human relationship. This is why you can spot so many contradictions within such societies where the only thing that matters is the liberated indivual. When love itself ceases to become a valie and when we remain bound to defining love within the boundaries of a law that itself has no basis other than the liberated individual the whole thing becomes a walking contradiction of values which lead to great societal problems even while protecting us against their abuses. This is why, I think, we end up with such sharp divides between left and right when it comes to the relationship between law and moraltiy. A film like this is apt to show that perhaps we are then missing the real and true problem altogether. For example, a society that make laws concerning marriage which govern and protect the liberty of the indivual is good and necessary. Such laws that exist within a society where we can no longer articulate why marriage matters leads to destructive realities as we work to function according to our humanity within these laws. How we navigate this tension is a point of the film, and one that the ending brings about within its strartling and well thought out conclusion.",4.0

This is one of my favorite movies from the Old Hollywood era. I think it doesn't get talked about enough. It's far more than a story about a man cheating on his wife or living a double life.

all the choices in this made it better. to point out the contradictions in the norm, to portray both relationships as equally important, to use the flashback tool so mr. jordan may be an audience surrogate. this movie was about why people get into difficult situations such as this, prompting the viewer to consider the humanity of others. even our own morality is put into question because of the realism this was portrayed.

"Vaya año de Ida. Ésta y El autoestopista, dos películas excelentes. Un reparto muy equilibrado: Joan Fontaine, Ida Lupino, Edmund Gwenn, y el 'paratodo' Edmond O'Brien.
Una temática muy atrevida, especialmente para la época, dirigida por una mujer, lo cual parece una vuelta de tuerca.
La música es un poco intrusiva, a veces no deja de sonar cuando s está dialogando, lo que parece muy poco razonable. Lo mismo ocurre con alguna partitura de jazz que se escucha, no de fondo, sino como parte principal, interrumpiendo bastante el desarrollo.
El misterio, la trama, el objeto central de la película se revela pronto, prácticamente desde el principio. Rompe así con los cánones del propio cine. No parece que pueda despejarse al comienzo de qué va la cinta.
""Nuestro matrimonio se convirtió en una sociedad anónima"". Es una frase que va más allá de una frase hecha, de un mero tópico. Es una realidad, a veces es la única realidad. A veces es el sustento del propio matrimonio. No sé qué hubiera hecho Bergman con ella y con sus problemas de pareja, tan recurrentes en su cine.
Contada en un flashback presenta el problema como una realidad a la que no se pudo sustraer el protagonista. Una salida inevitable a la sensación de soledad en la que vive la relación que mantiene con su mujer.
A veces hay que hacer lo que hay que hacer, en el momento en que lo hay que hacer. Él parece querer salvar su matrimonio, sin embargo su mujer no se toma muy en serio el matrimonio, prefiriendo los negocios, la empresa, el vértigo del progreso profesional.
Las reflexiones sobre la relación adúltera, y sobre la soledad que realiza son interesantes. Sencillas, pero con mucho sentido.

"Não é para mim. O desenvolvimento de ""The Bigamist"" é insuportável, extremamente lento e sem personagens caricatos. Eu não consigo me importar com as pessoas em tela e muito menos com a historia narrada pelo homem pois ele, em nenhum momento, consegue me convencer que ama as duas mulheres.
Entendo que a proposta do filme seja explorar a ideia do poligamia, mostrando que é possível amar mais de uma pessoa ao mesmo tempo, só que isso é feito de forma tão maçante que se torna chato. Primeiramente, toda a narrativa ser feita através um flashback é uma ideia que termina ainda mais com o ritmo da obra, pois já sabemos como ela termina - ou como ela procede. Além disso, essa narrativa ser feita toda por um relato masculino, coloca em dúvida qualquer veracidade daquilo. É uma história contada por um homem sobre como ele ""se apaixonou"" por outra mulher enquanto casado, mas nada me confirma os fatos que estão sendo contados.
Não vou me delongar muito falando do filme, pois não é um que eu acredito ter muitos comentários sobre, mas preciso destacar a única sequência de interesse da obra, o seu final. Tanto o diálogo do juiz quanto a troca de olhares na cena final podem ser lidas de tantas maneiras que cria uma complexa conclusão para uma história tediosa em todo seu resto. Realmente não é um filme para mim, apesar de seu bom final.",2.5
"Whilst Lupino’s other film of 1953, the cult road thriller The Hitch-Hiker, could be described as a traditional noir, The Bigamist is stylistically more of a melodrama with noir trappings. It’s an unusual film for its time as it digs into the complexities of love as a concept in contrast to the idea of marriage at the time. As well as part and parcelling adultery and bigamy itself. It certainly helped that this was made independently to explore such taboo subject matter. Especially when Graham, compellingly played by O’Brien, explains how he got into this situation to the adoption agent via flash black. A situation rooted in fears of loneliness and emasculation, though ultimately resulting in Graham being trapped in conflicting emotions of love and guilt for both women. Screenwriter Collier Young’s affections for Lupino, his former wife, and Fontaine, his current wife, informed this. That, and Lupino as director granting the female characters enough weight just adds to the tragedy.
It’s a shame then, as compelling as the flashback meat of the plot is, that the ending feels somewhat rushed, once everything is out in the open. Maybe it’s down to budget constraints that more drama couldn’t be given to the women finding out about Graham’s lies. It just stops it from being a truly great film. The structure feels like a blessing and a detriment almost. Fortunately the former just makes the film work enough for me that I can’t slate it off. All in all a pretty good feature from one of the few female directors in classic Hollywood.",3.5

The movie is classical ""a boy meets a girl"" story. Storytelling is smooth. Directed well. But... if you have met someone, it feels fantastic, being together makes you happy then... why? Loneliness?

"It's typically a kabet story with a twist circa 1950s but devoid of histrionics and still mamanges to be very sweeping. The film focused on the moral dilemma and Lupino, already a pioneer of her time, directs The Bigamist with sensitivity and economy. But what stood out for me tho is Lupino the actress, I daresay she's more memorable here than Fontaine altho it might probably due to the role as well. She was instantly captivating in that bus scene where we first met her on a tour to Hollywood stars' homes. I also like the casting of Edmond O'Brian in the title role. And the juicy historical details that surround the film adds to its rare appeal!",4.0

Bigamist... More like Big A hole...,3.0
A marrieds couple in San Francisco wants to adopt a child but the head of the agency finds out that the husband has a secret lover in Los Angeles whom he visits regularly on his business trip - plus a child. The film is to the same degree melodrama and film noir. The love triangle and the husband’s infidelity are the themes of both genres. The long flashback reminded me of many  anti-hero’s confessions. The surprising thing is that the (female) director creates a lot of sympathy for the guilty (male) protagonist which makes it a rare piece of classical Hollywood cinema.,4.0

"O romance e adultério são tratados com muita ternura. O cuidado narrativo de Ida Lupino tanto com o protagonista quanto com as duas mulheres dá diferentes tons de cinza na complexa relação entre pessoas, junto da fotografia preto e branca rodada em locação, o que dá um alívio para os romances de estúdio da época, e reforça o teor realista do retrato, a profundidade das personagens que habitam no mundo real. O começo do filme parece um tanto caricato, a investigação soa superficial, e a condução em flashbacks e locução em off dá contornos literários à história, o que afirma o melodrama mas entra em conflito com o realismo, que ao meu ver é a chave do filme. Há um singelo julgamento da personagem Eve, que é mulher de negócios e não “toca” Harry, mas o retrato das mulheres que ocupam os novos postos de trabalho serve como exemplar da ideologia da época, algo maior que o gênero da diretora. Mas esse elemento é necessário para fazer-nos torcer por uma delas, ainda que ao longo do filme Eve ganhe mais profundidade e, no final, gera a sensação de dúvida e pena do triângulo amoroso.",3.5
"Eine klassisch melodramatische Situation: Ein Mann liebt zwei Frauen, beide lieben ihn. Die eine kann keine Kinder bekommen, die andere schon. Problem: Mit Ersterer ist er seit acht Jahren verheiratet. Noch größeres Problem: Er heiratet die Zweite auch noch.
Genau dies ist die Lage von Harry Graham, einem angesehenen Handelsvertreter aus San Francisco. Mit seiner Gattin Eve will er ein Kind adoptieren, wofür aber sein Privatleben durchleuchtet wird. Dabei stößt der zuständige Beamte schließlich auf sein zweites Leben in Los Angeles, wo er bereits ein Baby hat. Dieses doppelte Spiel ist nicht nur aus moralischer Sicht fragwürdig, besonders den Frauen gegenüber. Durch die Heirat bricht Harry damit auch offiziell das Gesetz.
Und das ist schon ein springender Punkt für Ida Lupinos Film. ""Der Bigamist"" ist kein klassisches Melodrama und vor allem keine Morallehrstunde. Statt künstlicher Konstruktion baut die Regisseurin und Darstellerin der zweiten Frau Phyllis hier auf konsequenten Realismus, der aber noch viel tragischer und absurder ist. Keine der Figuren ist nämlich wirklich schlecht. Harry hat sich von seiner Frau etwas entfremdet, weil sie sich aufgrund der Unfähigkeit, Kinder zu gebären, immer mehr dem Geschäft widmet. Er liebt Eve noch immer, aber hat nun eben einen gewissen Überschuss an Liebe übrig und fühlt sich einsam auf den Geschäftsreisen. Deswegen gewinnt die gewitzte Phyllis schnell sein Herz, die ebenso einsam ist. Alle lieben einander, keiner hat eine böse Absicht. Natürlich begeht Harry einen kurzsichtigen Fehler, der ihn in ein moralisches Dilemma bringt. Lupino liegt es aber fern, ihn dafür zu verurteilen. Im Gegenteil, sie fühlt mit ihm mit, sowohl das Hoch der romantischen Liebe als auch das Tief des ausweglosen Schmerzes. Gerade das macht die Tragik des Ganzen aus: Es gibt keinen Bösen, nur einen Schuldigen. Einer, dessen beste, ja reine Absicht für alle Unglück bringt.
Lupinos Realismus zeichnet sich aber nicht bloß in einem komplexen humanistischen Moralverständnis aus. Vielmehr ist es auch ihre gekonnte Inszenierung. In ihrem wohl bekanntesten Film ""The Hitch-Hiker"" zeichnet sich diese durch konzentrierten Minimalismus und prägnante Bildsprache aus. Hier sind es besonders, passend zum Genre des Melodram, Schauspiel und Dialoge. Letztere sind ironischerweise gerade deswegen so realistisch, weil sie in gewisser Weise dem postmodernen Sprech Godards und besonders Tarantinos vorgreifen. Harrys Unterhaltung mit Phyllis über chinesischen Essen hätten auch Vincent Vega und Jules Winnfield führen können. Noch besser wird es aber, wenn auf der Bustour, bei der sich die beiden kennenlernen, über Filme und Stars schwadroniert wird. Der Höhepunkt: Harry ist großer Fan von ""Das Wunder von Manhattan"" mit Edmund Gwenn. Gwenn spielt hier in diesem Film aber auch den zuständigen Beamten für die Adoption.
Es sind Gespräche, die alltäglich sind, die man auch persönlich so führen würde, die deswegen aber gerade so ungewohnt für Hollywood sind. Man glaubt den Figuren dadurch aber auch jedes andere, emotionale, tiefschürfende Wort, weil sie auch sonst wie echte Menschen reden. Was dies aber noch zusätzlich begünstigt, ist das überragende Ensemble. Der erwähnte Gwenn ist entzückend altbacken, auf eine angebrachte Weise, im Grunde aber nur eine Nebenfigur. Im Zentrum steht freilich das Liebesdreieck. Die Damen sind beide gewohnt grandios, gerade in ihrer Gegensätzlichkeit. An Fontaine klebt das amerikanische Ideal, das etwas Biedere, dem sie aber durch so fundamental authentische Ehrlichkeit etwas überaus Menschliches gibt. Lupino ist ganz und gar nicht idealtypisch, aber gerade durch ihr keckes Charisma, ihre souveräne Weiblichkeit und die melancholische Leidenschaft umso Sympathischer. Beide sind nicht bloß Hälften einer Persönlichkeit oder ineinander passende Puzzleteile, sondern wirkliche Menschen. Ganz still und heimlich stiehlt ihnen darin aber Edmond O'Brien als Harry die Show. Sein Spiel ist leise, in sich gekehrt, ja unauffällig. Dennoch stellt er ein so tiefes und aufrichtiges Gefühlsleben dar, dass man so tief mit ihm bei seiner selbstverschuldeten Tragödie mitfühlt. Er hat keinerlei Starappeal, ist niemand Außergewöhnliches. Wie es auch vor Gericht sein Verteidiger sagt: ""Er ist ganz sicher kein Held, aber auch kein Monster."" Harry ist einfach ein echter Mensch.
Und mit diesem einfachen Faktum schafft Ida Lupino ein kleines Meisterstück. Ihre Inszenierung ist empfindsam, aber nicht zerbrechlich, schaut sich die schweigenden, aber doch vor Gedanken und Gefühl schreien Gesichter der Figuren ganz genau an, behält aber auch immer den Überblick für das Ganze. Selten war amerikanisches Kino so empathisch, so echt. Noch vor Cassavetes und fast noch mehr als Fuller definiert Lupino hier ein unabhängiges amerikanisches Kino, das schlicht vom Leben erzählt. Gleichzeitig antizipiert sie schon die filmische Reflexion, für die ihre männlichen Kollegen später wie Götter gefeiert werden. Man muss den Kanon in zweifacher Hinsicht ergänzen. Lupino, Fuller, Cassavetes, aber auch Tarantino, Godard, Lupino.",4.0
"Por si só já é uma situação decadente.
Ida Lupino imprime no filme a afirmação ""justificável não é perdoável"" e trabalha todos os personagens desse filme como peças sobressalentes um do outro.
As duas mulheres completam os desejos do homem, que busca na amante a cura para a solidão de suas viagens e acaba preenchendo a lacuna paternal que sua esposa, teoricamente, não pode suprir. É um longa que opta muito mais por estudar a situação e mostrar o que levou àquilo, do que encher a tela de julgamentos.
Você entende o protagonista mesmo que seja repulsivo. Mas de certa maneira Ida trata tudo com tanto carinho e ternura que se transforma num drama que investe suas forças no conflito de sentimentos ao invés do conflito ético e moral. Um filme que aposta no amor mesmo quando parece haver falta dele.",4.0

"Kind of a fascinating noir-ish social drama about... the prison of monogamy? Lupino basically seems to present her main character as a fundamentally good man who tries to do best by everyone and thus ends up in an intenable position for everyone, which is honestly a supremely charitable view of this weak-willed, wet blanket of a man who seems completely incapable of coming to grips with his own responsibilities and vary happy to instead indulge in the path of least resistance, but Lupino's humanistic approach almost convinces me.
There are many fascinating threads here, the one I'm the most curious about being Joan Fontaine's character being initially presented as being responsible for the situation for stepping outside of the traditional female role and being too much of a business partner and not enough of a wife, which the film doesn't entirely move away from but does complexify a bit by the end. The other one is the way the O'Brien/Lupino relationship develops, with her on the defensive at all times, always ready to get out, even when she gets pregnant, and him constantly pushing for more - she'd be perfectly okay with being a single mother, or at least that's what she clearly signals to him, but no, his sense of ethics dictates that this would be a crueler fate than being a man's second wife without knowing about it. I don't think the film quite reckons with the arrogance and entitlement present in this character who makes all of these complex choices by himself, but the performances are layered enough that this all comes through somewhat.
In the end, it feels like a film pushing in too many directions at once, which I'm not sure if I want to qualify as subtle or muddled. I guess i'll just settle for ""interesting"".",3.0

The characters are all quite likeable, including Gwen's character, who is sympathetic as he recounts how his moral dilemma came about. Ida Lupino definitely steals the show and overshadows Fontaine.
This film is very character-driven, and achieves a lot by not doing very much at all.",3.5
Je trouve que Ida Lupino a vraiment une vision très intéressante des relations hommes femmes et que les histoires qu’elle met en scène bien que un peu invraisemblable (déjà de par la situation mais même les dialogues qui sont d’une justesse mais qui dans la vrai vie ne passe pas vraiment) sont très réaliste dans la nature des relations. Tout comme le point de vue qu’elle a sur ses personnages que je trouve dans ce film très humains et affectueux.,4.0
Lupino was underrated as a stylist. So much textbook noir in this.

A meio, não conseguia perceber bem para onde é que o filme estava a ir, até que no final, não foi a lado nenhum.
The Bigamist é um filme onde toda a surpresa, todo o jus que possa existir surge no desenvolvimento da história, no encadeamento dos eventos. Isto porque, a conclusão não tem surpresa alguma, já a conhecemos pelo título.
Neste bizarre love triangle, é interessante o confronto entre o rosto de Joan Fontaine, severo e determinado, e de Ida Lupino, de traços doces, mais frágil. Este confronto serve para explicar (justificar ?) a divisão, a tal bigamia, de Harry, para quem Eve/Joan funciona como mãe (daí a sua infertilidade com Harry) e Phyllis/Ida como recreio.
Já o Mr. Jordan é perfeitamente insuportável - mas sentimos que o filme acaba estranhamente por justificar a importância do seu trabalho de importunação e invasão descarada de privacidade.

"As with other Ida Lupino films, this one dealt with a sensitive topic that is still relevant today. The Bigamist exceeds in bringing a tense atmosphere to a film about a man who is unfaithful to his wife, and ends up living a ""double life"" with another woman.
This film almost felt like a crime film, its suspenseful and fast paced. I was expecting a romance type film, and not really a film noir, but I really love how exciting it was. It does separate itself with other movies like it, because the audience knows how it will end. No matter which woman the main character chooses, there will be problems.
There is also the way Ida Lupino includes the fact that the mans mistake effects the husband and wife equally. Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino are both very similar to each other, because they dont know what their ""husband"" is up to. The courtroom scene at the end is probably the best scene in the movie as it illustrates this similarity well. It leaves the audience wondering what happened after the film ends.

"While it wasn't as overall strong as the other two films of Ida's that ive seen, it's still a uniquely compelling, if slightly flawed, melodrama that, again, showcases her unique grasp of moral complexity and empathy.",4.0
"Directed with tremendous empathy, almost to the film's detriment. While you could certainly argue that the film stacks the deck in Harry's favour, I find the ambiguity it creates to be fascinating. Sometimes we make bad choices, and instead of a big lesson that changes us forever, all we get are consequences.
Even so, Harry is arguably the least interesting character in the film. 'The Bigamist' is strongest when it's focused on Phyllis, his second wife. Ida Lupino gives an extraordinary performance here, and even though the film is well directed, it's her work as an actress that elevates the film for me. In only a few scenes, we watch as her hard shell gets chipped away to reveal the insecure, lonely soul beneath. It's deeply affecting and lends credibility to what could easily be a simple, sordid affair.
It may not approach this subject matter with the searing horror of Varda's 'Les Bonheurs', for instance, but it succeeds in other ways that are equally legitimate.",4.0

"Ida Lupino complementó su carrera como actriz al ponerse tras la cámara (y en el rol de guionista y productora) en los 40, convirtiéndose no sólo en una de las mujeres pioneras del cine, sino también en una de los pocos artistas de su época con tal capacidad.
Aquí encontramos un fiel reflejo de dos facetas de la mujer en la sociedad (y más en la de su tiempo): la mujer que trabaja, ganándose la vida y triunfando como empresaria; y la mujer que se dedica a su marido e hijos.
Y podríamos decir que son dos arquetipos de mujer, pero en realidad se alejaría mucho de lo que es 'El bígamo' pues, aunque la historia gire en torno a un hombre que lleva dos vidas y dos matrimonios, las protagonistas son ellas. Ellas que empiezan donde acaba la otra y que inician sus caminos en polos opuestos; ellas que, no por decisión propia realmente, deciden tomar caminos paralelos; ellas que son dos caras de la misma moneda, que es el ideal de mujer ""perfecta"".
Lupino debía saber muy bien lo qué se esperaba de ella en una sociedad así. Y más en una industria dominada por los hombres tras la pantalla. Es quizás por lo que decidió hacer el papel de la mujer abnegada y dependiente, como contrapunto a Fontaine, que se acercaba más a su faceta de artista exitosa y fuerte.
Y dirigió una interesante crítica a toda esa visión social y cultural de la figura de la mujer, a través del bígamo: un hombre que, por querer a esa mujer perfecta, decide no renunciar a ninguna de las dos partes, excusándose más en su egoísmo victimista que en el amor. Es en el juicio donde esa crítica moral llega a su esplendor y se encara directamente con el espectador.
Un punto que llama la atención, y que muy probablemente sea debido a su directora, es cómo interaccionan sus personajes: el hecho de que una mujer decida besar a un hombre, y no al revés, como es más ""propio"" del cine clásico, sorprende bastante conociendo el contexto.
A nivel técnico, lo que más destaca son los pequeños detalles en planos cerrados, introducidos para dotar de una mayor naturalidad en esa relación entre los personajes (como el roce de las manos al despedirse en la escalera).",3.0

(this movie is honestly more nuanced than that in the sense that the male lead genuinely DOES act with the best interests of his wives in mind, but nonetheless)",3.5
"Das peças mais formidáveis de uma Hollywood clássica em todos os sentidos, O Bígamo vira um espaço para Ida Lupino fazer perguntas difíceis e não necessariamente respondê-las. Um filme que traz para seu centro o sexo sem falar disso, que traz para o primeiro plano um desconforto do qual a cineasta nunca se afasta. Materializando uma complexidade moral rara para aquele contexto.
Econômica como sempre foi na construção visual, ela faz pelos detalhes que se destacam nesse minimalismo ferramentas precisas de construção melodramática. Já na primeira cena onde o personagem de Edmond O’Brien exita em assinar a autorização para que o departamento municipal de adoção investigue sua vida privada.
Tal qual o personagem de Edmund Gwenn, centro moral do filme, a obra vai desdobrando aos poucos o que tem pra ser revelado. Nos apresentando essas pistas da forma de olhar e acompanhando o protagonista sendo posto contra a parede.
Não é no mistério disso, entretanto, que a diretora está interessada. (se fosse isso, aliás, o filme não traria no título o que se descobre logo na virada do primeiro para o segundo ato: o protagonista tem duas famílias). O foco de Lupino é esse trazer à tona tudo o que há de mais complexo no que circula o crime cometido pelo homem.
Para tal, faz uma das coisas mais inventivas que poderia fazer nesse contexto, nessa Hollywood, nessa sociedade: conta a história pelo olhar do culpado por esse crime.
Escancara, no flashback que relata o relacionamento com a amante e tudo o que veio depois disso, uma multiplicidade de sentimentos. Torna ele porta voz não só de sua história individual como um personagem que é um representante dos questionamentos feitos à época a instituições sagradas como o casamento.
De quebra, traz o sexo à tona. E os filhos. Não foge à ideia deles ao mesmo tempo enquanto bênçãos e como fardo de diversas formas.
No todo, é fabuloso como O Bígamo se torna um melodrama que contém no seu miolo, um film noir que se materializa na história contada pelo seu personagem principal. A narração do áudio, o tormento emocional, moral, culpado do relato e, claro, a concepção visual de tudo isso. (os corrimãos das escadas da pousada onde ela mora que, projetados na parede pela luz baixa, evidenciam ao redor dele uma prisão)
Dos filmes feitos para que o elenco brilhe, de Joan Fontaine a Edmund Gwenn (o Papai Noel de Milagre na Rua 34) se tornam uma das maiores forças do longa. E mesmo Lupino, no papel da “outra” dá o próprio corpo para o papel daquela que muita gente na época (e hoje) apontaria como culpada dos crimes do amado.
A resolução que vem amarga é só uma forma de coroar o que há de melhor aqui. O como ela nunca deixa de lado a complexidade, como não se afasta do desconforto, não condena seu protagonista mas não por isso deixa de questioná-lo. Coisa que numa era do cancelamento fácil discutido dia a dia na indústria cultural é muitas vezes abafada pelo peso morto das saídas fáceis e das soluções simples que não buscam nada mais que uma fuga covarde de tudo.",4.0

"A curious melodrama from master director Ida Lupino.
Ida Lupino’s romantic melodrama The Bigamist (1953) is interesting precisely because Lupino directs it with an ambiguous moral compass. Only in the end does The Bigamist condemn this man for cheating on his first wife with a new mistress he marries and even parents a child. The rest of the film allows him to feel justified in the sense that he was a lonely salesman, so that you sympathize with this decent regular guy, all while ignoring the pain he is putting these women through, especially once they find out about his infidelity. Lupino’s direction is fascinating because she allows the man to be sympathetic as we follow him. She always keeps you emotionally invested in each romantic encounter as they feel like real conversations.
Collier Young’s script feels so strangely sexist as he goes to great lengths to excuse this cheating bigamist’s behavior as the desperate attempt of a man going through a midlife crisis to be happy. Ida Lupino should have told this story from the perspective of the ladies finding out about this man, instead The Bigamist is left ambiguous as to who he ends up with and truly loves, but the viewer knows by the end really. I think Young’s writing feels realistic in how people speak and in understanding the longing the lonely feel. However, he spends too long pretending that it’s morally okay for this supposed protagonist to cheat on his wife with another woman, when he is basically the villain of The Bigamist.
Ida Lupino is phenomenal as the lonely lady living on her own in Los Angeles named Phyllis Martin. She directs herself with a zeal and amorous affection. Phyllis is totally realistic as she feels like a genuinely lonesome woman wanting love, only to be devastated by her husband’s infidelity. Lupino has such fiery dialogue and sheer willpower. Her every line bites and comes across like Phyllis is a seriously cool lady. Joan Fontaine is likewise fantastic as Harry’s first wife Eve Graham. She is a sincere, independent woman, who finds renewed energy as a business woman instead of merely one man’s wife. Both actresses hurt you emotionally as you must witness their pain in their eyes and body language over this foolish cheating bigamist.
Edmond O’Brien is excellent as Harry and Harrison Graham. He lets you feel for this terrible man. He has little charisma or charm, so you cannot believe Ida Lupino or Joan Fontaine would have fallen for him, so perhaps Ida should have cast someone younger and more charming. However, O’Brien delivers raw emotion with a nuanced performance far more than you’d expect from a Code era film that must condemn this bigamist. Edmund Gwynn is great as the elderly adoption agent, who is honestly shocked at the scandal he uncovers.
Stanford Tischler’s editing is nicely succinct for this simple dramatic premise. His cuts keep The Bigamist down to a tasteful 80 minutes alongside Ida Lupino’s emotionally earnest direction. George E. Diskant’s cinematography looks striking with long panning shots that hold on the lead, so you always are thinking about what he is doing or feeling. Edward G. Boyle’s set decoration looks like they’re really lived in homes for both households. Leith Stevens’ score is nice with a pleasant romance to his melodies, while dark during the harder dramatic scenes.
In short, The Bigamist is provocative, ahead of its time, and thoughtful with a sincerity and fairness from Ida Lupino that is absorbing.",4.0
"I really wanted to like this movie so bad. It’s independent film in the era of studio conglomerates, it’s directed by a woman, it’s a provocative storyline. But alas, the story structure was a mess. It doesn’t help that the “catch” of the story is completely spoiled in the title. The structure of the man being found out by an over exuberant adoption agent and then narrating and coming clean on everything was the most boring way to find out story points.

"Ida Lupino is a fascinating Hollywood figure, a reliable actress who turned prolific filmmaker in an age where women rarely got to sit in the director’s chair.  1953 was her best year, helming the great minimalist thriller “The Hitch Hiker” and this unique look at, well, a bigamist (Edmond O’Brien) with two wives, played by Joan Fontaine and Lupino herself.   But the film isn’t in condemning mode, and is more of a character study on how a normal man could fall into such tricky territory (he’s intimidated in part by the careerism of Fontaine’s character); the concluding scenes reverberate with psychological complexity.  There’s also a willful meta aspect; at one point O’Brien’s Harry Graham talks about how much he enjoyed “Miracle on 34th Street,” whose Santa (Edmond Gwenn) co-stars here; much more bizarrely, “The Bigamist” was written and produced by Collier Young, Lupino’s ex-husband and Fontaine’s current one, which must have made for some weird moments on set.",3.5

"“I can’t figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you. And I pity you. I don’t even want to shake your hand. And yet, I almost wish you luck.”
Ida Lupino at the height of her powers here. Her subtlety in visual style is less ‘innovative’ in this film than in her previous outings but it shows a mastery of the form. Reminds me of William Wyler & Scorsese’s more recent films.... (it’s because they know what gets the job done!) 
What makes Lupino stand out, in my mind, is that in a Coded era, where films usually made pleasing moral statements, how we are encouraged to view our central character, our bigamist, remains ambiguous. And it’s a much MUCH richer film as a result.
Ida Lupino is a gem.",5.0

"Lupino fare.
Unlike many of today's filmakers, Lupino doesn't seem restricted to a specific narrative. She certainly sticks to similar themes throughout her filmography, but The Bigamist is an example of her versatility. Coming off the heels of Outrage and The Hitchhiker, she departs from a female gaze and attempts to emulate the opposite. She humanizes a man partaking in bigamy, how much farther could you go from a 21st century feminist narrative?",3.5
"Something that begins as a noir (this time the institutional bureaucracy chosen hounding after the individual isn't the police but rather child services) grafted awkwardly onto a melodrama. I'm not the police, the administrator turned detective tells him, when he almost asks him to turn him in.
As a noir, rather poorly constructed. The admin detective says the reason why he begins his quest is a hint of a ""A chip on the shoulder attitude"" from him. Strange, irrelevant clues give him away: an inscribed dagger with his other name.
Becomes existential (Never did I feel more alone and alone I was in pain) and much more humane despite the melodramatic content. He of course truly falls in love with the second after she has a baby and: I felt needed for the first time in my life.
The second woman, after finding out the story, has the gall to remonstrate herself and beg him for forgiveness after he dumps her: You gave my ego a kick. Will you forgive me.
After the tale is told to the admin, he becomes a nondescript priestly figure, moralistic without outright bile: A gallant and a foolish scheme. I despise you, I pity you. I almost wish you luck.
Terrible soundtrack that won't stop punishing you with its sappy strings.
The judge on his outlandish ruling: When a man, even with the best intentions we live by, we don't really need man made laws to punish him, the penalty of the courts is the smallest judgements.
While trying to woo her on the bus during a Hollywood homes bus tour, he notices her ""sales resistance"" to his charm. Is this confessional narrative and outward display of humble humanism (no one was wrong, it was just difficult unfortunate circumstances piled on one another) a sales tactic he uses (the pinnacle of the technique: asking the judge to condemn him at court, a false humility: no one, not even the guilty, want to be punished by bureaucrats) to win our favour and hearts or actual remorse?",0.0

"Ida Lupino was a moderately well known star who took over direction on one of her films in 1949 when director Elmer Clifton suffered a mild heart attack and was unable to finish Not Wanted, After that she would go on to direct several more movies, becoming the only female director in Hollywood at that time. In this film she directed herself for the only time. It's a film that is more interesting than good. Edmond O'Brien stars as a successful refrigeration salesman, married to his wife and business partner, Joan Fontaine. Since she can't have a baby, they try to adopt one. Adoption agency worker Edmund Gwenn investigates O'Brien's background and inevitably discovers his secret second wife (Lupino) and child. The film tries to bend over backwards to make what O'Brien has done seem reasonable, (not always successfully, in my opinion) and it gets into some interesting issues, such as O'Brien finding himself less attracted to his working girl wife. But it seems to end just as it's getting interesting, and Fontaine's inevitable discovery of Lupino is done offscreen, killing the impact. So, this is no classic.",3.0
"A film full of tension and great performances.
Ida Lupino stars and directs, not very common now let alone in the 1950s.
As bigamists go they don't get much bigger than Edmund O'Brien as Harry, a travelling salesman who has a tough time trying not to hurt the 2 women he loves, long standing wife Eve is played with the usual radiance you would expect from Joan Fontaine but the marriage is more apart than together, Harry eventually succumbs to an affair while away on business, falling for Phyllis, played in a fairly typical way gor Ida Lupino, a tough on the outside kind of women with understated beauty.
The whole situation is not going to plan and then discovered by the adoption agent, Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) whilst he is checking the suitability of Eve and Harry to adopt a child to complete their family picture. It's the guilt on Harry's face that triggered Jordan to dig deeper, and O'Brien is clearly acting with the world on his shoulders, but Harry isn't a bad guy, he just wants to make everyone happy, but what will the court of law decide?, will one of his Wives still want him?",4.0

"Hollywood in the post-war period, under the duress of competition from radio and television, began to see its production-code responsibility to bring to light, and in essence nationalize, issues deemed important to ""cover"" through its productions. Sometimes the use of this warrant could be quite cynical indeed, for example, having given us the thrill of the central sequence shot of Psycho, Hitchcock tacked on a ten-minute coda to that film warning about the social prevalence of psychosis. However, if not all such coverage can be deemed as cynical, a midwesterner can't be blamed for wondering how prevalent are issues that, to a Westerner, may indeed have been something one ran into now and again -- and I'm reminded of this by the occasion that brought a woman into the director's chair : bigamy.
Harry Graham, seen through the eyes of Eve (Joan Fontaine), a lovely girl astute with numbers, but unable to conceive, so that her husband, Harry, in franchising his sales accounts, more or less forgets about her doing the books at home, as she dreams of adopting a child, and so we see him, at least briefly, through the eyes of an adoption agency assessor (Edmund Gwynn), who follows Harry to L.A., on a business trip where Harry has met, some year or so earlier, Phyllis (Ida Lupino; she also directs), a waitress in a Chinese restaurant. Their loneliness can be shared, and Phyllis is all-too fertile, as their first night together seems to result in Phyllis' pregnancy, that she maintains while Harry continues to pursue adoption with Eve.
Harry is a phlegmatic, irritable peace-keeper, and as Edmund O'Brien plays him, a little difficult to make out -- therein lies much of the suspense in this story. O'Brien had done White Heat with Raoul Walsh and A Double Life with George Cukor, so he was a hot actor, working a lot, about to get his Oscar for The Barefoot Contessa. Lupino centers him, and though we don't find out if he wants to have a child, we do find out that he more than accomodates a situation in which he has one.
Lupino's direction raises the question of whether her choice of material, the indirect points-of-view of the scenario, and the strangely non-judgmental tone toward Harry Graham all amount to more interest here than the lurid, journalistic exposure of the topic.",3.0

"A businessman (Edmond O'Brien) and his wife (Joan Fontaine) are investigated by an adoption agency director (Edmund Gwenn) to determine their suitability as parents. The investigation leads to some interesting revelations about the husband's personal life. This is considered the first feature film in which a starring actress (Ida Lupino) was also the director. It is also considered the first film noir to be directed by a woman. It's worth watching even if the acting, and editing are a bit choppy at times; it's still a good story, and a pretty good picture overall.

Jordan (Edmund Gwenn) résume parfaitement le dilemme du spectateur  : ""I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck."" Il tente meme à plusieurs reprises de dire la vérité sur sa double vie.

"I liked Lupino's HITCH-HIKER a lot. Well, apparently, the size of something called an Amist is the subject of her '53 film, whether it's a small one I guess, Small Amist, or a big one, Big Amist? I don't know yet honestly, but I'll find out soon. BIGAMIST, concerning then a big amist, plays like it's not very natural (tooting together a kind of perfect melodrama) but like it's masterfully building its own kind of naturalness. Do you know what I mean?
Prettily. Quaintly. It feels a lot like Minnelli's CLOCK in '45 trotting for NYC or Sirk's ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS in '55 trotting for suburbia. Or we see geography of Hitch's VERTIGO in '58 (color-splashed San Francisco) or morality of Hitch's WRONG MAN in '56 (Henry Fonda accused in stark black-&-white). Or somewhat like Morris Engel's squat and adorable '50s work, in LITTLE FUGITIVE in '53 or in LOVERS & LOLLIPOPS in '56.
Lupino's BIGAMIST tries to explain the sordid 'double life' of one guy, by his loneliness among other things. It was the first American feature, y'know, to have its director star in it as an actress. I appreciate getting on a sightseeing bus after the narration remarks that 'though I couldn't care less where Clark Gable lived, here were people heading somewhere with a sense of purpose'; trying to dazzle somebody with trivia and such, 'Don't you have any interest in how the other half lives?', hearing 'Not particularly'. Hehe, boom.
A brighter, post-DETOUR picture, hey, love. Is it really cheating if the person on whom you're 'cheating' allows it? ""We asked nothing of each other""? Really? This takes in place in America, where of course exceptions are never made morally: everything's pure in those terms. Uh! Swap a splash fantasy around true-love myths, maybe sort of a lot better than SCARLET STREET or PICNIC. And I think it grabs something so truly true often enough, I guess it could only be made by Ida Lupino and be about an Amist of a certain size. Big? ""You know it, toots"".",4.5

What's the opposite of economical dialogue? The actors very touchingly and effectively wear their hearts on their sleeves then proceed to tell you exactly what they are emoting, and then 20 seconds later summarize it all again for you. There is still somehow a really strong sense of character beneath it all - the person who wrote the dialogue just wasn't in on any part of it. It's hard to fully accept that a character who has buried everything and can't communicate his feelings or actions to others, or himself, is also able to monologue the audience through his situation with a heightened degree of emotional awareness. 
To paraphrase what is expressed in the judgement and summarization of morality that is cast at the end (twice, naturally) it's not really good or bad, but it is curiously decent. 
The cheeky ""he's like Santa Claus""/Miracle on 34th Street dialogue is so strange because that movie only came out 6 years prior, but it's charming - The Casablanca stuff was less so.

I'm seeing now that I just really got hung up on the dialogue. Clearly didn't get past it. That's on me.",3.0
"Possibly the only female director working under the stricture of studio system of Hollywood’s Golden Age, actress-turned-moviemaker Ida Lupino has two pictures released in 1953 (soon her production company would close up shop and she would only direct one more picture in 1965), both grittily tackles the thorny, contentious maladies of American society at large.
THE BIGAMIST is a moral conundrum, San Franciscan couple Harry Graham (O’Brien) and Eve’s (Fontaine) conjugal harmony begins to crumble after they they find out Eve is infertile, turning her disappointment into business-driving entrepreneurship, Eve distances both emotionally and physically from Harry, who feels excruciatingly lonesome when on his business days in L.A, where he meets Phyllis Martin (Lupino), a waitress he finds rather sympathetic.
Collier Young’s script (yes, he is also the producer, Lupino’s ex-husband and Fontaine’s current hubby, talking about in-jokes and self-reference!) eminently portrays Phyllis as an independent-thinking, no-string-attached sweetheart that even a decent man like Harry cannot resist her blunt, unsentimental spell, “I don’t want anything from you.” is Phyllis’ opening remark. Therefore, in order to validate that Harry and Phyllis’ reluctant union (after Phyllis has a bun in the oven) is out of unalloyed mutual love, Eve has to take the short stick on account of her distancing maneuvers, sheer insouciance when Harry mentions to her his first encounter with Phyllis on a Hollywood tour bus. Eventually, it is Eve’s belated decision to adopt a baby that puts Harry’s double life on a line, when a diligent adoption agent Mr. Jordan (Gwenn) is keen on getting to the bottom of it.
While the narrative gains on a typical melodrama, Lupino the director refrains from performative hyperbole and swelling music to elicit audience’s sensorial response, instead she adopts a matter-of-fact tenet to map onto the triad’s mental trajectories with admirable exactitude, with O’Brien strenuously carrying off Harry’s beset disquietude and Lupino herself, playing pitch-perfect notes of Phyllis’ fragile brave face. THE BIGAMIST is a searing drama but its intensity is not exterior but interior.
THE HITCH-HIKER, released 9 months before THE BIGAMIST, is a taut all-hombre film-noir based on the lurid true story of a psychopathic hitch-hiker on a killing spree, a polarized remove from Lupino’s woman-issue B pictures she has cranked out since 1949.
Two ordinary men Roy Collins and Gilbert Bowen (O’Brien and Lovejoy) are heading to a fishing trip in Mexico, but incur a hostage to fortune after picking up Emmett Myers (Talman), who, at the drop of a hat, points a pistol at them. Coerced to do Myers’ bidding, the two friends come in for psychological and physical torment while they traverse through the expansive, often barren terrain in the heart of the Baja California Peninsula (Lupino and her team make great play of extensive location shootings that renders the pair’s noir-ish nightmare melt under the sweltering sun).
Talman, with one “bum eye” whose eyelid cannot be closed on a chilling, odiously smug mug, makes for an excellent villain and unregenerately spouts Myers’ venomous affronts one after another, letting his baseness and slyness get the better of the hapless duo, who are the essential salt-of-the-earth type, driven to crack under mounting pressure (O’Brien’s Collins is the one who almost loses it and Lovejoy’s Bowne is more resilient, patient and astute).
If Lupino really enters into the spirit by building up the tension and confrontation, THE HITCH-HIKER’s finale somewhat sags when the inevitable comeuppance transpires patly, elicits a bathetic feeling, why the heck they couldn’t act sooner to end their protracted misery?
Showing her laudable proficiency in molding two disparate pictures, Lupino’s singular case only woefully reminds us gender is never an issue in movie business’ division of labor. Ergo today, collectively and unflaggingly we should increase and uncap the number of women and members of minorities to all the tiers of the moviemaking edifice, just for the sake of putting the past wrong to rights, whose century-long accumulated debts are plain outrageous.",3.5

It seems very conflicted, but one thing I really liked about this film isn't even because of the makers themselves, I liked how at times it has really shoddy and jarring cuts indicating there's a slight shot or movement there that was too damaged or lost to time, it felt like a 1920's silent film that was given audio, and I liked that.

This was way better than the last film noir I saw The Big Knife which also starred Ida Lupino. This one at least felt like a movie and Lupino had serious talent as a director. I saw some people saying this film was kinda of misogynistic (which is really surprising considering it was directed by a woman) and true it's not the most progressive film. But I don't think it's a sexist film. Everything bad that happens in this movie is Harry's fault. =Eve and Phyllis do everything right and are just innocent victims of the whole affair. I think the reason people call this film misogynistic is because of how much Harry is sympathized with. But you can show sympathy even for characters who aren't the best people. Harry is something as a tragic figure as his actions not only hurt him but the two women he loves most.",3.5

"Though I enjoyed the film overall, I found it very difficult to swallow the exceptionally sympathetic portrayal of the tortured and oh so very decent titular 'bigamist'. With screenwriter Collier Young having been married first to director/star Lupino and then to co-star Fontaine, real life certainly informs this tale, which sidesteps the more homicidal tendencies of the noir canon with which it is generally associated.

"trope trope trope
Edmund O'Brien is second rate Raymond Burr
I feel that Ida Lupino's screen presence is underserved by the script and by the film she directed herself in.
Most of the movie is our underwhelming luggish male protagonist gripping one of the female protagonists and giving her some sappy speech to which either woman responds with ""Oh Harry! Do you reeeally?"" or ""I've been such a fool!""
Also the music that swells in the back groud throughout pretty much the entire duration gets very tiresome.
Most interesting sequence by far is the one on the bus, in-film references are always fun, especially re: hollywood and the truly inane nature of celebrity culture
Sad to say I might just not be much of a Lupino stan, between this and ""The Hitchhiker"" I am not quite getting the hype... nevertheless she is still a badass filmmaker and this film has merits-- many more than are visible to me in ""The Hitchhiker,"" I just feel like critiquing instead of listing the few things I do appreciate about it (right now)",3.0

"Kitchen sink melodramas aren't really my favorite style of movie, but I'd never seen a film directed by Ida Lupino so I thought I'd give this one a try.
It has a decent cast:
Edmond O'Brien whose only film I actually remember him from is D.O.A. so maybe that makes him a distinctly unremarkable Hollywood actor.
Joan Fontaine who has always been way too mousey for me. I love Rebecca, but not her role in it; and Suspicion is a fairly bland effort from Hitchcock. The Bigamist doesn't do much to change my opinion of her as an actress.
Ida Lupino who I think gives the most distinguished performance of the three.

Bigamy definitely seems like a fairly touchy subject to wrap a Code-era film around. I was enjoying the movie fairly well until Ida Lupino essentially gives Edmond O'Brien a pass for what he did, takes the blame for forcing him to commit bigamy, apologizes to HIM for the situation, and refers to him as a 'big lug' that she can't stand to give up.
I think I threw up in my mouth a little. I understand fully that gender roles have transformed significantly in public perception since this movie was made, but I can't give a pass to a movie whose 'punishment' ending feels so tacked on and unconvincing.",2.5
"Ida Lupino in particular is excellent in this surprisingly nuanced and unpredictably structured noir / drama.

Datar aja sih,3.5
"The third or fourth movie directed by Ida Lupino I've seen. I was surprised by this one—I expected the titular bigamist to be portrayed much more terribly, one note, kind of expected an emotional movie that pit the women against each other. Instead, I got a surprisingly moving drama about a man in love with two women who have their own life they're trying to navigate—it's a much more realistic story than I expected not about the effects of bigamy, but what would drive an otherwise normal person into the situation, how they would emotionally deal with it. The women don't even meet until the end of the film, when the man is sentenced to prison for bigamy, which feels like a really harsh, dark ending.
Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino are both stars in this movie and knock it out of the park—far out acting the befuddled Ed O'Brien who can't help but be very large in moments that require subtlety. The script also isn't as sharp or as emotional as I want it to be for what it's doing, but that might be due to the censors of the time. Either way, it comes off just a little underwritten and overacted by Eddie, which really holds it back for me. There might have been a masterpiece in this movie without the censor, with a different lead male—or even different choices of perspective characters.

This is a wonderfully weird weepy. On the one hand Lupino serves up a nuanced narrative, as commented on by a few characters at the end. On the other hand the score is as subtle as Fred Flinstone’s club - and it never lets up.
Lupino is our Naruse. This and THE HITCHHIKER are disturbing works in the way good drama should be. They both succeed at grabbing you by the collar and throwing you to the ground. She was of her time and ahead of it.

"I don't know the reviews for this are kind of middling but in all honesty I loved it. I was really very surprised and definitely preferred it to the Hitch-Hiker (just realised they both came out the same year damn Ida Lupino is so good). It's not like I've seen an abundance of old classical films (40s, 50s, 60s) but the Bigamist is one of the most engaging films from that era that I've seen. The 80 minute runtime certainly helps. Ida Lupino is a great director and actor and I feel like she deserves a lot more recognition. I'm glad I watched this as even after the Hitch-hiker (and being very impressed) I was considering passing this one up but I just decided I'd watch it in the spur of the moment right before it left Mubi. I shall certainly be watching more of Ida Lupino's films; next will probably be Outrage as I found it on youtube and it honestly looks like an incredible film and very very ahead of its time in terms of its themes and content. The Bigamist was hugely enjoyable and it's nice to see another film with Kenneth Tobey in. Tobey seems just so likeable and I feel like he should've gotten more lead roles as he's so charismatic and a reliably solid actor. I highly recommend the Bigamist. It's excellent.",4.5
"Ida Lupino's sensitive but blunt and adult melodrama about a man who ends up married to two women he clearly loves. Lupino was the best female director of the classic Hollywood cinema and has an unreal grasp for pacing and subtle camera movements to convey the essence of the action. What makes Lupino's direction here so interesting, is just how much she refuses to make anyone into a hero, a martyr, or a villain. These are all people going about their lives and making decisions and living with the consequences as normal human beings do. Lupino refuses to see anything in clear black and white turns and has grace and love for everyone involved here. The finale is an expert example of staging a scene to create a visual ending based on mise en scene and one of Lupino's best cinematic strategies is utilizing shots on crooked streets to convey the idea that it's not the characters who are evil but the streets and locations which embody them. The only real negative downsides to this film lie in the fact that Lupino, as great as an actress as she is, might not be the ideal person to play the role of the other woman as she feels too old for the character she plays here. Additionally, there are some subtle film noir aspects to this melodrama in how Lupino constructs her mise en scene, think of the shots of the male looking out of his hotel window complete with blinds and a blinking white light, that is interesting as well but not fully fleshed out.",3.5
"Uses the classic Hollywood flashback narration to tell a unique, daring tale for the times, one that eschews villainising or cheapening its characters for any shock value. The title is bold but also direct: the film is not attempting to hide its subject, which enables it to explore it more fully. That said, the back story doesn’t ring true and some more edge to the titular character may have brought the film more resonance.",3.0
"Much like as with The Hitch-Hiker, this film is more important for its cultural significance. But I found the film itself really quite flat mainly down to Edmond O'Brien's title character. An utter wet blanket, it was hard to believe that he could get two women to marry him, let alone one. Fontaine and Lupino do their best, but ultimately, it's all just more than a little forgettable.",2.5
"Surprisingly drab, which is a disappointment from the same director behind The Hitch-Hiker, a comparatively explosive film from the same year. The Bigamist, in comparison, is merely a drama of its time, centred on relationships and infidelity. It's serviceable, but unremarkable.",3.0
"This is an incredibly interesting film, not because of the plot or script (both of those are very much of their time), but because of Ida Lupino's direction throughout the film. I hated to make a comparison like this so quickly, but the film felt like if Alfred Hitchcock had directed Brief Encounter, the cues from Hitchcock's early films is undeniable, but then again the script being so like a more American version of Brief Encounter, and though it's written from the male perspective, Ida Lupino's direction makes it incredible sympathetic to everyone involved, while not shaking anyone of any blame.
Throughout the film, the lead four performances are all great, and while Edmond O’Brien is great in essentially the lead role, both Ida Lupino and Joan Fontaine steal the show whenever they're on screen, as their performances are so well played. However, it's the way Lupino directs the scenes that makes it work so well, as I said, there are Hitchcockian influences, but her style is completely her own, and after seeing her other film The Hitch-Hicker it was interesting to her play around in a different genre. I wish that she'd had more of hand in the script, as it's very clearly a male-centric film, as much as it's obvious that she played up the female character much more in the scenes they appear in.
I think that where the film fails is not having the two women meet and even having the story being so male-centric, I think that having on of the women present for the telling of the story would have made much more of an impact that this does in this version of the film. Though I have to say, for as much flack as I'm giving this film, it's nowhere near as bad as you might think, all my complaints are all theoretical, the technical aspects of the film are all great and taking aside what I've said, the story in complete isolation is really good.
I think that the film is a really good film that seems to lend ideas from films that came before it and blends them together so seamlessly and interestingly that you don't notice the influences. I love the ideas at play, but I wish that the film was much more feminist and female-centric, I'd say if it had been more that way included then this would reside on the same level as Brief Encounter, but the flaws here just pull it below that level.",3.5

"Like The Hitch-Hiker, it does what it says on the tin in an efficient time frame: two women are unknowingly married to the same man, which comes to light when he and his first wife attempt to adopt a child.
This reminded me of a couple of other films concerning similar love triangles from roughly the same era: A Place in the Sun and The Best Years of Our Lives. In the former, a young man feels trapped by his girlfriend’s unplanned pregnancy; in the latter, a man feels trapped by a rushed wartime marriage. In both, these relationships are preventing them from being with their true love, a wholesome all-American girl. Lupino flips this on its head: Joan Fontaine (whom I’ll watch in anything) fits the wholesome archetype somewhat more, with Lupino (directing and starring) in the trampy obstacle role inhabited by Virginia Mayo in The Best Years of Our Lives and, more sympathetically, by the great Shelley Winters in A Place in the Sun. But Harry (Edmond O’Brien) has been married to Fontaine’s Eve for years when he meets Phyllis (Lupino), and when she becomes pregnant, she is adamant in not wanting to trap him—she doesn’t even volunteer the information. She gives him every opportunity to remove himself from the situation. Throughout, his troubles are shown to be of his own making, even as the film remains sympathetic to him (though Edmund Gwenn plays a choric role, presumably an avatar for more conservative audience members, in being condemnatory; we have more moralising from a judge later on, though again somewhat tempered with sympathy).
As much as this film resists a virgin-whore dichotomy between its female leads, I can’t help but feel that Eve gets the raw end of the deal. Though her infertility isn’t framed as a personal failing per se, her coping mechanisms are—and those coping mechanisms are such egregious sins as getting a job and being good at it, and not wanting to adopt right away. Her emotional unavailability to her husband is always framed as being a result of her becoming a career woman. I can’t help but wonder if this anxiety about women in the workplace reflects post-war cultural shifts which also intensified marital instability. The film is sympathetic to both women, but in order to be sympathetic to Eve, it seems, she must renounce her career ambitions and embrace the idea of motherhood. Structurally, the film also encourages more investment in the relationship between Harry and Phyllis: as Harry attempts to explain himself, he lays out their love story from beginning to end, including the mitigating circumstances of his growing emotional estrangement from Eve. His relationship with Eve isn’t afforded the same kind of attention—we never learn what brought the two together, and even in their supposedly loving scenes together, we know that Harry is tortured by the demands of his double life. We may feel sympathy for Eve, but it’s more difficult to root for her as a love interest, particularly as Harry and Phyllis already have a child together.
In some ways I think this is the film doing something interesting: it privileges Harry’s relationship with the kind of a working-class woman who would, in the other films I mentioned, be treated very differently by the narrative. On the other hand, it’s difficult not to read Eve’s infertility and career-mindedness as implied justifications for Harry’s infidelity, even as he is the one condemned on a textual level.
There are playful in-jokes aplenty: the film’s screenwriter, Collier Young, was married to Fontaine at the time, having previously been married to Lupino, and there are a few references to Edmund Gwenn’s role as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street. For me, this complicates things. To what extent do we read the film as a straightforward morality tale, and to what extent does the metanarrative make it, in fact, a self-reflexive Hollywood comedy? I think the film is played straight beyond those few winks, but it must have been difficult for contemporary audiences to ignore the behind-the-scenes resonances.
For its time, the film may be relatively nuanced, but it hasn’t aged too well. The most compelling part is the relationship between Phyllis and Harry, but we never get any resolution. We never know how the love triangle resolves itself at all, as—by Hays Code-mandated necessity—the film devolves into moralism at the end, leaving us on an unsatisfyingly ambiguous note (or maybe I’m just not the best audience for a film which hinges on the sanctity of marriage). There is a shared glance between Fontaine and Lupino, though, which is loaded with fascinating subtext. It might have been interesting to see a film about those two women picking up the pieces after their husband’s trial, rather than the film which ends with it.",0.0
"It could only ever really be Edmond O’Brien, who is never quite in command of himself, never quite the leading man. Beside the coruscant beauty of Ida Lupino he is small and awkward; framed by the yearning branch of a tree he is subject to his idle wanderings. As he narrates the decline of his marriage, he is reflected in a passing glaze; the shot concludes tilting to a shapely mannequin, O’Brien a translucent presence lost in the movement. Lupino et al. complicate the scenario in the character of Phyllis, who might browbeat and overlook, but is no mean harridan. She is lost to her husband by incident; they cannot communicate, but not for any ill feeling. Their marriage has failed, but she is not aware. All of this assiduously established to placate the Moral Evil on which the film is founded: Lupino does not outwardly reject the marriage contract, but rather measures a most unlikely scenario in which her God-fearing public might tie themselves a knot around it. David Lean was the most genius exponent of such a tactic in Brief Encounter: his was a love affair so pure, so absolutely extemporaneous, as to defy all moral guarding, all reasonable behaviour. That they fell in love by complete accident seems an impossible plausibility. Such equivocation is not so clearly replicated in The Bigamist, though a similar effect is courted; Harry did not take up with Eve for some salacious getaway, but was rather drawn to her loneliness, just as she to his. Theirs was an innocent affair whose culmination remains as such. This precious balance becomes ever-more precarious as the film proceeds: it is just not possible to sustain the premise for the length of the picture without indulging in increasingly ludicrous plot contrivances. These contrivances are indulged in, and the concluding smash-up comes a little ridiculous in this flickering light. Though if any man might sell such ill-thought, well-intentioned schemes as are necessary for this film’s final act, Edmond O’Brien would be he. As the judge sums it: ‘These are decent women, Graham. And you’re basically a decent man.’ Moral evil – moral in its second sense, as modifying adjective.",3.5
It is wrong to demand from the only female director in film noir universe to be even more feminist especially taking into account that her making films is a revolutionary act by itself and a lot of people were against it. But it's a shame that such thoughtful and emotional film about bigamy and loneliness has that idea inside that woman can't have a successful career if she wants a happy family as well.,3.5
Loved the morally ambiguous ending; especially with being a 1950s film! Need to check out more of Ida’s work; she brought a ton of emotional depth out of the characters and actors.

"I like the fact that Ida Lupino made short films. Perfect for curling up on the sofa with your iPad, at the end of yet another Covid19 enforced working day at home.
Another well crafted, well scripted film. I really enjoyed the 50's feel and decor and the shots of San Francisco and Los Angeles. And when Harry picks up his baby son, you kind of think, wow! Lupino makes us feel just as startled as the man from the adoption agency.
What a contrast to The Hitch hiker. Here we have three very likeable, sympathetic characters. Unlike the Hitch hiker though, the ending is ambivalent. We are left to decide what choice Harry will eventually make.",3.5

"After being quite underwhelmed by Ida Lupino's The Hitch-Hiker, I didn't expect much more from another not even 80 minute film by her. That's where The Bigamist gets you. With a rare female voice behind the camera at the time, we're given quite a sharp story of bad man with a secret second life.
Again, with the very short runtime, the film is a little odd in the pacing department. It's quick to get into things and it never reaches the depths you wish it would but it is still able to give some real good dramatic stings when it needs to. I also really appreciate the more nuanced approach to all the characters it takes. It's my favourite of the two Lupino's on Mubi currently with its impressively progressive take on something you'd expect to be more cut and dry in the 50s.",3.0
"Way more complicated and morally ambiguous than things usually were in this era. Not sure how this got through the censors, with the baby and all too.

If anything, it's almost too balanced and even-handed to come off as entirely plausible, since it's hard to imagine an actual bigamist behaving, despite his mistakes, in so honourable a manner – but perhaps that's just me being cynical.

"A strange mix between Brief Encounter and Yojimbo, Ida Lupino crafts a bleak and fatalistic drama that is undoubtedly way ahead of its time. Edmond O'Brian is perfectly cast as a washed out, alternate-reality version of Humphrey Bogart who walks heavy with defeat. The conflation of his philandering with crime is probably the most interesting part of this film, he literally spells it out when he says; ""I felt like a criminal looking for a way to get out"". This entire movie has a heist movie/one last job aura around it, further making it a stand-out feature of 50s cinema.
I love all of these aspects of the film, but I couldn't bring myself to quite love this film as a whole. Maybe it was the boring cinematography or the lack of truly dramatic moments, I think this film could have benefited with a melodramatic twist, Joseph Losey style. But it's still a great example of subversive American cinema that managed to get away with such controversial subject matter at the time.",3.5
"If The Bigamist were released today it would be problematic. But it wasn’t and for its time, this film treats a difficult subject with a gentle and human touch.

Ida Lupino can sure as hell direct a noir that's actually not really a noir about the virtues of family and self-worth.,4.0
"This was a disappointment for me. I absolutely adored 'On Dangerous Ground', which Ida Lupinio starred in and directed certain scenes of, so went into this with great excitement only to discover that it's just ... fine?
This is a pretty standard and unremarkable drama that, from where I'm standing, placed far too much emphasis on the bigamist and not enough on the women he is deceiving. They are presented only insofar as they impact his life, and have virtually no existence at all when he is out of the frame. This is all rather frustrating, since while the bigamist himself is ... fine and acted well enough, the women he gets involved with are far more interesting than he is. Sadly, the film doesn't seem too share this view and the women are portrayed exclusively as victims of the bigamist's deceit.
An interesting companion piece to this is 'Les Diaboliques', from a few years later. While directed by a man (Henri-Georges Clouzot), 'Les Diaboliques' is far more interested in women and how they navigate what's essentially a man's world than Lupino is here. By the end of 'The Bigamist', all I could think was that I desperately longed for the sequel where Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino teamed up to murder their husband and assume full control of his business. That story would certainly have been more interesting than what we got here.",2.5

"What I saw in The Bigamist was how people lived in the beautiful lie deeply rooted in society, exploring the taboo of bigamy back in the old days. Ida Lupino directs this noir drama proving a female filmmaker has the ability to tell these deep, meaningful stories during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The ending of this has to be one of the strongest endings ever, leaving room for ambiguity whether we call Harry Braham's moral code a crime or not.
REWATCH REVIEW on June 11, 2021
The Bigamist's romantic tragedy still holds up to this day, remaining authentic to its subject matter without treating its plot too melodramatic for the characters.

"""I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.""
That quote really sums up this terrific movie from Ida Lupino, about a man living a double life. Harry Graham has been unfaithful, but he's ""basically decent"" (as the judge says) and at one point even openly admits his cheating to his wife. That makes The Bigamist one of the most layered depictions of a complicated romance Hollywood produced in this era. The open ending is particularly thought-provoking; you can imagine Harry being shunned by both women, but from a current-day perspective you could also almost imagine the result being some kind of polyamory. Ida Lupino is excellent both in the director's chair and as Phyllis.",4.0
"An important premise and theme of adultery and divorce from the early 50's. It is not a fantastic movie or anything, but it is an important one. Since it was nominated for a bunch of Academy Awards, it must have been a big deal when it came out. Nowadays it feels very tame though. These themes have been explored to death in modern cinema and I honestly do not find them that appealing. It has to have something more unique to it for me to care. I do respect early movies like this though that pioneered so much stuff for us, but I only love the ones I feel like it is warranting a watch in a modern setting as well and The Bigamist just does not warrant that in my opinion. It is in no way a bad movie though, completely watchable.",2.5
"“I can’t figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you, and I pity you. I don’t even want to shake your hand, and yet, I almost wish you luck.”
it’s fascinating how Ida Lupino made a nuanced, ambiguous take on such a heavy topic. that line from Edmund Gwenn’s character really sums up my sentiments towards the main character.",3.5
"For this being the first time I've interacted with anything made by Ida Lupino, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot might not be the most grand thing, but there is a lot of nuance and this feels carefully explored. By the end, it felt like a worthwhile watch, and definitely not something I typically would have sought out other than right now.
Our three main characters are comprised of Ida Lupino as Phyllis Martin, Joan Fontaine as Eve Graham, and Edmond O'Brien as her husband, Harry Graham. Harry Graham finds himself being investigated alongside his wife when the two attempt to adopt a child. This leads them to meet Mr. Jordan, who is portrayed by Edmund Gwenn, who uncovers Harry's secret marriage to Phyllis. These four make the film fun to watch, even though Mr. Jordan's eventual description of Harry feels very accurate.
The plot is fairly simple. As I mentioned earlier, the film follows the two marriages that Harry Graham finds himself involved in. Given that the film came out in the midst of the code era, the ending feels very ambiguous. This is definitely a plus, as the middle section of the film starts to drag a bit, but the fact that there isn't an entirely concrete ending really makes pushing through worth it. There's a really tense tone to this film. While it might not stress the viewer out to the point they have to turn it off, watching Mr. Jordan investigate Harry is interesting to say the least. The courtroom scene at the end grants a level of nuance that I did not expect to see in this film, especially given the subject that the film deals with.
Visually, the film isn't anything groundbreaking, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Given the focus on the characters and their connections to one another, the film does well to showcase what's happening. In fact, the way that Joan Fontaine's Eve Graham is portrayed, especially in the very final frame, gives a humanity to her that could easily be glossed over.
This is a decent watch, if nothing else. There's a nuance here that doesn't really seem to fit in the era that it was made in. The short runtime makes this an easy watch to fit in, and made me want to seek out more from Ida Lupino, both as a director and as an actor.

"Sacándole todo el provecho a su escueto presupuesto, utilizando un trazo de escena sencillo pero efectivo, Lupino imprime cierta melancolía a un filme que mira humanamente a sus personajes, sin hacer juicio a sus actitudes cuestionables, pues sabe que esa cuestión sólo le compete al espectador.",3.5
"I love how Ida Lupino plunges straight into her films, barreling through the story without catching breath. Her films are concise without feeling rushed.  The Bigamist follows a nice (mostly) traveling salesman who gets in over his head and finds himself married to two women.  Whoops.  The film does a good job of showing his side of things, and it’s filled with tenderness and love.  But the audience knows this delicate, precarious balancing act will crumble, and I didn’t want to see any of the characters fall victim to that looming heartbreak.  The ending is satisfying and left me with a lot more things to ponder than if it had ended a few minutes earlier (when I first thought it was ending).  Beautifully shot and acted.",4.0
Poor Joan Fontaine. Poor Ida Lupino. Great film.,4.0
"Ida Lupino directs and costars in ""The Bigamist,"" a 1953 film starring Edmond O'Brien, Joan Fontaine and Edmund Gwenn, as well as Lupino.
O'Brien and Fontaine play a married San Francisco couple, Harry and Eve Graham, who are unable to have children and are planning to adopt. Eve is a very successful businesswoman; Harry is a traveling salesman with a big territory in Los Angeles.
Harry becomes quite nervous when he realizes that a thorough background check must be done before the adoption can take place. Mr. Jordan (Gwenn), who works for the adoption agency, knows something is wrong but can't quite put his finger on it.
Eventually he finds out - Harry Graham is Harrison Graham in Los Angeles, and there he has another wife (Lupino) and a new baby. Harry tells Jordan the whole story of meeting Eve (Lupino) in Los Angeles, drifting into an affair with her, learning she was pregnant and being unable to abandon her.
Well directed by Lupino, the film pushes the sympathy toward Harry and his dilemma and keeps a good pace and interest throughout. Fontaine was no longer a big movie star, having passed the magic age of 30 several years before, and she can be seen often in these black and white B movies of the '50s. She does a good job and looks quite glamorous, but Lupino's role is the showier one. Edmond O'Brien does an excellent job as the beleaguered Harry.
This film truly was a family affair - this screenplay about a man with two wives was written by Collier Young, the ex-husband of Lupino and, at that time, the current husband of Fontaine; and Fontaine's mother, Lillian Fontaine, plays Lupino's landlady. Worth seeing, if only to wonder what went on during the filming.",3.5

"Here's a pro tip: If your proposal includes either one of you grimly asking, ""are you sure?"" maybe its time to rethink things.
The Bigamist really washed over me. I was surprised how quickly it went by, with fairly low tension. Hell, without context a lot of the second act plays as a straight romance. But that's not a critique. Lupino tackles the subject with surprising nuance and warmth. Everybody (admittedly to differing extents) is a victim in this film. In fact, there's probably an argument to be made the film is too sympathetic to Harry/Harrison.
On the whole, The Bigamist is a slickly directed (oh, those long shots!), surprisingly warm, and unexpectedly modern flick well worth a watch.",3.5

All of this said, the Kinda slant-wise noir is a really interesting concept I wish I could see more of from this period. Simple but smart at times.",3.5
"A strangely sympathetic view of bigamy is portrayed here in Ida Lupino's ""issue"" film. It is still an unusually brave and non-exploitative attempt to deal with the subject matter without being salacious, the same approach she would take in her film about rape The Outrage. Her and her husband Collier Young began making low budget independant films that he produced, she directed and they co-wrote together. The film takes a balanced, and mature look at this particular case, from all three points of view. Dated but daring.",3.0
"Lupino really can draw a very precise love triangle, as we could see (briefly, but twice) in Never Fear. This is an extremely well-rendered melodrama, and a sense of ambiguity in its characters that surpasses any urge to find an easy way out (like killing Lupino's character, since she is sick, and giving her baby to the other woman). The ending is really really brave - it's not open-ended, but it doesn't solve any problem, just like, you know, real life. One more thing: FLAWLESS performances.",5.0
"There's not a lot to say about Lupino's direction (she seems content with merely capturing the story rather than expressing it in any meaningful way), but the content is way against the grain for 1953 since it makes the bigamist of the title a sympathetic character. And I love the way that it dodges the Production Code with a completely open ending that, at best, implies that the guilty man will pay a price (it doesn't even insist that the price will be prison, like the Code would want).",4.0

"Ida Lupino was a remarkable filmmaker who alongside a successful acting career also carved out a reputation as a respected producer and director. Directing eight feature films (many in the male-dominated genre of film noir), she formed her own independent production company, and was also the only woman to direct an episode of The Twilight Zone (Episode 145 (1964), The Masks). During a period when she was suspended from working at Warner Brothers she began to reflect on her waning interest in acting, especially when, 'someone else seemed to be doing all the interesting work.' Once she got into her stride as a director she really put her mark on the set, with her director's chair carrying the name 'Mother Of Us All.'
Often seen as belonging to the generation of modernist filmmakers that include Nicholas Ray and Robert Aldrich, she dealt with social themes others would steer away from, including rape (Outrage (1950), unwanted pregnancy (Not Wanted 1949) and bigamy (The Bigamist (1953). In perhaps her most well-remembered film, The Hitch-Hiker (1953) Lupino managed skilfully to capture the American male in crisis in a film without a single woman character. The Bigamist shows a remarkable degree of sympathy for a man (Harry Graham, played by Edmond O'Brien) who, more through soft heartedness than anything else, marries two different women, one in San Francisco (Joan Fontaine as Eve), the other in Los Angeles (Ida Lupino as Phyllis). Eventually, after Phyllis has a baby during a period when the childless Harry and Eve are seeking to adopt a child, he breaks it off with both women and turns himself into the police.
In the final courtroom scene the moral complexity of the scene is brought nicely into focus by the judge's summation and the two women share a knowing look between each other that seems to suggest sympathy and understanding of what each has experienced. The film ends ambiguously without revealing Harry's sentence but with the suggestion that he will have obligations toward both women and his child as he rebuilds his life. In the era of the Hays Code it took a lot of canny creativity to question conventional marriage. Lupino does it by pointing out the hypocrisy of society looking the other way when it came to adulterous 'flings' but legally and morally condemning a weak-willed man who has two wives and a child and cares for all of them. It's this kind of ethical complexity and sensitivity that leaves you wishing that more women were placed in charge of making movies during the Golden Age of Hollywood.",3.0

Um filme sensível, à frente de seu tempo (é de 1953!) em relação a postura das mulheres, porém ainda assim um tanto machista, ao apostar apenas na visão de Harry e sua ""solidão"" como desculpa para traição. Porém o final do filme se redime completamente, com o discurso final do Juiz.

"So! Director Carol Morley suggested on Twitter that we choose a film freely available for us all to watch at home, and that anyone who's able could join in with a viewing at 8pm GMT on a Friday – I was absolutely up for it. As I've mentioned before, I'm finding the self-isolation has really damaged my film-watching habit rather than helping it, so any idea that helps me prioritise that is hugely important to me.
The first film chosen was Ida Lupino's The Bigamist. I was vaguely aware of the name, but I had never fully appreciated what a powerhouse Lupino was in Hollywood between the 1930s and 1950s, as well as working well into the end of the 1970s. In addition to directing seven feature films, she had fifty-nine credited roles on film too, including this one. She's an absolute knockout here as the 'other woman' Phyllis, delivering her lines with acerbic flair, but equally tender when she needs to be. Despite leading a relatively solitary life, she commands the screen so confidently that she's absolutely mesmerising.
She's countered well by Joan Fontaine's Eve, who is equally filled with a very different type of energy and life. Like Phyllis, she's a well-rounded character: a skilled businesswoman, deeply caring for her own family and passionately excited to begin a family of her own with her new husband. Her joy and enthusiasm for her life is palpable, and also heartbreaking when she reacts with such gay disbelief when her husband attempts to tell her of his affair.
If there's an obvious flaw in The Bigamist, it's that the character around which all of the action revolves is a bit of a vacuum. It's hard to see why such impressive and spirited women as Eve and Phyllis should find themselves head-over-heels in love with Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien). My gut feeling is that the screenwriters are more concerned about the moral and ethical situation of this case of bigamy than they are with the character itself: unfortunately, though, without a credible character at the heart of it all, it just comes across as a bit baffling. The central 'defence' for bigamy (that Harry Graham never felt 'needed' by Eve) doesn't stand up to scruitiny at all, but there's a valiant attempt to address a very interesting ethical point at the very end of the film – but it's all rather lost by that point.
Despite these flaws, it's an interesting screenplay that succeeded in subverting my expectations well: I'd assumed it would be a thriller-like film revolving around whether Harry Graham would get caught or not – and it turned out to be something quite different. It was also a great introduction to Lupino's incredible body of work and I'll look forward to watching more.

The Double Life of Hárronique,3.0
"“The Bigamist”, a 1953 drama film noir directed by film star turned director Ida Lupino, follows Harry Graham, a successful businessman as he navigates being married to two different women at the same time. While this dramatic set up could have easily been turned into a slapstick comedy, Lupino instead took the more difficult and rewarding path of making Harry Graham’s story into a drama film noir that interrogates societal norms around romantic relationships and marriage as well as being a piercing psychological examination of the consequences of loneliness. This commitment to examining marriage and relationships no doubt is at least partially due to Ida Lupino’s dual role as director of “The Bigamist” as well as one of the stars of the film. In fact, Ida Lupino’s dual roles as director and leading actress of “The Bigamist” has been cited by many as one of the first times a female star of a film directed herself. As both director and star of “The Bigamist”, Ida Lupino is part of an incredibly small group of women who have both stared in and directed the film that includes Angelina Jolie (“By the Sea”), Julie Deply (“Two Days in New York”), and Barbara Streisand (“Yentl”). Besides being a notable example of an early film directed by the same women that stars in it, “The Bigamist” is also a complicated but excellent example of film noir. Broadly speaking, film noir can be defined as a style of film that features stylized, black and white cinematography and features nihilistic characters that explore social and psychological issues, typically through crime or detective stories. “The Bigamist” features many of these same characteristics. For example, “The Bigamist” explores how Harry Graham’s spiral into a double life as a twice married man was caused by his crushing loneliness caused by his frequent travels as a businessman. “The Bigamist” also features a sense of nihilism and melodrama throughout the film, which are a hallmark feature of film noir. However, “The Bigamist” also diverges from the prototypical film noir film in several key ways. For example, even though “The Bigamist” is still centered around a crime (bigamy), the crime the film is centered upon is not a murder or large scale theft. Further, “The Bigamist” does not feature a female character in the femme fatale role that is featured so commonly in film noir films. Three and a half stars for “The Bigamist”.",3.5

"Really weighed down by its complete dearth of charisma whenever Ida Lupino isn't on screen. The softboiled detective segments with Edmund Gwenn's lecturing old man from the adoption agency are painful, as his character is given little to endear him to the audience and Gwenn overacts to a cartoonish degree, at one point indicating his feelings of suspicion by moving his entire head to shift his gaze from left to right rather than just his eyes.",2.0
"The premise of this film sounds so ridiculous, so absurd, so primed for the worst excesses of Hollywood melodrama. I feel like in the hands of almost any other director in the 1950s, it would turn out as schlocky, treacly dreck. But it wasn't in the hands of any other director: it was in the hands of the wonderful Ida Lupino, the only woman director working in Hollywood's studio system in the 1950s. And aside from her skill at noir and science fiction, she had an uncanny ability in these social commentary films at tackling controversial subjects and treating all her characters with intelligence, humanity, and sympathy. The end result is a film which is frankly so much better than it has any right to be.

"Surprisingly nuanced and empathetic towards the titular character....doesn't exactly let him off the hook, but it never really moralizes or punishes him like you'd expect a Hays Code-era film to do, even at the end, and instead offers a much more complex and sensitive view of love and relationships. A really heartfelt little melodrama, with great performances all round....Lupino is solid behind the camera, but even better in front of it, and I somehow never noticed before how obvious it is that Fontaine is ODH's sister.

The new release on blu ray quite frankly did little for me whether it be 4k, 8k or whatever.

"The last of my Ida Lupino marathon (she did make one more film but more than a decade later and for a major studio not her own production company) is another historic first, this being the first time a female director starred in one of her own movies. The film stars Edmond O'Brien who previously worked with Lupino in the same year's The Hitch-Hiker, as a man who, together with his wife, played by Joan Fontaine, this is easily Lupino's starriest project, is filing to adopt a child, and we follow the adoption agent as he looks into the past of the prospective father, eventually uncovering his shocking secret.
Of course, it's no mystery what this secret could be when the film is called 'The Bigamist' so thankfully the film doesn't keep you in suspense too long. The majority of the film is the husband's explanation in flashback of how he got into his predicament. As the two wives, Fontaine is jovial, sincere and businesslike, while Lupino is sardonic, funny and sensitive and O'Brien manages to make his foolish situation understandable, as he sincerely tries to avoid hurting either woman's feelings and alleviate his own loneliness and ends up making everything worse.
Like Lupino's other 'social problem' movies it ends on a commendably open ending, however the film's own stance is still unreservedly compassionate. It's possibly the most complete and satisfying of her films, with some of screenwriter Collier Young's (who was also married to both Fontaine and Lupino, although at different times) neatly detailed and humorous dialogue, like the 'Chinese' restaurant run by white Americans with only one authentic Chinese dish on the menu, or introducing Lupino on a tour bus of the homes of famous movie stars (on which the residence of another of the film’s stars Edmund Gwen is a stop).",3.5
"#1 in my series of 2: “Joan Fontaine is pretty neat, right?”
In a world pre-Lifetime original movies, there could be dark, twisty relationship movies that weren’t overly melodramatic and where not everyone was a total trash bag. This film was also a rarity for the time by having the female star, Ida Lupino, also direct the film. This is an amazing specimen of the noir genre all around.
With a story dealing with 2 wives, one with a child, who don’t know about each other and the man married to both of them, you would expect there to be a lot of drama or villainy or at least one of them would have bad breathe or something. The swerve here is that everyone is a good person and good for each other and things just kind of happen. The man doesn’t come off as conniving or a sex fiend. The women are not jealous or authoritarian. Essentially, the plot is driven by the human condition alone. Even when the man is put on trial for his bigamy, it’s made very clear that, though illegal, his actions were all well intended. It’s a fascinating and quick story to get sucked into!
Two goofy points:
1.) My favorite line in the movie is “You like Chinese food? I know a place with the best water chestnuts in town.” Who goes out specifically for water chestnuts!? 
2.) Since the film takes place in both LA and San Francisco, it’s also just a fun sightseeing film!

Some pretty solid performances from Lupino and Fontaine coupled with solid but unspectacular visuals from Lupino turn in a fairly interesting little flick.

"The movie as a whole is surprisingly sophisticated for the year of release, and Lupino’s performance is naturalistic in a way that seems ahead of its time.",3.5
"There are many things I really like about this movie. First off, Ida Lupino is a boss bitch with serious acting and directing skills. Her character in this movie is great and, in fact, all the characters in this movie are compelling, original, and nuanced (regardless of how much sympathy you may actually have for some of them). The women in particular are refreshingly strong characters, especially in the context of 1950s films.
However, there are also some things I don’t like about this movie. Most notably, it seems overly sympathetic for the lead male character. He can’t be happy when his wife is more successful than he is, he puts in almost no effort whatsoever to communicate with her about his unhappiness, and he makes many majorly fucked up decisions. Poor baby! The fact that he’s portrayed with any hint of sympathy is a bit absurd.
Granted, he is not framed as a hero, but the intention for you to feel at least partly sorry for him is pretty clear. Like, we’re supposed to give him a medal for supporting his child and baby mama? This perspective has made me waffle a bit on how much I actually like the film (my initial rating was lower). The dude dug his own grave! You reap what you sow, asshole.
Ultimately, despite that issue, I do think it is still a great movie. As with a lot of great film (and art in general), it forces you to think and come up with your own answers. Maybe I don’t like that a character is shown with more sympathy than they deserve, but I had to actually use my brain to form that opinion. By painting the picture in shades of gray, so to speak, it forces you to come to your own conclusions and judgement.",4.0

Love Mad Men. Great from Ida. Wonder how significant her directing was in the decision to make Joan’s character a career-driven wife. Combining his loneliness with what he interprets to be his emasculation is a top tier choice.

Might even be underrating the film, as the depiction of the wife vs mistress is so nuanced and even handed its kind of a miracle.

"The last film in Kino's Ida Lupino set, 1953's THE BIGAMIST, is perhaps its most difficult. The film centers around a man named Harry Graham (Edmond O'Brien) who is trying to adopt a baby with his wife, Eve (Joan Fontaine) because she is unable to conceive children. But as the adoption agency investigates the family to determine their suitability, they uncover a dark secret - Harry is actually living a double life, with another wife (Lupino) and child in another city where he often travels for business. What seems like a pretty straightforward issue becomes disarmingly complicated under Lupino's direction, who refuses to treat this as the issue of black and white morality that it appears to be.
She actually makes us feel sympathy for Graham, as she takes what could be seen as an ""aw man I'm sorry I got caught"" excuse and delves deep into the roots of what caused his betrayal. In THE BIGAMIST, he isn't seen so much as a rotten philanderer as a complicated and conflicted man who got in over his head. ""I don't know whether to despise you or feel sorry for you,"" the inspector says at one point. And the audience is in much the same position. While viewers' reactions will likely vary greatly, Lupino refuses to take sides, and the result is a film that exists in a surprising moral gray area rarely seen in 1953. It's all made even more fascinating by the fact that Lupino and her husband/co-writer Collier were going through a divorce while the film was being made, with Collier's new girlfriend, Joan Fontaine, playing opposite Lupino as the other woman. THE BIGAMIST displays an incredible restraint and sense of forgiveness that showcases Lupino's unique humanist talents.",4.0

The Bigamist was a frank and subversive film for its era, questioning social norms, maturely showing how marriages can transform, and refusing to condemn O’Brien’s choices. Lupino directed this the same year she made The Hitch-Hiker, another film with a subversive subtext that questioned gender norms.",0.0

Good work from Joan Fontaine and Edmund O'Brien here, but Ida Lupino (directing herself!) is the standout for me; Phyllis has obviously been damaged by life and she's doing the best she can, dealing with this dingus who's swept into her life.

"This is a fine, surprisingly sophisticated melodrama (not really a noir, by my lights) directed by Ida Lupino, who also stars as ""the other woman."" The movie has sympathy for all three characters, and I suppose it might be noir in the sense that it features a basically decent guy who succumbs to a temporary weakness and brings himself and others down. He tries to do the right thing, to do right by both women, and inevitably fails.
The story is mostly told in a long flashback after the title character has been found out by an adoption agency investigator played by Edmund Gwenn, so it's not a spoiler to say that the deception comes apart. The two women are great characters. I was particularly fond of the wife, played totally naturally by Joan Fontaine. The screenplay doesn't let her husband off the hook with the old ""she drove him to it"". She's smart and amorous and dedicated to making their family business a success, but that business requires him to be on the road a lot. He would love to be home more, but honestly she's having too much fun running things (he credits her 100% with their booming sales) to really hear him.
That's as much blame as the movie assigns her. She's still affectionate and happy and tells him at one point, ""I love our marriage"". Significantly, she says that as she's dropping off to sleep, exhausted from work. He's a good guy but a man of his era, and isn't sure he wants a business partner with benefits. Hence the trouble starts.
The movie is not looking to score any political / social points, except to note that if the traveling salesman had merely kept an out of town mistress, society would wink at it. The Bigamist is short and smart and interesting, and well worth your time.",4.0

"This is the second Ida Lupino-directed film that I have seen on the Criterion Channel, after “Not Wanted.”  Like Not Wanted, it deals with an unplanned pregnancy, which in this case leads to bigamy, as opposed to adoption. Adoption does play a big role in this movie as well. An investigation into the bigamist’s background before adopting a child in one marriage leads to the discovery of his second family. 
Lupino was a great director and she is the true star of the film as the second wife. Joan Fontaine is very good in a difficult role as the first wife. She had to be both loving and distant, warm and cold. This role probably would have been portrayed a lot differently if a male of the time directed this.

The fact that a female-directed film noir about lying men exists is, in of itself, insane... but the fact that it manages to hold so much empathy for every character here is really what cements Lupino as a master storyteller. Certainly a subtle revolution... 
...But the ending of the film was very frustrating for me. Eve and Phyllis, both tremendously acted and written throughout the film, are never afforded a single chance to respond to Harry’s lies and infidelity. And while I acknowledge that this ending was likely a deliberate attempt to force contemplation from the audience, I would have loved just SOMETHING more than a half-smile in a courtroom from either of these women after what their weak-ass husband put them through!",3.5

"A thoughtful, even handed and utterly engrossing examination of relationships and domesticity in 1950s America.

I didn't really care for the old man who works at the adoption agency and first uncovers this bigamous affair. I get it, he's there to infuse the picture with a noir element but in the end its not really necessary.

"The bigamist 1953

This is a “B” blue plate special served up nicely by the director and star Ida Lupino. Largely ignored by audiences and critics alike when it was first released, it never the less played at a first run movie theatre in Times Sq. The plot is the title, and was a daring movie for the time. In it Edmond O’Brien is a successful salesman of freezers and lives a nice life in San Francisco in a snazzy mid 50’s apartment with his wife Joan Fontaine who also helps out with the business. All is well with their marriage except she wants to have children and can’t so they decide to adopt. They meet up with Edmund Gwenn who runs an adoption agency and things look good for them until they have to agree to an investigation that makes O’Brien turn white. Without giving too much away, Gwenn discovers that O’Brien is living a double life in Los Angles with Ida Lupino and their infant son. A serious problem for all concerned and in a flashback O’Brien lays out his heart and story to Gwenn who is hard and not generally moved by the tale. The film is short at 80 minutes and laid out in an A,B, C format by Lupino with some nice off the wall touches. Lupino and O’Brien meet cute on a tour bus through Beverly Hills, you know the one that takes tourists past the homes of the rich and famous movie stars, and we are treated to some chit chat from O’Brien on how much he loves movies and one of the homes they pass belongs to none other than Edmund Gwenn. This is one of the jokes in the movie that refers to Gwenn and his most famous role playing Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th street, and at another point O’brien refers to the Gwenn character as Santa Claus.I could have done without these. Lupino and O’Brien hit it off in a mild sort of way, and you begin to wonder why he is playing her up since he is in a good marriage. It turns out that he is lonely being on the road and so is Lupino who works as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant, I love this touch. Lupino is finally getting some respect for the movies that she directed, hard little punches to the stomach and she is also quite good as the 2nd wife, sensitive and believable. Filmed on location in L.A. which gives the film a nice lived in feel. The transfer is ok, not great.",3.0

"Cinema is invented towards the end of the 19th century, and we only have to wait until 1953 to get the first film which had a woman director who also stars in the film! The next one would be Jodie Foster...in 1991. So you know, there's so many of them. At the same time we can't move for all the self-directing Costners, Eastwoods, Gibsons, Afflecks and Clooneys.
So it is definitely a film of historical importance, but is it good? Yes, it is. There's a moral complexity and ambiguity which isn't common for the Hollywood of the early 1950s, which is probably why the film was dropped by RKO and Lupino had to find a way to distribute it herself. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino as well as Edmond O'Brien as the titular character. So there's plenty of star power here, and the acting is pretty good, as is the directing.
What really makes the film stand out from the crowd of other socially aware movies is the complexity of the characters. No one here is really evil, people make mistakes, sometimes stupid mistakes but a lot of the mistakes are just misdirected attempts to make things right. The bigamist doesn't marry two women out of some kind of perversion, but because he wants to do right by both of them, wants to make them both happy. This is actually the same reason that he is caught. As a character tells him in the film ""You disgust me, but I almost wish you luck."". No matter what your moral position here is after the first mistake has been made, of having an affair with a woman while he is out at work, there is really no good way to get out of the situation. The women are blameless and in love with him, and he clearly is in love with them, or at least likes them enough that he doesn't want them to suffer, which only makes him dig his hole deeper and deeper. A really thought-provoking film.",4.0
"One of those movies that's something like 75% flashback and lots something from that, becoming all recitation of facts and not particularly dramatic. It's capable and does all right with that, but Ida Lupino doesn't really manage to turn its sympathetic take on the situation into something tragic or even a fascinating sort of irony.",3.0

Even the judge in the resulting court case seems reluctant to impose the required punishments for stepping outside government-sanctioned modes of being; ""When a man, even with the best intentions, breaks the moral laws we live by, we really don't need man-made laws to punish him.""
The movie also has a few clever inside jokes built around co-star Edmund Gwenn and Miracle on 34th Street as well.
Co-star Ida Lupino directed the movie; perhaps the first time a woman directed a movie she starred in. Lupino, while not well known outside hardcore film buff circles, ought to have had a significant directing career like contemporaries Anthony Mann or Nicholas Ray but instead we're left with only half a dozen or so movies she directed, most of them quite good.",3.5

Considering the whole plot is spelled out in the title it has to rely on the characters and their developing relationships and largely succeeds, and given the subject matter it was surely a difficult balancing act to keep the three leads sympathetic in their own ways. The abrupt ending caught me by surprise. Ida Lupino is now on my radar too.",3.5
"Far more progressive than it would have been in any decade besides, perhaps, this one (a woke poly remake with a Professor Marston-esque resolution seems almost suggested by the text) this is a much more complex and empathetic look at relationships than the banter and bombshells would suggest.

"Ida Lupino's direction and script (co-written with partner Collier Young) gives this very of-its-time melodrama a rough-edge and sharp tongue that's most welcome. Edmond O'Brien gives his man caught between two loves an affable everyman quality, and Joan Fontaine and Lupino herself play his wives, who refuse to play to this subgenre's worst tendencies, instead feeling like adult women of not-inconsiderable dimension, especially in the realm of an RKO cheapie. Solid stuff.",3.5

"This is such a surprising little film. It’s been on my watch list for years and years and I’m so pleased I’ve finally seen it. You’d think with a tabloid-bating title like The Bigamist that the film would be a shlocky, cheap affair designed to titillate an audience out for a cheap thrill. What you get instead is a sensitive portrait of two women and the man they both love. 
Edmond O’Brien plays Harry Graham who is married to Eve (played by Joan Fontaine). They want to adopt a child and come into contact with Mr Jordan (played by Santa Claus himself Edmund Gwen). When Jordan does the background checks he discovers that Harry is also married to Phyllis Martin/Graham (played by the film’s director Ida Lupino). 
The film unfolds from this point in a flashback as Harry explains to Mr Jordan how he ended up in this situation - a travelling salesman whose marriage to Eve has hit a rocky patch as she deals with their business affairs back home as well as a sick mother and father, Harry meets Phyllis on a bus tour of the homes of the Hollywood stars. They get talking and slowly fall in love. 
Harry tries to get out of it but then he discovers that Phyllis is preganant and, being a ‘decent’ man, he does the right thing and marries her. So begins his double life.
It’s so delicately handled (and acted) that you can’t help feeling sorry for Harry. As Edmund Gwenn says to Harry at the end;
 ‘I can't figure out my feelings towards you, I despise you, and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, and yet I almost wish you luck.’
I won’t spoil the ending but I should say that it doesn’t end happily for anyone - not that it ends in murder or in any great melodrama - just that all of these people are going to be affected by the events and there’s a real sense of loss and sadness about it all. 
All of the cast are excellent and Lupino proves to be a great director - even the flashback structure works well for me. 
As a side note - apparently Collier Young (the film’s writer-producer) was married to Joan Fontaine whilst the film was being shot but had previously been married to Ida Lupino. Can’t help thinking that must have made for some interesting conversations on set.",5.0
She did that,5.0
"Edmond O'Brien is horrifically miscast as the titled role- he's always being upstaged by his clearly much more effective two female costars all the darn time-to be fair, they're played by extremely charismatic and extraordinarily gifted actresses. He also does a terrible job acting wise, as he has no idea what to do with his character at all, so he unwisely decides to play him as a confused dope with no characteristics at all- thus, the audience doesn't genuinely care about him in the slightest. It also doesn't help that he is supposed to portray an unlikable character sympathetically but due to his monotone vocal range and his lack of passion in the role, he causes the main subject to become less interesting than the horrendous bus tour that sets the premise up in the first place.
The moralizing tone overwhelmed the film's script to the point one would swear they were accidentally watching a Hays Code approved ""melodrama"" which it totally is. This is the only time Ida Lupino ever completely directed herself and it clearly shows why- she doesn't seem to firmly know which job to pursue first, and without any clear decision making on how to reunite those two prospects together, she exerts an unintentional and overwhelming sense of sloppiness upon the whole film itself. The visuals suffer to the point that it looks more like a juvenile televised soap opera than an independent film made by capable adults. The actors don't know what to do with themselves- sometimes such lack of direction helps spur creativity (Joan Fontaine does a wonderful job at expressing her character's inner thoughts- even more astonishing is Ida's self-determination whilst acting as you can feel that she's doing her best under the rather unfortunate circumstances) but most of the time, it really diminishes the actors' and crew's self-confidence to the point of not being able to do their best within their role. This is downright depressing as Ida Lupino showed her true talents within both departments- just not when they're together on the same project.
The script, already hampered and trampled upon by a really unpleasant waging censoring finger, is already hard to swallow within its logic department- why did Edmond O'Brien ever think he could get away with bigamy and why did he go along with his first wife's adoption plans as it was made apparently clear that any place in charge of taking care of minors need to search very deeply within its applicants in order for the child to be placed in safe, and reliable hands; why was Edmund Gwenn even allowed to go back to the orphanage after his monumental and unmentionable failure if said mistake was that severe; if the first wife really was a major operative within the company, shouldn't she have been already to Los Angeles to the point that she's well acquainted with the place? Most importantly, why did he never let his second wife know the truth from the moment that he found out that she was pregnant- heck why didn't he tell anyone about the information as he could explain his mistake and accept full responsibility of the situation much to his newfound moral approval and sensitivity to his spouse's sanity as well as fostering respect for his mistress' dilemmas?
Aside from many more logical problems, the script should have been really interesting as it made a social problem much more palatable to moral tastes- it sadly fails because the script's so focused on making the controversial issue palatable to contemporary audience reception that it ultimately makes it blandly heavy-handed to the point that the film quickly wears its welcome out before it can hit any dramatically interesting scenes. It's a true shame, as this was one of the few mature films to openly deal with taboo subjects in a time of insanely restrictive censorship and it's clear that everyone tries their absolute hardest in trying to make a badly written tearjerker seem believable. It's just that no one actually bothered to mend that script up so to make it less puritanical and more openly frank or to rid that same production of any massive tonal failures so as to achieve a sense of control in spreading its ideas.
If you're still curious about Ida Lupino's directing career, please check out her other films, especially Outrage- an amazing film both of its time and also ahead of its time in its depiction of rape. Please avoid The Bigamist as one would avoid bigamy in real life.",2.5
"Didn't like it, but still it is a very well-made film

The structure of 3 main character is thoroughly reasonable. and yes, it is truly inconvenient to take that Harry isn't really a guy who always looking for another woman to hook up with.
He has been faithful to his family for years but he had this self-esteem issue grown inside about his wise, smart, enterprising wife. and when he meets up with Phyllis, he uses her as a exit from his life but eventually he becomes love her as time goes by.
As we see, almost everything that happens in this movie is based on real life. for example, men often feel resistance about women who are smarter than them. and having an affair if the circumstances are right.
Now what the movie repeatly emphasize is, it could happen to every guys. not just to a guy we labeled as ""mysogynist"" and sadly, it really is. it's not anti-feminism or a message to us women to shut the fuck up, it's just the way it is.
I don't think Ida meant to say ""Yes, so us women should be in a kitchen but intimidating our own men."" and we don't have to just be on her side if she meant is this. I think she just knew really well about how mean could a standard familyman be, and witnessed some cases, so she decided to make a movie about it.
For last I just want to say about Phyllis. Well, she is... I'm not quite sure what she really is behind the illusion of damsel-in-distress and why does she act like she doesn't need any help but I kinda have a clue why Harry gave that much dedications to her and it is also reasonable. (Nothing matters just bunch of things she has that can be fantasized by a man) and what really fascinates me is that she isn't be here just to get attention to him. I know she acts in attractive ways but that's not because she supposes to leave good impression on him. that's because that is what she is. she has something on her mind so she tries so hard not to rely on anybody. that makes her attractive, and three-dimensional in the same way. and I want to know about her more. about her past life...
Just now that I tell you the first thought after watching the film is, women's life sucks ass. seriously, why would we want someone that often be scared of our intelligence as our spouse? We don't have to go along with this bullshit, maybe we have before but not in the future anymore.",4.0

"The concerns of The Bigamist are right there in the title. But if you’re showing up for a lurid story, Lupino aims to disappoint. The Bigamist is overflowing with empathy for its titular hero, a traveling salesman locked in a loving marriage to Joan Fontaine that is feeling more and more like a business partnership, as well as his wife and the woman down in L.A. he ends up marrying after she gets pregnant (Lupino).
In a strange way, The Bigamist is more narratively noir-ish [than The Hitch-Hiker]: totally predictable impulses lead to totally irreconcilable situations, and nothing but the tragic awaits us. Lupino allows the tale to unfold in such a way that guilt, if not hard to establish, is understandable. The film’s soap opera title hides a classic story of a few bad choices writ large.

"Honestly that adoption investigator was such a nosy ass!
This is kind of a hard one to watch from a current perspective because the problem it presents is totally solvable by some relational honesty that wasn’t thinkable at the time. It also filters too much through the man’s perspective.

"A simple and brilliant morality play. There's a shot where two of the women are both slightly out of focus and the space in between them is in focus. Perhaps the best dramatic use of depth of field I have ever seen.
The drama is based on a deeply human idea, take someone who has done something wrong then give that crime a context and a compassionate point of view.
All the roles are so well cast, Fontaine has such an innocent and fragile air that you feel as though her character could break at any moment.
The corny 1950s dialogue makes it even better, showing how if you have a good story even the most dated details can come alive.
The judge's final monologue where he says the court can't punish the man any worse than him living with what he's done is so good.
Perhaps a film could be made about someone who does a bunch of horrible things but his ultimate punishment is having to live with himself. There could be something darkly comic there.",5.0

"The first Hollywood feature wherein its female star directed herself, The Bigamist also marks another in Lupino’s string of filmmaking efforts to squarely confront pressing, taboo social topics. This dramatic, haunting noir uniquely centers on fragile family man and traveling salesman Harry (Edmond O’Brien) torn between his matrimonial devotions to two women: the business-minded but barren San Francisco-based Eve (Joan Fontaine) and his independent, grounded (and fertile) Angelino, Phyllis (Lupino). Caught in his lies by an adoption agent, Harry’s tangled romantic yarn is spun in a series flashbacks. RKO was originally attached, but producers Young and Lupino instead opted to self-distribute when they recognized the measly profits that were barely returning to their pockets.",3.0
"Lupino’s The Bigamist is nowadays best known as the first film noir in which the female lead directed herself. She plays a mistress who comes into the life of Edmond O’Brien, a succesful but bored businessman. The film starts with O’Brien and his wife wanting to adopt a child. The adoption agent is somewhat suspicious towards O’Brien’s behaviour. He starts to investigate his life and soon discovers that O’Brien is leading a double life and already has a child with another woman. This woman turns out to be Lupino, as O’Brien tells the agent in a flashback. When he finishes his story we learn that he is married to two women, one of them being Lupino who he had an affair with until she got pregnant and he decided to marry her eventhough he was already married. This film is not necessarily suspenseful but more an interesting take on the moral dilemma O’Brien faces being tangled between two women he loves. The final courtroom scene makes the viewer realize that O’Brien tried to do the right thing. Lupino directed a nuanced film where we can sympathize with everyone involved. It almost feels more like a Douglas Sirk sort of melodrama instead of a noir.

"OK, I'm actually going to try to write thoughtful responses (not really 'reviews') to the movies I watch this year.
Recently became aware of and interested in the films of Ida Lupino after watching her in DEVOTION. After seeing this and THE HITCH-HIKER a week ago, I'm even more fascinated by Lupino and wonder what drew her to telling these stories that seem so focused on the vulnerability and fragility of the male ego and the masculine role. There's a scene in THE HITCH-HIKER where the titular murderer brags about being tough from the get-go and taunts the 'soft' married men he's ambushed, making it clear that he's delineating himself from them, reassuring them (and probably himself) that they do not align with his idea of 'manliness.' The film doesn't seem like an overt comment on that, but it's definitely there. Anyway, it's more obvious in THE BIGAMIST, which concerns itself with the three major players' gender roles! So basically the premise is that a couple, Harry (Edmund O'Brien) and Eve (Joan Fontaine), want to adopt a baby, but the husband is acting 'spicious when he's asked to sign a form that he consents to a full background check and the adoption agency man (played by Miracle on 34th Street Santa -- there's a line later that wink, wink-nudge, nudges that fact) is, like, Hmmmmmm, uh-uh! and he starts investigating the husband to find out what he's hiding. So, Harry and Eve. Harry is a traveling salesman slanging freezers or something, who cares. Eve is his former secretary turned business partner (if I'm not mistaken) and wife, and she's awesome, the few scenes we see her in. There's a scene when she and Harry are having some bigwig over for dinner and Eve gives him the product sales pitch. She's modest and does the hokey, ""Aw, shucks, it's nothin'. I'm just a gal!"" bit but her confidence is palpable and she totally commands it. Meanwhile, Harry bats his lashes into his dinner plate, and Eve snaps him out of his stupor by asking him to serve the guests some brandy. Get it together, house husband! I exclaimed, ""oH FOK!"" aloud. So, there's a taste of the underpinning of Harry's wandering. They're pretty cliché role reversals, Eve is career-driven and Harry is more family-oriented and expects an amount of emotional validation from Eve that she can't meet--tbh, cos she's too busy being an ambitious, independent woman with troubles of her own. That is, her father passing away and, of course, her character is written to want to be a mother but she's physically unable to have a child. Okay, cutting to the chase, Harry's all hesitant and sneaky because, as the title suggests, he's got another woman on the side because Eve just isn't, supposedly, fulfilling her role as a woman, she isn't a doting Wife (Harry says at one point that he ""loved Eve but never felt she needed me"") and she's barren so she can't be a Mother (well, she *can*, that's why they were going to adopt, but you get what I mean). Enter Phyllis, or Phyl, as she's diminutively and affectionately referred to by Harry. She's a tough-skinned waitress with her wits about her (played by Lupino herself) who's actually a softie deep down that Harry awkwardly sidles up to during one of his lonely business trips on a homes of Hollywood stars tour bus. Anyway, they date whenever he's in town and eventually, yep, she gets preg. Santa adoption agency man ends up figuring all this out and it concludes with Harry going to court. It's melodramatic in all the right ways and the ending is uncertain. Both women stare at him as they leave the court room with their own looks of pity and subdued incredulity, like, ""Why? you bastard..."" Personally, I hope both women left his azz!!!!!
Extra:
--Interesting to note that the screenwriter, Collier Young, was previously married to Lupino, then apparently they divorced after founding their indie production company, and he ended up marrying Joan Fontaine. Juicy!
--The female characters are way more interesting than the male lead.
--I wanna seek out more films under Lupino's direction, but there aren't too many and it looks like after THE BIGAMIST, she mostly worked in television until THE TROUBLE WITH ANGELS (one of my mom's favorite movies so maybe I'll watch with her while I'm on this Ida tip) in 1966.
--Oh, and also, it was nothing special, but I liked the way flashback was employed as a storytelling device. Gave Harry's coming clean a noir feel.
--Lmao at the finger pointing at Harry in the poster. It's him. He did it.",0.0
"Very interesting picture from Lupino. It seems progressive and I guess it is for its time in that it shuns black and white morality for the gray areas in between; she utilizes  empathy from both the audience and the characters in the story to her advantage. It still focuses heavily on the male protagonist and is maybe a little too short for its own good. We feel for him, but why? His wife was apart from him and contributing to the family business as much as he, and did she cheat on him because she was lonely?? Maybe that is the trick here, to understand the characters but see the hypocrisy in these relationships. Probably a lot more to analyze here that will require a second viewing.",3.0
There are some kind-of interesting performances in this and I feel like there's probably more here I missed? But as it was it was a peculiar look at this idea. I am not sure what to make of it.,3.0
"Another one of those deviously subversive jabs at the wholesome image of suburbia in 1950s America, “The Bigamist” dares to infiltrate the sacred confines of marriage with the seediness and distrust of film noir. Directed by actress Ida Lupino (who also plays Phillys, the second wife) at a time when movies were creatively dominated by men, the movie provides a frank and rare portrait of the insecurities and hypocrisies of men, exemplified by Harry Graham, a husband so turned off by his wife’s becoming a career woman that he goes so far as to attempt to pick up strange women on tour busses. Yet, even when he’s successful at this, he remains pathetically indecisive, reluctant to even kiss the other woman and yet also unwilling to quit seeing her and return to his wife. When he finally does have sex with the other woman, he isn’t even man enough to break things off with his wife, or even tell her about the affair. When Phyllis becomes pregnant, he marries her, without even letting on that he is already married. As Harry recounts all of this to an adoption agency worker who has finally outed him, he comes off as a complete wimp, wallowing in self-pity and acting as though he never had any choice but to do exactly as he is.
The irony is that Harry’s plight is understandable for a man of his era, his decisions constantly guided by the conflicting values of a time when people were expected to strive for the utmost normalcy. When the mask of that misguided concept of normalcy shows cracks (the inability to conceive a child; a career woman for a wife) begin to appear, Harry winds up betraying the charade altogether and loses his identity altogether. In another interesting twist on the American dream, this time one constantly perpetuated by Hollywood in these days, the film ends not with a classic happy ending, but instead with a a musing by a judge on guilt and punishment.
The fact that Mr. Jordan so avidly pries into Graham’s private life based on nothing more than an uneasy feeling about Graham might have been an all-too-recognizable bit of political commentary might have been an all too familiar bit of political commentary during the height of McCarthyism.",3.0
"MAY MOVIE MAGIC 2016
As part of our film festival we chose the phenomenal actress Ida Lupino as our tribute star. As part of that we would be remiss not to include The Bigamist as part of our line up. As she both directed in and starred it is a natural choice. A great movie The Bigamist offers so many contrary feelings to the audience. The strong story line and dramatic acting make for great story telling. As part of the 101 movies you need to see before you die list. I can finally cross this one off.",3.5

"Just heard about this #52FilmsbyWomen thing people are doing so I figure I'll join in,
Ida Lupino is my favorite of all the film noir leading ladies, and while it is a real bummer that there weren't more women directing films at the time, I'm glad that Lupino was one who got a shot at it. Love the Hitch-Hiker and Outrage so I was looking forward to this one quite a bit.
The movie is a love triangle that unfolds as an adoption agent begins looking into a couple planning to adopt. While the wife (Joan Fontaine) checks out fine, he becomes suspicious of the husband (Edmond O'Brien). Investigating O'Brien on one of his business trips to LA, he finds he is living a second life with another woman (Ida Lupino).
The movie paints its three characters fairly and methodically. O'Brien is obviously in the wrong and it doesn't make us feel any sympathy for him, but at the same time it doesn't go to extremes to make him the biggest shit in the world. Both of the women feel like real human beings being put through the ringer. O'Brien being framed as our main character, a lesser movie might make one or both of his lovers feel like a wet blanket or shrill annoyance to make you understand why he would do this, but this movie fortunately has more respect for its characters.
The result is a interesting and morose watch. There are times where it moves a bit slow...maybe because the two ladies are more interesting than the lead and there are occasional gaps where we are aone with him a bit too long.",3.0
"Bad enough that, of the three principles entangled in this sordid web of bigamy, actress Ida Lupino seems to be the only one that knows her way around the material (though this is possibly the fault of director Ida Lupino) -- Edmund O'Brien acts like he has all of John Wayne's impacted feces lodged up in his business, & Joan Fontaine seems way too even-keeled, if not downright chipper, for a barren woman desperate to have a child.
The real problem, however, is this script doing everything in its power to excuse, if not justify, the bigamy. Of course it wasn't the man's fault that he can't talk to his wife about his dissatisfaction, or that he was so desperately lonely that he knocked up a one-night stand on his birthday, or that his wife's father died around the time he learns of his baby-daddy predicament (so of COURSE he can't come clean to her about his infidelity). & he's such a good guy for wanting to keep up both of these ruses for the sake of the woman / child, even though he's actually a dishonest weak-willed asshole (who's also too stupid to realize that maybe you should do more with your name if you're going to live a double life). Either this script needs to tone down the pathos, the director needs to do a better job of recognizing the absurdity of all this & exploit it in some way, or the viewer should go watch Scarlet Street instead. (Unless the viewer's watching this for the bigamy; then I'd recommend the first three seasons of Big Love.)",2.5
"One wonders how something like this comes together. Ida Lupino directs a script by her husband/ex-husband, about a man with two wives. ""the shocking story of two women who gave all their love to one man!"" Who is the author/autuer of this film? The Los Angeles setting makes for some interesting Meta Moments, the lovers meeting on a Hollywood tour bus, the presence of Edmund Gwenn and frequent mentions of Santa Claus. Ho ho ho. Interesting",2.5
I've never been much of an Edmund O'Brien fan but he's quite good here and has nice chemistry with Ida Lupino who gives an excellent performance herself as a woman trying to keep the world at arm's length so she doesn't get hurt again. I just wish the film had a little more Sirk or Nick Ray in it. It's pretty straightforward. A little more melodrama would have gone a long way.,3.0

"Excellent Ida Lupino directed movie featuring melodrama and a tinge of noir. Fighting against the mainline studios, Lupino formed her own movie company called The Filmmakers. This story of a man marrying two women and raising children was not seen as 'the right stuff' by the big studios and what was meant to be an 'A' grade movie turned into a 'B' grade much to Lupino's efforts to make it otherwise. This was to be her last directorial role. Joan Fontaine looks and acts brilliantly alongside her male lead Edmond O'Brian. Listen out for the script nods to Edmund Gwenn who played Santa in the 1947 version of Miracle on 34th street. Very good movie",3.0
"Ida Lupino's The Bigamist exhibits almost all of the tells of the noir genre except for its most unique plot - a lonely man who succombs to his weaknesses and commits a terrible crime might seem straight forward noir territory until you take in to account the fact that the crime he commits is bigamy and although he tells his shameful story in flashback to a detective (straight out of noir 101) there's a whole lot of mooning about feeling sorry for himself and a very obvious play to use the unreliable narrator literary trick. It's a fascinating deconstruction of what makes noir noir and especially how the different sexes are portrayed in film, with Lupino offering two very different and yet very strong female characters and a weak male who just needs somebody to watch over him.",3.5
"The premise isn't aging well.... who pays Edmund Gwynn's salary to travel all over investigating prospective adoptive parents? Nobody cares anymore.
Surreal moment once (director) Lupino enters when we see the home of ""Edmund Gwynn, Santa Claus from Miracle on 42nd Street!"". He's like.. in the movie.
A crime drama? Oh yeah... bigamy is a crime. Otherwise, this is just melodrama.
A double life in SF and LA
From TCM
Imagine for a moment that you are a woman in a man's world: an actress turned director, with your own production company. Your company has overextended itself into unfamiliar territory, and its future rests on you. You assemble a bunch of Oscar®-winning actors and convince them to work for free, in exchange for a share of the profits. But those profits are in doubt, thanks to your decision to venture into self-distribution.
Now, let's say that your investors for this no-budget marvel have rejected every one of your story ideas save one: a story about a man with two wives. And just for toppers, let's imagine that you've cast yourself as one of these wives, and as the other woman you've brought in your own real-life rival in your own, very public, romantic entanglements.
Stressful? Perhaps, but you've just assembled the pieces of a bona fide soap opera so fascinating that you're all but guaranteed popular attention regardless of how well-or how poorly-you do your job.
Meet Ida Lupino-actress, writer, director, producer, and all at the tender age of 33. Not another woman in Hollywood even came close to such an accomplishment, not at the dawn of the Father Knows Best 1950s.
Not that strong women were few and far between back then-in fact, quite the opposite. During the war years, sisters were doin' it for themselves. When the boys came back, they found a capable and confident workforce dominated by women. Men retook the reins, but it was not so simple-their gals had gotten used to playing the same games, and the economy favored two-earner couples. Social mores continued to expect that good hubbies were the sole breadwinners, and believed that if a wife worked it was a matter of scandal, but the misfit between those increasingly outdated attitudes and the changing economic landscape caused no small amount of sexual tension. Just the stuff for dramatic movies.
Ida Lupino and her then husband Collier Young founded their own independent production company The Filmakers (where's the missing m? You tell me) in 1950 and launched a series of ""social issue"" pictures about: a dancer who gets polio, a strained mother-daughter relationship, rape. These were made-for-Lifetime movies two generations beforehand.
But Lupino was more complex than that. She could play steely-hard better than anyone, and she had a hard-boiled sensitivity. So she dabbled in noir as well, and her 1952 thriller The Hitch-Hiker was a white-knuckle suspense flick about a killer who takes a pair of philandering husbands hostage; it stands today as one of the most intense thrillers of the noir era. It was her biggest commercial success, but while the critical accolades flowed easily her way, most of the cash flowed into the coffers of distributor RKO.
So, Collier Young suggested that they simply walk away from RKO and distribute their own films. It would mean more risk up front, but substantially increase the (hoped for) rewards. The plan was to produce a quorum of flicks for $125,000 apiece, but in the end the investors only backed one, The Bigamist (1953).
Despite the provocative title (and the fact that it only barely passed muster with the Production Code censors as it was), The Bigamist is a solidly melodramatic and not at all sexy piece of work. Doughy frontman Edmond O'Brien (see also The Hitch-Hiker, D.O.A. (1950), The Killers (1946), and other noir fare) plays Harry Graham, a traveling salesman based in San Francisco. His wife Eve (Joan Fontaine, Hitchcock's Rebecca, 1940) is an ice-bitch corporate executive. In a reversal of typical women's movie tropes, Harry is hungry for family, intimacy, and emotional connection--but she's all business. In a cruel stereotype, it turns out she is literally barren, unable to have a child of her own any more real than the tin robot she buys in anticipation of a kid unlikely to ever come. Lacking any human closeness at home, Harry wanders. On a sales trip in Los Angeles, he kicks off an affair with Phyllis, a waitress in a Chinese restaurant (Lupino). This chick is tough as nails, unsentimental, and a little coarse, but she's a little more earthy and real than Eve. When Phyl (50s films often featured rugged dames with mannish names) turns up pregnant, Harry does the honorable thing and marries her-but as his wife is grieving her father's death and trying to adopt a child of her own, he feels unable to divorce her just yet. So, he straddles the two marriages. Neither life is particularly desirable, neither woman is a ""bad guy,"" and the whole situation is more sad than tawdry.
When the investigator for the adoption agency (Edmund Gwenn, Santa Claus himself from Miracle on 34th Street, 1947) starts to look into Harry's squirrely-ness, the jig is up. Cue a flashback and a courtroom scene - but because this is a low-budget art film and not a formulaic major studio release, don't expect a tidy conclusion or satisfying coda.
Mainstream movies were bifurcating in the 1950s. Exploitation pix aimed at teens dumbed the form down for big profits, while foreign imports tended to appeal to more refined tastes. Lupino savvily aimed her film at the latter crowd, expressly offering adult-themed drama that one couldn't find on TV and otherwise might have to endure subtitled pretension to enjoy in theaters. Along with the serious treatment of a controversial subject, Lupino giddily tossed in some fun in-jokes as well: at one point, Harry takes a ""star tour"" of Hollywood and sees the palatial retreat of Edmund Gwenn, who is of course one of the actors in the movie.
The press made much of the curious overlap between fact and fiction in the movie. The film depicts a man who is married to both Joan Fontaine and Ida Lupino-a situation well understood by the film's screenwriter Collier Young, who could basically claim the same thing. Not long after founding The Filmakers, Young and Lupino divorced, but remained professional partners. Young quickly married Fontaine, while Lupino married actor Howard Duff; the two couples were on good terms and socialized together. ""We want to be grown up about it all,"" said Young; ""Ida and I are old friends,"" added Fontaine, ""I knew her before Collier did.""
According to Joan Fontaine, the original plan had Jane Greer playing the Eve role, and when Greer dropped out the production was left in a quandary, short of time, short of funds. Considering it her ""wifely duty,"" Joan stepped up to take the role, and agreed to defer her salary so long as Ida agreed to direct-although Lupino had once vowed never to direct herself.
Unintentionally, the consequence of these choices would echo throughout the film in subtle ways. Joan Fontaine's onscreen character is a cold fish, barren in all senses of the word, while Ida Lupino's role is the more wifely, even if she plays it with a street-hardened edge. Privately, the two women were living similar roles. Ida Lupino had found what her biographer William Donati called ""everything she wanted: fame, fortune, beauty, a career, Howard Duff and a child."" By contrast, in her autobiography, Joan Fontaine writes bitterly about what she refers to as ""the aridity of householding and child care,"" saying that ""the web of domesticity tightened about us."" The onscreen depiction of the two women also reinforces the distinction between them. Fontaine's scenes are somewhat flat, almost perfunctory, whereas Lupino's scenes are full of noir atmosphere and rich expressive shadows. Fontaine recalls, ""after shooting all my scenes, director Ida saw the rushes, didn't like the photography, and changed cameramen before actress Ida began her own scenes!"" What Fontaine remembers as a flash of feminine vanity may have been more than that-director Lupino had plenty of good thematic reason to depict the two households in fundamentally distinct lights.
Production took place in June and July of 1953 at a rental soundstage at Republic Studios. Director Ida hashed out a cut with one editor, then fired him and continued with Stanford Tischler until she was happy with the structure: a noir-style investigative opening, a flashback sequence delving into the characters and their drama, finishing with a melodramatic courtroom sequence. The finished 79 minute film was sent out on Christmas Day 1953 to positive reviews but performed poorly at the box office. The Bigamist spelled the end of The Filmakers. Lupino would not direct again for a dozen years, not until 1966's The Trouble with Angels.
Lupino's Filmakers group may have indulged in made-for-cable melodrama, but this oddball gem is something the Lifetime audience would certainly reject. The Bigamist stands today as a rare treat: a woman-made ""woman's picture"" that avoids sentimentality and obvious emotion, a low-budget film that eschews genre convention and revels in top-drawer acting talent, a somber study of life-altering decisions that makes marriage seem more like a curse than a blessing. For a happily married woman at the top of her craft, her film bespeaks a quiet anguish and cynicism one doesn't often find outside the world of film noir.
