Comentario,Nota
"Feels light years ahead of its time in dealing with topics like toxic masculinity, victim-blaming, and PTSD, although weirdly ends with the protagonist still not quite able to make her own choices. Nevertheless, Lupino's contribution to cinema and her forward-thinking and willingness to take on taboo subjects is pretty remarkable for the time. Maybe hopefully someday someone can write about how outdated and passé this film is, but unfortunately that time isn't now.",4.0
"Action! - Female 4 Front: Breaking Grounds With Ida Lupino
Ida Lupino returns with a film co-written by the actress and which at the time was somewhat controversial as it was apparently the second post-Code film to touch on the subject of rape in a way that many may see as outdated, but which in context works, not only in the form of discussion (which may well be somewhat superficial), but as a mechanism for creating suspense and adding psychological value to the film, at times giving it a touch reminiscent of Hitchcock's work.
Mala Powers, in her first major role, does an excellent job of depicting our character's fall, displaying both her fragile and charming side as well as the horror of the attack she underwent. Lupino's camerawork, with its closeups and angles, and the music all contribute to the psychological depth of her performance.
All in all, a really good take on the matter with enough mystery and suspense blended with some film noir elements for good measure, resulting in a film that I will recommend watching for those into any of those genres.

In Ida Lupino We Trust.,4.0
"I decided to have a break from being served up substandard westerns from Film4 and TCM today and took matters into my own hands to try and find some older stuff that was available on YouTube instead. I'll do what I want.
Outrage was a very recent watchlist addition from when I was reading Ida Lupino's Wikipedia page. As is the case with any film that has a crime in it made from about 1939 to 1960, it's often been labelled as a film noir but really this is nothing like a film noir at all. Instead, it's a groundbreaking and controversial (for its time) film about a young woman looking to rebuild her life after suffering a serious sexual assault or rape.
This being 1950, nobody is allowed to say any such thing. Instead they say she's been ""attacked"" and the poster itself says a similar such thing. I do wonder how Lupino felt about the Hays Code restrictions she has placed on her here, which also probably inform the somewhat misleading title as well. Even within those restrictions, she has fashioned a sometimes incredibly powerful film that touches on a remarkable number of themes for a film as comparatively early as this.
This is not a film that chooses to go down the route of tracking down Mala Powers' 'attacker' as it looks, early on, as though it will do. Instead, it focuses completely on Powers' struggle to continue with her life one way or another. This all happens after the scene in which she's attacked. Played out with no soundtrack at all, it's one of the most unbearably tense and horribly grim scenes I think I have ever seen in a film from this era.
Thereafter, Lupino does not try matching that scene for suspense, mainly because that's not what her intentions are for this film anyway. Instead, she touches on feelings of alienation, paranoia, displacement, guilt and fear of physical contact from both men and women - covering so many of the psychological effects suffered by survivors of sexual violence. And she does all this in a 75 minutes running time.
Outrage only stumbled somewhat at the end when Powers brains a pushy bloke with a wrench, nearly killing him, only to have clergyman Tod Andrews, who has helped her to restore her social confidence and provided her with support, to insist the chap in question ""....meant no harm"". That left a slightly sour taste although, in fairness, Powers still hadn't told Andrews what she had been through at this juncture. Andrews also gets a courtroom soapbox moment that is well meaning but sounds very quaint and melodramatic in this day and age, and Powers being essentially forced to return to her home town and family was slightly difficult to swallow.
If it wasn't for the last 5 to 10 minutes here, Outrage would be a film I would have absolutely no question in claiming as something of a lost classic. However, it is still powerful today, containing a perfectly vulnerable performance from Powers, and resisting the seemingly obvious plot directions that almost all other films of its time would take. Lupino's career as a director is in need of far more attention than it has received in a very long time.",4.0
"one of the most aching films about trauma and how it ripples through our lives, without even being allowed to explicitly state that its protagonist is raped",4.5
"Spoilers & discussion of sexual assault ahead.
The best thing about Ida Lupino's Outrage is its ambiguity. Exploring the aftermath of the rape of a young woman (Ann Walton, played by Lupino favorite Mala Powers), the movie is loaded with people whose motivations and natures are never entirely clear.
Why does Ann's father say he's ""frightened"" about her taking the bus to work on her first day back after the assault? Is he worried about her mental health? Her physical safety? Or is his concern about what people might think of a father who allows a girl to go out on her own, so soon after being rape?
Why is Jim so determined to marry Ann as they had planned, despite what happened to her, and her resistance to his newfound urgency? Does he believe that traditional, marital normalcy will make everything better for the woman he loves? Is he worried about how he will look to their neighbors if he wavers? Or might he fear that he will waver, if he allows himself time to think?
And why is Pastor Doc Ferguson so interested in Ann? Is his attention predatory? Romantic? Altruistic? All of the above?
What is the place to which Doc has brought Ann, found passed out on the side of the road? Why is the woman who owns the place so strangely distant and wry about the entire affair? And what is ""The Harrison Ranch""? Is it a working farm, or is that a dark euphemism for a house of prostitution?
All of these questions and many, many more are unavoidable while watching Outrage, and it's to Lupino's immense credit that she never explicitly answers any of them. We learn from the behavior of the people with whom we're allowed to spend time and can draw tentative conclusions, but uncertainty nevertheless abounds. Doc's motives are never entirely clear, and we don't learn anything about either Ann's father or her fiancée — when she returns home to them, our questions remain unanswered, and are presumably still present in Ann's mind, as well.
Where this crucial complexity is lost, however, is in the film's final act, when its wheels unfortunately come off in significant ways.
Having been approached in a repellently presumptuous, physical, very aggressive manner by a stranger at a community dance, the quite literally trapped Ann, who is on her back on the ground, unable to get away from the man who looms over her, strikes him with a wrench and runs, putting the man in the hospital and herself in prison.
While, to modern eyes, the wrenching (LOL) irony of the scene — the victim of an assault that was going to get a lot worse, and a lot more physical, being labeled a criminal for defending herself — is abundantly clear, as it likely was to women in the audience in 1950, unlike the rest of the film, the scene is not left open to interpretation. Instead, Doc — Ann's confidant, and a pastor besides, as well as the film's sensitive arbiter of goodness, gives Ann his heartfelt assurances that her attacker ""meant you no harm,"" offering as evidence the fact that ""I've known him for a long time.""
It would be wonderful if the film gave us the space to question Doc, and recognize his brainwashing by the system in which he lives when it comes to what we today call toxic masculinity, but I don't think that's offered. Instead, he remains the voice of good sense and moral authority throughout the final act of Outrage, making a heartfelt plea for psychological treatment of criminals, sensitive treatment of Ann, and arranging for her attacker to be lionized for his agreement not to press charges against her, something that will no doubt clear the ground for him to continue forcing himself upon unwilling women.
I recognize that the film for which I was hoping likely wasn't possible in the US in 1950, but the intelligent, layered nature of the first two acts of Outrage shows such a strong awareness of the minefields through which women constantly move on the part of Lupino and her co-writers Malvin Wald and Collier Young, that to have that nuance and understanding suddenly vanish at such a crucial moment was an immense disappointment.

"An astonishing drama, with a very powerful performance from Mala Powers. Way ahead of it's time, this film was the first serious attempt from Hollywood (well b-pic) to discuss the ramifications of rape.
Ida Lupino constructs an amazing drama, which for the period is a very subtle, sensitive and non-sensationalist, examining of a very tragic and serious subject. The film does calls this ""assault"" but it was 1950 and minus that, everything else is treated with a very weighty tone.
Visually this is sparse film-making but Lupino is excellent is shot construct and her use of angles. Same with the editing, possibly this is the most tightly edited 75 mins I've ever seen.
A very worthy drama and very worthy of your time.",4.0

"Is this why you raise a daughter? Is this what you love and sacrifice for? What kind of times are these that such things can happen?
The topic at hand is so heavy that it made the film feel like it was 3 hours, not 1hr15. The chase scene, in particular, was so unbearable that I almost burst into tears. Despite not being the easiest of watches, Lupino provides something bold and ahead of its time. The doubts and victim blaming that, unfortunately, lingers in rape culture is absent here. To be able to produce a film that explores rape like this, during an era where it wasn't heavily discussed, is phenomenal.",3.5

in the end, our protagonist, anne (an outstanding performance by mala powers) knows that it'll be a difficult path but, hopefully, she'll be able to overcome this traumatic experience someday.",4.0
'Attack'. Oh Hays Code.,3.5
"A primeira metade é uma obra prima, tem aquela tensão que o Fritz Lang conseguiu com M, o desenrolar é pertinente com a época, com O Segundo Sexo da Beauvoir recém lançado, ainda não era difundida a ideia de que o estupro é algo inerente à sociedade patriarcal e não uma ""doença"" de alguns individuos como o padre/pastor diz em seu discurso que hoje soa extremamente datado, apesar de ter alguns reacionários que ainda pensam assim. No mais, é um divisor de águas, por tocar num assunto espinhoso dentro de Hollywood com o código Hays, embora enfraquecido, ainda em vigor.",4.5
"Every year I come up with a list of film goals. Directors and actors I want to do a deep dive into. Genres or films from a specific country. I find it to be a good way of eliminating blind spots and continue to increase my film knowledge. 
Anyway, Ida Lupino is a filmmaker I’ve long wanted to get acquainted with. I’m familiar with her work as an actress, but never ventured into her career as a director, which some hail as the output of an auteur yet to get her due.  
After watching Outrage for the first time, I can say Lupino’s third film was light years ahead of its time and it’s probably a miracle RKO didn’t balk at releasing it. In 1950, a film dealing with the sexual assault of its lead, a young bookseller named Ann Walton (Mala Powers, giving a powerful and transfixing performance), was exceedingly rare. Outrage also gives us a powerful look at the damage wrought…crippling PTSD…paranoia…endless victim-blaming. And most critical, a protagonist who outright refuses to let it define her. 
Lupino also takes aim at toxic masculinity (again, in 1950!!) and films a genuinely harrowing scene where a townsman refuses to take no for an answer. Truthfully, I think Outrage has only gained power overtime. It serves a stark reminder to how little has changed in 70+ years since it’s release. This is a technically accomplished and brave film (especially the ending), a prime example of a film in search of a wider audience.",4.0
"Pretty great for what Lupino managed to convey regarding Powers' Ann's tumult in the wake of a vicious attack as per Hays limitations, from skirting special ""There, there"" treatment by the townsfolk that pity her to an impulsive and distressed trek to a countryside idyll wherein Tod Andrews' Reverend ""Doc"" Ferguson lies in wait as her temporary life coach and savior. Aptly highlights what's wont to drive the reeling Ann to escape, i.e. the aforementioned and idea that one minute the perpetrating animals are apprehended, the next they're back on the street as she gradually gives in to a patently more civilized individual's methodology involving falling apart before picking up the pieces as a life necessity. While Doc - a capital G *good* man - is unequivocally both the who and what Ann comes to lean on as she grapples with the total upending of life and self as she knew them, there isn't much to gripe about in the realm of problematic representation as Lupino employs his gently mannered disposition as an absolute foil to the initial act's perpetrator whilst Ann hurdles psychological and public opposition on her way to deserved complacency.",3.5
"So much violence and neurotic madness. A vicious film that finds the strength needed to move on in the only places possible - faith, nature and the other.",4.0
"After watching The Bigamist, this is the second Ida Lupino-directed feature I've seen that was tonally adventurous and thrillingly directed until it gets to the final courtroom scene that uses 10 minutes to explain a moral thesis to the viewer. I'm sure this is for Hays Code purposes of explaining to the audiences who perhaps aren't ready to wade into murky moral waters but they are unfortunate add ons nonetheless.
Prior to said court scene, I marvel at the way Lupino uses hands in this movie. For a movie about rape that never uses the word rape Lupino expertly uses space throughout Outrage and it's the hands of men that constantly block a woman's freedom. Outrage opens with Mala Powers running through an open square with freedom of movement. She is picking up two pieces of cake for her and her sweetie on their respective lunch break but before handing over her order the soda jerk withholds it, asking her to consider him as her boyfriend next week. When her boyfriend places his hands on her shoulder and pulls her in close, Powers whispers—suggestively—about the gravy she's cooked for their fried chicken dinner, she leans in for a kiss but her boyfriend pushes her away because a granny is watching them and doesn't approve. Her sexual agency is denied because it's for a man to push for and determine when is a good time, even though he loved hearing about that portion of gravy she's going to serve him later. It's the soda jerk's hands that unbutton his shirt in a revealing letting-off-steam moment before he yells, ""hey beautiful"" at Powers on her walk home. And it's Powers hands that lay on a car horn attempting to get the attention of anyone nearby before she is raped by her follower; she does get someone's attention above but they just close their window in an annoyance at the sound of the horn blaring.
Once word of her attack has been whispered through the town, Lupino uses her camera to catch glances and concerned awareness that now blocks her previously free movement through town; the man who would marry her shakes her with both hands when she says she no longer wants to. When she runs away and passes out on the side of the road Lupino expertly has created distrust in her new savior because he blocks her exit from his room by placing his hands to the door frame and then immediately puts his hand on her shoulder to calm her down. The same male hero of this movie is presented as someone who has to earn Powers and the audience's trust, much counter to the normal introduction of the male hero in early cinema. And Powers will be reminded again why when she goes to the county fair and a man determines that she will dance with him and kiss him simply because that's what he wants.
Now, the areas where this movie falters also feels entirely out of Lupino's hands. Such as the Hays Code ending, the inability to use the word ""rape"" and/or rapist due to said Code, and the title of the movie. It's funny how Lupino, a great actress in noirs, essentially has to have a manly noir title for all the films she made for RKO even though only a few of them were actually noir. Rape and societal response to the crime of rape is indeed an outrage, an internal scar for the victim (here worn on the outside by her attacker), but the title to the movie doesn't really make sense as this is an exploration of physical withdrawal not hell-bent revenge. And unlike a few other films from this period that had an obvious tacked-on ending, this one wouldn't have been satisfying if it just ended with the court scene discussion for ten minutes. So everything just kinda ends in a swallowed hiccup. But the first hour is extremely nuanced in the visual representation of prohibited and invaded spaces where a woman once roamed free. And the outrage that she no longer can to the same extent.
Actually, maybe the title isn't that bad then.",3.5
"A really hard one to rate, as Lupino's work always seems to be. The three of her films I have seen all had interesting points of view that it would be easy (and possibly correct) to put down to her gender, this and the Bigamist shine an interesting light at 50s society and tackle things that most films of the period don't and showed moments of visual flourishes that are genuinely interesting whoever directed them. This and The Hitchhiker have scenes filled with first rate Noir stylings (more consistently in the Hitchhiker but the first act here as well).
In between and away from Lupino's position as a trailblazer they largely feel like pretty competent and standard 1950s fare rather than anything else. And that is presumably what Lupino was aiming for, to show that she was a competent working director who could take and deliver a job the same as anyone else. The fact that she does so with so many points of sociological interest as well is probably a bonus. I don't feel it's really unfair to her to watch this and feel that in a lot of ways its just a regular 50s film that you wouldn't be watching 60 years on if it wasn't for her historical position, based on some of the acting, dialogue and visuals it would probably be a 2 2.5 star movie, some of the second half of the movie was quite hard to get through..
But it is a very interesting movie in a lot of ways, its depiction of attitudes to rape and it's aftermath are fascinating. It's tempting to say they are forward looking or ahead of their time, but I think that gives too much credit to more recent decades and that it's probably more correct to say that they more likely the result of having a female director in charge of what we see and hear and that the rarity of that is what makes their attitudes stand out. That these views would seem a lot less ahead of their time if we'd just got to hear the views of a lot more women of 1950, if more stories had just been told by people who had an idea of the fear and impact of rape rather than seeing it as something to be erased or (in later decades) used as titilation or as revenge motivation for men.
So you end up with something that, in truth with a few exceptional scenes, largely looks like formulaic 50s TV but contains ideas and attitudes totally different than everything coming out of formulaic Hollywood. That Lupino might not be extraordinary visually but that she does bring an extraordinary viewpoint, presumably not one 'ahead of it's time' but actually the silenced viewpoint of the women of her time.

"Ida Lupino was a marvelous actress, but perhaps even a better director. She might have been given more resources nowadays, but even with low budgets and relatively minor stars, she made extremely powerful films. This may be the best, a gritty, extremely modern tale about the rape of a young, pretty woman in a small town and the failure of society to in any way to prevent the rape or help her deal with it. The police want to catch the rapist, but they are pushy and insensitive in their questioning. Her fiancé wants her to know that he still loves and desires to marry her, but he is almost violent in his attempt to convince her, scaring her further. Her family doesn't know how to speak to her, resulting in awful silence, while the rest of the town is obviously gossiping or awkward in their consolation. Eventually, she runs, heading for nowhere, just needing to escape. And going untreated, she panics when another man makes an unwanted advance and nearly kills him in her terrified response.
Mala Powers plays the main role of Ann with a great deal of pathos and depth of understanding for her emotional and psychological state. This was her first major film part, and she would also play Roxane in Cyrano de Bergerac, probably her best known part, the same year.
Ida Lupino's touches are throughout, especially in the scene where the rapist pursues his terrified victim through what should be familiar streets, but are twisted by the knowledge of the darkness that is closing in on her. And how many directors would dare take on not only rape, but also the misogyny of America, especially as it manifested after World War II? Women had experienced some freedom during the war, but they were re-constrained afterward, even tighter than before in the 50s, when good little women were housewives and mothers, letting the menfolk handle everything else. And that leads to a stranglehold on every part of women's lives, including sexuality, so that even the word rape could not be used in the film.
TCM showed this far too little known film at the Classic Film Festival in Hollywood in 2018 at the Egyptian Theatre. It is a shame it has not been released on DVD or Netflix, so more of the world can watch and marvel at a film so far ahead of its time and so good still today.",4.5
"Ida Lupino’s B film noir Outrage tackles rape and its impact on the victim, physically, psychologically, and socially, albeit in the cultural vernacular of 1950’s Hollywood in which none dares speak its name. Only the second film since the pre-code era to deal with the issue, Lupino’s daring is hard to see without context.
The stalking scene leading to the attack is pure visual noir: Expressionistic shadows, angles, pursuit, fear, darkness. Mala Powers runs from her masher/stalker/rapist, out of a world of happiness, marriage, and family and into back alleys of terror and isolation.
This excellent sequence is not matched in the latter part of the film, which follows Powers as she runs away from her family, job, and fiancee to the rural countryside, a new identity, and a job in an orange packing plant.
The story, co-written by Lupino, lacks real vim, and her “rescue” (from herself) reeks of paternalism and secular but very pronounced Christianity.",3.0
"1950 Ranking 
The word ‘rape’ is never once uttered but yet Lupino even within such constraints successfully conveys the horror of her protagonist’s predicament. I really wish she had gotten to work within a less censorship-heavy system but nevertheless this is very powerful, important work that is perhaps the best I’ve seen of her work yet.",4.0
"Absolutely groundbreaking at the time from Ida Lupino. That scene was traumatic, and it builds on the effects of the mental torment such an experience would create.

"""Um outro ponto de vista psicológico que merece destaque especial é aquele no qual Ann deve identificar o seu estuprador na polícia. Em um momento brilhantemente montado, o policial vai perguntando para ela, de maneira insistente, se um daqueles homens é seu agressor, até que os planos de seus rostos vão se sucedendo rapidamente e ela finalmente grita que não consegue reconhecer seu rosto. Vários momentos depois, quando um homem tenta agarrá-la no campo, a montagem também confunde seu rosto com o do estuprador original. Assim, utilizando-se de uma técnica cinematográfica (a montagem), Lupino passa uma ideia muito clara que permeia todo o ideal de sua obra, que inclusive está muito bem apontado pela própria tradução brasileira do título: O Mundo Todo É Culpado. Nunca se tratou de dar nome ou rosto ao estuprador, de individualizá-lo, mas de reforçar que se trata justamente de um mal coletivo, de todo homem como potencial ameaça. ""

"To tackle this certain theme in the plain decade when it got made, just shows the level of Ida Lupino’s admirable bravery as a ambitious filmmaker and the entire importance surrounding her film Outrage. Not much as just an educational piece of criticism against sexual assaults and rapes inside the historical celluloid of women’s marginalization in society’s DNA across years, but as her own horror movie of sorts.
Building the late tragedy that will haunt the character of Ann Walton (a seriously great Mala Powers) as it was a haunting-thriller, firstly introducing the sweat and hopeful girl about to marry and follow a great future ahead of her as we follow her into hers daily routine as a hard dedicated worker and a sweet fiancé and responsible daughter, but all build with a lure that something is about to go off at any minute. But when the real monster is revealed and the inevitable terrifying act is about to occur, the director builds the moment with an impeccable use of dark shadows and white bright lights to build a almost gothic scenario, and seemingly took inspiration from Jacques Tourneur’s Cat People street-stalking scene, to equally brilliant and agonizingly haunting results.
Even if the act itself is hidden for production-censorship of its era, Lupino still builds the effective feeling of a bleak cathartic occur with the broken horn of censorship covering the victim's potential cries of pain as she is openly ignored by everyone around. And all the aftermath of it shows a even genius showcase of Lupino’s direction, creating a dirty portrait of an intense judgmental and critical generation of America, easily blaming and judging rather than sympathizing with the victim’s pain and forever to bare scar. A scar that is reflected in her constant fear and paranoia on every little bit of sound and touches that surrounds the character. Again, agonizingly brilliant!
Everything is helmed so superbly that I couldn’t help but to feel that its subsequent second-half almost looks as a different movie altogether, and that if falls a bit into some easy didacticism that the film, until then, had magnificently avoided. When we accompanied Ann on her escape from everything and everyone who still makes her remember what happened, to find herself in a quiet town as she meets and relates to an incredibly understandable reverend Bruce Fergunson (Tod Andrews) who doesn’t resists one bit of flirting with her directly, at the same time that he proves to be a friend and tutor of advice for the young woman to overcome all this. It feels a little to on the nose and hammy from my personal perception.
Although it is still a good chunk of the film that carries scenes that match the whole theme of the film, where, just like in Not Wanted, the character succumbs to a real madness state affected by the evil that was caused to her, whether be in this case of complete paranoia and fear, that makes her commit an criminal act to defend herself, in another scene of equal terrifying agony for the Ann. But it also serves as a cry of clamor and denunciation that comes from the director herself towards the topic addressed, putting Bruce's character to literally shout in front of the symbol of justice, the judge and the accuser, while defending Ann, straight blaming society of all these problems that affect thousands of victims, at that time and still reflected on today.
Even if it falls into a bit corny territory at the end, but with a VERY strong first half, there is nothing else that Outrage is if not another great film by Lupino and certainly one of her most memorable outings.",4.5
"This could have easily been a scare pic, and it would have if just any contract male director was hired on for this. However, it was Ida Lupino who makes it feel nuanced and profound enough that it never feels like a film that uses scare tactics in order to sell the story.
The film is tactful enough that the assault scene, or leading up to the assault that is, is so nerve-wracking. Then, the film is always placed in the protagonist's corner. Mala Powers is really good in this, never plays overly neurotic or melodramatic for the camera. It feels natural.
There's a couple moments where I do believe some things would be handled in a more mature manner these days, but to have this only be the second film to handle the subject during the Hayes code era, it does an incredible job.",4.0

"Les 15-20 premières minutes tiennent du chef d'oeuvre, la mise en scène est renversante, et la scène de l'agression demeure un modèle que l'on devrait étudier: Lupino ne peut rien montrer (et de toute façon c'est rarement une bonne idée de montrer), alors elle transfère l'émotion à une scène de poursuite angoissante, qui se termine avec la caméra qui s'élève et cache l'agression par un mur et le bruit d'un klaxon continu (le son agressant contribuant à faire sentir l'oppression), jusqu'à cadrer un homme qui ferme sa fenêtre pour ne rien entendre; c'est tellement limpide et éloquent, et simple en même temps. Et oui, pour 1950, faire un film sur les conséquences psychologiques d'une agression sexuelle, c'était audacieux en maudit, mais je trouve que le film se perd un peu en cours de route, lorsque la protagoniste fuit sa maison, parce que le point de vue se déplace peu à peu vers un homme, qui a le beau rôle de la ""sauver"". Je n'en tiens pas trop rigueur, la perspective reste peu explorée même aujourd'hui, et dans le contexte de l'époque c'est déjà extraordinaire comme prémisse, et il y a encore des moments très forts, mais bon ça diminue un peu l'impact du film, même si la mise en scène demeure impeccable jusqu'à la fin.",4.0
"I’ve seen a lot of advertisements these days for films both classic and contemporary saying that the central message therein is “what the world needs right now,” or more specifically what “we” need right now: we as Americans, we as members of society, etc. As 2018 is director / co-writer Ida Lupino’s centenary, her films both in front of and behind the camera are newly being re-examined, and while Outrage is my first film of hers (as far as directing is concerned), I can tell that it’s the most startlingly relevant. 
Ann’s sexual assault throws her life into a tailspin; despite good intentions from family, friends and (surprisingly) the law, she is plunged into suffering and sees no other option but to flee everything she’s known. It’s all very sad - and while the film eventually provides some solutions and sources of hope (especially a stirring speech from a man imploring other men to understand the gravity of her situation), Outrage also starkly reminds the viewer that sexual assault isn’t rare, and perpetrators walk.

En esta película sobretodo me interesa mucho el contraste visual que genera para hablar sobre el trauma, tiene unos 30 minutos iniciales de pesadilla y encierro filmados como los dioses; después de ese punto, la película pega un giro y se abre lentamente, todo se vuelve mucho más ameno, libre y se aleja del noir y se acerca al melodrama.
Tal vez es algo obvia en algunos momentos, pero tiene una sensibilidad y corazón hermosos que me enternecieron mucho, hay una cierta ""mirada femenina"" con respecto a los géneros del cine clásico que tienen las películas de Ida Lupino que es muy peculiar, no sería la misma película si fuese dirigida por un hombre (aunque fuese igual de talentoso).
Tal vez un remake le podría hacer provecho a una historia como la de Outrage. A pesar de que no deje de ser una película fantástica.
Gracias Abogado por recomendarla.",4.5
"hard to not think of fire walk with me, with the exploration of sexual assault and the flights to surrealism/impressionism—the tapping of the office workers and the soft thud of the wrench. hard also to not think of mizoguchi, not as much for the subject matter (though that too), but for the high-angle crane shots that seem to say, ""even from this superhuman angle, where everything is in sight, there are mysteries inside each of us that you will never understand""",0.0
"A hugely important film. Ida Lupino's unflinching resolve is so portentously palpable, I can almost feel her jaw locked, eyes set and dark-edged. The taut restraint in Outrage is searingly unbearable at times, heady with a destructive formal elegance. I had to remind myself to breathe. Mala Powers is astounding; made real by her stifled sobs, glinting streaks of silver tears, her public attempts to cloak her grief by throwing up her hands to shield her face. And with the flourish of one tactile dissolve, we watch Powers evaporate into the gloom of a celluloid night. How does a woman reenter and recover her life when it appears to be over? Lupino seemed driven by large unanswerable questions in her work as a director, screenwriter, and actor. I’m unspeakably grateful to her for pursuing what can be saved and restored after women have been assaulted and diminished by men, for daring to imagine what comes next when a woman survives.",4.5
"Bold for its time but aging strangely, Ida Lupino’s picture centers on a young woman, Ann, traumatized by being raped. The word “rape” is never spoken; characters say “assaulted” with grave, knowing tones, and the meaning seems clear to all. 
Lupino was working in 1940s Hollywood melodrama mode and stages a harrowing, noirish chase scene. Before and after, she establishes the context of what we’d now call “rape culture”: men feeling free to lewdly proposition women, to touch them, to follow them, even when explicitly told to stop. One guy introduces himself to Ann and, within a minute, starts undoing her braids because he thinks she’d look better with her hair loose. Another man, knowing that she was raped, addresses her tenderly and then feels the need to put both hands on her as she, quite capably, steps onto a bus. 
The second half shifts focus, rather uncomfortably, to a Male Savior in the form of a strapping yet sensitive reverend. He voices some lovely ideas about compassion in the justice system and finding his faith through natural landscapes, and Ann’s recovery unfolds by listening to him with adoration in her eyes. It’s like tacking #NotAllMen onto the film. 
Still, the picture is solidly crafted and, in some vital ways, impressively anachronistic. Thanks to Kino Lorber for the crisp new Blu-ray release.",3.5
"ida lupino already establishing herself as a favorite between this + On Dangerous Ground. like the nick ray film she worked on, this one bounds with this unending empathy, not just in the romantic character in the second half (who ends up being platonic) but in its treatment of victims, what helps and what tears them down. teared up a few times towards the end.",4.5
"The first act feels very Langian, but eventually you realise that this film has its own form of ‘iron morality’, sustained by the absolute sincerity of the staging and the careful attention Lupino provides the performances — especially Powers, who is astonishing. There can’t have been many directors working in Hollywood in 1950 who could have managed the many shifts this four reeler undergoes (not a lot of films could make you think of both Lang and Borzage) as it passes from the abstraction of the most material horror to the realism of the most numinous faith. This also reframes the way the rape is filmed — those high angles are not just an aesthetic device but a materialist strategy, a way of showing the crime as a social issue that must be seen ‘from above’ (we think of Mizoguchi’s parallel use of the crane, as Jack’s review mentions), refusing what lesser directors would go for: the alternating perspectives of the hunter and the hunted (incidentally, exactly what the hack Spielberg relies on in his metaphorisation of violence in Jaws, as Daney pointed out). It also seems to be an important ur-text for at least two Brisseau films that are particularly special to me.",0.0
"Outrage pops the conservative Hollywood bubble with themes of rape, female oppression and PTSD and while the anti-climactic ending, in which Ann is still chained to male decisions, might ruin a few things, Outrage remains an incredibly progressive picture that showcases Ida Lupino at her best.",4.0
"Another strong central performance (Mala Powers in her debut). Another hot topic (the emotional trauma of a rape victim). Another impressive piece of direction from Ida Lupino. 
Certain sequences here are outstanding, such as the stalking of the girl before she is attacked - shot almost silently, the scene concludes with the deafening and prolonged blast of a car horn, which itself feels like a violation. Indeed Lupino’s use of sound throughout is strikingly inventive. 
If elements of the scripting and certain of the performances don’t scale similar heights, the passion and power of the project are not undermined.",3.5
"Tackling the subject matter of rape in 1950, particularly the aspect of processing trauma, is no insignificant thing. I love Ida Lupino for championing this kind of socially conscious cinema. Nevertheless, it is still 1950, so of course there has to a be a true gentleman (and minister) at the end of the dark tunnel who can love, help, and take up the cause of the victim without judgement. I kind of had to ignore the obligatory narrative choices of the second half and just watch Mala Powers navigate the mental recovery. It's a great performance, and the movie is bold for its time (when it's allowed to be).

"Ida Lupino... Wow!
Y a deux séquences dans le film qui sont des leçons de mise en scène et de montage. De véritables leçons de cinéma. Malheureusement, le film perd de sa force en cours de route. Le problème survient lorsque le personnage incarné (avec beaucoup de crédibilité) par Mala Powers, en fuite après avoir été victime d'une première aggression, se fait une ""seconde famille"". Étrangement, la protagoniste qui était au centre du récit, s'efface un peu pendant sa fuite.
Il reste que c'était un film audacieux pour l'époque et le traitement est empreint d'humanité. Bravo Ida Lupino! Les livres d'histoire du cinéma devraient parler vingt fois plus de toi et aller au-delà de The Hitch-Hiker (qui reste un maudit bon film, ceci dit).",3.5
"Despite being unable to use the word ""rape,"" Ida Lupino's directorial feature Outrage engages with the concept in a manner franker and more realistic than usual for Old Hollywood. No doubt benefitting from a female director/co-writer, the film is thoughtful and harrowing with its approach. Lupino excellently conveys the trauma surrounding sexual assault -- not only the abuse itself, but the lingering psychological effects and the pain of society's often terrible responses to the victim. The ending could be done better (Hays Code gonna Hays), but Outrage packs a wallop, especially for its time.",4.0

"El cine de Ida Lupino –al menos sus tres primeras películas, que son las que he visto− es en sí mismo un logro invaluable, la combinación soñada entre la técnica cinematográfica y la voluntad de trasladar a la pantalla la situación de la mujer en el mundo sin adornos, filtrada a través de una mirada realista y alejada de paternalismos. Resulta realmente complicado encontrar casos comparables (de creadores capaces de integrar mensajes tan contundentes en sus películas sin caer jamás en lo discursivo, conservando al mismo tiempo las más importantes virtudes de sus contemporáneos) en la época, y una búsqueda de posibles equivalentes actuales nos llevaría casi con toda probabilidad a la frustración.
Aclaro que para hablar de sus tres primeros trabajos incluyo Not Wanted, película que inicialmente escribió y que tuvo que finalizar ella misma tras el fallecimiento de Elmer Clifton, en el que sería su primer trabajo detrás de las cámaras, aproximadamente un año antes de su debut oficial con Never Fear. Más que notarse su contribución, diría que su estilo visual y narrativo se distingue con tanta claridad que es difícil imaginar a cualquier otra persona como responsable de tan extraordinario resultado, a mi parecer muy superior al de su también estimable ópera prima. Las similitudes entre ambas y la inmediatamente posterior –e inmejorable– Outrage no se reducen a sus inequívocamente vinculados puntos de partida: tres mujeres que rondan la veintena y cuyas vidas se desarrollan con perfecta normalidad –alguna dificultad más pasa la joven protagonista de Not Wanted, sin vínculos amorosos al comienzo y cuya relación con sus padres es menos plácida de lo que le gustaría; pero, en cualquier caso, nada que diste demasiado de la normalidad– se ven obligadas a la huida o a la reclusión por diferentes motivos, pero siempre como consecuencia de males endémicos de la sociedad, generalmente temas espinosos que merecían un tratamiento que sólo podía ofrecer un(a) cineasta de altura. Y, por supuesto, Ida Lupino lo era.
Las tres propuestas comparten una estructura narrativa donde se dilata hasta el extremo la parte central, en la que un hecho dramático –sea un embarazo no deseado, la aparición de una enfermedad o una violación– impide o por lo menos complica indefinidamente que sus protagonistas puedan seguir con sus vidas y completar sus planes de futuro. La primera negación de ese futuro es la imposibilidad de contraer matrimonio, pues todas las tentativas se ven truncadas por las circunstancias. En los tres casos se atisba la felicidad plena en el horizonte, hay al menos un momento en el que las cosas no podrían ir mejor, para más tarde caer hacia los infiernos. Sin embargo, Lupino posee una sensibilidad que incluso en los puntos más críticos ofrece algo de luz, un humanismo que suele proceder de los secundarios más inesperados, dibujando la sociedad como un lugar en el que el bien y el mal libran una batalla permanente, y donde afortunadamente el primero tiene muchas posibilidades de vencer. A pesar de creer en la recuperación y en la reinserción, de vaciar de nubes el horizonte y devolverlo a su estado original, el futuro forma parte del fuera de campo, piensa que no es necesario visualizarlo y sólo nos lo sugiere.
Al igual que en el cine de Nicholas Ray, las protagonistas de Ida Lupino no pueden volver a casa, se han visto obligadas a renunciar a sus hogares y (sobre)viven donde pueden o donde les toca –una en un centro de madres solteras, otra internada en un hospital de cuidados especializados, y la última en un rancho en medio de ninguna parte–. Más allá de eso, las tres primeras películas de la directora parecen prefigurar la extraordinaria On Dangerous Ground de Ray, donde intervino como actriz y también filmó algún que otro plano. Lupino, que por aquel entonces ya había superado la treintena, interpreta en ella a una mujer ciega, convertida así en la respuesta metafórica a lo vivido por las tres jóvenes de sus filmes.
Resultan llamativos los patrones visuales que comparten los tres títulos: en todos ellos los hechos clave son anticipados –cuando no directamente filmados− mediante patrones visuales –las imágenes se vuelven borrosas y aparecen recuerdos fragmentados− y sonoros –se intensifica el sonido externo y suenan voces que surgen de los recuerdos−. Llevando aún más lejos dicha repetición, Not Wanted y Outrage se estructuran de manera muy similar. Mientras la secuencia inicial de la primera sirve para introducir un flashback a través del que se narra prácticamente toda la película, el plano de apertura de la segunda, aún con los créditos iniciales, volverá a aparecer minutos más tarde, en una secuencia que por sí sola vale más que muchos largometrajes. Sobra decir que la limitación presupuestaria no supone ningún problema para la cineasta, que desde su primer trabajo demostró un personalísimo estilo visual. Un ejemplo: en Outrage, la protagonista rememora –más mental que físicamente, aunque la causa del colapso sea una situación similar− el hecho traumático y la composición visual conecta los dos momentos*.
En cuanto a Outrage, la más brillante y reveladora –a nivel formal y argumental− del trío, su realismo en la seca y estremecedora escena de la persecución y posterior violación –elegantemente omitida, como el encuentro nocturno entre la protagonista de Not Wanted y el pianista− recuerda a The Reckless Moment, la obra maestra de Max Ophüls. La verosimilitud, un término que cada vez encuentro menos interesante, deja paso a una experiencia física por su verismo: sentimos que los personajes están sufriendo en tiempo real, como si la cámara dejara de ser un mero dispositivo de filmación para convertirse en nuestros ojos. En el film de Ophüls veíamos a Joan Bennett confundirse de dirección al salir de una joyería, fruto de los nervios del momento, y esa sensación de cercanía se mantenía a lo largo de todo el metraje; por su parte, en la cinta de Lupino sucede algo similar cuando Mala Powers trata de huir de su agresor, pues pasa de entonar alegremente una canción a dudar continuamente sobre qué lugar es el mejor para esconderse. Ambas reflejan, cada una a su manera, la situación de la mujer en la sociedad patriarcal y sus consecuencias, y sus imágenes son igual de contundentes y esclarecedoras hoy que en 1949 y 1950.
*Fotogramas",4.5
"The most disturbing aspect of this is how not dated it is. Outrage's depictions of post traumatic stress and alienation may not be the most sophisticated or nuanced, but the directness of it is still more than most rape narratives told by male filmmakers today can manage. Lupino's later film, The Hitch-Hiker, is significantly more tense in its direction, but the essential elements are still here. The protagonist's hyper-sensitivity to movement established through the visual and sonic elements forces us into her perspective, rather than allowing us to exist as voyeurs. Some sequences are a little too wooden for me, an attempt at watering this down for the sake of broader appeal -- the fact that the word ""rape"" is never used is the easiest way to identify the constraints this was created in. Still, in both its thematic and cinematic elements, it's ahead of its time and still valuable today.

"""O Mundo é Culpado"" tem muitas inconsistências dramáticas, um elenco cheio de limitações e algumas ingenuidades na direção, mas pensar no pioneirismo deste filme o transforma numa obra muito maior. É o segundo filme a tocar no tabu do estupro na era do Código Hays (depois de ""Belinda""). O primeiro com este tema dirigido por uma mulher. Ida Lupino estava engatinhando como cineasta, mas revelava uma força e uma ousadia impressionantes. O filme é um estudo de personagem, que investiga o impacto do trauma da agressão sexual em plena era de direitos racionados. Talvez seja o primeiro grande filme essencialmente feminista - nenhum dos trabalhos da pioneira Dorothy Arzner havia sido tão ousado. Feminista e feminino porque consegue buscar a delicadeza para os caminhos da protagonista sem deixar de entender a dificuldade que ela terá para se entender e se aceitar. Essencial numa época de Bolsonaros.",3.0
"Remarkably (or not) this film, despite a relatively short running time acting styles that are a little dated by 21st century standards, and the black and white photography, feels quite contemporary. In a sense, we haven't caught up with it yet--in a lot of movies (including Rashomon) rape is treated as a terrible act, yes, but it's not really focused on what that means. This is a film where that's examined, where our protagonist's life falls apart after she's attacked (In a well-shot, genuinely harrowing sequence) -she ends up basically trying to leave her life, her fiance and her job behind and start anew, where she's befriended by a sort of proto-hippie reverend, but the damage she's carrying around with her is something she's still struggling with....
Mala Powers is terrific here both at communicating the damage the attack has done to her psyche and her refusal to be defined by that attack, her determination to grow and heal, even if she doesn't quite know how to do that in the second act. And there's a scene that feels remarkable for a film in 1950 (Honestly, it'd probably be remarkable for a movie now) where her Reverend friend, in a late scene in the courtroom after Powers has panicked and attacked another man who was trying to come on to her, gets a signed statement from the injured man saying it wasn't her fault, and instead indicts the community, 1950s society really, as not having done enough to help her and others like her. As a movie, it's well-crafted and watchable, as a cultural artifact, it's something more important.",3.5
"Outrage sets itself apart from other noir movies that I've seen, not just through its commentary on rape culture and how victims of rape suffer for so long after the attack, but because it was directed by a woman named Ida Lupino. There are relatively few classic movies directed by women, but it's very interesting to think what changes would have been made if those movies were directed by men. Lupino does a great job at getting you to see the world through the eyes of the main character, and you begin to share her paranoia and grief. For a 50s film, this is really smart, but through the eyes of someone living 70 years in the future, there are some glaring problems that unfortunately undermine the message of the movie. There's an over-reliance on the men of the story to save Anne, and there's a conflict of themes where the blame is placed on institutions, yet the characters look to these same systems to fix everything. The great hypocrisy of the patriarchy is that women are called queens and we're meant to put them first, but the actions of men directly go against that.",0.0

"A woman’s life falls apart when she is raped coming home from work. This was a heavy film. This is something a lot of women think about, I know I automatically imagine where and how I can be assaulted when I am at work or simply walking down the street. The portrayal of the protagonist’s mental strain is intense as well as the entirely useless reactions of men around her, particularly that of her partner. Ida Lupino really just did that",3.5
"This is light-years ahead of its contemporaries, when it comes to tackling subjects that were taboo at the time. A pinnacle in feminist cinema. Comparing this film to others from the same time period where the women were portrayed in a far different light is heartbreaking.
On a technical level, this feels very dated, but it's worth watching for the reasons above alone.",3.5
"Las películas que dirigió Ida Lupino contaron siempre con un factor de polémica que a simple vista se nota en todo lo que las rodea, todas encuadran en esa lógica de la clase B norteamericana de explorar nuevos territorios, donde los conflictos se dan de manera más pura o inmediata y jugando con el estilo de los titulares de color, con temas calientes. Como en The Bigamist (1953), Lupino juega con tabúes, y en este caso se trata de una violación, en una película donde la palabra rape no se dice ni una sola vez.
Ann (Mala Powers) es una empleada oficinista con aspiraciones de casarse, y la historia comienza en las vísperas del compromiso. Hay una cierta armonía visible en su vida como trabajadora. Logra hacerse tiempo, con algo de dificultad, para poder almorzar unos modestos sandwiches con su prometido en medio de la jornada. Al mismo tiempo, su padre parece tener una visión más liberal, pretendiendo que Ann siga formándose para convertirse en profesora y no terminar siendo ama de casa. Sin embargo, pese a esta posible tensión, las cosas se dan sin mucho conflicto. Su padre acepta el compromiso, su madre se alegra y su futuro marido parece, en apariencia, acorde a la cuestión. El conflicto llega cuando una noche, a la salida del trabajo, Ann es seguida y violada por un hombre. Es una secuencia feroz, con una persecución en las calles vacías que va agotando al personaje hasta el momento en el que ocurre el acto, y vemos la horrenda cicatriz en el cuello del violador, tal vez una figuración monstruosa de los hechos que serán elipsados.
Outrage se va a centrar entonces en las consecuencias de la violación de Ann, con una tensión oscura entre el fuera de campo y la mirada de los otros. Al mismo tiempo que Ann es sometida al juicio de la mirada de los demás (tanto hombres como mujeres), también desarrolla un terror profundo a los varones. Se darán también numerosas secuencias en las que la puesta en escena intentará amoldarse a la vulnerable subjetividad del personaje, con montajes sonoros de lo que ocurre en su cabeza. Lo particular de Outrage quizás sea que el objetivo de Lupino se acerca más a un intento de salida del trauma que a una búsqueda de justicia. Todo lo que vemos en la película parece orientado a enforcarse en las decisiones de Ann para dejar de ser infeliz. Ella huye de su hogar y de su hombre, que es incapaz de comprender la pena por la que su prometida está pasando. Comenzamos a ver subrayados los momentos en donde Ann es de alguna u otra manera manipulada o forcejeada. Cuando se niega a casarse tan prontamente (como si fuera un antídoto ineficaz), su novio la persigue y la atrapa. Ann, horrorizada, escapa.
Eventualmente llega a Santa Paula, un pueblo singular en el que parece que Bruce (Tod Andrews), el reverendo local, es uno de los referentes principales. Bruce encuentra a Ann y cuida de ella, sin saber su secreto. A lo largo de su estadía se dará una especie de juego de dobles, donde por un lado existe la figura masculina oscura y violenta asociada al violador (y desplazada luego al hombre del que huyó), y por el otro está Bruce, un tipo religioso pero carente de sus modismos, y que se comporta como un hombre más del pueblo, capaz de construir un vínculo de amistad y protección con Ann sin necesitar juzgar su pasado. En Santa Paula se da otro episodio, en donde Ann reacciona ante el avance de un hombre que intenta besarla a la fuerza. Obviamente tanto esta secuencia como el juicio al que es sometida hacen ruido en la actualidad, pero termina acentuándose aquello a lo que Outrage apunta. Cinematográficamente, lo que Lupino termina armando es una figura salvadora en el personaje de Bruce, que como hombre posee natural y trágicamente tanto fuerza como algo de atracción por Ann, pero además se presenta como un ser capaz de entender al sujeto que es ella. Como espectadores ponemos a Bruce siempre en duda. En su primera aparición vemos su brazo, obstruyendo el paso de Ann, ejerciendo autoridad. Luego la lleva a un lugar alejado, pero Ann se siente segura. Es un reverendo, pero no está vestido como uno, y su relación con la religión se destaca por su liviandad coloquial, como en todas las escenas donde jocosamente invita algunos pueblerinos a que concurran a la iglesia el próximo domingo, una iglesia que está totalmente fuera de campo, como si fuera el pueblo mismo.
En ese sentido la imagen que terminara de cristalizar a la película se dará en la despedida entre ellos dos, cuando parece que Bruce la va a besar en la boca pero lo hace en la frente. No se trata de idealizar a Bruce quitándonos de encima el conflicto femenino, sino de contemplar lo que el vínculo con Bruce implica para la perspectiva de Ann. Outrage es una película dirigida por una mujer pero absolutamente sigilosa en su construcción, porque Ann no está diseñada como una heroína empoderada, sino como una mujer ultrajada propensa a la identificación en su debilidad, cuyo vínculo con Bruce es el relato del reconocimiento de esas debilidades y la posibilidad de enfrentarlas. Lo que parece interesarle más a Lupino es poner en juego la posibilidad de amar. De alguna manera, más que crear a una mujer, lo que hace es crear a un hombre, uno en el que, aun conociendo su naturaleza, puede confiar.",5.0
"Femtember #20
It's continuously baffling me how Ida Lupino is not more well known/thought-of as a director. She made so many cool films that were unique and most of them feel far ahead of their time. Outrage is one of the earliest films ever made to tackle the psychological and emotional effects of rape. The script which Lupino also wrote keeps a tight focus on our main character and the only major flaw is the B-movie limitations and some minor acting annoyances (it could get a bit melodramatic during scenes) but the subject matter is without a doubt one that calls for these types of performances. Especially considering this was 1950.
It also strikes me how influenced by film noir Lupino's films tend to be. I've heard a lot of people designate much of her filmography as ""lady-pictures"" which would have been the accurate moniker of the time, but damn they have aged so well and remained so thematically resonant that the term almost feels derogatory now. She wasn't making terrific lady pictures, she was making terrific pictures in general.",4.0
"Ida Lupino is a god and we're all living in her world! Some of the most gorgeous shadows and black & white photography this side of Orson Welles, the first act is some of the most emotionally arresting film noir I've ever seen. Mala Powers in the lead role gives a beautiful nuanced performance; I can't believe she never made it big, because she showcases bonafide talent here.
In terms of representation for women, victims, and sexual politics this is light years ahead of even most films today (or as Mira so eloquently put it, the rest of the world is still behind), but I do have one complaint!! I recreated a scene from the script without watching it first for my directing class, and so I was super excited to see how they filmed the scene; however, after beautiful Reverend Ferguson's touching speech....HE ADDS AN ATROCIOUS ""C'MON LET ME SEE A SMILE""....ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. IT WASN'T EVEN IN THE SCRIPT!!!! The perfect amazing king Ferguson in the screenplay would never say such bullshit 😤😤😤
Anyways minor adaptation issues aside....(also there's no way in hell you can convince me that choice was Lupino's idea) this is a masterpiece of both film noir and representation for women in film, both in front of and behind the camera! I wish we could see more revisionist noir like this centered around women's stories",4.5
"فيلم من أفلام الدرجة الثانية، بيتناول موضوع شائك ( الاغتصاب) في عصر كانت السينما مقيدة بقوانين رقابية تمنعها من تناول مثل هذه الموضوعات، بالإضافة إلي أن المجتمع الأمريكي وقتها في فترة الخمسينيات كان يغض الطرف عن المسؤولية تجاه هذه الموضوعات، وأخيراً الفيلم من إخراج إمرأة إيدا لوپينو
إيدا لوبينو كانت ترى نفسها مخرجة وتبذل أقصى ما بوسعها في أي عمل يسند إليها، الكلام السابق هو وصف قالته عن نفسها، الملفت للنظر أنها لم تقل أنا امرأة مخرجة، هي شافت نفسها زي اي مخرج في وقت كان صعب وجود نساء خلف الكاميرا ويقودوا فريق عمل، ففكرة أن الفيلم يكون درجة ثانية، ده أعتقد أنه سهل حاجات كتير، يعني هو مش متوقع من هذه النوعية من الأفلام أن تكون بنفس القدر اللي بتتمتع به الأفلام من الدرجة الأولى، وكانت بتتيح للمخرج أنه يحصل على تسهيلات بإدارة عمله بكل أريحية دون تدخل متعسف من استوديو الإنتاج، وكمان اتاحت أمام ممثلة مثل لوبينو أنها تتواجد خلف الكاميرا وتقدم أعمال تظهر فيها اللمسة الأنثوية.
لما يكون فيه تحديات زي ما ذكرت، بيظهر معها مدى جودة وبراعة المخرج في إيجاد وسائل للتعبير عن موضوع الفيلم
وهنا مثلاً في الفيلم، الحادثة لم تصور، ولم تذكر كلمة اغتصاب طوال الاحداث، والبطلة لم تتحدث أبدا عن مصابها، كل ما سبق تحديات، تجاوزتها المخرجة من خلال إستخدام الصورة، هي اتبعت قاعدة بيغفل عنها مخرجين كثر، وهي
Show me, don't tell me.
قدمت الحادث بتقسيم عرضه على قسمين، مشهد مصاحب لعناوين البداية لفتاة بتهرب واضح عليها الإعياء والهلع، ثم رجعت المخرجة بالاحداث بدون ما تقول للمشاهد أن ده فلاش باك وعرضت بطلة الفيلم شابة من المدينة، بتعمل محاسبة في مصنع، على وشك الزواج.
بينتهي القسم ده بعرض ما سبق المشهد الافتتاحي، فبنشوف تربص المجرم للفتاة
ومطاردتها الي وقوع الحادث
المخرجة ظهرت احترافيتها في تنفيذ مشهد المطاردة، اعتمادها على إيقاع اللقطات التصاعدي، واستخدامات مؤثرات خاصة من الأماكن زي صوت التاكسي، استغاثة البطلة، صوت بوق السيارة اللي كان مصدر استغاثة ثم تحول الي رمز لوقوع الواقعة، مع إغراق الاماكن في الظلام والظلال، واستخدام كل ما هو متاح في المكان لتصوير أن البطلة أصبحت محاصرة بلا حول ولا قوة، مع تمثيل الممثلة اللي بتخلي المشاهد يخاف على مصيرها من براءتها وخوفها.
مقطع المطاردة يعتبر مشهد رئيسي مهم يجب التمعن في إزاي المخرجة قدمته.
من بعد هذا المشهد، بتعرض المخرجة واللي شاركت أيضا في كتابة النص السينمائى، الوصمة الإجتماعية بعد الحادث ورد فعل المجتمع والمقربين من البطلة، مع إظهار رحلة الإنهيار النفسي اللي بتتعرض له وبيؤدي الي هروبها لمكان آخر.
إذا كان القسم الأول غلب عليه الظلام، القسم الثاني كان نور وطبيعة وأماكن مفتوحة، بأشخاص جدد، ببحاولوا طمأنة البطلة، من أبرز الشخصيات وجود شخصية القسيس اللي هيمد يد العون لها، اختيار أن يكون رجل دين ظهر من خلاله وجهة النظر المحافظة للمخرجة وأن الإيمان هو السبيل الوحيد لتخطي ومواجهة الأزمات.
عشان كدا بنهاية الفيلم كان كلام رجل الدين وعظي مباشر لكنه مناسب وحاد وواضح فيه أنه بيخاطب مؤسسات المجتمع قبل المجتمع نفسه كأفراد.
الفيلم يستحق المشاهدة، عشان نشوف إزاي إمرأة في فترة الخمسينيات تمكنت من كتابة وتقديم موضوع حساس، وتحايلت بالصورة وإدارة الممثلين واختيارات الموسيقى والمونتاج، في تقديم عمل بسيط يعلق بالذاكرة.",4.0

"2K scan on Blu Ray that I've been waiting for months to see since it's been super low in stock. Donating it to the video store since we don't even have a regular DVD of Outrage. After watching the film, that's especially unfortunate, because it quietly rules much the way of Bigamist but also has a LOT more to say, and it's extremely well directed.
The chase scene is Bava level horrific, and the noir lighting is especially chilling. A very clear statement about cat-calling is in there but it's also masterful in its minimalism. Of course Ida Lupino figured out how to do that.
I don't want to give much away so I'll just illustrate how the direction is exemplary. Mala Powers' head after the attack is behind the bars of the bed's headboard, body blanketted but exposed. The mother is leaning over her and is behind the bars as well, unable to know what to do. Perhaps to say she survived as well. Ann sees her parents talking about her and that's the first time she has to ""put on a smile"". The entire town knows about the attack like some kind of nightmare. The office scene is incredibly authentic while Hitchcock-level dramatized. And then the line up scene, and then and then... Just a masterclass in explaining the complicated aftermath of a r*pe.
Amazing shot later on in the film with dancers twirling, Ann slowly encircling them at the outermost edges, looking at them like joy is a foreign object now. The camera swims through the dancers to meet Ann on the other end. It sharply cuts to her exact perspective, then back from dancers onto her. A moment of simple genius, honestly.",4.5

Impressively ahead of its time in its portrayal of rape, PTSD and the way that society reacts to sexual crimes and the victims of such crimes, Ida Lupino's powerful Outrage treats what happens to its protagonist Ann in a sensitive, empathetic way, whilst at the same time hinting at a deep well of anger beneath the surface. Despite the over the top title, which implies some sort of revenge story, Outrage is in fact more driven by character than by narrative, striving to keep Ann and the psychological and physical trauma she suffers as the primary focus.
In some respects, Outrage feels fresh even when viewed today, in the way it critiques the responses of the police to rape as well as the varied responses of Ann's family, friends, fiancee and co-workers, some of whom are sympathetic, and some of whom most certainly are not. It is also brilliantly directed by Lupino, who shoots the rape scene itself with reference to the asthetics of a noir film, whilst maintaining tension in a way equal to Hitchcock or Lang; meanwhile a later scene where Ann tries unsuccessfully to return to work uses subjective point of view shots and manipulation of the sound mixing to great effect, reminding me of Hitchcock's classic early sound film Blackmail. Even as the film becomes more conventional in its second half (with Lupino basically doing a hard reset and relocating Ann to a random small town, which consequently removes some of the film's edge and sense of anger) and then surrenders to excessive melodrama in the last few minutes, Lupino still directs with style and grace, and the power of the first half in particular make quite an impression.
Of course, in some respects the film does bow to 1950s social mores and censorship pressures. The word ""rape"" is never used (everyone just refers to what happened to Ann as a ""criminal assault"", although to be fair at no point is there an attempt to downplay the seriousness of the situation), and the film's determination that Ann is suffering from ""insanity"" is well-intentioned but feels rather out of date now, as does the somewhat paternalistic and agency-removing conclusion whereby the nice helpful men step in to resolve Ann's problems. Furthermore, an incident toward the end of the film would very clearly be treated as a sexual assault today, however this seems to be minimized and even excused by the characters (if memory serves I think Ann even ends up apologizing to him). However considering the time period it is astonishing that this film was made at all, and many if not all of its issues can be explained by reference to the severe restrictions imposed on films portraying controversial subjects by the Production Code.
As one of the only female directors working during the Golden Age of Hollywood, Ida Lupino's work is of huge historical importance, and films like this (and also The Bigamist, which I loved) make clear that she was an immensely talented director, easily the equal to her contemporaries even whilst working with comparatively small budgets. I hope to watch more of her films soon.",4.0

It's not only an incredible achievement that a woman director (Ida Lupino) was able to work in the studio system at all, but getting to make a movie that centers on sexual assault while the Hays Code was in place is astounding.
I think what this movie is so effective at is placing the audience in Ann's shoes.

Lupino helps paint a bigger picture on several aspects in society that can feed into rape culture, toxic masculinity and victim blaming.",4.0

Sobre Outrage voy a decir que se agradece mucho que la escena de violación no se mostrara prácticamente pero que la directora hiciera tanto hincapié en el terror de la muchacha huyendo de su atacante, el peso del miedo que la deja paralizada y cómo reacciona después. Me sorprendió un montón el enfoque psicológico de la peli, el hecho de que el ""salvador"" de Ann entendiera su inocencia y pusiera el trauma en su defensa. Pero todo lo del salvador me hizo un poco de ruido, se agradece que no fuera un hombre choto pero igual entabla una relación un tanto condescendiente con ella.

"TW: rape, sexual assault, trauma
In the Hays Code era filmmakers were constantly withheld from making the art they wanted to. One of these limitations was that you couldn’t make films about rape. You couldn’t depict it, you couldn’t even say it. “Rape” was a four letter word as far as Hollywood was concerned. Ida Lupino in all of her brilliance, however, decided to use this censorship to her advantage as a storyteller. How do you make a movie about rape, without it being in the movie at all? The final product is one of the greatest films about trauma ever made. 
From the opening moment, violence is present. A mug slides into frame, penetrating the peaceful countertop, and then Ann, our main character, is harassed by the diner worker. What feels like a small passing annoyance is really a nod to the audience about what this film is about — a woman struggling to feel safe again. Even though this moment happens before the rape scene, it shows that the world men perpetuate for women is one of a constant balance between safety and fear. 
I could talk about so much of this work: how Lupino expresses through sound and movement the internal experience of a panic attack, the conscious efforts to keep the identity of the rapist a mystery to the audience as well so that every interaction with a man afterwards is as uncertain for us as it is for Ann, or the brilliant direction in the scene of violence itself, etc. But the most impressive element of the film, and what makes it a true masterpiece, are the restrictions that keep it from being a different work. Namely, the censorship of its core content. By embracing the inability to even have the words “rape” or “sexual assault” in the script, Lupino critiques society’s ludicrous dedication to keeping things hidden. Under the rug. “The neighbors don’t need to know.” This mentality is prevalent throughout, under a sharp but subtle critical eye from Lupino. The film itself feels scared of itself — as if it couldn’t utter the dreaded word even if it tried. 
I highly recommend Lupino’s work to anyone, especially if you’re trying to see more female directed films that don’t get highlighted often. Having seen three so far, this is undoubtedly her best, but The Hitchhiker is a close second.",5.0
"To even begin to capture how remarkable this film is to me might be a bit rough, I have so many emotions swirling through me right now. I have put off watching this film for quite sometime, it is definitely a heavy subject matter that I instantly connected to when even just reading about the film. In reading about it I thought I pretty much knew the ins and outs of this film, but I truly was not ready for the impact this instantaneously had on me. How much I could feel myself grasping onto Ann and her every emotion.
First off, I don't think Mala Powers is given the credit she is due when it comes to taking on this captivating role. You can see just how much she put into it and that couldn't have been easy. I'm glad she had someone like Ida Lupino to guide her through this. From the moment Powers appears on screen as this happy, carefree girl I almost burst into tears, knowing this will be stripped away from her. You see her easily shrug off advances from men that mean nothing to her and be completely enveloped with the man she is in love with. Lupino in this way captures what it is like to be a woman living in the world, she knew it herself so fully and harshly, when it comes to the audacity of men and their incessant need to catcall and be pushy toward women. That was a very powerful sentiment to be seen. It is so normalized in films of this era that it takes on such a direct quality of saying this isn't normal. Women should not be treated this way.
The part that was hard to watch was the lead up to Ann's rape. Her happiness takes on an eeriness, this will only be the ghost of who she once was. Then when she is being followed home was probably one of the most chilling and suspenseful scenes I have ever experienced. I think a lot is done to take care of the audience in not showing the actual assault, I'm sure the hays code also had a lot to do with that, but I also like to believe it is a way to save any viewer from experiencing anymore unwanted trauma. I have watched many movies that have involved rape and explicitly showing it has only ever done me more harm than good, and maybe that is just me, but I am thankful for the way this was carefully shot and set up.
Instantly Ann is alone in her pain and suffering, she feels like a sort of pariah in her own town, even in her own home. She tries so hard to put on a brave face and continue on with life, but while at work she experiences a panic attack, which is a scene so poignantly done. Unwanted hands trying to console, little sounds amplifying to an unnerving degree...once again Lupino has created something so true to life, in a way that I myself have had this exact experience when facing a panic attack.
Everything is forever different and tainted for Ann now. She can't go on trying to be normal. In an attempt to numb her pain she runs away from home. To have a life of just going through the motions and thinking as little as possible of what has happened to her. In running away she meets a reverend, played by Tod Andrews, who shows her she is not alone and in the most extraordinary way Lupino connects rape survivors with PTSD. It is clear, in a way that it is pretty much explicitly said, that Ann is suffering from PTSD. Which in a world where rape culture is super prevalent and that is something that most people have just recently connected to rape survivors, to see this in a movie from the 1950's just out right saying it took me aback for a moment.
Outrage is so aptly named, you have to watch it to feel why it so fitting, but I think most importantly the true message of this picture was to give women a voice, or to at least show them they weren't alone, in a world where this wasn't being discussed at all, it was real and it was happening. You are never alone, I think that is so so important to know. As cliché and lame as that sounds it helps more than most know. The world can swallow you into darkness so quickly and you have to begin to relearn everything and be willing to open yourself up again to heal, and that will always be the most difficult part, but it is possible to reconnect yourself back to some sort of peace.
I know Ida herself didn't see what she had done was of any importance, she was just making something meaningful to herself, she was doing the things she wanted to do, but I thank her every day for the legacy she left behind, even if she is still trying to fight to be known, it is slowly coming to be and the more who discover her films the more I hope they feel how special they really are and celebrate them.",5.0
"This went on the list a few months ago, when I began compiling recommended noir titles, though I would argue that this isn't exactly film noir. I had been trying to track it down lately to no avail (despite both of my local library systems having well-stocked classic film sections), but when I searched YouTube looking for a trailer, I was delighted to see that someone had uploaded a transfer from TCM in its entirety, and the quality was quite good to boot. Honestly, if it wasn't for the awkward stumble at the end, this would be a certified classic. But even without that status, Outrage (and Ida Lupino) deserves massive credit for being one of the first films to deal with rape, victim blaming, toxic masculinity and the sheer trauma of sexual assault, even if the Hays Code forced them to tiptoe around the word RAPE.
Yes, rape is an ugly word. But it describes quite possibly the worst thing you can do to another person, so its nature is much uglier than the word rape itself. It makes people so uncomfortable they dress it up in euphemism, hoping to shield themselves as best they can. But we need to confront RAPE and stop pretending it doesn't exist, because frankly it's the fucking least we can do. And Ida Lupino knows that, despite the restrictions placed on her film.
Marla Powers plays Ann, who is engaged to Jim (Robert Clarke) and tells her parents the news at the film's outset. But shortly after sharing her wonderful development, she is followed after a late night at work by a man who clearly means her harm. He has hit on her earlier and wasn't pleased with her disinterest, so he takes it upon himself to get what he wants by any means necessary. It's a harrowing chase scene, ruthlessly tense and well-shot, making us squirm before the man even gets near Ann. And because of its era, the shot dissolves after Ann hits her head and passes out, resuming as she limps home, a horrified shell of trauma.
We may expect, especially given the movie's (errant) ""noir"" classification, that the remaining minutes will be spent finding and arresting this monster. But Lupino wisely chooses to focus on the woman in the story, because the man is irrelevant. It's about his actions, and how they ruin Ann's life, confidence and sense of safety. We watch as Ann struggles to get out of bed and eventually leave the house, her inner peace shattered as she gives in to paranoia and PTSD. Everyone is watching her, staring, silently blaming her or asking how she put herself in such a situation. The slightest surprising sounds are jarring and terrifying. She has nothing left to cling to except for that singular, calamitous moment.
Powers does a great job in a heartbreaking role, and is never less than fully committed, believable and sympathetic. She helps us forget about wanting justice, because all we want is for Ann to be functional, so she can eventually find peace and healing. When she leaves town suddenly and meets a reverend named Bruce (Tod Andrews), she is able to at least begin building something new in a new place. And for a while, things are nice, until her trauma triggers a violent outburst that lands her in court. Though a tad melodramatic, I liked the court scene and thought it served the story well, but the way Ann's arc ends questions her ability to so much as make her own decisions anymore, which cuts her legs out from under her just as she is beginning to stand on her own again. Outside of that decision (which, I suspect, was forced on Lupino by a male studio executive in what would be a disgusting act of irony), Outrage makes a definitive and bold statement in a time when movies about rape were virtually unheard of.
This is brave filmmaking that deserves to be applauded and more widely seen and recognized for its risk taking and vision. Ida Lupino is someone I need to invest more of my time in, clearly.",4.0

Nobody uses the word rape -- instead, the protagonist is said to be the victim of ""a criminal assault"" -- but its after-effects are still felt most acutely. At times, this even plays like a psychological horror film, which surely was co-writer/director Lupino's intent. Considering the talent she showed for it, it's no surprise that she would return to similar territory three years later with The Hitch-Hiker.

"Outrage is a B-movie with distinct limitations that come with such a production, but it's also striking how Lupino embraces these same limitations as an act of defiance—the word rape is never used, simply because it wouldn't have been allowed by the censors, but it also indignantly mirrors the way Ann can't articulate her traumatic experience to others and becomes trapped in a psychological prison to which only she has the key, society then as it sadly still is today, unable to comprehend such a despairing abyss or enact a suitable reaction to it.
It joins a run of several message pictures that Lupino made at the time, touching defiantly on topics that Hollywood wouldn't go anywhere near, each of them told from a uniquely feminine perspective and what she achieved here is simply decades ahead of its time in depicting not just rape but the entire culture that comes with it—the total lack of protection that society offers women, victim shaming, the inability to bring those responsible to justice and the systematic normalisation of violence towards women, which Lupino conveys here with subtlety—every interaction Ann has is tinged with malicious intent, even if just intended as consensual courtship.
The story itself may be basic but the rape sequence itself is a work of noirish brilliance, a nightmarish pursuit through an abstractly empty, entirely male landscape that offers no escape and though nothing graphic could be shown, the way Lupino obscures the final moment is chilling enough. As one of the very first films to actually tackle the subject, you can see how this would have been the Irreversible of its time—confrontational, divisive and unavoidably provoking a conversation.

"Considered to be one of the first Hollywood films (or films, for that matter) dealing with the tragically ever-relevant issue of sexual assault, Outrage is a fantastic little B-film. What's more noteworthy is not just the subject matter, but also (and this is what has made the film age so well) that it is directed by a woman: the trailblazing director of Ida Lupino.
Outrage is a work of rare empathy, maturity, and feminine centrality in a time and grade of film where such a subject matter would have usually been played for spectacle (which is unfortunately what the poster does). Although some aspects of the dialogue may be a little overly didactic, explanatory, or theatrical for an internal subject matter, and the film does feel a little too cheap or dramatic (mostly through the music) for realism to be consistently achieved, the script offsets many of these issues with affording a great deal of room for implication and for detailed glimpses into Ann's psyche, who is played with immense pathos by Mala Powers in the only real standout performance of the film (expressing both scars and rebellious confidence). It also moves in many surprising and refreshing directions (bucking cliches at every turn) for such a film and ends on a very moving exchange. Like Edward G Ulmer's Detour, this is also a film that does use its budgetary limitations to its advantage at some points, using the reduced number of extras to create an alienating quality and to transform the tastefully executed assault sequence into an immersive experience for many women being stalked or harassed where our protagonist and her pursuer seem to be the only people in the entire world.
The real strength here though is Lupino's excellent direction, which is some of the most expressive I've seen from a Hollywood film of this era and which makes a mockery of most of her male counterparts' desiccated, vococentric delivery from the time (only Hitchcock and Welles are the other two directors from this time I can think of with such a European sensibility to her direction and editing decisions). Some of the nightmare sequences here (where words desynchronise with mouths or repetitive sounds drum louder and louder) or the beautiful shots of Ann standing against nature (a particular shot where her windswept hair against a forlorn highway tree line makes her appear as a lost object is particularly fantastic) wouldn't feel out of place in many of the more adventurous and experimental European arthouse.",4.0

Recently engaged Ann Walton, leaving work late one night is chased down and raped by a man who she knows in passing but who she doesn't recognise in the dark.
So when the police get involved she can only give the vaguest of descriptions , has to go through the trauma of a face to face line-up and believes that everyone in her neighbourhood is judging her, so that eventually she simply runs away from her home and her family, although she'll never be able to leave that experience behind.
This being 1950 the word rape is never used, instead she's been 'attacked' and of course the assault itself is only implied, director Ida Lupino does what Hitchcock would do 22 years later in Frenzy and backs the camera away and in this case around a corner, but leaves us in no doubt as to what is happening.
Up to the point where Ann impulsively takes a bus to California the film is about her, and the community's, reaction to her assault, she believes, and it seems to be the case, that everyone is whispering about her, as if she herself has done something wrong, and that the only thing that's going to make that sense go away is when the man is caught and convicted, only she's unable to do anything to help the police, so the only thing to do is to escape.
After that the film takes a different tack as she's taken in by a family and given a job, all at the behest of the man who rescues her from the side of a road. He turns out to be a preacher, although you'd never know it, he doesn't look like one, doesn't dress like one, doesn't act like one, and we never get to see him in his church.
Essentially Ann is saved, and the fact that it has to be a man of the cloth who does it is a bit of an issue for me, particularly since the film goes out of it's way to make him as little like a regular preacher as possible. In effect, he is a Christ-like figure, her saviour. It bugs me, but maybe that's just my prejudice.

"LUPINO (3/9)
“You know, I believe in miracles.”
Always awestruck anew by this woman of few images. For what more is there to be said with images that do as much, affect as much, love as much, damn as much as these? First glance suggests only a novice visual language of A-B-C-D-E’s: establish, master, single, single, two shot, closeup, transition, ad infinitum. Second’s a levee break, revealing a filmmaker equipped with all 26 letters, intimately aware of their many possible arrangements, potential patterns, consciously choosing the focused, fatless route over the fractal’d. Hers is a primal minimalism that mirrors and brings us vis-a-vis (oft literally with her anti-ambiguous blocking) the primal matter of men and women’s every interaction, small, big, insignificant, life altering. The latter is the lifeblood of this picture.
The Lupino M.O. of framing every interaction between a man and a woman as a confrontation, innately, in the making, around the corner, is here. Hitchcock did the same; there, it was morbid curiosities materializing. Minnelli: the unstable co-existence of male and female dreams, their respective dull realities in combat. In Land O’ Lupino, it’s all on the defense. It’s a constant dance to secure one’s honor and sense of identity. Every moment is an attack. Fittingly, sadly, Outrage opens here.
Lupino’s scenes and sequences are always visual games, usually two player, where the participants fight for control of the frame*. As such, she immediately launches us into the rules of her latest: when will Ann return to the center of the frame in confidence? Outrage opens with her on the run, fleeing from frame edge to frame edge, avoiding the center, building to her assault visually portrayed as her being pushed out of the frame entirely, visually portraying the stripping of her autonomy and liberty as a denial of her being given frame (read: voice, say in her worth) at all. The following 70 minutes are her return to the center, be it through fantastical triumph (emphasis on fantasy**) or the indifferent accumulation of time between. Indeed, before the film stumbles and itself never recovers (thanks be to the Code), Lupino treats us to a career-best tracking shot, filled with great tenderness, synthesizing Ann’s odyssey by watching her lift herself up from the periphery (of the frame, literally) and return to the center with new beginnings of assuredness. There’s even a nice little symbol of an older, serene woman beside her and a blossoming tree behind her; maybe a multifaceted picture of her before, her now, her to come; maybe not; lovely, lovely, lovely nevertheless
*In Not Wanted, the bulk of every scene is a clean, unbroken single for one character and a clean, unbroken single for another. Based on the dialogue, blocking, and power dynamics, one character will eventually leave their single by exiting their frame and re-entering the other person’s, the victor’s single, where the victor, either a man or an internally misogynistic woman, commands the body language of the submissive partner ‘til scene end. The game resets accordingly. (Hard, Fast, and Beautiful has the same visual endeavor of winners and losers based on blocking, but the name of the game is who literally stands tall in two shots versus dueling singles that aim to absorb the other’s agency.)
**The false ring of the last 10 suggest studio tampering as do Never Fear’s. They outright contradict the rest of the film’s argument and their respective characters’ arcs, framing these women’s returns to a place of self-love-respect-confidence as dependent upon being in a relationship with a man (which, regardless of sentiment, in both instances, play purely unwarranted, without set up, like intellectual censorship).",3.0
"Interessante ter um filme tocando em tal temática num viez de preocupação com o estado da mulher pós-trauma - interpretado com maestria pela Mala Powers - já nessa época.
Todo o suspense é muito bem construído e certos comportamentos/pensamentos secundários coniventes com o tempo em que vivia a sociedade representada. Ainda assim, gera um certo incômodo por vezes ao 'romantizar' um pouco demais a relação entre o reverendo e a protagonista, e permitir que homens roubem o protagonismo/fala mesmo quando não necessário (por exemplo, até no momento final do filme a Ann ainda aparece na posição de vítima total incapaz de decinir o melhor para si por conta própria, mesmo quando o faz suas palavras soam mais como uma repetição do que lhe foi dito do que algo intrínseco dela). O mais triste é saber que toda a sensação que o telespectador recebe de fuga/medo constante principalmente com relação aos homens ao redor pela personagem, nada mais é do que a realidade cotidiana das mulheres até hoje.

"Unless there is someone that I am not aware of, Ida Lupino was only the second ever woman to work as a director in the Hollywood studio system, and the only female director working there between Dorothy Arzner's retirement in 1943 and Elaine May's debut feature in 1971. Which is, quite frankly, insane.
And a film like Outrage is a perfect example of why voices of women matter, and what kind of film we were missing for so many years. Outrage is a film about a woman who has been raped by a stranger, and suffers from the trauma afterwards. It's not a film about revenge, or even about justice being done, but a film about a woman whose life has been shattered, and who is trying to escape from that to cope. And it is told by a woman, adopts a woman's perspective, and feels so much more real than anything a man could have done.
Well, at least for the first two thirds of the film, as even Ida Lupino had to make films that the studio would approve and release, so the ending is, let's say, rather conventional and even preachy. But still, as a whole, Outrage is dealing with themes that you wouldn't expect a film made under the Hays Code to go near, and I am glad Lupino was there to tackle them.

"the aftermath of a SA/rape is often worse than the actual act. the perpetrator can go on and probably never remember your name but you don’t forget. even if you didn’t see them you still see them everywhere. you hear them everywhere. you feel them everywhere. you notice things too much now, the look in people’s eyes with this morbid and disgusting pity, the way people touch you feels like ice and lava at the same time. you constantly feel on edge and sometimes even when you’re doing something to protect yourself (as everyone claims you should’ve done in the first place) you still find yourself in bad situation where you have to pretend everything is okay or exploit your trauma for some sort of understanding and freedom. 
i tend to avoid movies that deal with rape because it’s often extremely triggering since people think showing graphic and oddly fetishistic scenes is the way to go when victims have said TIME AND TIME again that NO ITS NOT. but i really appreciate this movie, not only does it not have a graphic scene (probably due to the era it came out tbf) but it captures the aftermath so well. you don’t always become some badass killing machine or stone cold fox, sometimes you’re just…hollow and scared. while everything goes on around you, you’re just there.

"""As histórias preferidas de Ida Lupino contam todas a lenta cicatrização de uma ferida. Ferida física tanto quanto moral. Suas personagens, que sua femininidade, seu caráter ou as circunstâncias transformaram em chagas vivas, necessitam da serenidade, não como um luxo, mas como um remédio indispensável a sua sobrevida. Essa busca vital da serenidade e da luz é a substância e a razão de ser dos filmes de Ida Lupino.""
— Jacques Lourcelles",4.5
"A opressão sofrida por Ann é notável desde o início do filme, quando o estuprador a elogia, ultrapassando os limites do balcão, fazendo-a afastar-se um pouco assustada. Essa situação é potencializada pela cena em que o crime acontece. Ida Lupino aproveita-se do espaço cujos depósitos parecem estar na iminência de tornar-se poeira; da iluminação, aumentando as sombras, e do som diegético – ambas opções que lembram M, O Vampiro de Dusseldorf – para construir a tensão.
A utilização do som, aliás, é formidável por levar o espectador a não apenas observar sua protagonista, na posição de passividade, mas também a entrar na subjetividade dela, o que torna o filme ainda mais louvável quando pensamos no ano e nas circunstâncias em que foi realizado. Lupino utiliza-se, ainda, do contra-plongée e plongée quando Ann fala com todos aqueles homens que, mesmo quando a ajudam, não deixam se mostrar-se mais importantes que ela.
Os olhares, ainda que vistos apenas uma vez, tornam-se presentes em todas as outras cenas; os carimbos, unhas, passos continuam reverberando na mente de Ann, mas também na de quem assiste. Ainda que sua segunda metade não seja tão impecável em visual e narrativa quanto a primeira, O Mundo é o Culpado mostra que nos mais de setenta anos que separa seu lançamento de nós, muitas discussões parecem permanecer as mesmas, infelizmente.",0.0
"The question of how human beings respond to a world that no longer embraces them, recognizes their plight, and/or is revealed to be much less inclusive than once believed is a trope that galvanizes artists because it re-aligns and often destroys what us as spectators are acclimated to.
Visually and especially aurally, Ida Lupino's OUTRAGE is a difficult but necessary work because it is concerned with how a victim of sexual violence is minimized. This occurs both at work, where she is rubber-stamped out of her mind and existence, and later, when her sanity is questioned after thwarting a second assault. When the victimized demonstrates a capacity and willingness to defend herself, she becomes a threat who needs to be punished and isolated. In another powerful scene, she must view a gallery of suspected assailants, their faces overlapped with the law's mandate to expedite her thinking and match what she sees to what she cannot mentally recall; it's a powerful reminder of how rape is viewed by the American legal system as an inconvenience.
Lupino's film straddles noir, melodrama, psychodrama (and even hints at social realism, as in a brief scene among orange farm packers), in order to circumvent some of the effects of Production Code-era censorship, but only has one overt message, which is for mental healthcare to be treated as a fundamental right. This communique, enhanced by the disorientation, anger, and despair we feel when watching it, makes it an essential work.",5.0
"Um dos primeiros testamentos sobre os efeitos do estupro, em plena década de 1950, aí da sob padrões de formatos cinematográficos - ainda assim, temos um trabalho contundente e que exibe as marcas de tal atrocidade. A direção de Ida Lupino nos aproxima, primeiramente, do universo profissional e cotidiano da protagonista: uma defesa de Mala Powers bastante imponente em cena. 
É a mulher que, ao retornar do trabalho pra casa, é vitimada pelo ataque que fragmenta sua vida. Após sofrer o estupro - em uma sequência bem organizada em termos de cena e tensão, ainda que não tão explícita -, a personagem tenta mudar a identidade e se reconstruir em outro ambiente. 
É por isso que você cria uma filha? É pra isso que se sacrifica para cuidar?. O protesto da fala do pai, é o mesmo que o nosso que se depara com tal condição. A fragilidade, a dor e a dificuldade de se adaptar após o atentado, são pontos colocados na projeção de um roteiro que estabelece a vitimização da protagonista. 
Lupino cria de forma tensa os efeitos psicólogos, através de cenas emblemáticas - como quando a personagem chega no trabalho e observa o colega carimbando o papel. Os sons das batidas do carimbo parecem desatinar a mulher, como um pesadelo. Um turbilhão de sons em eco que exibem o desconforto do mental de alguém que sofreu, sem direito a reajuste. A dramatização do filme encontra um foco de reflexão ainda atual, mesmo formatado numa narrativa daquela época.",4.0

"Il mio viaggio alla scoperta di Ida Lupino inizia da Outrage, uno dei primi film di Hollywood a trattare esplicitamente il tema della violenza sessuale, sebbene non sia mai pronunciata la parola ""stupro"" a causa della censura. In qualche modo, Outrage parla proprio di questo: della difficoltà di elaborare il trauma in una società che priva le vittime di violenza sessuale della loro voce, dove parlare apertamente di questi temi è considerato un tabù. La famiglia di Ann Walton vorrebbe che la ragazza si lasciasse tutto alle spalle per continuare la vita di sempre e sposarsi con Jim. Nessuno ascolta davvero Ann, nessuno le chiede cosa vuole e di cosa ha bisogno. Il film è, naturalmente, figlio del proprio tempo, soprattutto nella conclusione oggi estremamente problematica, ma Lupino dimostra spirito critico e lungimiranza nell'inquadrare alcune questioni cruciali del dibattito sociale. In caso foste interessanti a leggere qualcosa di più articolato su un film tanto complesso e sulla figura di Lupino, consiglio questo bell'articolo di Alexandra Heller-Nicholas: www.sensesofcinema.com/2018/cteq/outrage-1950-ida-lupinos-vision-of-rape-trauma/",0.0

ps. cine de mujeres, tan sensible ;(",3.5
"Like all of Lupino's films, ""Outrage"" is a fascinating (and frustrating) blend of conventionalism and progressivism that is beautifully made.
The first half of this film is a sensitive portrayal of a victim of sexual assault and her ostracization from a society so conservative it can't even say the word ""rape."" The men around her seem to make her attack about themselves; her father complaining about how his students ""stare"" at him without noticing the piercing looks his daughter is getting. Men are always touching or getting close to Mala Powers, feeling entitled to her body even when misguidedly trying to comfort or soothe her. I absolutely love the almost two minute long tracking shot of Mala pacing around the outskirts of a dance festival: she is clearly so yearning to partake, but her isolation and fear prevent her from doing so.
The film's final act, however, is maddening to audiences of today. Mala is sexually assaulted again at this party, in a terrifying scene making expert use of Lupino's trademark of subjective sound editing and perspective. It's impossible not to identify strongly with Mala in this scene, and when she finally grabs that wrench and clobbers her attacker its a genuinely cheer-worthy moment.
Only the film doesn't treat it this way. She is put on trial for this ""attack"" and is forced to be defended by another man who makes the point that because of her initial sexual assault she has become mentally unhinged and her use of the wrench to defend herself merely came out of a moment of mental weakness. There is an assumption that even in a clear case of attempted rape, a woman should never use violence to defend herself. It is absolutely MADDENING to watch, especially since it is clear we are supposed to agree with this perspective and support her advocate in his valiant ""defense"" of her. He even says her attacker is a ""a great guy"" who meant her ""no harm."" How the fuck does he know that? He wasn't there!
Still, the film is one of a handful at this point in film history to actually explore this topic, and aside from the final act it is a sensitive and beautiful portrayal of a woman coming to terms with and healing from her trauma. Lupino's visual style also really cemented itself for me here, with her creative compositions of the banisters, trellises, and windows of conventional domestic spaces taking on menace to the women trapped within.
Beautiful, frustrating, complicated. Well worth anyone's time.",3.5

"The third film from actress-turned-director Ida Lupino is one of her best, beginning as what seems like another charming romantic drama before taking a hard, scary turn when her heroine (Mala Powers) is raped. The rapidity of that gear-shift is part of the picture’s genius—the casual threat escalates with lightning-fast intensity, just as such things do in real life. It’s a truly terrifying sequence that never crosses the line into exploitation (this is an early example of the value of the female voice and gaze), and Lupino is equally vivid in her dramatization of the aftermath: infantilization, quiet judgement, lack of compassion, and similar harrowing horrors.",4.0

RAVING REVIEW: Prepare to embark on a cinematic adventure unlike any other, as Ida Lupino's OUTRAGE takes you on an extraordinary expedition into the seldom-explored realms of Hollywood storytelling. A powerful piece of cinema that promises to provoke thought and reshape your understanding of the film.
The tale unfolds around Anne Walton, brilliantly portrayed by Mala Powers, whose life unravels after an appalling assault by a stranger. Unlike other films that might focus on the sensationalism of the crime, OUTRAGE plunges into the raw emotional journey that follows. Anne's torment is depicted with such gritty honesty that it strikes an unsettling yet profoundly enlightening chord.
What sets OUTRAGE apart from other films of its time is the subject matter and how it's handled. Lupino's direction crafts Anne as a character of resilience, not just a helpless victim, as we witness her transformation, struggle to heal, and pursuit of individuality. This story isn't a mere plotline; it's an insightful study of human resilience and a universal recovery journey.
Lupino's directorial prowess extends beyond the plot, giving us a visual experience that adds layers of complexity to the story. She transforms OUTRAGE into a visually stunning piece using creative camera angles, atmospheric noir styling, and meticulous attention to detail. It's a film that matches the depth of dialogue with the visuals on screen.
The supporting cast, including Anne's fiancé Jim Owens (Robert Clarke) and the pastor Paul Ferguson (Tod Andrews), deserve mention for their powerful performances. Their multifaceted performances paint a realistic portrayal of the confusion and sympathy surrounding trauma, adding authenticity to the plot. The choice of lesser-known actors of the time only heightens the film's credibility, making it more relatable to the everyday viewer.
Any imperfections aside, OUTRAGE's place in cinematic history is sealed. Recognized by the Library of Congress in 2020, its significance endures. One of the rare gems directed by a woman in a male-dominated industry, Lupino's bold creativity has left footprints for future filmmakers.
Despite a rocky financial performance, with a budget of $250,000 that put Lupino's independent studio, The Filmmakers, to the test, OUTRAGE's artistic triumph remains undimmed. Sometimes, the path less traveled brings unexpected challenges, but the destination makes it all worth the journey.
OUTRAGE is a film for everyone, not just cinema buffs. It's a bold exploration of themes that echo across generations, an artistic endeavor transcending time and trends. Its imperfections are overshadowed by its powerful narrative, exceptional performances, and innovative direction.

"i honestly think on one level i'm more willing to forgive the 'rape as manifestation of neurosis' reading this time, if only because it unexpectedly ends up as somewhat of a critique of the prison system, which punishes violence without resolving its root cause. but it's still frustrating that a film which gets so close to an awareness of rape as an extreme form of the constant violation of women's boundaries inherent in a society that doesn't value their desires (the number of men who touch ann without her consent even BEFORE the guy she assaults takes it further) ultimately shunts all of that off onto a societal other, an outcast, someone 'we' are responsible for but who cannot be found among 'us'. is the men taking charge in a legal case at the end yet another manifestation of the way that patriarchal society ignores women's voices, whether that's to assault them or 'protect' them? how much does outrage want us to question that? i think for all its flaws this film fascinates me in its attempts to work through the issue it sets out to deal with, even if the solution may end up being too simplistic.",4.5
"Ida Lupino is definitely known for being an early pioneer in women directed cinema. On top of that she was also ahead of her time in some of the subject matter she tackled early on. 
Outrage is a feat in its self for centering an entire film around a rape. The build up to it is quite nerve racking and unsettling.
The word is never mentioned and attack or assault is always mentioned. It’s crazy to see how she is treated afterwards and how she navigates the situation following. Mala Powers does a lot of great emotional acting here. It’s sad to see the way men treat the situation but flash forward over 70 years later and there are still similarities. 
Also did they seriously not have any divide or concealment between a victim and criminals in a lineup back then? That blew my mind.",3.0
"A woman's life seems to be going perfectly. She's got a job she enjoys, a boyfriend she's excited to take the next steps with. A bright future opens before her, and then... everything changes.
Outrage never uses the word ""rape."" In 1950, under the iron fist of the Hays Code, when ""good taste"" was the aim and vulgarity was taboo, it wasn't allowed to. So instead, what happens to Ann is simply called ""a violent assault."" But the film makes it pretty clear what happens to her, and it doesn't really pull back from showing the profound impact the rape has on the life of its protagonist. She is shaken, terrified... ashamed. The film can't mention the word rape, and neither can Ann. She's sure that everyone is secretly judging her, that her experience makes her the offender. Given societal ideals at the time, she wasn't far off.
When actress Ida Lupino moved into filmmaking, she wanted to tell stories from a woman's perspective, focusing on subjects male directors and writers were contented to ignore. That's what led to films like Not Wanted (about abortion and unwanted pregnancy), The Bigamist (about infidelity and men having families on the side), and this one. She dealt with these subjects with a smart, mature, sensitive touch. But it wasn't always enough.
In a 1950 review, San Francisco Examiner critic Hortense Morton wrote that Outrage is not ""in good taste."" ""Most of us who plunk down our dough at the ticket office want to be entertained,"" and a story about a young girl being raped isn't entertaining. Well, that's one take on it, I suppose. Another review from 1950 notes that it is ""grim and unpleasant"" and the subject matter is ""distasteful and depressing."" Ann probably wasn't wrong that no one would want to hear her talk about her rape when film critics certainly didn't want to see Lupino directing movies about rape. I'm glad that, in the intervening decades, filmmakers became more able to explore different themes reflecting the full experience of life (for good and ill). And I think bold films like this one, which challenged conventional notions of entertainment and good taste and propriety in film subjects, helped to get us to that point.
But even aside from that, is it good? I'd say so. It's a well directed mix of noir and melodrama -- two subjects Lupino was well versed in (she starred in plenty of both, including On Dangerous Ground, which mixed both noir and melodrama -- and she stepped in as an uncredited director with Nicholas Ray as well). The early segment of the film, in which Ann is stalked through abandoned city streets by her attacker, is fantastic. And Mala Powers gives a great, compelling performance all throughout the film.
As a side note: At one point, a man at an orange ranch tells Ann she can earn 18 cents per packed box, for 1.25 an hour. With inflation, that works out to 2.28 per box and 15.85 per hour in 2022 dollars. That's not bad for agricultural work!

"Im angry I haven't seen more of Ida's work.
Outrage is a masterwork. Unexploitative and compassionate without being sappy. Has a better grasp of PTSD and all the internal weight that comes with it. I cannot believe this was made and I'm angry I didn't see it earlier.
Thematic fulfillment aside, Outrage is, cinematically, masterful. The cinematography is claustrophobic and tense when needed and does well placing the viewer in the lead's POV without any campy tricks or tackiness. Its classically hollywood in all the right ways here.
Some point to the ending as flawed or unsatisfactory but this is in some way where the movie continues to resonate in real ways for me. It lacks, what we may believe or want to be, a catharsis, but it's often like that whether we want it or not.
For me, I can only speak for myself, this is one of those movies where I felt seen but didn't hate it.
Where other films about assault that I like tend to be more of a wish fulfilment sort of escapism (female prisoner scorpion, Mrs. 45) wherein the victim regains their autonomy, gets revenge and defies the odds of trauma by being sexy while doing it, Outrage is utterly real and somehow never dips into the gratuity or preciousness that other contemporary pieces might when addressing the same subject.",5.0

"There's a lot to sort out with this one. In some ways, it's a frank, focused depiction of sexual assault and the resulting trauma. In others, it's an overly simplistic, sanitized version of this story for the censors.
I found the mix kind of frustrating, but I do think Ida Lupino was doing everything she could to tell a truthful story within the constraints she was given. There's certainly a lot of truth in behavior here mixed among pat 50s dialogue and resolutions. I don't like the way that the pastor character is presented as a savior, but I think there's a lot of sly toxicity intentionally planted in his behavior. The ending, which I think is meant to read as hopeful to the structures of power Lupino was working within, also reads easily as a crushing continuation of Ann's journey through a distinctively male world that will never listen to or support her.
Considering that the original script was rejected by censors until all mention of ""rape"" was removed, the film calls it ""criminal assault"", I don't think it's too much of a leap to read a more subversive narrative between the lines and give Lupino credit for getting any version of this film made.
This film was clearly made on a lower budget, the sets and performances make this plain. Mala Powers' lead performance as Ann is quite striking and deeply rendered, but everyone else is a little wooden. Lupino's assured composition and use of light transcends the budget though and brings to mind something like Night of the Hunter in some sequences.
I'd really like to see a restored version of this film. As it stands, this is really hard to find. I had to watch a 480p rip on YouTube taken from the one week TCM screened this in 2014. According to MOMA, Paramount digitally preserved this film in 2018 and it screened a few times then. I don't know if that preservation included any type of remastering, but it would be cool if Paramount would let anyone who can't get to the MOMA fucking watch the movie they preserved. Kino Lorber put out a Lupino box set in 2019 that did not include this film. What is preservation really if it doesn't come along with some kind of reasonable access for those interested?
As ever, I have no idea why any of this happens, but it seems that films directed by women are still treated as second-class even in preservation efforts. It's no stretch at all to say that this film is quite important and should be easily available to watch for anyone interested in film history. Until then, the version on YouTube remains up and is in better condition than other films I've seen preserved there.",4.0
"This film is an interesting exploration about a woman dealing with the aftermath of rape in 1950. Things have definitely changed.

And that's at a time when you couldn't even say the word 'rape' in a film. It's a dated examination of this situation, but still worth looking at as the emotions conveyed are honest ones.",3.0

It uses film noir style and tropes to explore paranoia, but the paranoia of a woman over the everyday casual entitlement of men rather than the perceived post-war loss of male agency. There's a paper to be written here somewhere (probably already has been, who am I kidding). But it's also marvelously effective simply as a drama/thriller.

Unfortunately I found the delivery of the message a bit too preachy (hehe) & condescending, which was a shame.

"Excruciatingly uncomfortable and deeply upsetting, sometimes even at its most superficially optimistic moments. This makes it abundantly clear just how much Not Wanted was indeed Lupino's film, as this displays the same command of lighting, blocking, and subjective sound design that made that film so unique. While there is plenty of outright melodrama here (not a bad thing), it's Lupino's more subtle portrayals of post-traumatic stress that really leave a lasting impression on me—particularly in the climactic waltz scene, a quiet tour de force; and in the way everyone seems to feel perfectly fine just casually touching, grabbing, and shaking Mala Powers without a second thought—a recurring event that might look like a quaint, slightly cringey curiosity in any other film of the era, but here ultimately becomes terrifying through its constant repetition. I've seen frequent complaints that the film grinds to a halt after the first act, but I think that's kind of the point: this woman's life has been stopped cold in a way that none of the people around her really appreciate. The story of this woman's rape is also the story of how she has been robbed of her own sense of agency, and this robbery ripples forward into her life far beyond the bounds of the film's plot. I think it's an extraordinary film and I'm a little shocked it's not better known by now.
As with Not Wanted, only exponentially more so, it's difficult to tell how much of the discomfort I feel about the ending here is intentional.",4.5
Well it’s just straight up disgraceful we don’t talk about this movie more.  The in media res to end all in media res.,4.0
"Tightly directed, and effective at talking about rape (and its aftermath) without being able to directly use the word or depict anything more than the lead up to an assault (though, honestly, I would argue nothing more than this lead up is needed) due to the Hayes Code. We see Ann Walton (Mala Powers) being given come ons worthy of Twitter anger and derision by a lunch counter man that eventually is the one who assaults her. She does nothing to ""bring"" the attack on but is blamed for it anyways, and the combination of shame and untreated PTSD lead her to run away. She finds a new life working for orange growers and a sensitive friend in the shape of a man living in the area and himself recovering from TB he caught during the war-an ex-Navy Chaplin played by Tod Andrews. I found it interesting which concerns are still with us, that the finance is supportive of Ann, and the plea for more mental health care that Andrews' minister delivers to a judge late in the film, which I was not expecting.",4.0
"Before becoming a fairly prolific TV director, Ida Lupino directed several feature films, this being her third (second credited). I had previously seen The Hitch-Hiker, On Dangerous Ground and The Bigamist, enjoying them very much.
In this one, Mala Powers plays a young woman engaged to be married who is ""criminally assaulted"" (the term they used in the movie for rape) after a late night at work. Now unable to deal with life in that town, she runs away in fear, and things only get more complicated from there. As with The Bigamist, Lupino was not afraid to cover another taboo subject. She and the cast did a great job in expressing the various emotions surrounding such a terrible event.",3.5
"In adopting the aesthetic of film noir yet focusing purely on Powers's experience rather than the investigation as expected, Lupino subversively turns our focus to the horror of rape and the oppressiveness of a male-dominated society which views all women as inherently subservient and reduces them to sex objects.
The horror of the rape scene is evoked in Lupino's use of high angles and haunting silence which turn the familiar streets of the small town into a dark morass of shadows and threat, their emptiness suggesting the societal ignorance that leaves Powers alone to fend for herself.
What follows in the aftermath of the ""attack"" is even more impressive in its portrayal of the fear and nervousness which linger in its wake. Seeing the world through Powers's eyes lays bare the omnipresent aggression and possessiveness of the men surrounding her.",4.5
"This reminded me of why I loved Ida Lupino's work when I first encountered it in 2021, having watched most of her films except this one. For a Hays code era film it was (mostly) very modern, except for the last 10 minutes or so which felt so outdated and melodramatic, even for a film made in 1950.",3.5
"Fantastically directed by Ida Lupino. Only a woman could have made such an empathetic and honest film about the emotional impact of a sexual assault in 1950, and treat it with the required weight while still dancing around the production code restrictions of the time.
Tightly written, beautifully photographed. It occasionally veers into preachy territory but everything this film has to preach is important, accurate and cuts to the bone. Mala Powers and Tod Andrews, both of whom I’d never heard of before, deliver emotionally raw performances that stay with you.",4.0

While this feels very dated now, it was no doubt ahead of its time in 1950. It is striking to me that when toward the end of the film Ann (Mala Powers) is stalked by a dude who cannot understand why she’s freaking out when he just wants to kiss her (seriously, wth?) and she attacks him after clearly demonstrating in multiple ways that she is uninterested, the authorities decide she is a threat (again, wth?) The way it’s filmed, it is very clear where Lupino stands no matter what the dialogue indicates.

Soando como uma critica de fato.
Apesar do incômodo, existe um trabalho exímio de direção de Ida Lupino. A decupagem clássica é muito impressionante. A famosa sequência que eu já tinha assistido diversas vezes antes, dentro do contexto do filme não poderia ser mais aterrorizante. Outrage sempre vai ser um exemplo para mim de obras que conseguem alcançar o estado de pavor de uma mulher em estresse pós-traumático diante de uma situação de abuso.",4.0

This could easily have been a maudlin melodrama but Ida Lupino ratchets up the intensity with Noirish cinematography and slow burn plotting that makes the suspense almost unnerving at times. I would say it's a bit ahead of it's time in the way it holds a mirror up to society and is sadly still quite relevant. It definitely touches on the business of victim shaming but does so in a way that doesn't hit you over the head. Unless you're Jerry Paris that is. He may not have been a rapist but he definitely was a creep and she should have hit him twice just for that alone. Kiss THIS bitch!,0.0
Loved all of it except for the movie treating Frank like an innocent victim. She told him no multiple times. She kept trying to run away from him and he kept ignoring her. He deserved to get cracked over the head.,3.5
An Old Hollywood film about a young woman dealing with the aftermath of a horrific sexual assault and it’s accompanying mental and emotional traumas. I’ve only seen two of her films but Ida Lupino really had a way with film noir. She had a way of taking these stories about people experiencing true powerlessness and ultimately finding their own quiet strength in a way that places their humanity and vulnerabilities front and center. She was truly a pioneer actress/director who deserves to be named in the same breath as all her male contemporaries.,4.0

"Its status as a groundbreaking film in the Hollywood of its time is undeniable. With very intense dramatic moments especially in its first half. In the same way, the second half and denouement are somewhat less interesting, but the movie never falls out of favor.
It may seem obvious, but Lupino's work is the highlight here.",3.5
"The expectation of a happy and satisfying resolution that accompanies anything from classical Hollywood makes the rare horrific moments in the films of that era even more horrifying, like taking a bite of something sweet only to find it rotten inside. Outrage is the textbook definition of this experience, its aesthetic a careful curation of shadows that recalls the period's greatest noirs, but its focus on the crime of rape providing a story that feels far more sickening than even those pictures' murders. Censorship prevents the crime from ever being explicitly named and is likely the reason the act itself isn't shown. Yet, at least regarding the second point, the movie is all the better for it - reserving the viscera for communicating the long-lasting damage on the survivor rather than making a spectacle of the assault itself. This empathy is why the film has aged so well, we are never meant to view the protagonist as a fallen woman nor is her suffering made a vehicle for anyone else's rage, the film is steadfast in its defence of her, especially when her trauma causes her to lash out at the men in her life. Unfortunately, the ending does let her down, forcing her to return to a violently insensitive fiancée instead of allowing her to enjoy her newfound peace alone - attempting to resweeten the story after its mould has already been exposed.",4.0
The premise is absolutely incredible for a film from the 50s but I fear its execution was a bit off for me.,2.5
"A film that is VERY ahead of its time. Ida Lupino is also to convey the struggle of a sexual assault victim and how other people around her react to her, never really understanding the pain she went through or how to help her. It's extremely impressive that a film about a woman being raped was made in 1950, is directed by woman & written by a woman. Lupino took a risk with this film and it worked. It was especially nice to see a character call out how disgusting SA is and how men need to work on themselves when for so long, and sadly today, women get blamed for what happens. Lupino, you're phenomenal.
The leading actress, Mala Powers, does an excellent job portraying the pain Ann Walton goes through. Ann goes from such a joyful character to a broken woman. It shows how much this can break and alter a person. While we don't get to see her reunite with her family at the end, it's good to know that the ending is at least hopeful.
I've seen some say the ending isn't good. While I wish we got to see the reuniting, I understand that a story like this isn't supposed to have that perfect picture ending. That's not realistic. The ending is open ended because that's how life is. You just have to keep moving forward.
While I didn't care too much for Bruce, him standing up for Ann and calling out men's problems was great to see. I just wish that Bruce and Ann's relationship felt less romantic and more supportive friends or helpful mentor. And since this is a 50's film, the man does have to help the woman for her to finally be in a better place. It's annoying, but Outrage is still EXTREMELY progressive for the time.
Ida Lupino is truly a phenomenal director, I need to watch some movies where she acts in, and she is climbing up my favorite directors list.

Not a rape-revenge film as the title and premise might lead you to believe. It's also not really a film noir, although the scene where Ann is chased before being assaulted is haunting. The rest of the film is a serious and sensitive depiction of the trauma she experiences long after.

Also Lupino as a filmmaker brings both tenderness and an unnerving atmosphere of fear and distrust, the sound design especially in certain scenes was phenomenal.",4.5
"How do you overcome a dark place in your life? Running may delay dealing with it, may seem to numb the pain, but it is always there--even, as with Anne, when one is dealing with a false sense of guilt. A large part of healing is accepting that there is still hope, and the that ""Someone"" still loves, and wants to strengthen and help. In Outrage, the beginning of true healing came with the love and understanding of a man who had found strength to overcome his tragedy when he had looked up into Christ's love and understanding, into the face of the ""Someone"" who helps and heals in every shadowy part of life, if only we would let Him.
This innovative film, wonderfully directed by Ida Lapino, tackles the affect of crime, instead of showing the police work. I appreciated this angle, because while bringing criminals to justice is a good cause, the individuals dealing with the criminal's actions are very much a reality: they have to live with the guilty party's actions.
Dr. Fergeson's face when he learns of Anne's past is very touching, and is juxtaposed with the envious criminal. While the criminal horrendously misuses his natural strength, the doctor is a man of self control, who uses his power to strengthen and to heal.
""People who mean something to each other never say goodbye""

"Ida Lupino’s ethical melodramas might not hold up as entertainment to a modern audience but the subject matter does. And at least in this, her third film, she seems to find a style and pacing that keeps up with the taboo subject matter. 
Ann Walton’s trauma feels believable not just because of the stand out acting by Mala Powers but because Lupino choreographed a scene that would make her ptsd make sense. What begins as a cat call that is ignored, slowly escalates to chase, capture and then a per-film-code cutaway that leaves the unimaginable up to the audience to imagine.
The act doesn’t just dictate the characters actions going forward it becomes the singular trait for the living victim. The film holds up because of a more natural style and detail that was lacking from her other two films.

Every single picture Ida Lupino directed has a particular touch/nuance that makes familiar Old Hollywood tropes and genres feel a little more refreshing and unfamiliar. You really see that here. Her approach to sexual assault feels so honest and grounded in 1950s reality with a critical sensitivity decades ahead of its time. It’s challenging to watch but an absolute masterpiece.,5.0
"Even though the execution of this drama is both far from the best and rather routine, I can forgive such aspects considering it is dealing with the subject of sexual abuse in a rather effective but also sensitive manner. This is made all the better due to the solid direction from Ida Lupino and the rather great lead performance from Mala Powers. Now sure it is rather constrained by the nonsense rules of the time but there is no doubt this gets its message across while being more than worthy of respect for daring to tackle such a crime. The rest of the cast is also good, it is well-paced, the plot is engrossing, it is well-edited when it comes to depicting the flashbacks and panic attacks and the cinematography is on point.",4.0
"An addition to the ""Get em' girl! cinematic universe"".
Seriously though this attacked society standards and politics in a time where that did not fly well. It addresses 'contemporary' issues that 70 years later still aren't solved. Recently I watched Alex Garlands 'MEN' and for as shallow as that was in portraying it's themes, whilst watching this I couldn't help but compare the twos attempt at telling relatively the same narrative and attacking the same social matters... though Outrage does it near 100x better.
With a voice like Ida Lupino who in her own right is an absolute badass by being the only working female director in Hollywood during the 50s, it's a damn shame this movie doesn't get more attention for calling out the sexism and toxic masculinity that was even more standardised in her time. I cannot imagine the struggle it took to get this made, but I'm so glad it was. Not only an amazing movie, but amazing at showing the similarities of social environment, really shows 'how far we've come' -_-
Ida Lupino was ahead of her time. She wasn't afraid to stand up for herself and portray the gruelling realities of women. An important movie I urge everyone to see, not just for it's themes but for how great of a narrative and well-made film it really is. Perhaps top 3 noir?",0.0

"ANTI-CRITERION CHALLENGE 2022
#6 - A movie from the 1950s
Since I’d seen most every other Ida Lupino-directed film, I knew this one had to be the pick for a film from the 1950s to watch, and it luckily does live up to my expectations.
While there are a number of scenes that meander quite a bit, especially after Ann leaves town, this is still a highly potent look at rape and the psychological effects it leaves on the victim in a society that refuses to admit that it’s even a problem (hell, they can’t even say “rape” in the film’s dialogue). I found Mal Powers’s performance to be incredibly effective, particularly in expressing just how such a horrible thing can make you believe that you don’t belong anywhere and your self-worth plummets to nothing.
Beyond that, Lupino’s direction is, as always, excellent. There are a number of scenes played out for maximum efficacy without resorting to any number of cliches of the period, and in particular, I like her use of crane shots in this film. It makes this whole world seem slightly smaller, and fills you with the dread that the next man she runs across also has the potential to be a rapist. It’s a downright harrowing thought, but one Lupino wants every viewer to leave the film contemplating.",4.0
"I adore the score; Ida Lupino knows how to jam. 

Mala Powers was the perfect lead for this film. As her character’s womanhood was put into question & unraveling, she became like a little girl again. This was a very real story & an unfortunate truth most women, even the very women in your life, have gone through. 
How do you move on in your life with the singular body that feels as if it can betray you over & over again? One in which you can’t bare to look at? One in which you want to crawl out of? One that everyone seems to have a possession over but you? A woman’s body has become separate from one’s own self & she has to find ways to reclaim it, to see it differently, or at the very least feel like she can move within it again.
How do you find trust in your limbs to do what you’ve known them to do? As depicted, only some sort of time & momentum can heal wounds of this magnitude. Most women find solace in a distracting form of work, keeping their hands busy so the thoughts can be kept at bay. I didn’t entirely adore that it was a man who helped her out of this, but I’m keeping in mind the time period & the budget. And I’m taking it that people & community can help you heal, too. 
This film is a difficult watch, but is incredibly important in representing the horrors in the aftermath of rape & sexual assault. People forget that pain can linger, especially the rampant male directors & writers who have a kink for including rape scenes in their films.",4.0
"- Ann, why are you crying?
- Because you understand me. You understand everything.
Lupino hits an emotional nerve in me how people can connect through trauma by conversation. A story about Ann Walton getting raped and trying to force the memories away by leaving everything behind only for her past to catch up with her again. This one is years ahead of its time about taboo subjects of rape and PTSD that are still relevant to this day. Lupino was a master filmmaker.",4.5
"Well, I certainly never would have expected such a film could be made in 1950 that so sympathetically portrays the trauma a rape victim endures. From the sheer terror of her being hunted and attacked (and I appreciated the lack of a score during the chase), to the shame and paranoia Ann felt, to her flight response kicking in and causing her to run away, to her fear of almost every man she encounters. Most impressively though, is that there is never the suggestion from the story that Ann is in any way wrong to feel the way she does. Rather, the audience is led to sympathise with her, even as she strikes another potential attacker in the head with a spanner. And the fact she faces no criminal conviction from this is laudable.
My only real misgivings are with the ending. While I was pleased with the outcome from the court hearing, I was disappointed that Ann was essentially stripped of her agency by Bruce and made to return home when she didn't want to. Yes, her family loved her and wanted to see her again, but even just being in the town where her initial attack took place could be enough to trigger painful memories for her. And though I am sure it was not the intent, it felt as though Bruce was guilting Ann into doing what was right by her parents and fiancé, rather than what Ann herself wanted. A small blemish on an otherwise remarkable film.",4.5

Truly monumental storytelling for a Hays Code-era film. Lupino’s crafting of Ann carries such a weight and empathy that PTSD and sexual assault weren’t presented with at the time. It’s truly remarkable to watch this and recognize how ahead of its time it is. The crane shot with the neighbor shutting his window is eerie and sent shivers down my spine.,0.0
"Bold in a way only a B-movie could be at the time, Lupino provides an incredibly empathetic examination of sexual assault. She also cuts down with razor-sharp focus the 50s societal norms around rape culture and marital relations—where fiancé Jim, the supposed perfect suitor, is shown to be just as possessive and domineering as Ann’s rapist.
Fave moment: Let's be honest, this movie is cheap—and you can really tell during the rape scene that it’s filmed on an empty studio set. But to me, this doesn’t detract but enhance how warped and unnatural this sequence feels—and accentuates the fear and hopelessness of the situation. We know it’s not a real city. No one is coming to save Ann.",4.0
"Una película que me sorprendió totalmente. Toda la secuencia previa al ataque es suspenso puro y el uso consciente de los espacios en el asedio, una maravilla. Más allá de eso Ida Lupino maneja muy bien el drama sin los tonos melodramáticos, hasta diría que el lugar esporádico del moralismo está bien utilizado. También me parece una película compleja en el tratamiento del tema, se va del tópico de la violación (y la violencia masculina) hacia una esfera más amplia, donde la protagonista está huyendo constantemente del tutelaje (familiar, institucional) en pos del espacio personal, un aspecto que se resuelve de manera ""clásica"" pero también deja espacios abiertos a la interpretación.",4.0

That this film is still relevant is shameful. Lupino does a fantastic job staging scenes to heighten our understanding of Ann’s interior world of constant terror.

"A Hays Code-era production from one of cinema's often overlooked auteur's: Ida Lupino. This isn't a rape revenge, exploitation joint (like the films that would play on the Deuce in just a few short years) but rather a painstakingly honest and sincere portrayal of the psychological toll exacted by sexual assault.
Interesting that much of the dialogue surrounding our protagonist Ann's mental state contains the word temporary. ""Temporary insanity."" ""Temporary mental lapse."" When, as we know now, these trauma-induced symptoms such as emotional outbursts, hallucinations, paranoia and black outs, are anything but temporary. We call this post-traumatic stress disorder.
I admired how the male characters in OUTRAGE were not binary. Instead, Lupino (who wrote the film with her then-husband) crafted multiple unique male characters. A doting father, a loving fiance, a kind doctor, a friendly co-worker, a few borderline-aggressive suitors (or is that Ann's PTSD?), and of course, the assailant - who we do not spend much time following. Instead, the picture focuses in on the rebirth of a woman who's only option is to accept the world as a fucking horrible place with a few decent people in it.",5.0

Flash forward to me watching Outrage (1950) directed by Ida lupino and WOW, what a difference it can make once you put a FEMALE POV behind the camera. This was delicate, bold and tender while boiling over with female rage in the dialogue it has. the script says so much without being offensive and there’s a lot of hopefulness in how it deals with the mental deterioration that goes hand in hand with assault. The “romance” is again..tender, left to interpretation and longing yet respectful.  
I think this should be required viewing and Ida should have become a more talked about director in the canon, period!!",4.0
"The urge of dramatization prevails over the genuine sympathy of the character, regardless Lupino adopts a strong cinematic approach towards the realization of the psychology of a sexually assaulted victim. It’s quite an achievement considering it’s a product of 1950 Hollywood studio.",2.5
"With her third feature as a director, Ida Lupino continued her exploration of young women fleeing domestic settings following personal tragedies. After tackling unwed pregnancy in Not Wanted and disability in Never Fear, she dealt with the issue of rape in this historic effort. Released in 1950 it was only the second post-code film to address the subject of rape, and the first to be directed by a woman, it's forebear being 1948's Johnny Belinda.
The film follows Anne, an office worker engaged to be married who, one day on her way home is pursued by a man who had earlier harassed her and is raped (I use that word specifically as the film was not prohibited to use it itself). She returns home shaken and unable to face anyone who knows what happened to her, she runs away, eventually landing in a small town, where she meets a kindly and understanding local pastor who assists in her recovery.
Considering its era, the film is remarkably strong in its portrayal with only one early outburst that rang false. Like all Lupino's films it privileges ideas of empathy and understanding, and makes itself less about the issue itself and is aimed more at the woman at the story's centre and the emotional hole she falls into as a result. However it is not at all 'victim-blame-y' emphasising the need for personal care and powerfully recreating the stresses of the procedures that follow her assault as much as the code permitted.
As with her other films Lupino uses subjective viewpoints and balances realistic detail with expressivistic editing, camerwork and music. Key scenes play out with dramatic use of silence or uncomfortably loud effects, the rape itself is conveyed through an upward crane shot and a single protracted burning car horn.",3.5
"#Noirvember 2019 Nr. 12
Outrage - ""Taxi! Taxi!"", ruft Ann Walton (Mala Powers) dem Fahrer hinterher als sie das Büro nach einigen Überstunden verlässt. Ihre verzweifelten Worte verhallen in der sternenklaren Nacht. Was der Fahrer nicht weiß ist, dass die junge Frau von einem Mann verfolgt wird. In einer Garage, in Mitten von Autos, sucht sie Schutz. Verängstigt tastet sie sich in der dunklen Halle vor und betätigt aus Versehen die Hupe eines Cabrios. Der laute und schrille Ton weckt nicht nur die Nachbarn, sondern führt ihren Verfolger direkt zu Ann. Während sich der Mann auf sie wirft, vermischen sich ihr Wehklagen und die Hupe zu einem schrecklichen Schrei.
Ida Lupino widmet sich als Regisseurin erneut einem heiklen Thema Vergewaltigung. Outrage schlachtet die Tat aber nicht aus, sondern behandelt die Folgen eines sexuellen Übergriffs. Außerdem kritisiert der Film die gesellschaftliche Umgehensweise mit Opfern und regt eine Diskussion durch Lösungsvorschläge an. Mit 75 Minuten ist Outrage kurz und prägnant, Lupino geht es hier um eine Botschaft. Obwohl sie den Stoff mit ihrer eigenen Produktionsfirma ""The Producers"" umsetzte, musste sie wegen des Hays-Codes, der in den 50er-Jahren die moralisch akzeptable Darstellung von Kriminalität, sexuellen und politischen Inhalten prüfte, die Vergewaltigung als ""Übergriff"" bezeichnen. Outrage geht detaillierter auf die Folgen ein, als viele zeitgenössische Werke und funktioniert noch heute.
Wie in Not Wanted und Never Fear, stellt Lupino erneut eine weibliche Hauptfigur in den Mittelpunkt. Ann wird vor dem Übergriff als eine emanzipierte und lebensfrohe Frau gezeigt. Der Übergriff zerschlägt alles, wofür sie gearbeitet hat und löscht ihr Vertrauen zu Menschen aus. Sie ist plötzlich unsicher, ausgeschlossen und unverstanden. Wie ihr Büro-Kollege, der seine Papiere wie ein Roboter stempelt, trottet auch das Leben weiter und Ann muss sich wie eine Maschine einfügen. Die Gesellschaft schweigt und lässt sie im Stich.
Als Ann nach der Attacke völlig verängstigt nach Hause kommt, bemerken ihre Eltern, dass etwas nicht stimmt. Sie rufen die Polizei und einen Arzt, der sie körperlich untersucht - Eine psychologische Betreuung bleibt aus. Die Polizei instrumentalisiert die Tat, um ein Verfahren einzuleiten. Anns Familie und das Gesetz suchen nach Gerechtigkeit. Ann bleibt mit ihrer schrecklichen Erfahrung allein, auch weil die Scharm der Eltern vor diesem gesellschaftlich geächteten Thema zu groß ist.
href=""http://somedirtylaundry.blogspot.com/2014/09/outrage-ida-lupino-1950.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"">Am nächsten Tag verlässt sie ihr Haus und glaubt, dass die Leute sie anstarren. Ihre Blicke sind wie heiße Nadeln, die in Anns Seele gestochen werden. Ihre Hilflosigkeit wird immer wieder in längeren Plansequenzen visualisiert. Aus Scharm zieht Ann von zu Hause aus, geht aufs Land, wo die Leute sie nicht kennen. Dort findet sie eine Ersatzfamilie, die ihr Herberge und Arbeit gibt. Pastor Bruce Ferguson wird für sie zu einer Bezugsperson. Es ist wichtig herauszustellen, dass er als Mann keine sexuellen Absichten verfolgt. Zu ihm kann sie eine Beziehung aufbauen, sich ihm anvertrauen und neuen Mut schöpfen.
Outrage versucht Lösungsansätze zu finden. Der Film schlägt bessere Vorsichtsmaßnahmen und professionelle psychologische Hilfe für Opfer und Umfeld vor. Mehr Sicherheit auf den Straßen und schärfere Gesetze sind weitere Punkte, die der Film kurz aufgreift.
Ich hätte gerne gewusst, wie Männer in den 50er-Jahren zu diesem Film standen.
Hat er sie für das Thema sensibilisiert oder gar ihre Sicht verändert? Speziell im Hollywood-System ist diese Frage deutlich mit ""Nein"" zu beantworten. Der Weinstein-Skandal und das ""Times-Up-Movement"" zeigen, dass das Thema immer noch so relevant ist, wie im Jahr 1950(!) als Ida Lupino es aufgegriffen hat.",4.0
hOw does Outrage deal with r*pe culture in a way that films today don’t even when it wasn’t even allowed to use the word? i wish Ida Lupino could have directed hundreds of films bc she clearly makes the films male directors could never make. i don’t understand how I have only just found Ida and her films </3,5.0
"Like I said in my previous review, running a b-movie production company gave Ida Lupino authorial control to tackle sensitive and lurid subjects that the big studios were afraid to approach. Although the MPAA restrictions on even the mentioning of rape were being relaxed at the time, Outrage still feels like a shock to the system, even today. Here is a filmmaker using her perspective and talent at spinning suspense to deliver the fear many women feel in certain situations every day. The act itself, or rather the catcalling and the chase the that leads up to it is one of the most anxiety-inducing thriller sequences of this era, more tense than any of Hitchcock's most famous scenes. Yet because this comes from a female writer-director it never feels exploitative, and neither does the victim's (Mala Powers) post-traumatic breaks that haunt her throughout the rest of the film. Claustrophobic prison bars provide the main (and very noirish) visual motif whether they be long shadows cast by towering buildings, a headboard frame. or a very literal jail cell. Ann's mental prison becomes physically manifest in the mise en scene and framing. The film also refreshingly treats Powers' mental health as something that can be coped with with therapy rather than depicting her as a permanently broken woman. Now at times the acting can come off a bit maudlin, after all nobody was really making movies about rape of even PTSD at the time, so Lupino's direction is big and expressionistic to get the point across. As such the movie loses a bit of its power in the melodrama, particularly in the latter half. The film gets sooo close to identifying the root cause of rape, that is to say a society that objectifies women and encourages men to ignore even the most basic aspects of consent. But it swerves out for a more general condemnation of the state of the mental health system for not properly treating potential rapists. Perhaps it's best not to project contemporary ""wokeness"" to movies from 70 years ago and at its best Outrage is still a resonant film on a still sensitive and difficult subject.",3.5
"There isn't a ton of outrage expressed here—mostly there's paternalistic concern and a general faith in the sturdy fabric of American life. But the first act hangs heavy: the poster of a clown leering over a dark alley; the hell of weird looks and pats on the back; the noir despondency around the possibility of justice (""we're only dogcatchers,"" says the cop). The moments where Lupino explicitly brings us into Ann's trauma-shaped view of things feel far realer than the consoling/patronizing ""reality"" outside them, which lends some credence to reading this how we would like to: as a clear-eyed film about rape by a female directorial force-to-be-reckoned-with. If there's something ""progressive"" to be found here, it's the insistence on the continuity between everyday creepiness and actual violence.",3.5
"Ida Lupino directed a tough little movie about a woman who got sexually assaulted that was way ahead of its time.   It deals with that trauma that it causes, the damage it leaves.  It was riveting without being exploitative.   It showed PTSD symptoms before they  were known.   It was very moving.  Ida Lupino was a grade a director.    Part of the retrospective being done at Film Forum covering the five films Ida directed in the 50s.",4.0
"Extremely heart-wrenching tale of a young woman attempting to deal with the aftermath of her rape. Beautifully acted by Mala Powers, in one of her earliest roles. Tod Andrews puts in a good performance as another troubled soul who befriends Powers’ character and so helps start her on the road to recovery. Masterfully directed by the brilliant Ida Lupino. A unique and very compelling film that will remain in my thoughts for a long time.",5.0
"There are glimpses of brilliance in Lupino's direction with particular effect in the three assault sequences, but the shortcomings of the film are clearly apparent by the limitations set by the Production Code. I desperately want to track down the PCA file. I cannot imagine Lupino initially writing what appears in the second half of the film because she so powerfully tackles male aggression against women but ultimately falls into a category of other films at its time by succumbing to patriarchal values.",3.0
"At Home - PLEX
The ""attack"" sequence is VERY well done, Lupino directs with grace as the inserts look great and tension is well built. 1st half is certainly stronger than the 2nd and the last 10mins or so sort of lost me but I still really enjoyed it.",3.5
"You can almost feel Lupino muttering, ""This is not a Woman's Film. This is not a Woman's Film. This is not a Woman's Film."" Rape is an outrage, and Classic Hollywood knew that, of course, but for the subjective experience of its aftermath to be taken seriously, Lupino had to treat that aftermath calmly; and in refusing the ""hysterics"" that her male contemporaries would be ever-ready to underline and write off, Lupino crafts an internal, intimate portrait of a trauma survivor that feels out of its time. There are some powerful flourishes of style—the jarring musical shift and ever-more-cluttered composition leading up to the ""criminal assault,"" the office, the bus, the traumatic recurrence—and some wonderful subtle ones, as well—the coffee cup being cleaned, the meeting in the packing plant—but they're embedded in dialogue and acting that are restricted, limited, composed of feeble, timid emotions that, despite their diminution, are subjectively overwhelming for Anne. That limiting would be easy to criticize as a flaw, as it lends itself to a feeling of being underwhelmed, but if you adjust to the lowered intensity, the way the movie generates empathy is a quiet feat.",4.0
"It feels almost mean-spirited to give this film such a comparatively low rating, but there it is; rarely has a film so thoroughly failed to live up to the excitement promised by its title, splashed sensationally across the front of the theatrical poster. It may have been different for an audience in 1950, but the intervening years and changing attitudes mean this is now little more than a meandering melodrama. It's basically a film about the rape of a woman (although the word 'rape' is never actually mentioned) and the psychological impact this has on her, derived as much from the social stigma as inward trauma - another curious sign of the times. It lacks the light touch, both in terms of the direction and the script. Mala Powers is infuriatingly passive in the lead role and drifts from one situation to the next like a dandelion on the breeze. Her eventual saviour, who guides her back to the right track, is Bruce; a solid man of the cloth and consummate renaissance man who shepherds the stray sheep from his flock back to the fold like some kind of earth-bound celestial being. It's all very worthy but very little fun.",2.5
"That rarest of birds: a truly unpredictable movie, both in the way the story unfolds (rape defies conventional narrativation) and the striking directorial moves Lupino pulls in almost every scene (e.g. the waiter filling huge sugar jars while the radio plays a rhumba, or the old woman at the country dance who is focused on insistently until she suddenly disappears).",4.0
"A rarity for 1950 (and, unfortunately, still a relative rarity today), this is the vision of a woman director, Ida Lupino. Fascinating feminist/paternalistic look at rape, a word that dare not speak its name in 1950 (it is always ""an attack."") Based on the evidence here, the relatively unsung Ida Lupino, who also had a long career as an actress, had strong filmmaking chops. She was a producer and writer as well. According to Wikipedia, film historian Richard Koszarkski reckons her ""a true auteur.""",3.0
"Tudo entre o momento do estupro e a fase de adaptação da protagonista à nova cidade lembra ela de seu trauma. É uma experiencia aterradora e que repercute social e psicologicamente por muito tempo, está além de seu controle consciente. E Lupino representa a subjetividade traumatizada de forma muito delineada, com os símbolos saltando ao público, mas sem realmente alterar a lógica narrativa — vide a sequência em que a protagonista tenta voltar ao trabalho ou a cena em que precisa identificar suspeitos na delegacia. É meio hitchcockiano pela forma como a decupagem se adapta à mente da protagonista, mas também parece meio wellesiano pela forma como a maioria dos planos se compõem. Lupino está entre os grandes mestres da Hollywood classica, porque harmonizou lindamente as tendências clássicas à objetividade e à subjetividade, de um jeito que seus planos simplesmente fluem de um estado de consciência a outro, de uma perspectiva a outra, e assim sua visão do drama se enriquece profundamente — e nos enriquece enquanto público.
Parte do brilhantismo da construção simbólica de Lupino está nesse fluxo classicamente invisível entre os dois polos estilisticos (objetivo e subjetivo). Sua direção nos proporciona algo como um óculos de lentes bifocais, com a diferença de que Lupino é muito arrojada e mal nos permite notar que se tratam de focos diferentes. Todavia, muito de sua grandeza está não nos óculos, mas no que os óculos veem.
Alguns símbolos se tornam recorrentes e ganham significado profundo por suas repetições. O que mais merece destaque é a forma como a protagonista corre e se esgueira pelas paredes quando se sente ameaçada (movimentação corporal muito comum no cinema, mas que Lupino recontextualiza magistralmente): isso ocorre imediatamente antes do estupro (numa sequência fortíssima de perseguição, em que cada plano conta) e quando o xerife aparece na nova cidade. A reprodução que Lupino faz da mise-en-scene anterior é cuidadosamente inserida no novo cenário, de modo que entendemos o sentimento da protagonista (como entendemos na primeira vez) e compreendemos perfeitamente a ligação simbólica entre o seu sentimento imediatamente anterior ao estupro e o seu sentimento por ver o xerife — talvez a ligação se dê, subtextualmente, porque ela entende a possibilidade de ser mandada de volta para casa como uma violação igual à do estupro, porque tudo em casa a lembrava do estupro (novamente, tudo).
Outro símbolo muito interessante, mas bem menos contextualizado dramaticamente e pouco dependente da maneira específica como Lupino dirige (a princípio, é um mero artifício de roteiro), é o cachimbo que nunca se acende, apenas é mascado. Ele se torna im marcador de tensão na personagem do pastor, homem que domina a protagonista para sua proteção, mas que também representa uma ameaça gigantesca — ainda mais a primeira vista. Esse objeto fálico que o pastor porta e nunca acende, apenas flerta o tempo todo, parece indicar a possibilidade terrível que cada homem contém e que ele contém especialmente por ter resgatado Ann, por estar mais próximo dela e por parecer interessado nela sexual e romanticamente. Ele é uma ameaça que nunca se concretiza e que, conforme Ann se adapta à nova vida, se demonstra inofensivo e, cada vez mais, agradável e amoroso num sentido que a protagonista valoriza. De certo modo, o cuidado manso e sensível que o pastor oferece a Ann é a chave para que ela redima todo o mundo diante de seus olhos, para que as coisas não se resumam a ameaças. Para isso, ele precisa começar ameaçador e se transformar aos seus olhos.
Esse filme é essa história de transformação simbólica. O mundo começa comum, se torna terrível e, aos poucos, volta ao seu status ordinário — terapeuticamente. Também é a história dos perigos de uma concepção simbólica do mundo ao redor como uma ameaça constante, da ameaça que uma pessoa amedrontada frequentemente representa. O problema que o filme enfrenta não tem a ver com a inocência do homem que Ann ataca no final — até porque ele não parecia inocente, nem um pouco. Tem a ver com o descontrole simbólico (portanto, um descontrole geral) a que o trauma submeteu Ann. Ela se tornou escrava de um trauma. O filme mostra isso de forma simpática à protagonista e, aos poucos, mostra o horror dessa escravidão. Escravidão que perpetua o sentimento do trauma e que impacta a ela e a todos ao seu redor.",4.0
"Powerful, groundbreaking film which has been neglected for decades. Of the three Ida Lupino films I have seen (The Hitchhiker and The Bigamist) this is the best by far, and it deals with rape, a controversial subject for its time.
Lupino uses a noirish atmosphere for the beginning of the film, and the actual rape sequence recalls the best of Fritz Lang, with Mala Powers pursued by the rapist in terrifying, empty dark streets. The second half of the film is solid but weaker, as the film has to adapt to the storytelling conventions of the era.
While not on the level of Kinuyo Tanaka’s contemporary masterpiece, The Eternal Breasts, Outrage shows the unique power which a female filmmaker can bring to female driven narratives. I know this sounds obvious but it really wasn’t for decades.",4.0
"The last ten minutes are a bit of a letdown, no doubt a casualty of the time and place this was made, but on the whole this is a crowning achievement. A tonally adventurous and thrillingly directed drama about the ripples of post assault trauma. Lupino in particular keyes into the way that Ann's space becomes constricted after the rape. The film begins with Mala Powers running through an open square with freedom of movement, not a care in the world. But after the assault, we see how these spaces close up on her. She does so in usual ways, blocking and prying eyes, but also the use of men's hands to restrict her. The soda jerk, who grips her arm to keep her from leaving in the opening. The way her fiance grabs and shakes her when she declares she no longer wants to marry him. Even the ""good"" man in the movie is introduced placing his hands on the door frame to block her exit and then putting them on her shoulder to calm her. Normally his character would be introduced as an unambiguous hero, but here Lupino allows for initial distrust until he's able to earn the faith of both Ann and the audience. And even then, when Ann goes to the county fair, she's reminded again of her powerlessness as another man puts his hands on her and determines that she will dance and kiss him simply because that's what he wants. On the whole, an extremely nuanced visual representation of prohibited and invaded spaces where a woman once roamed free.",4.0

Difficult subject matter but a very important film especially for its time (though still plenty relevant these days) and for the fact that it was directed and co-written by a woman when that was anything but common in Hollywood. Excellent performance by the lead actress as well. Could have been a bit longer but it gets the point across without feeling too preachy.,4.0
"Talk about a movie being ahead of it’s time. Astonishing Ida Lupino got this made in 1950, let alone directed it!
For a topic as sensitive as rape an incredibly delicate hand is needed and Lupino navigates the entire issue with such vigor. 
The stalking scene is anxiety inducing and the climactic shot of the sequence was a swift punch in the gut. The sequence is so effective I genuinely was just as uncomfortable as Ann was whenever she was alone with any men for the rest of the film. 
But what’s impressing me so much about this film is that PTSD was not understood or talked about at the time, and yet here is Lupino exploring how impactful trauma is and how hard it is to heal as well as what helps that healing.  It is no wonder Scorsese is so influenced by her.

Edit: coming back around to this to add that the power of the final courtroom scene is sitting with me so strongly because it insists that we are also at fault for violent acts in our society and I think that is an astonishingly beautiful thesis and something we would do well to remember today.

I was curious how they would handle it. Of course they did not say the ""r"" word but there's no doubt what happened to her. They managed to handle things in a tasteful and honest way. Though some modern-day ""woke"" viewers may have some criticisms, no doubt, the film should be applauded for handling such a taboo topic. Great performances too by an unknown cast.",4.0

Ida Lupino sabe transformar um suspense em uma situação assustadora e, apesar de não ser um filme terror, a cena da perseguição chega perto. Por conta disso, o longa tem uma abordagem empática por toda sua duração. Destaque também para a performance de Mala Powers, com uma sutileza sublime na gesticulação e expressões.
Um roteiro sensível somado à direção e fotografia belíssima faz desta história de apenas uma hora uma obra bem a frente de seu tempo.",4.5

"31 Films Directed by Women - March 2024
Feels both ahead of its time (it's a woman telling the story of a rape victim from the victim's point of view) and, well, of its time (they can't say ""rape"", plus the ending where her agency is taken away from her). Has a strong opening 20 minutes, which includes the really haunting chase scene leading to the sexual assault, and then continues to be interesting as we follow Ann trying to recover from the incident and deal with the trauma, and while she receives support from them, the lack of understanding of her family and fiance causes her to run away and try to rebuild her life elsewhere.
Pretty much every scene that involves Ann with a man feels uncomfortable; even when Doc Ferguson shows up as this knight in shining armor character I was always questioning his intentions and never really felt safe for Ann at any moment in time.
Don't go in expecting a revenge movie like Ms. 45, or any sort of radical feminist work, but for simply tackling this subject matter with care and providing a thoughtful treatment of Ann and the aftermath of the incident (at least until some questionable third-act decisions), it's a commendable achievement for the time period.",0.0
"O estupro, o trauma e a hipocrisia social sob a ótica feminina.
""O Mundo É O Culpado"" (Outrage, 1950) é o segundo filme dirigido por Ida Lupino, atriz, roteirista e diretora britânica (seu primeiro filme, Not Wanted, fala sobre uma mãe solteira) e o segundo filme estadunidense a abordar a temática do estupro nas produções hollywoodianas pós implementação do Código de Hays (o primeiro foi Johnny Belinda, de 1948).
Acompanhamos Ann Walton (a estreante Mala Powers, espetacular no papel), uma jovem de futuro promissor que é estuprada na saída do trabalho. Tendo que lidar com os olhares dos vizinhos, os comentários no trabalho, o desespero dos pais, a pressão da polícia para que identifique o agressor, e o afã de seu noivo em tentar normalizar a situação (ainda que esteja fisica e emocionalmente distante), Ann decide fugir para outro estado, assumir uma nova identidade e recomeçar sua vida. No entanto, seus traumas ainda estão ali, pungentes, e são reativados quando Ann sofre assédio de um rapaz, o que gera consequências graves.
O roteiro e a direção de Ida são extremamente sensíveis ao drama de Ann. O filme foca no estudo da personagem, e tanto a câmera de Ida quanto o trabalho corporal de Mala denotam as mudanças no comportamento de Ann.
No início da trama temos uma Ann mais solar e expansiva, e a câmera a acompanha, preferindo planos fechados e na altura da personagem, trazendo um aspecto mais convidativo e inofensivo. Seu ataque, por outro lado, utiliza planos abertos e bastante plongee e contra-plongee, evidenciando a solidão de Ann em seu trauma e como ela se sente em posição de desigualdade aos outros conforme a trama segue. Em uma das cenas mais emblemáticas nesse sentido, Ann vai a uma festa, mas fica distante de todos. A câmera percorre o baile no mesmo papel de espectador passivo que Ann ocupa em um dos cantos da tela, fazendo com que o público seja empático a sensação de deslocamento da protagonista.
A sensibilidade e empatia do roteiro não estão somente na câmera de Ida Lupino, mas também em seu roteiro. Além do estudo da desfragmentação de Ann, temos também cenas e diálogos que demonstram a ineficiência da sociedade em acolher Ann. Do policial responsável pela investigação que se mostra insensível ao trauma dela aos comportamentos sutilmente agressivos do noivo e de colegas de trabalho, Ann vai se sentido cada vez mais embotada, retraída e desesperançosa.
Curiosamente, a única pessoa que consegue criar um laço de confiança com ela é um homem, um pastor que faz do trabalho de ressocialização seu propósito de vida. E é ele também que faz o discurso final sobre a ressocialização não só de Ann, mas de pessoas em forma geral, trazendo o questionamento do quanto o crime que Ann foi vítima é tão somente culpa de um indivíduo e quanto a sociedade e sua cultura não tem responsabilidade pelos desdobramentos do filme.
No fim, O Mundo É O Culpado é um filme que merecia muito mais divulgação do que de fato possui. Tornou-se um dos meus filmes favoritos e me fez querer assistir toda a filmografia de Ida Lupino enquanto diretora.

"extraordinary nuanced depiction of the aftermath of rape. wildly ahead of its time politically (in the end, lupino avoids carceral logic— when Tod Andrews argues against criminalizing Mala Powers for her actions in surviving a second assault, he goes even further, blaming the initial rape not on the individual perpetrator, but on the institutions that failed to prevent his violence. a sophisticated abolitionist framework in product of 1950 hollywood). two shots in particular stand out: the sweet old woman spying as Mala and fiancée kiss, and the crazy choreography of the camera tracking Mala circling the swirling dancers.",4.0
Ida Lupinos våldtäktsdrama om posttraumatisk stress var på många sätt före sin tid i sin feministiska tematik. Riktigt bra till 2/3 in då det blir för smetigt. En kysk stabil man måste naturligtvis rädda hjältinnan men annars hade nog censuren satt stop.,3.0
"This is brave, poignant, important and so many things altogether. ""Outrage"" is a movie about a rape victim and the ways she attempts to accept herself after that. It's a movie about how women can easily fall prey to this, about the horror of seeing that act in their heads forever, about feeling dirty and being judged, about coping with a traumatic event, and mostly a movie that attempts to make the audience understand and relate to this traumatic experience.
The first 30 minutes are just a must. We can see this woman's life, the persecution (nothing graphic, I mean 1950?), and how is the aftermath, and how people react around her. That ""reaction"" is precisely asking the audience how they would react to this if they knew a rape victim. This film asks hard questions and thank you so much Lupino for that.
My issue and that is why this is not better rated, is that the second half of the movie is a bit uneven. I think the last 10 minutes make it better and I did enjoy the ending very much (it is actually one of the strongest points of the movie), but it kinda feels like a different film and at least I would enjoy seeing a different approach. The whole ""small town vibe"" with the people who rescued her was less interesting, even though it ended in a really smart way.
Still, it is a very strong attempt to portray something that would be almost impossible to see in a movie in 1950. Ida Lupino shows grit, shows guts, and shows how movies can be important to understanding other people. To relate, to empathize. It has its flaws but it is surely something I would recommend. Oh, and the main character is great and is truly well-directed.
PS: would be an excellent double feature to see this and then ""woman on the run"". Very different movie, but actually from the same year and with two strong women leads.",3.5

Has an icky, but revealing, tension between the Hays Code-dictated mores of the time and more feminist, near abolitionist viewpoints. Would be an otherwise unexceptional little movie, if not for Ida Lupino. Her direction, here and elsewhere, was so evocative, with an emotional intensity that seems to flow directly out of the screen, out of her cast’s every expression and gesture. What could be uncontrollable in other hands is primed and pointed under Lupino, who leads the audience with tender care or ferocity, as the story dictates.

"День 27 Noirvember Challenge: directed by a woman
Життя і психологічне здоров'я молодої пані, яка щойно заручилася, повністю руйнується: її зґвалтували по дорозі додому з роботи.
Is any girl safe? - питає синопсис фільму і режисерка і сценаристка Айда Лупіно. І питання досі доречне.
Хоч фільм і розповідає про жертву зґвалування і це є центральною темою, але в фільмі жодного разу не промовлено вголос, що це саме зґвалування. 50ті... Victim of the criminal attack. Проте сама наявність такого фільму і початку діалогу з глядачами - це дуже сильно.
Outrage став другим Голлівудським фільмом періоду після кодексу Гейса, що підіймав питання зґвалтування. Але перший, знятий жінкою. Ще й якою.
Нуарна недовіра світу і відсутність позивтивних персонажів тут дуже психологічна і особиста: після зґвалтування головна героїня почала боятись чоловіків і не може аби її торкались, здається, що всі можуть (і дійсно можуть) та намагаються її скривдити, до того вона має неймовірне почуття сорому, і намагається від нього і цих спогадів втекти, починаючи ненавидіти себе і своє життя через надану фізичну і моральну травму. Їй здається що всі шепчуться про неї, витріщаються, що часто, нажаль є правдою. В тому числі її наречений ніяк не видався підтримуючим чи розуміючим. Вона заново намагається довіряти людям, довіряти чоловікам і це неймовірно складно.
Від цього всього і саспенс фільму цілком інакший. Часом, я навіть не помічала відсутність музики, напруга і недовіра і так аж зашкалювала. Кожен рух, дія, погляд і доторк будь-якого чоловіка тут стає дуже напруженим моментом, особливо, коли кожен може собі дозволити обійняти незнайому жінку, чи провести рукою по спині, по волоссю, ну ви поняли. І скоріш за все (дівчата) зловили зараз флешбеки. Але тут ще й поправка на час подій - тоді чоловіки багато собі дозволяли. А від фільму прибуде ще й злості.
Розповісти про цю складну тему, ще огорнуту в нуар - це геніальне рішення Айди Лупіно, як на мене. І дуже важливе. А для 50х на перших років закінчення дії кодексу Гейса, що обмежував кіно - дуже вчасне.

"Noirvember 2023 #26/50
The Long Noirvember 2023 #51/52 (Spot #26)
One of the categories for this Long Noirvember marathon was to watch a noir directed by Ida Lupino. I have already reviewed her primary Film Noir (The Hitch-Hiker), and I had already seen one of the others that is at least occasionally cited as a noir (The Bigamist). That left this as my best remaining option, which does show up in the occasional Film Noir resource. It's maybe not noir in the strictest sense, but it does fit the category well enough. Interestingly enough, while doing a bit of research on Lupino, I learned that she was actually the only woman to direct a Film Noir* during the classic period (a classification that excludes foreign-produced, noir-adjacent films). Also, while we're on the topic of Lupino, it's worth pointing out that she both directed and co-wrote the film here, though she didn't star in it. Later in her career she would direct herself in The Bigamist, a movie that she didn't have a part in writing. While she did undertake all three of those roles at various points in her career (not to mention producer), she never tackled all three in the same picture. Had she ever chosen to do so, she would have preceded Barbara Loden as the first woman to write, direct, and star in a film that was widely-released in the United States by some twenty years.
Ann Walton (Mala Powers) has a job working as a secretary in an office somewhere in a generic town called Capital City, but her main focus every day is on spending her evenings with her boyfriend, Jim Owens (Robert Clarke). One day Jim tells Ann that he has gotten the big raise he has been hoping for, which means the two of them can finally get married - assuming they can get the courage to tell her parents the big news. They do, but talking about it the next day at the local coffee shop puts a waiter who has a thing for Ann into a fit of rage. When the man sees Ann getting off of work, he follows her down a few alleyways and sexually assaults her. She doesn't realize who had done it, however, besides having seen a large scar on the man's neck. While the police, her parents, and a local doctor try their best to help her through the situation, nobody is really well-equipped initially to do so. Ann feels the weight of the pity of everyone around her, and she flees to Los Angeles to get away from everything. She happens to stop in a small town nearby an orange grove along the way, where a reverend named Bruce 'Doc' Ferguson (Tod Andrews) helps her re-center her life. That is, at least until another incident threatens to derail her newly happy existence.
It's actually probably a good thing that Lupino didn't choose to star in this movie (though I couldn't tell you if she even considered it to begin with), as it does make sense to have a younger actress in the role. Powers was only 13 years younger than Lupino, but the 18-year-old certainly fits the bill as a young girl fresh out of school, barely into the workforce, and facing the prospect of an engagement at a young age - all when her life blows up after a brutal assault. Powers also brings a fresh face to the role that audiences wouldn't have been familiar with, which the veteran Lupino wouldn't have been able to offer. And while I'm sure Lupino would have been just as good, Powers delivers a convincing performance, letting viewers feel the brokenness of her character as she tries to pick up the pieces of her life. The plot itself is ultimately pretty thin, offering viewers a big opening that sets things in motion, a lull in the action as things settle down, and another big moment that helps resolve things. There is some good messaging about restoring one's faith, about justice being performed in the right places, and about healing from trauma hopefully taking place. It all wraps up maybe a bit too nicely, but you can tell Lupino and the other writers had the right ideas (if not the time to fully flesh things out).
*Also in this article was a great quote from cinematographer Archie Stout, who had the following to say about his work with Lupino: ""Ida has more knowledge of camera angles and lenses than any director I’ve ever worked with, with the exception of Victor Fleming.""",3.5
"Wow. Ida Lupino was such a talented filmmaker. I can only imagine the horrible misogyny she had to endure.
Lupino deals with this sensitive topic deftly. At times there is a real Hitchcockian vibe to this film. It does drift into almost being a ""message"" picture near the end but I noticed The Bigamist kinda does as well but I assume it came with the territory of being a female filmmaker in 1950's Hollywood.
I highly recommend this movie.

Ida Lupino was a queen of noir. Be it acting, writing, or like here directing. She was fearless, controversial and above all smart.
Post-code this is only the second film about rape passed by the board. The first being “Johnny Belinda” 1948. In this era it took smarts to get films like this even made, let alone released. All hail the queen!

"DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BELOW




Considering context, this was such an impressive movie. Back in the day when you literally couldn’t even say rape in movies, nevermind show anything, this movie does it’s best to build that tension, and from there does a good job through a good performance of showing the blaming, the confusion, the unfairness and every other awful thing that occurs after something like that
Really ahead of it’s time and really limited, but I was very impressed! I’m not really doing this movie justice with my review but this was great",3.5
"Quelques spoilers.

Comme pour Bigamie (qu’Ida Lupino réalisera trois ans plus tard), il est difficile de ne pas voir Outrage pour ce qu’il est d’abord manifestement, c’est-à-dire un film-à-sujet (comme en témoigne son final particulièrement didactique et laborieux), occupé à attaquer de front un tabou de société alors encore à peine discuté.
Sur ce point, il serait évidemment facile de faire fi du contexte (à savoir celui d’un cinéma et d’une époque où ne serait-ce qu’aborder le sujet était impensable) pour ne plus voir dans ce film que ce qui y a vieilli, et qui désormais saute au yeux : cette jeune femme qui ne peut se reconstruire que via le patronage d’un bon homme d’église paternaliste par exemple ; ou bien le fait que celui-ci, face à elle, ne soit que manières suaves, touchers, et attitudes toutes en sous-entendus (bref, le contraire de ce qu’on attendrait du comportement à adopter face à une personne sexuellement agressée). On pourrait y ajouter la façon dont le geste violent d’Ann en fin de film n’est analysé que comme une confusion traumatique (alors qu’elle fait face à un garçon réellement agressif face au non-consentement qu'on lui oppose), ou encore cette manière dont le film renvoie le viol à une affaire de criminalisation galopante (loubard anonyme qui va faire ça dans un coin de rue – surtout pas un homme de l’entourage proche, ou issu de cette communauté chrétienne évidemment au-dessus de tout soupçon).
Passons sur ces anachronismes, qu’il serait bien mesquin d’opposer sérieusement au film, pour se pencher sur ce qui à mon sens constitue son principal échec : le fait que, d’abord parti pour accompagner l’héroïne dans son chemin de croix et de reconstruction, le point de vue se déporte très vite sur les autres personnages (dès la première soirée, préférant d'abord les états d’âmes du père au calvaire de la jeune fille), pour ne très vite plus la filmer que ""de l’extérieur"", animal effrayé et énigmatique dont l’intériorité nous est refusée, sinon aux moments-clé ou sa réflexion laisse place à la panique. Le souhait de l’héroïne, en début de film, ""d’aller au travail toute seule"" lui est en quelque sorte refusé par la cinéaste qui se met successivement du côté du pasteur, puis des juges, de tous ces gens compréhensifs se penchant de bien haut sur son cas.
Alors certes, réduire le film à ce transfert est un peu malhonnête, Lupino déployant une fois encore de vrais talents aux moments décisifs – lors de la scène menant au viol d’abord, tendue sur un fil, qui fait le choix a priori curieux de ne pas s’en tenir au point de vue de l’héroïne (on est tout autant avec son agresseur), et qui permet en cela d’éviter à la scène de se faire thriller, de se faire jouissance horrifique ; ou encore dans cette relation ambigüe (teintée de romance) avec le pasteur, qui nuance et colore de doutes la dernière partie du film. Mais pour le reste, Lupino apparaît surtout comme l’une des nombreuses figures de cette fin de règne Hollywoodienne, à l’heure du goût naissant de ce cinéma pour la psychologie et son didactisme, et pour une rhétorique visuelle qui se donne à voir – jeux de sons, de montage, tentatives d’illustrer savamment la névrose : on peut juger que tout cela est aussi élégant que passablement vain (seul le klaxon, en ce qu’il incarne un cri que le quartier et la société ne veulent pas entendre, atteint le spectateur au cœur). L’approche générale, comme dans Bigamie, reste avant tout curieusement froide, comme un peu théorique et en surface, pas toujours apte à nous faire épouser les émotions de ses personnages - à l’image, au fond, de tant d’autres ""grands films"" un peu ingrats produits dans cette derrière ligne droite de l’âge d’or d'Hollywood.

"It speaks to the success of Lupino, and the failure of filmdom at large, that Outrage still feels like what archaeologists call an out-of-place artifact. Even if you've soaked in Old Hollywood films, it's rare & revelatory to find one that tackles this topic in such a tough, frank, principled, and subtly perceptive way. Nor does it simply owe that potency to its taboo subject; Lupino's direction is precise, capturing everyday tensions and visualizing the social dislocation of trauma. The third act gets a tad wobbly. But the finale slips something deeply political into the smallest of gestures.",4.5
"Powers is really brilliant noir/social realism drama. The darkness spins out to utter nightmare in a dazzling and effective opening. The second half deals superbly with trauma opening it up to healing. The ending, ostensibly a happy one, reeks with bleak uncertainty.",4.0
"Ida Lupino's ""Outrage"" was released in 1950, a year after William Dieterle released the also interesting ""The Accused"". Both films deal with the rape of a woman and its consequences. However, in very different ways.
While the latter turns the rape into a murder and explores the trauma as a feeling of guilt, Lupino's film begins by unabashedly depicting the action in a harrowing night sequence. Using wide and overhead shots, the director crushes the girl against the street and isolates her to convey her loneliness and despair.
She then avoids any metaphor and speaks about the subject with total sincerity. Lupino dares to delve into the family's shame, the girl's sense of guilt, the disapproving looks from neighbors and co-workers, or her anxiety attack at the lineup.
All this is undoubtedly helped by the work of a female director and producer. Her film places the woman as the full protagonist of the drama, makes us identify with her most intimate feelings and, although she grants her redemption through a man, she does it without a love relationship, in a much more spiritual way.
A unique work for its time.",4.0
"Extraordinaria primera mitad, donde se sirve del lenguaje y los recursos del cine negro de serie B para tratar un tema casi tabú por entonces. Más allá de su valentía se trata de un buen film de serie B que confirma la valía de la directora Ida Lupino.",3.5
"Well, the movie about rape from 1950 is a teensy bit outdated. Shocker. Anne’s character isn’t fleshed out, and she seems more a vehicle for the events of the story than an actual person. There are a lot of by-today’s-standards misogynistic lines and actions that are presented as healthy (“C’mon, lemme see you smile”) and Anne’s reaction to the trauma she experiences is shown to be, while understandable, ultimately misguided. However, fleeing from a community that ogles you and makes you a pariah, from an uncompromising and uncaring fiancé, and from a police force that mistreats you is certainly a better choice than the alternative of remaining in harmful circumstances. Furthermore, the fact that a victim of rape is shown as dangerous or even insane because of the crime committed against her is frankly abhorrent. Still, the film is a technical masterpiece - the repetitive editing as an expression of stress and discomfort is truly disconcerting, and the sometimes tender and personal, sometimes distant and voyeuristic camerawork is emotionally immersive, particularly in the aforementioned scenes of discomfort. Plus, an amazing performance from Mala Powers!",2.0

"🅵🅸🅻🅼: 7/10.
Outrage, directed by Ida Lupino, is a remarkable film that dared to challenge societal norms of its time. Released in 1950, Lupino took on the progressive and challenging task of directing a film as a woman, and not only that, but one that focused on the theme of sexual assault and its profound impacts. Even though more than seven decades have passed since its release, it's disheartening to realize that society still has a long way to go in addressing this issue.
Lupino masterfully balances the delicate line between ensuring the story's effectiveness and abiding by the restrictive guidelines set by the Hays Code. The film cleverly sidesteps explicit visuals and instead relies on the power of suggestion to convey the emotional toll inflicted on the protagonist. The result is a haunting portrayal of the psychological aftermath of sexual assault, painting a stark and disquieting picture that resonates even today.
The performances in Outrage are truly commendable. Mala Powers delivers a compelling performance as the victim of the assault, skillfully capturing the character's vulnerability, fear, and eventual strength. The supporting cast, including Tod Andrews and Robert Clarke, provide solid performances that add depth and nuance to the narrative.
However, the film's effectiveness is somewhat impacted by a significant shift in the story halfway through. The introduction of a clergyman and the subsequent exploration of religious themes take away from the film's initial focus on the consequences of sexual assault. While this thematic shift adds complexity to the narrative, it dilutes the impact of the central issue at times.
Despite this narrative detour, Outrage remains an important film that dared to tackle a sensitive subject in an era when it was largely ignored. Ida Lupino's directorial prowess shines through, challenging audiences to confront the lasting impacts of sexual assault. It serves as a reminder that although progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. Outrage is a poignant and thought-provoking film that deserves recognition for its boldness and the conversations it continues to spark.

"Ida Lupino was an excellent actress as well as being gorgeous, but this play is lousy in its script and a little worse in its narrative structure; It is undeniable that today, more than half a century later, the woman who is subjected to sexual harassment or violence continues to become an executioner instead of a victim, but the melodrama of Ann Walton, her rejection of her fiancé and running away from home until she runs into Bruce Ferguson is a narrative disaster: ambiguous and carried in a monotonous way without contrasts or oppositions that give interesting peaks to the story beyond the scene of the harassment and the harassment in Santa Paula.",2.0

I’m always extremely surprised when an old film tackles such serious topics that feel extremely taboo for the time. Overall I think the movie does a very good job at showing the affects of trauma and doesn’t hand you a “everything’s better now” happy ending. It all feels like a natural progression towards moving past horrific events.,4.0
"This film gets off to a powerful start (the assault sequence is brilliantly and harrowingly shot) but gets bogged down about half way through in contrived plot twists, Tod Andrews' endless speechifying and, most unfortunately, the failure to give Ann any true agency in the face of her trauma. Ida Lupino clearly felt that she needed to smuggle the progressive subject matter of her movies (in this case, the PTSD faced by a rape survivor) in through the conventions of traditional melodrama or noir. She may have been right, but today it seems clear that Lupino was a strong enough visual storyteller and actors' director that many of her movies would be even better if those conventions had been jettisoned completely. Still, props to her for even getting a story like this to the screen in the first place.",3.0

"I don't usually like old Hollywood films. I know I’m generalizing, but it's hard for me to find movies from that period that can speak to me as a female spectator, though Outrage was definitely one of those. Depicting sexual assault on screen is always a delicate matter, and in the Code era it could be very difficult, so of course there’s nothing explicit or graphic and the morals of the movie reflect the period the film was written in. Ida Lupino centers the storytelling around the feelings of her main character and her trauma in a world where there is no sympathy, also making parallels between soldier’s ptsd and sa victims’, both emarginated inside a system of hatred, violence and oppression. Outrage is not a perfect film if you read it with a contemporary lens, but it is definitely ahead of its times for a lot of reasons.",4.0

"Empathetic and stylish, Ida Lupino takes what could have been a straightforward B melodrama and turns it into an exploration of female trauma. A gripping beautifully shot first half does slacken a bit in the second half, but it never fully loses interest. The camera choices and sound design also elevate the film, which in a different director’s hands might not be half as interesting.",4.0
"Mala Powers' tour-de-force performance as well as Stoumen and Stout's frightening and arresting cinematography cements this horrific story about the ways in which sexual assault can seismically upend one's life as one of the more fascinating pictures of this particular decade. The film's use of sound, repetition, dark imagery, and high angles helps create this tense, uneasy atmosphere where, like Powers' Anne, the audience is unable to fully trust anyone she comes into contact with after the horror of the attack.",4.0
"Man, Ida Lupino was good. That early stalking scene is pure noir and absolutely horrific.",4.0
"Taken as either a literal arc of sexual assault and the ripple effects of trauma and PTSD, or as a wider metaphor for the female struggle in a 1950s patriarchy, Ida Lupino's b-budget noir Outrage is lightyears ahead of its time.",4.0
"For a movie that's know for being the 2nd Post-Code Hollywood movie that deals with sexual assault, I was surprised with how understated it is about sexual assault. It's interesting how the movie focused instead on rebuilding your life after trauma in a way that was actually pretty touching... After surviving something horrific, imagine just being able to run away to an orange farm and finding community and having a hot priest take of you without using you as a sexual object... What a great fantasy ending.
Somethings that are also interesting from a scholarly point of view is the way the movie draws a harsh line between ""criminal rapists"" and ""regular guys that don't mean any harm""... like the incident that re-traumatizes Ann gets brushed off because the ranch owners have know the guy for years... but the event honestly seems just as scary and violating regardless, and while it's portrayed through cinematic language as just as bad, it's explicitly distinguished in the script, which shows a profound misunderstanding of rape culture. The ultimate conclusion of the film is that society isn't though enough on crime and psychiatric incarceration which is why rape happens, not men not being able to take no for an answer because they're told they're entitled to sex, even though there's glimmers of that conclusion sprinkled into the movie. It would probably be interesting to see what changes the script went through in the writing stages.
Overall, the movie is pretty sympathetic to its heroine, and shows how complex trauma can be, but it also feels like an overall uplifting movie about healing that reminds me of Douglas Sirk.",4.0
"il est peu connu mais c’est vraiment un chef-d’œuvre de son temps, foncez!! 🤍",5.0
"A film filled with a lot of very good, often dragged down by some bafflingly bad stuff that seriously takes the edge off. The raging mansplaining of its last 10 minutes, particularly the last couple of scenes, is hardcore. Being so concerned for someone's mental well-being and then booting her ass out the door in spite of clear reluctance was some kind of choice, the movie presumably hamstrung by the age in which it was made.
Still, it's impressive how much material they cover in so comparatively short a space of time, and the incredible fit it finds channeling intense trauma through internalized melodrama. The covering of the life at home after the attack is wonderfully visual and concise in its handling, the general psychological torment she endures is vividly portrayed, and the inciting night of doom is an incredibly executed setpiece right up until the sheer stupidity of its conclusion.
The fact it sidesteps easy cliches in the characterizations of the people around her is one more feather in its cap, and a testament to Lupino's greatness.
I just think the aforementioned idiocy of the climax to the stalking through the streets and the end of the movie that goes from a Psycho-like clunky summation of all issues covered to a ridiculously rushed-through finale that feels entirely out of step with the careful human feeling that has preceded it are key issues at key moments that rob it of coming as close to perfection as it'd be likely to get with the economy of time it gets to explore the many things it seeks to.",3.5

"A young woman has it all: a decent job, loving parents, good friends, and a man with good prospects who just asked her to marry her…and then it is all ripped away when she is raped walking home from work one night. While the film never uses the R word, it is heavily implied and is absolutely a film about what this kind of assault does to a person. 
It is a good movie on the topic, it may be a tad dated in it’s style, but the film really does a great job of showcasing what rape affects a person. Everything seems wrong after that. She doesn’t want to be with her boyfriend, she doesn’t want to even be with her family…she runs off and almost jills a man when PTSD kicks in and she think he is about to rape her. I mean that is some legit issues being explored, especially in the post-code bland 50s. 
And I think that is absolutely down to the fact that this film has a female director. Some 50s male would’ve botched this story for sure, but Ida Lupino does a great job capturing the subject here. Again it isn’t perfect and some aspects feel a tad dated, but the effects it has on the victim feel real enough, and they needed a women’s perspective to capture just right.",3.5

"Well ahead of its time in subject matter, quite surprising that this was able to be made in 1950 given the Hayes Code but given the sensibility of Ida Lupino you can see how she was able to achieve the horrors of the rape without gratuitously showing anything. The many faucets of PTSD, victim blaming, fear, silence and more are all brought to the forefront here. According to Wikipedia this is the second Hollywood film within the Code era of cinema to talk about Rape.
Beautiful blocking through staging and dialogue and the sound design is so prevalent here. I know neither Outrage nor You Were Never Really Here are the first to utilize sound to place you in the head of the character but damn does Ida Lupino & Lynne Ramsay know how to use it to the fullest affects. The link between PTSD and sound. These characters not being able to “drown out the noise” as almost like it’s suffocating them. It’s brings such an intense emotionally impact on the viewer. 
***Spoilers***
Another beautiful example of the sound design is when she has to identify the man on the police line up. The police offer tells the men to show their left profile, then their right profile. “Try to concentrate Ms. Walton, Try to remember, we don’t want this man on the streets tonight”. Following up with the sound replaying “left, right, left right” in various ways almost in the same vain a military sergent would have you when marching. The repetitive phrasing seems to imply that this is a moment playing over and over in her head that she doesn’t want to re-live. Yet the pressures from this male cop pushing her to re-live it, and essentially placing her at fault for the man being on the streets tonight, just straight victim blaming. The insensitivity that woman experience in the most upfront or subtle ways is sickening. 
***end spoilers***

The more and more you watch films from Woman filmmakers the more you understand how their perspective shapes the story, in a way that most men don’t know how too. I remember having a whole year studying the female gaze at film school and their were some people who didn’t believe in it and said that we all can tell stories the same, doesn’t matter who’s behind the vision. Hearing that is just completely beyond me, I don’t understand how one could erase someone’s entire experience. 
While the lighting can be kinda flat throughout the film, the camera movement and composition is pretty great. Archie Stout knew the assignment . 
The only downside to this film is the dramatic-ness of the acting at times and ESPECIALLY the score. It’s so painfully 40/50s Hollywood. 
I’m pretty sure the copy I watched on YouTube was from a VHS recording of TCM. That def brought me back some years 🥲
Is there where Jordan Peele got the idea of tearing the cotton out if the chair 👀

"Ida Lupino really wakes up as a director on her second (credited) movie, creating a couple of sequences that rivals anything made by any noir suspense artist; riveting first half deals with a woman suffering the ""consequences"" of rape and assault, less riveting second half deals with finding solace in organized religion and hegemony; also hampered by the Code, which didn't allow for such words as ""sex"" or ""rape"" to even be used in the script (which is why the perpetrator is called an ""erotic offender""); these implements make Outrage not so much a movie ahead of its time (which, given the subject matter, it could have been) but rather a very clear illustration of its own - indeed, the looming bureaucracy of hospitals, the church and the court of law (which are supposed to be comforting to us) seem more evil and frightening than the key assault (which is erroneously treated as a mere anomaly from a bad apple, who can't be sane anyway, and therefore needs psychiatric care too).",0.0

"Much of the film – not only the rape scene, but, in particular, the later one in which she bludgeons the well-intentioned farm boy – privileges Ann’s perspective. We see things the same way she does: we feel both with her and for her, something that, almost 70 years later, many films centred on sexual violence still struggle to achieve.
In sharp contrast to the astonishing first quarter of the film, in which Ann’s experience is rendered so powerfully and sympathetically and with such a deep acknowledgement of the horror of what is happening to her, the simplistic, almost rosy conclusion – in which she travels home to her parents and fiancé ostensibly ‘cured’, returning in an uncomplicated way to a status quo drenched in 1950s Americana – is almost shocking in terms of its suddenness (from a contemporary perspective, at least).",4.0

"Shares a lot of similarities with Ida Lupino's debut, Not Wanted: young woman is wronged by a man (to put it lightly), then runs away and gets a modest job while undergoing worsening psychological stress. Outrage improves on this formula in some ways: it's a lot more frank about the pain and trauma that stays with the woman protagonist, there are more voices of support to cast away any doubt that this isn't her fault, and the ostensibly larger budget allows Lupino to mount this story on a much more impressive scale. The scene where Ann is stalked through the neighborhood (built within a studio backlot) is brilliant, full of huge crane shots and visual tricks that transport Ann to a place of pure terror.
But Outrage still hits a ceiling that it can't break through. More and more men begin to speak for Ann by the end, to the point that it doesn't really feel like her journey by then anymore. Her time spent healing away from home is still a little too dependent on the existence of a man decent enough to care for her. Still, this is generally very strong work from Lupino, who in 1950 Hollywood was already unapologetic about speaking up against the mistreatment of women by seemingly suave, movie-star-type men. And Mala Powers is great as Ann, giving her a wisdom beyond her years, allowing us to see how thoughtfully she considers her options, even as she fights back her trauma.",3.5

""Now I understand. You are innocent. So awfully innocent.""
In a lot of ways, Ida Lupino's Outrage feels miraculous. A mainstream studio in 1950 releasing a film directed and co-written by a woman that deals with rape? Even with Johnny Belinda two years earlier, Outrage feels remarkably groundbreaking. Lupino was clearly a great, great director, and that's especially clear in the first half of the film. The buildup to the rape scene (only described in the film as an ""attack"") is as nauseatingly stressful as anything I've seen in a horror film. She sets up Ann's hopes and dreams and successes in a simple, compelling way, like a house of cards, which makes the collapse of it all that much more heartbreaking. It helps, too, that Mala Powers does strong work as Ann. She sells every step of her journey from bright-eyed young woman to a shattered victim to a resilient survivor, even when the film around her takes a few weird turns.
The back half of the film is odd. Tod Andrews shows up as a reverend, there's a festival, there's a trial, there's a rushed ending and a dead-end attempt at romance. It's nowhere near as potent as the first half, but it doesn't discredit what makes the film so impressive and valuable. Lupino is in full command of her craft as a director here, fixing her mournful, sympathetic gaze on a survivor of sexual assault and effortlessly forcing every audience member into her shoes. Things as mundane as a coffee counter or a car horn or a passerby on the street become utterly terrifying. Lupino reminds us that it's an awfully violent world, one that will rip you up without a second thought. If the end of the film is any indication, though, she's just as confident that somehow, there's always hope. It's very moving, even if it takes a few stumbles getting there.",4.0

52 films by women [2021 edition] - 29/52
About as overt an attempt in using the relative freedom offered by the B-movie industry to deliver social commentary as you're likely to find, Outrage is fascinating in how it eschews the expected conventions of the time in order to focus less on pursuing the perpetrator than it is on the survivor reacting to and processing the trauma she's experienced in a manner that makes emotional sense while understandably discarding logical sense (a factor that is amply reflected in how the technique foregrounds her perspective). Even concluding with a scene that is at once anticlimactic and polemical still proves the best possible manner in which the film can wrap up its subject matter in a way that fits the demands of the time while still achieving a distinct sense of artistry.",3.5
"Filme produzido durante o código Hays, código de censura americano que teve início na década de 30 e perdurou até 68. Um filme que fale tão francamente de estupro e vulnerabilidade feminina já seria histórico, Ida Lupino consegue, mesmo em um começo de direção, tornar algumas escolhas visualmente interessante, por mais que se perca no desenvolvimento.
É interessante que a atmosfera otimista da formação da instituição família é apresentada de forma bem lírica, o companheiro agradável, a boa vizinhança e emprego estável, em uma alternância em planos mais abertos sem cortes, e planos fechados nos momentos mais íntimos com o namorado. O uso da profundidade ajuda a integrar o espaço a essa percepção, primeiro da reprovação do pai ao casamento dentro da casa, mas que acaba cedendo. E posteriormente, na cena do ataque, os planos bem abertos mostram a isolamento da figura feminina frente ao caos urbano, usando um jogo de sombras e um uso do som para intensificar a atmosfera opressiva que remeteu os filme M(1931) de Fritz Lang. A posição de vulnerabilidade feminina, dessa forma, é sentida na atmosfera pós trauma, como se a violência física fosse apenas um sentido de uma violência institucional maior, lembrando que o agressor na primeira cena do filme direciona a mulher frases ostensivas que no cotidiano são comumente tratadas como ""normais"". Essa ruptura, faz com que a personagem busca em si mesmo um novo direcionamento, o problema que em seguida o filme acrescendo uma outra figura masculina que toma o protagonismo e perde completamente o tom que o filme anunciava em seu início, tanto que o filme termina focando o personagem masculino não a mulher, que possui todo o arco narrativo. Talvez o cenário bucólico do interior e o discursos religioso possam ser entendido como um contraponto as aflições urbanas da modernidade, mas certo que existe uma perda no peso ate então apresentado.",3.5

"A young bookkeeper is raped on her way home from work and struggles to deal with her trauma and the looks of pity from those around her. This is interesting in a time capsule kind of way. It's surprisingly sensitive to rape victims by not painting her as just a victim or engaging in victim-blaming whilst also acknowledging her trauma. But it's still from 1950 and suffers from the restrictions of the time: from the theatrical wooden acting to the lack o any real deep psychological examination of trauma and rape (and you know, not even being allowed to mention the words rape or sexual assault). It's not bad, just clearly a product of its time.",3.0
"*Registering the Registry also publishes over on medium.*
T'wasn't kidding when I said women vanished from the director's chair in the days after Lois Weber and Ida May Park. Excepting those working completely outside the Hollywood studio system like Aloha Wanderwell, the early twenties through the late forties saw exactly one new female voice within the American movie scene, Dorothy Arzner. Once she retired in 1943, the industry lacked for a single feminine voice behind the camera for another six years. You let traditional corporate finance take charge of your industry, and this is what happens; buncha Wall Street types in charge, ousting everyone who doesn't fit the ""normal"" mode, cause we ain't had no women or racial minorities or queers in important positions back at the bank or the stock broker office, we ain't about to have any making motion pictures. With but two figures to carry the torch within studio walls across four whole decades, it's no small wonder there's a popular perception no woman made any contribution to American cinema until Shirley Clarke's independent breakthroughs in the sixties. Especially since our second voice and today's director didn't come into it through the usual hiring routes - she happened upon the job by purest circumstance.
Englishborn to a family of generational entertainers, Ida Lupino (1918–1995) was groomed to be an actress from a young age, and that's exactly how she arrived in Hollywood in 1934, at all of sixteen years. Though she proved popular when slotted into the image of a blonde ingenue (to the point her early battle with polio was regular news), her work under and Paramount rarely amounted to much special. A brief stint at Colombia in The Light That Failed and subsequent contract work for Warner Bros. soon shifted her image, however, showing the world an Ida Lupino defined by dark hair, knowing looks, a strong independent streak, and a tendency to bite back at any who crossed her path. This screen personality earned her critical acclaim, and also served as a reflection of her personality offscreen, where she'd frequently clash with directors and studio heads when offered parts she figured badly written or demeaning, earning her frequent reprimands and suspension from work. What might've proved embarrassing for other actors instead opened opportunities for Lupino, as regular downtime on-set accorded her a chance to watch and learn as the directors and crews continued production, unaware their suspended star was studying the tools and ways of their craft. These breaks fostered a desire to work behind the camera rather than before it, leading to Lupino beginning a side career in producing and directing.
All this came to fruition in 1949, when director Elmer Clifton suffered a deliberating heart attack while shooting Not Wanted, a drama about pregnancy out of wedlock that Lupino co-produced. She stepped into his shoes, filming much of the remaining footage guerilla-style on location to keep costs down, and released the film to widespread acclaim, though she kept her name off the credits out've respect to Clifton. Still, doors opened so wide are rarely so easily shut, and Lupino's first chance at direction swiftly led to more, financed by her personal production house The Filmakers, first alongside second husband Collier Young, then alongside third husband Howard Duff. Sadly, Lupino only directed six films under this model before an abusive relationship with Duff, trouble securing financing, and a slowly-developing alcohol dependency led to the studio's closure and her shift to acting and directing for television (including distinction as the only woman to direct an episode of The Twilight Zone, and the only director to also star in an episode). While she directed as the only woman to helm Hollywood features in the 1950s, though, her pictures were noted for their willingness to tackle difficult subjects, just like Weber before her: 1949's Never Fear draws on her battle with polio to explore a young woman's struggles against the crippling disease, 1953's The Hitch-Hiker dramatizes the then-recent killings by Billy Cook in one of the decade's strongest noirs, and The Bigamist from the same year examines adultery and polygamy on serious terms near-unseen in the decade. Oh, and lest we get too caught in our career-overview revelry to forget today's picture, 1950's Outrage stands as one of the first post-Code American films to seriously tackle the subject of rape.
An already uncomfortable matter, it becomes all the moreso before Lupino's camera. The still-strong Motion Picture Production Code openly forbade any direct depiction of the act or usage of the word ""rape,"" so Outrage centers itself 'round distinctly cinematic means of communicating the horror of so senseless an attack and its aftermath. Mala Powers' Ann Walton has no reason to suspect the world means her any harm - she's a career girl making her way up the ladder as a secretary, she's got loving parents (Raymond Bond and Lillian Hamilton) who largely support her life choices, a steady boyfriend (Robert Clarke) who's just proposed, and regular contact with a nice young man (Ted Oliver, uncredited) who runs the concession stand she visits every morn. A bland, contented existence with no troubles, which easily hides the young man's leering looks and meaningful rubs at an old sweaty scar cross his neck. It only takes one evening of long shadows and empty streets for the man to start stalking Ann, whistling down empty alleys shot at harsh angles to catch her attention, driving her to quicken her step, furtively checking over her shoulder in a silent sequence until she starts screaming out for help at doors and windows which hold either nobody or those who don't care enough to help. We go and go and go, darting from streets to alleys to a truckyard, each mistaken bump against a trash can or truck horn changing the pursuer from threatening shadow to definite face, creeping closer and closer. A single tumble, a fearful glance up at the face obscured by railing with only the scar visible, and then a crane shot up and away as he descends, the only sound a blaring horn that awakens neighbors who merely shut out the din.
From here, to others, all seems banal again. For certain Ann is traumatized, but she has her parents and boyfriend to lean on, doctors to help numb the pain, a steady job to return to, and certainty the police will go through their motions to catch and prosecute the perpetrator. Yet our frequent glimpses into her perspective indicate the trauma is not so easy to process. Prison bar imagery becomes prominent, sequestering Ann away from other characters behind striped shadows and bed posts, as if she were the one punished for another's wrongdoing. Shots are blocked with an eye towards extremifying distance, making small spaces oh so impossible to cross by rendering the few feet to another's side a million miles long. When she is by another's side, no matter how friendly or loving they were before the attack, Ann cringes, averts her eyes, tenses all ready to fly should they make any sudden moves. The routine rum-tum-tum patter of her office is magnified into a deafening roar of maddening regularity, driving her to scream out of pain in public. She walks down the street, and it seems as if every eye is upon her, sly glances over shoulders and behind her back when they're sure she's not looking. All is a reminder of the attack, the feeling of being cornered and overpowered in a spotlight, every sensation a violation, and all this in the mundanity of her normal life. A call into the police station to identify her attacker from a lineup of men with scars upon their necks is simply too much, too seizuring a reminder that conjures visions of the night and man real as life before her eyes, and she runs away.
Yet the open road provides little solace, for such an impulsive decision triggers a manhunt led by the concerned figures in her life, which in turn transforms every radio broadcast into a potential trigger, a plea for help from someone who can find the wayward woman who was so viciously raped only serving to drive her further away. There are too many strangers, too many eyes, too many dark places she can't enlighten, too many chances surrounded by people. Except… on her own, there's too much space, too many angles for attack, too many ways to twist her ankles and fall down helpless yet again, too much uncertainty in the world. Closeness and distance provide no solace, company and isolation offer equal fear, noise and silence both bring memories of her rapist. No matter what Ann chooses in her flight to Los Angeles, memories tear at her mind, triggering another panic attack, until she can go no further.
Solace does offer midway through the second act, in the form of Reverend Bruce Ferguson (Tod Andrews), a travelling priest who's stopped to work on the Harrison orange farm, and who brought Ann in from their dusty road. Accepting their offer to work in exchange for room and board with no other options left, Ann's difficulties continue for a time, her perception of small spaces as large gulfs and her discomfort around people doesn't let up, yet there's something different about life here. Something about the Reverend's softspoken voice and willingness to share his own trials without probing too deep into her pain that makes her feel, if not comforted or fully healed, at least as if someone understands and won't push her to the point of another episode. It is handily the film's weakest passage, defined as it is by simple shots of rural bordering on pastoral life and driven by a relationship between Powers and Andrews which verges too close to openly romantic for what it's meant to accomplish, but its presence is appreciated all the same, for it ensures Outrage is a film about something beyond its main character's pain and suffering. There's intent to discover a path towards recovery, to posit this all-consuming agony at being violated and seeing her sense of safety shattered will not last forever, to make it possible for someone to help. If it takes Bruce waxing poetic in vaguely religious tones about his idyllic youth and how this valley makes him feel whole again after military service ripped so much away for the film to accomplish this sensation, then so be it.
The comfort of Bruce's presence isn't how Lupino means to resolve her conflict anyhow. He's a wanderer, prone to recall for another post by the church at any hour, and the sheriff's deputies make too frequent a habit of buzzing about the farm on their search for a missing person to leave Ann's mind stable long. Those clutching, clawing doubts remain, sharp and potent as ever, and they come to a head once again when Ann is confronted by another attendee at the local festival - the by-now familiar seizuring imagery recurs, her sight blurring to morph his face into that of her rapist, the soundtrack throbbing with panic and mortal terror as she reaches for a wrench, strikes him 'cross the head, and runs and runs and runs. Once again the snare closes, once again the walls tighten, once again a dash across open, rolling hills feels as if the world has become a box designed for the express purpose of tormenting Ann Walton and letting all creation gawk at her suffering. Nowhere to go, nobody on her side, on trial for attempted murder in an unknown part of town with hard-faced cops and jurors ready to pass judgement on her as just another crazy woman, the nuance and journey we've witnessed lost to those judging eyes who haven't had their world made senseless by a rapist strode out of the dark.
What makes Outrage really remarkable, to my mind, what makes its endeavors to grapple with so difficult and ugly a subject as rape and its aftermath worthy of induction into the Registry, is how Lupino makes the smart choice to ultimately disentangle Ann from this briar patch. Through Reverend Ferguson's testimony, she argues for compassion towards the criminal element in society, not just towards Ann, the victim we know was driven to violent action by fear and isolation, but also towards her rapist, and the whole body of those caught in the justice system. Not as wrongly persecuted innocents, mind (with some of this cast over the rapist, I'd never consider praising the picture if THAT interpretation reigned supreme); as failed charges of society as a whole, men and women left without a net or proper support, left to wander the streets with a darkness clouding their heads, each to their own dysfunction until it finds an outlet and commits a wrong. He and his writer/director argue the need to rehabilitate rather than punish, to provide therapy rather than prison, to understand the larger network which made the criminal the way they are, and strive to ensure both they and we are better for having reached out.
This is all left in the abstract regarding her rapist, while we directly see Ann receiving therapy to process and live beyond her trauma. It is not a perfect plea for tolerance and understanding, with the language used to argue such heavily tinted by direct comparisons to unrefined pig iron and scrap metal without intervention, characterizing the lost and damaged as worth help only because they might prove useful to society after refinement, as inherently worthless so long as they do not receive institutionalized help. There's some acknowledgement of the inherent value in assisting the scarred's healing, yet this too is discolored by the final scenes once again framing Ann and Bruce's relationship as possibly romantic, only not openly so because it's better for her to go back home rather than dally here with a new lover. And, as already acknowledged, the inclusion of her rapist in the equation, while sensible in the logic of a ""the entire system has failed ALL those we count among the criminal class"" thread, does not fully ring true when we've spent so much time embroiled in the damaging effects of his rape. All issues, all of which dent Outrage to a degree, none of which make it any less remarkable to find such an angle as the conclusion of a story at the start of the persecute, punish, and shun decade. Ida Lupino dives as deep into the depths of rape trauma as censorship practices would allow without directly naming the thing, exploring its isolating, paranoia-inducing, scarring nature as fully as possible, and breeched the surface again saying, ""No, these people CAN'T just suck it up and make it on their own without support, they really need professional therapy if they're to have a chance.""
Outrage is acknowledged as the second post-Code American film to tackle the subject of rape. It is, I think, illustrative towards understanding why Outrage is highlighted in the National Film Registry if we take a brief moment to consider the first such picture, Jean Negulesco's 1948 film Johnny Belinda - major prestige picture from Warner Bros. compared to Lupino's B-movie cheapie for RKO in its last days. You'll understand, Johnny Belinda is a great film in its own right, full on beautiful cinematography from Ted McCord and an embarrassment of fantastic performances, each of which earned their Academy Award nominations (four of a total eleven, one for each acting category), including Jane Wyman's winning turn as the deaf/mute farmgirl Belinda. I can easily see the film making the Registry one day on strength of its empathetic portrayal of these disabilities, Wyman's performance elevating what could easily read as cloying and exploitative into a potent examination of an innocent heart done wrong, yet as a portrayal of rape it is far weaker. Despite a harrowing act-ending assault of similar power to the one in Lupino's film, the effects of the aftermath are almost entirely focused on anyone other than the victim. Belinda's lover, Belinda's parents, Belinda's community, Belinda's baby, Belinda's rapist, Belinda's rapist's lover, all receive extended consideration for how Belinda suddenly coming down pregnant and not telling anyone how impacts THEM, while Belinda is left withdrawn for a single scene in the aftermath before she is consumed with joy at simply having a baby of her own. The horrors and evils of rape are left in purely abstracted terms, a plot point to make possible other character and thematic turns. We do not see the fear, nor the trauma, and perhaps most damningly, the recovery is presented as a snap, instantaneous thing. Johnny Belinda is a film with rape in it, not a film ABOUT rape.
We do not find the perfect film in Outrage, nor do we need to find the perfect film. What Ida Lupino delivers is a picture with an impressively effective means of visualizing trauma towards a goal of making the audience feel and understand its protagonist's suffering on a deeper level, and one with an impassioned cry for social support systems and mental health care atop this. If it does not fully rise beyond the issues of presenting male and female leads as a natural romantic pairing against its own better interests, I would say it is only because films which shoot well ahead of their time are rarely so ahead on ALL fronts. It is a good-verging-on-great film from a talent early in her development as a director who deserved far more shots than the paltry eight total she ultimately got. We're living now in a cinematic world partially built upon the daring and empathetic foundations she and her contemporaries laid, and it would do any body well to give Outrage the 75-minute chance it needs to make an impression on their lives. My analysis by way of summary above can only faintly capture the impact of actually watching for yourself.",3.5
"Possibly Ida Lupino's most famous movie (give or take The Hitch-Hiker) and one that largely lives up to the hype. Outrage moves seamlessly between melodrama and film noir to tell the story of a young woman who is sexually assaulted and the fallout the act brings. The film never explicitly says protagonist Ann Walton was raped, but all the same Lupino is quite frank about what happened, remarkably so for Hays Code-era Hollywood. Historical boldness aside, I was still very impressed with this film. Unlike Not Wanted, whose style and presentation felt at odds with each other, Outrage feels a lot more cohesive. Lupino uses the conventions and tone of noir to address the experiences of sexual violence which is emotionally realistic if not literally so. The first act in particular is remarkable, largely built around an incredibly tense and stalking scene, Lupino's camera capturing both the visceral horror and societal indifference to sexual violence. The immediate fallout which concerns both Ann's psychological damage and the stigma which attaches to her and her family are also rich (and sadly still ring true).
From here, the film starts to lose a bit of steam as the narrative shifts with Ann running away and trying to start a new romance, culminating on a climactic monologue spelling everything out so bluntly it makes Psycho's infamous end look positively subtle by comparison. The actual ending is interesting in how it resembles a happy ending without actually being one, but overall I do think the third act lets the film down just a bit. Still, Outrage is definitely a rewarding piece of cinema and singular within Old Hollywood.",3.5

"Only the second Hollywood film to address rape, this is a thoughtful and pioneering film directed by the trail-blazing Ida Lupino. It's not quite what I expected; in its focus on the men around Mala Powers' Annie, it really is more of an interrogation of male attitudes to women rather than a more straightforward exploration of trauma. It's very moving and its bittersweet ending avoids trying to draw a line under what has happened and feels very modern.",4.0

"""Em O Mundo Odeia-Me (1953), Lupino realiza uma espécie de transição. Seus filmes anteriores eram dramas intimistas protagonizados por uma personagem feminina. Aqui, não há personagens femininas e o drama dá espaço a um noir de estrada eletrizante, de apenas setenta minutos de duração. Baseado em casos reais, O Mundo Odeia-Me tem aquelas histórias fáceis de se introjetar no imaginário popular: um serial killer caroneiro. Filmado em locações reais na divisa com o México, o filme é extremamente sombrio durante as noites, com pontos intensos de luz iluminando apenas partes do quadro, e bastante sórdido durante o dia.

"5 Directors, 25 Films - Vol. III - Film #1/25
Director: Ida Lupino (Film #1/5)
As others have already noted, this feels so ahead of its time in terms of its themes. I was keeping my expectations at bay for what Ida Lupino would be like as a director considering the era but it was pretty great how stylistic her direction is. It's not the craziest ever, but her slight touches really make certain moments pop, especially in regards to the aforementioned themes that I think Lupino really makes shine. It's undoubtedly a B-movie but breaks through that barrier to become something so much more special than its peers.",3.5
"I was very impressed with this film. It is clearly dated in some areas (such as the fact that they can't just say the word ""rape""), but feels shockingly modern in others. The way that the film handles not only the emotional trauma Ann must deal with, but also the way that the patriarchal society neglects and abuses her constantly. Nearly every man in this film forces himself upon her in some way, even the ""good guys"" who are trying to help her. Her father wants to force his lifestyle on her. Her boyfriend wants to rush into their future in spite of her fears. She is forced into questionings and similar situations that she is simply not ready for, and after all of this, they try to blame her for it. The messages on display here are incredibly relevant and resonant even now, and the fact that Lupino crafted this in 1950 makes it even more outstanding.",4.0
"Transgressive for 1950, thanks to producer Ida Lupino and star Mara Powers (""Doomsday Machine""...man what a career comedown...). This was 19-year-old Powers' first movie, and she's stunningly beautiful -- and brilliant -- in the closing scenes where she's being given a Hollywood happy ending.
By the end of the movie Powers has grown up the hard way and is ready to be an independent woman (by semi-liberated postwar standards), but it looks like she's going to be denied that choice. Maybe she'll be happy in her new/old life, but maybe not. No doubt the Production Code prevented Lupino from having Powers explicitly state her doubts (can't question the sanctity of marriage), so we're left to guess her fate. Lupino paints it as probably bittersweet at best.
The word ""rape"" is never used (again: the Code) but the dialogue leaves zero doubt about what she goes through throughout the movie. ""Outrage"" is noteworthy because it's the kind of social guidance film exploitation films like ""Reefer Madness"" pretended to be. You've got explicit calls for damaged men to be sent to therapy rather than prison, where they just get released and rape again. And explicit calls for psychiatric help for rape victims -- and maybe for other female issues too? (OK, maybe not: ""Mad Men"" was still 15 years in the future.)",4.0

"Que buen ojo tenía Ida Lupino para la dirección: desde la secuencia de persecusión hasta las desrealizaciones de la protagonista.
Es una buen retrato de como era percibido este crimen; pero aquí no se enfocan en el crimen sino en el estrés postraumático de la protagonista.
La segunda parte es tranquilita, termina medio sosa y quizás de manera melodramática pero todo cierra perfectamente.
EDIT: A mi parecer no he sido justo en ese último párrafo: en la segunda parte es introducido un personaje sabio que ayudará a la protagonista en darle esperanzas, así que no me sorprende que al final dé un discurso elocuente ante los policías.",4.5

"Ann sale de su trabajo, de noche, camina distraída, silbando alegremente. Un vendedor de café que más de una vez se le insinuó sin éxito, la observa salir. El hombre apaga la luz de su pequeño puesto, se calza el sombrero y empieza a seguirla. Al mismo tiempo, la música que acompaña al alegre silbido, hasta entonces armónica, sutil y optimista, cambia: ahora el silbido sigue sonando en primer plano pero el acompañamiento pasa a ser en tonos graves y ominosos. Cada vez que Ann abandona la pantalla dejándonos a solas con el hombre, el silbido desaparece y la música oscura se apodera de la escena. Se genera un ida y vuelta entre los personajes y la música que acompaña a cada uno, hasta la música del perseguidor se convierte claramente en la principal, y al volver, el silbido, parece una irrupción desubicada y extraña. El hombre le grita a Ann un par de veces y ella empieza a silbar más lento y más despacio hasta dejar de hacerlo. Ahora es la música de tonos graves y pasos, los de ella, en cuadro, y los de él, pesados, rápidos, fuera de campo, amenazantes, hasta que un chiflido corta el aire en dos. La música desaparece y el momento más tenso y adrenalínico de la persecución se vale del sonido ambiente. El falso silencio amplifica cada paso, cada tacho de basura que se cae, cada afiche callejero rasgado, cada auto que pasa y cada bichito que zumba, cada grito desesperado y cada suspiro ahogado, mientras vemos al par de cuerpos moverse entre las sombras de un estacionamiento de camiones, sobretodo ella, buscando escondite, siempre reencuadrada entre maderas y grandes cuerpos metálicos, de forma que quede parcialmente oculta también a nuestra visión. Trata de esconderse dentro de un camión y accidentalmente toca la bocina. El sonido se hace eterno, se suspende en el tiempo e invade el aire de forma punzante e ineludible, tapando todo lo demás. Ahora es tarde para escapar, con el oído fuera de combate, monopolizado por el bocinazo, solo queda la visión que enseguida se borronea, con la baranda de una escalera de por medio entorpeciendo aún más la percepción, permitiendo captar poco más que una campera de cuero y una monstruosa e inconfundible cicatriz en el cuello. Los sentidos se anulan antes del hecho traumático, la cámara se aleja y el único hombre cerca no es más que un viejo vecino que se despierta sobresaltado por ese bocinazo atornillado a la noche, y no hace más que cerrar la ventana para escudarse un poco de él y tratar de descansar, mientras ni él ni nosotros ni nadie ve lo que pasa, ni siquiera Ann, que en su visión parcial no lograr librar a su violador del anonimato.
Al otro día, avergonzada, atormentada por las miradas de la gente, Ann vuelve a su trabajo. Así como los recursos sonoros fueron prominentes a la hora de mostrar el hecho traumático, también lo son para representar los efectos en su psiquis: los ruidos cotidianos de oficina se agrupan, se acompasan y se orquestan como una sinfonía de la irritación. El toc-toc de un hombre poniendo sellos, las hojas de papel dándose vuelta, el tamborileo de los dedos de una mujer, se solapan dando forma a un loop insano que crece en intensidad hasta que Ann explota en un grito y quiebra en llanto.
Ann, obedeciendo el lema Go west, young man! se escapa hacia Los Angeles, aunque se pierde a mitad de camino. Un hombre llamado Bruce Ferguson la encuentra y le permite quedarse con su familia. Ella se instala en esta nueva ciudad, consigue un trabajo, y empieza a sentirse cómoda a partir de la relación que va forjando con Bruce. Pero la mentira tiene patas cortas y en algún momento la verdad salta a la luz: Bruce se entera del pasado de Ann, y de que la están buscando. Ann, que deseaba quedarse por siempre en aquel lugar, ahora entiende que no puede escaparse de su pasado. El hecho traumático funciona como la mordaza fija de una prensa mecánica, donde su cabeza está apoyada constantemente. Puede vivir tranquilamente en esa posición hasta que la otra mordaza, la regulable, empieza a apretar: es el murmullo, las habladurías, la presión social que nuevamente vuelve a sentir cuando en su nuevo hogar se enteran de que fue violada.
Su nueva desadecuación queda clara al día siguiente en un baile del pueblo. Ella entra por un lado del cuadro, vemos la pista de baile repleta, pero ella la rodea, mientras la cámara pasa por el medio, entre las parejas, hasta encontrarse con ella nuevamente. Podría estar bailando despreocupada, ya totalmente integrada en su nuevo contexto social, pero no tolera que su pasado se conozca, se siente corrompida y juzgada a pesar de no tener ni un ápice de culpa. Es entonces cuando, nuevamente, un hombre la acosa, la sigue y se le tira encima. Caen cerca de una máquina de arar y el recuerdo de la violación se apodera de ella, pero esta vez, en lugar de paralizarse, atina a defenderse: sobre la máquina hay una llave, que Ann no duda en agarrar y estrolar en la cabeza del agresor. El hombre termina casi muerto, pero por obra en parte de la convención del happy ending y en parte gracias a cierto nuevo progresismo, herencia social del new deal de Roosevelt, -discurso de Bruce ante el juez de por medio- la justicia considera que Ann actuó en “estado de enajenación temporal”. No es legítima defensa, porque tampoco le iban a creer que un tipo considerado tan bueno y simpático, sin cicatrices monstruosas, iba a intentar violarla, pero que le sirve para zafar de la cárcel y, luego de enterarse de que encontraron a su primer agresor, volver a casa y retomar su vida donde la dejó.",4.5
ida lupino inventó a los aliados,4.0
"Film puissant sur le viol et ses conséquences sur la victime, Outrage marque surtout pour sa maîtrise formelle qui ressort lors de deux moments de bravoure : le drame du début et la scène de bal vers la fin, les deux points de bascule de l'intrigue en somme. Lupino gère l'espace parfaitement, jouant de profondeur de champ et de plans large en plongée, pour créer une tension dingue, alors que Mala Powers touche par son jeu plein de justesse. L'autre point fort du film est son rythme et son efficacité. Le film passe en un clin d'oeil et parvient à développer son récit sans accroc ni sans laisser sur notre faim. La galerie de personnages rencontrés est aussi intéressante, particulièrement le pasteur qui va l'aider. Un film vraiment abouti donc, reprenant les codes du film noir pour les employer dans une histoire assez terrible, dont l'ingéniosité est de ne pas se focaliser sur l'enquête mais bel et bien le traumatisme provoqué par tout ça.

extremely relevant even today to show the mentality of a sexual assault survivor. even the most minor characters had incredible depth & the most subtle movements by mala powers contributed a lot to the emotions her character was going through. just shocking how real this movie is to rape culture considering it’s from decades ago,4.5
"It's incredible that one of the pioneers of women filmmakers in Hollywood was able to do so while also making socially-conscious films. While Never Fear, the polio drama I watched for my list last year, is now mainly a fascinating relic, Outrage's outrage is unfortunately still very relevant. Ida Lupino's direction and Mala Powers' performance do so much with so little spoken, from the distressing chase scene, to showing symptoms of PTSD, to the serenity on Powers' face as she takes in the countryside and the resolve in her voice at the end. The script clearly had a much harder time navigating the 50s studio system. The most frustrating moment is when the film tries to draw a firm line between the same actions of its scarred criminal assailant and a thought-reputable man. Even the ostensibly sensitive men in the picture often act egregiously. Still, based on the strengths of its more understated qualities and knowledge of Lupino's attitudes, one has to wonder how much the overall damning portrait of a patriarchal society should be read as the intended text.

"Mala Powers is amazing in this - her performance is heartbreaking.

Week 18: Auteur - Ida Lupino
It’s interesting to see a movie from 1950 tackle this subject matter, and I doubt that there were few that could have done it with the level of nuance and sympathy that Lupino brought. Lupino focuses on Ann in the aftermath of her assault and the difficulty of her recovery, while presumably most other male filmmakers, even today, would veer into thriller territory and make the focus of the narrative on her attacker. While it does veer into melodrama towards the end, it’s still a pretty bold and refreshingly honest take, and one that further highlights just how under appreciated Ida Lupino is.",4.0

La protagonista es violada, pero el acto no se muestra en cámara, ni se usa la palabra ""violación"". Lupino sabe que en una sociedad como la filmada hay palabras que nunca se dicen, y que frecuentemente las personas que creen ayudar son otra versión del mal.

"Ida Lupino's dated film about rape must have been controversial at the time but it is a little frustrating to watch in a modern context. Lupino and her husband made conscious decisions to make ""issue"" films, like The Bigamist, and this one which is a brave thing to do. In Hollywood things did not move past her film until the late 70s perhaps with Anne-Claire Poirier's Mourir-A-Tue-Tete (1979) aka A Scream from Silence. Being an aficionado of films from the 70s, it felt like 75 % of all movies had rape scenes in them. I would argue mostly to shock or titillate, or both. So, in that light, Lupino's film is ahead of it's time while also being dated. It is not her best but worth a look.",3.0

Lo único que se siente algo insatisfactorio es el final, con un alegato que sale medio de la nada (pero que no está mal en sí mismo) y la decisión de mandar a la protagonista a su hogar sin hacerla partícipe de la misma.

"Outrage, although a short film but unique in its own way, this film is noir. The films protagonist is a victim to a criminal assault which than leads to her insecurities and paranoia to the environment around her but eventually healing herself again. This film falls under crime and thriller along with drama which syncs well with the noir -style filming. I believe the infrastructure of the film was a bit off because some scenes were a bit innocent looking to the story being told. The café stand kind of threw off the antagonist introduced because it is unlikely for a character of that type to be developed in that area or maybe to me, it’s just something that was new, again, to me anyways. Usually characters in these types of films come from jobs “rough around the edges”. I think everything else seemed to coincide with every situation and conversation going on. In the end, the unexpected café server from the stand, still worked out because a bit of the criminal’s history is revealed. Most noir films are used for crime situations because of the vibes they carry which is the black and white shadow look for the mystery and drama. For the story being told, noir fit perfectly well. I found many of the noir shots interesting because of their distinctive angular and shadow views. One memorable shot is when Ann is attacked where high and low shots are shown, building up suspense until her predator catches up to her. Shots and angles like these still work in modern films because it leaves the viewers imagination wondering. During the progress of the movie, audience can get a sense of drama and sexual motivation which is what the film reveals and if audience consider it love, Ann does find it again during her healing process with Bruce. Some might not think its love, and some might think it is but ultimately, he is someone like her fighting the same battle. Personally, the movie was very meaningful in terms of mental sickness and wellness because I saw a woman who was strong enough to face the world and live with her fear but also heal from it. I also saw a woman who went through many changes in that short time frame for something cruel that happened in an instant, did it make her a better person in the end? Whether it did or not is up to the viewers, but I know she finally accepted what happened and moved on with her life.",0.0
"""sometimes i feel as if the whole world is upside down""
being a b-movie from the 1950s about rape, its pretty incredible how well done this is and how it addresses so many nuanced social issues (despite the very paternalistic overtones throughout)
its also much easier to digest than modern films dealing with rape, likely because of the restrictions of the hays code as well as the euphemistic language used at the time. in this sense, it effectively illustrates the point that you don't need to show rape in order to depict how devastating it is.",4.0

"100 Years Of Film - Outrage (1950)
Outrage starts out very strongly but then loses its pace a bit. It's definitely a brave film that handles very heavy topics quite well for the early 1950s. The directing being done by Ida Lupino, giving this film a female perspective, must've have definitely helped. The script is a weak point as well as the score that doesn't seem to fit the film at all. However, the main actress Mara Powers and her character never feel over the top or exploitative. The whole time she feels very sincere and true.",3.5
"Director Ida Lupino deserves tremendous credit for tackling the subject of rape in this 1950 film.  Handcuffed by the taboo subject, the word rape was not used once in the film instead the word assault was used.  Yet the emotional toll and impact on the victim was raw and clear.  Conveniently contrived at times, this can be overlooked for the sake of the bigger picture.",3.5

I love Lupino’s direction. She doesn’t get enough credit.",4.0
"Surprised that a film from this decade is able to discuss issues of sexual assault, even if it can't explicitly say the right words. I'd prefer that much more time was given to Anne figuring out on her own how to deal with this tramatic event, rather than her wandering around aimlessly, having other men guide her. However, with that said, Lupino's attentive direction gives us a great leading performance (in Mala Powers) and a first and third act that feel tightly directed, even if the middle portion isn't as smoothly paced.
But by God, that Chase scene is easily one of the best directed scenes that Lupino has created so far.",3.0
Somehow this movie discusses rape better than most movies made 70 years later. Truly astounding. I wish Ida had been able to make much much more. She knew what she was doing.,5.0
"""Outrage"" is about rape, though the word is never mentioned. Directed and cowritten by Ida Lupino,
it concerns a young woman (Mala Powers) who is engaged to be married and is raped on her way home from work. Traumatized and filled with shame, she runs away from home. She ends up in a community where she is attended to by a minister. However, she doesn't tell him what happened to her. Problems arise.
Though made 56 years ago, the elements of the film ring true, and of course, feelings don't change - the victim thinks she's dirty and behaves as if she is the criminal.
Mala Powers gives a very good performance, exhibiting the shock, nervousness, and terror of the victim. Though the script meanders a bit, Lupino does an excellent job of directing, particularly the action scenes.
In 1950, this film was probably ahead of its time. It's good to see to show us where we were (particularly with no DNA tests or rape kits) and where we are.",2.5
"Operating within the narrative and prudential contraints of the time, Lupino delivers an incredibly powerful film essaying rape culture.",4.0
"I discussed this film and others with Christian and Zā on the Gilded Films Podcast.

What we have here is a very profound examination of a woman who survives a sexual assault, led by a stunning performance from Mala Powers. Being one of the very first films to approach this subject matter, I was pretty nervous for how the film would approach the topic. While the treatment obviously isn't perfect, I have to say that it's much better than I expected for a film made in 1950.
I think a large reason for that is the direction from Ida Lupino. Just the fact that the film is directed by a woman makes a huge difference, and Lupino does some really good work here. The most striking scene is the lead-up to the assault itself. While the assault is not shown on screen, the tense build-up is enough to leave the viewer terrified. And I really appreciated a lot of how the film presented the central character after the assault. We witness her continuing anxiety, the long-lasting effects of the trauma, and even some explanations of the paralysis she experiences during the event.
Like I said, it's not perfect, but I'm pretty impressed with what we have here.",4.0

"My second Ida directorial feature. Saw at TCM Fest 2018 at the Egyptian Theater. Wrecked me. The single most challenging, terrifying, and accurate portrayal of rape and the trauma of its aftermath i’ve seen. ",5.0
"There is something doubly startling about a rape scene coming after an introductory act this classical: the black and white, the banter, the bold melodramatic acting, they paint a picture of a world we've been trained to think of as safe. Pleasantville isn't meant to contain perverts. There is something almost Lynchian about it, the wrongness not just of the act itself, but it's cinematic context.
The sequence is stunningly crafted even in its own rights though, Lupino balancing suspense with a brutal fatalism. The thoughts that run through your head during the tense stretch are all in the past tense, resigned ""If only...""s, but that doesn't let you look away. What really elevates the film though is the way that it too refuses to avert its gaze from this girl after the act, it cares about the consequences of this crime.
Lupino's works are all torn between times, there are elements in all of them that are brilliantly progressive, but they are compromised by others that succumb to more common social ideas of the era. The treatment of trauma is terrific, but its use as a plot point in the climax is problematic. That temporary insanity brought on by PTSD and not, say, self defence is the legal out seems baffling, as does visiting Frank in the hospital.
It's tempting to say that this is baby steps, Lupino pushing where she needed to and ceding where she didn't, but the moral and sexual regression of cinema that followed suggests maybe she shouldn't have bothered trying to make this more palatable for the boars.",3.5
"That. Was. Wonderful. Inasmuch as a film about rape could ever be wonderful.
Beautifully filmed, acted with perhaps a touch more hysteria than I would have liked but I'll forgive that because every other performance was so perfectly calibrated to realness and subtlety. And what an excellent plot, my goodness. After a pretty terrifying beginning which I knew Ida would do to the nth and she did, the emotional journey Ann took had me with her every step of the way. And my god, were the euphemisms of ""vicious attack"" and ""criminal assault"" infuriating. Fucken Hays Code.
What I didn't expect was the super interesting insight into the justice system and the film's critique of that as well as society at the time. Just when I was wincing at the word ""neurotics"", the very next line was one about the importance of social welfare and support and rehabilitation. There was an interesting note of sympathy even for the rapist in terms of his own damaged psyche, but then I didn't quite care for the insinuation that such a criminal is an exception rather than a creation of a toxic masculine society, but hey gotta make allowance for then and now. Still, my god, every time I braced myself for nauseating Fifties morality or psychobabble or sentiment, this film surprised by doing exactly not that. Go, Ida et al.
Interesting too how paternalistic that courtroom scene was. Male judge, male DA, male clergy speaking on behalf of Ann. Which is all too reflective of gender disparity in courts, I know, but the fact that they all spoke for her and made decisions for her WITHOUT consulting her smacked of the most infuriating paternalism. And suddenly I realised that if it was a man behind the camera, I would assume that paternalism was totally condoned. But a woman was behind the camera, and not just any woman but Ida Lupino who routinely defied male studio execs and their systems of power, Ida Lupino who knew exactly how to get every bit of power she could within the male-dominated industry and studio system. Knowing that turns the courtroom scene of paternalism into a great subtle critique of that system, I like to think. I hope.
I'm not entirely sure I cared for the holy male helping Ann out of her trauma, but then again I also liked that she did find one male who didn't pose a sexual threat to her. And he was certainly played that way. There may have been an emotional attraction to her but it was very subtle and could very easily be either ignored or explained away as compassion rather than any sort of predatory behaviour. I think it was also really helped by the total vagueness about his church and no association with any recognisable religion, no collar or cross or symbol. That made him much easier to accept, much more normalised.
The moment she knelt by his chair and he talked about going away and she wanted to go with him, I had this sudden epiphany (haha) that I was pretty much watching St John Rivers and Jane Eyre. Except this was a much much sweeter kinder St John, the St John he should have been instead of the incorruptible fucktard he actually was in the book. If he had been like this, Jane would have gone anywhere with him. And I was like, ""Omg I bet Ida Lupino loved Jane Eyre.""
AND THEN I REMEMBERED DEVOTION.
I haven't watched it yet. As a fierce Bronte reader, I have been avoiding it for yonks, trying to choose the right moment.
So yeah, no doubt she did.
The ending really surprised me. On one hand, I love the ruthless elegance of it, and that we never get to see the family reunion of tears and joy and falling into each other's arms. That Ida trusts us to imagine it well enough. On the other hand, I kinda would have liked to see how she would have reined back the sentiment to depict something beautiful and just restrained enough. I would have liked to see how Ann and her fiance mended their relationship. Just two or three more scenes would have been enough.
I like that this was Mala Powers' first film, apparently. What a way to start a career, gosh.",5.0

"A Atriz e Diretora Ida Lupino ousou trazer à tona um tema bem delicado em plena década de 50.
Em uma época em que se mantinham os problemas dentro de casa e longe dos olhos da sociedade, Ela nos apresenta uma jovem que é abusada sexualmente por um homem que a observa diariamente (um dos fatos deste tipo de violência é justamente que o criminoso é alguém próximo à vítima).
E todo o trauma vivenciado pela protagonista é maximizado na forma em que precisa enfrentar o medo e também o julgamento daqueles que a observam em seu dia-a-dia.

"There’s an emotional purity flowing in the dialogue, a rather outmoded purity that’s both a reflection + expression of its time. For a film entitled Outrage dealing w one of the most sensitive social nerves of our time, I was a bit underwhelmed by the fifties self-restraint. But Lupino herself admits that the censorship effected more complex ideas + representations, and ultimately one cannot possibly attack a work for being prescient, precocious, and still very angry at its core. The outrage is as real as the problem.",4.0
"Again a mixture of good and bad things. The look is great. I love the whole rape scene but it does have its problems. Why does it take her so long to stand up when she falls down? Why does the car horn keep sounding when she has gone out of the car? One can argue that this is all from her perspective, the way she is experiencing what is happening, but then the camera work does not support that. The point of view is not hers. Still a very interesting and daring film. SPOILERS. Ida Lupino even has compassion of the rapist in the end. WOW!",3.5

As the camera pulls farther and farther out. She doesn't need us to see it. We don't need to see it. Then, a man, on the right hand side of the frame, appears at his window open - he shuts it, shaking his head.
The difference between us and him, however, is that neither us or she couldn't do anything about it. He could've investigated, he could've looked, he could've done something. And yet.

"The story of young girl Anne, who is raped (""a victim of criminal assault"") shortly before her marriage by a vendor. She cannot cope with the situation afterwards, and breaks up with her fiancé, even though he proposes that they can leave capitol city and live somewhere else, where nobody knows their past. She flees by herself and ends up working on an orange farm under another name.
Mala Powers fills the broken and frightened girl Anne with much sympathy so that we can feel her plight and see how one incident changes her personality completly.
Lupino does a fine directing job: After the rape, when Anne returns to work, we see how nervous she is. The stamping of paper and nails clacking on desk by colleagues is in close up repeated and the sound intensified until Anne breaks together. The same happens during a lineup of criminals at the police office (since TV series ""Life on Mars"" you wonder why a lineup with the vitim protected behind glas was not invented earlier).",3.0

I was really liking the film until the very end and then it fell off a cliff.

"This film is one that could, understandably, be seen by modern viewers as old fashioned, even prudish. But it is important in watching a film like this to remember that at the time it was released, it was considered bold and daring for taking on the topic that it does . . . the rape of a woman and the trauma that she experiences in the aftermath of the attack. The film seems old fashioned now because the word ""rape"" is never uttered in the film, and the ways in which it discusses the issue are often veiled and tempered. However, it is an important step in film exploring these kinds of concerns.
The story centers around Ann (Mala Powers, in her debut), a young bookkeeper, who is finally able to marry her fiance Jim due to his recent receiving of a raise. One night, when she is working late, she is followed by a man who runs a coffee stand where she works and is attacked and raped (obviously we do not see the rape itself, but the buildup stalking that leads to the attack is very well done). After the attack, Ann faces a variety of issues. People in town (mostly women) are gossiping about her, and even though her family and her finance are supportive, that support comes with an expectation that she ""get over it"" and move on with her life. Because she cannot do this, she runs away and finds herself lost on the side of the road. She twists her ankle and is rescued by a clergyman, Bruce, who cares for her and sets her up in a new job at a ranch. After she is harassed by another man, she hits him with a ranch and is prosecuted for it, but Bruce is able to get her off by explaining what has happened to her and the kind of mental state that she is in. After some time of therapy, she wants to return to Bruce, but he insists that she go home and return to marry Jim, which she does.
While Powers gives a very good performance as Ann, the character herself could be considered problematic. She often seems helpless and completely dependent on the men around her. While much of this is a result of the trauma she has experienced, the film does seem to insist that she cannot work through her own trauma, nor can she rely on any women for assistance. Therefore the film puts the viewer in the double bind of seeing the men around Ann as responsible for the trauma that she experiences and her general sense of entrapment, but at the same time are the only source of healing for her. This lead to the unsatisfying, but intriguing, ""happy ending"" that is actually quite dour or melancholy. We know that Ann is not fully ""healed,"" and we are not thrilled by the idea of her returning to the fiance who, when we last saw him, was shaking Ann and shouting in her face. However, we also recognize that this is the only end that the censors would have allowed at the time.
What the film does achieve very well is putting us in the mental space of Ann. In addition to Powers' strong performance, Lupino has several sequences that intentionally create a subjective view of Ann's experience through the manipulations of visuals and sound. These are all the more powerful because they are not overly ""arty"" or overly long. They are just enough to put us near Ann's mental space, which is the main thing that the film seems to be striving for.",4.0
"First Ida Lupino!
(somedays later I came to find this in fact wasn't my first Ida Lupino--A little Letterboxd dive into depictions of nuns and I come to see another movie of hers that I remember watching with my parents growing up--The Trouble with Angels. Though I haven't rewatched that movie, or even recall too much of it, I am taken aback that I wasn't made aware of Ida at all, especially as a kid who expressed interest in directing.
One of the beautiful things I am finding in what I am deeming as my film education in 2024 is the absolute BOUNTY of talent to dive into. There's beautiful Varda to experience, a history of Almodóvar to relish, and more delicious freak shit to devour (again great thanks to my subscription to Girls, Guts, Giallo--a most excellent investment). Most of what I have been consuming speaks to the budding film faggot brewing in me all along--something that I didn't get to explore fully despite my various returns and attempts in more constrained childhood.
What's wild about the Ida of it all is how this entryway was there at one point--a woman director (who frankly reminds me more of my grandmother than even Shirley--if you can believe!) who was making films about rape culture fully ahead of the ~times~ Watching this in 2024 feels like a damn miracle--but her work 16 years later was a celebrated moment in my childhood home.
I am writing this minutes before therapy, so you can imagine I am making these connections with great healing in mind. But really, rad as hell to see Ida's work fall right into my film education",4.5

"Bonne idée d'Ida

C'est avec un certain désappointement que je constate que le film est comme une montgolfière qui n'a plus de feu à la moitié du parcours.
La première partie est magistralement mise en scène, très bien écrite et très audacieuse pour l'époque. Là où la seconde tombe dans le cliché pur et dur qui nous offre une partie d'ennuie assez mémorable.
C'est vraiment troublant j'ai le sentiment que le métrage contient deux films totalement distinct en son sein qui ne créent aucune osmose entre eux.
Et c'est dommage car parler d'agression sexuel dans les années 50 c'est vraiment pas simple (notamment avec le code Hays). Mais on peut néanmoins souligner et féliciter le geste en dehors de toute considération qualitative
Bref film important malgré une seconde partie très en dessous.

Sai reflexiva do filme pensando o que conseguimos mudar nesses 74 anos? não muito aparentemente..",4.5

Fascinating movie, fascinating to see something like trauma and PTSD described without the language for it being developed yet. It's also interesting to see similar societal expectations surrounding something so tragic. There are similarities in male entitlement, men either not understanding or ignoring how their actions might come across to another human being. The idea of women being something different has always been around, like heavenly creatures that aren't quite the same thing as humans or less charitably like object for desire. We see both ends of the spectrum with her two attackers. The rapist simply whistles at her like a dog in addition to treating her like someone to be bargained for. Frank or whoever is coming from the ""women are so beautiful I just want one"" end of the spectrum, which someone could use to delude themselves into thinking they're being complimentary. Sadly that attitude takes a long time to go away, and probably never will because we're human. We can also see the modern problem of visibility reflected in the past. Rape is a deeply personal, private thing to undergo, and there's an inherent additional pain that a victim has to go through: reporting. We want to solve the crime, we want catch the bad guy, and it's a brutal balance to try and walk. We see the detective demanding answers, and he certainly seems to be on the side of justice, yet we also see how excruciating it is for her. The crime is public because, well, it's a crime, people want to solve it. This forces her to see her deepest trauma and fears in people around her, which is well-illustrated with sound especially, seemingly mundane things overwhelming her. We may not have small-town gossip, but we do have sensationalist news and social media. People love scandal, people love to be able to pass moral judgement on others, and that's something that hasn't changed since 1950.
Brucie is great, he's empathetic and helpful and even a little bit respectful (for the era?). He does kind of insist she go out to the valley with him but he does also seem to respect her body language, at least much more than some others. I got choked up at his line of ""Now I understand you are innocent"" and how hard he fights for her in court. He's coming face to face with a new experience and is loving and caring in response.
One thing I am a little bit iffy on is Jim, and really the ending in general. I get that people probably shouldn't be judged on one decision or mistake, but sometimes mistakes and conduct and words reveal character traits. When the chips were down, when Ann was in distress, Jim was 100% selfish. Could he have had good motives? Sure, perhaps he's just a reflection of the times, not understanding what she needed. It is still difficult for me to see the way he behaved and think ""yea this is a happy ending going back to ol' Jim"". This may actually be a movie where I wish the two leads did get together. Bruce's intentions were so pure that he truly feels like a representation of what a person needs to heal. Heck maybe even have no romance to demonstrate that you don't need to get married to be happy.
Most of the film's stylistic positives are the aforementioned depiction of PTSD, but there's also some effective visual juxtaposition. That picture of her in the white dress is the clearest example. Multiple times it's looked at as a sort of mourning of her previous innocence. We also see a strong contrast between her attitude in the intro, her running away, and her sunny disposition in life. That attitude change is nothing revolutionary or incredible, but it is sold well by Mala Powers who has a wonderful brightness to her face when happy.",4.0

Very daring in its depictions of sexual assault and the subsequent trauma as a result. Powers has an effective dissociative stare, but her more elevated moments of performance don't seem suited for this manner of contemplation. Still, there are several great scenes, such as the second pursuit that ends with self-defense (something gets me about the fact that he decides not to press charges). However, all of it gets ruined by that ending, where she takes on the counseling and goes back home (back to her boyfriend who grabbed her by the arms, unable to see her mental anguish). I really don't see it as a happy or satisfactory ending, even though the movie clearly frames it as such. More justice was needed, imo, or just adapt the story in a way where some grandstanding solution wasn't required.",3.0

"A powerful film about the traumatic aftershocks of a woman’s rape. While the high contrast lighting in the opening credits and an early incidence of sexual harassment foreshadow the crime, the first section of the film mostly just establishes Ann’s normal life and daily routine, especially her relationship with her parents and fiancé. By showing us Ann’s happy, normal life, Lupino is able to set up a chilling contrast with life after the attack.
The attack itself is a stunning passage of cinema that effectively uses some of the subjective techniques Lupino establishes in her first two films. The sequence begins with a disturbing shot with the stalker in the foreground of a deep focus shot of her walking down the stairs of her workplace. We then track behind him as he catcalls her. These early shots from his perspective—establishing the threat—quickly shift to shots from her perspective that emphasize her terror and helplessness. For example, the track forward from behind the attacker is mirrored by a backwards tracking shot of Ann quickly walking towards the camera. After he whistles, both she and the camera freeze until he appears in the background before Lupino cuts to another setup. There is no music in the sequence until the very end, emphasizing the sounds of footsteps and her horrifying cries for help.
Lupino uses high contrast lighting to create deep, threatening shadows and long shots that emphasize the empty streets and alleyways. Right before the attack, we get a POV shot of him standing over her, slightly blurred, before the camera cranes back and up, ending the sequence with him walking toward her. The tone and visual look of the film completely changes at this point; when she returns home, it too is filled with dark shadows, as if the alleys have invaded her house. When she recounts the attack to the police, Lupino keeps it in a single shot, the camera positioned behind her bed so that the bars of the headboard cut across her face as if her own room is now a prison.
The rest of the film develops the aftereffects of this trauma, keeping us within her subjective position. There is a brilliant sequence in the office in which she flinches after a co-worker pats her on the back. The film then crosscuts between her traumatized face and closeups of a guy stamping papers, the noise of the stamping greatly exaggerated, giving us a subjective soundtrack. Mala Powers gives a moving and devastating performance as Ann, oscillating between a Bresson-like blank face and explosions of expressive fear and pain. The character’s body language is completely transformed, changing from calm and confident to skittish and small, especially when around male characters.
The film isn’t perfect: there is a reverend introduced in the second half of the film who not only tries to force Ann to get better but also gives a misguided courtroom monologue towards the end that seems to blame sexual violence on the fact that there are too many insane people because the courts can’t handle them all. This shifts the film a bit too much into “social problem” territory, displacing the centrality of sexual violence with vague attempts to diagnose society’s ills as a whole. While it is possible to read these moments as critiques of religion and the courts as complicit with rape culture, they take the film away from its powerful, incisive look at trauma. However, the film is still essential viewing for its unflinching exploration of Ann’s subjectivity and how the violence of her attack colors the rest of her life. It is a stunning, phenomenal piece of cinema.",3.0

Lupino does a great job in creating Powers into a character we, as women, can emphasize with. Her struggle is more than real, and her falls reflect that struggle perfectly.
I must talk about that assault scene as well. What an amazingly sensitive, smart, and painful look into assault. Truly a moment that could only be written and directed by a women.

"The film’s most daring scene, where the vendor stalks and corners lead actress Mala Powers on a lonely night, is as scary as a horror movie; in its look and feel, it could even be a Val Lewton production.
Ida Lupino’s direct, simple style is highly effective. She frames a few striking compositions, like the view of Powers through the encaging slats of a truck - trapped. Her additional credit as co-writer pays dividends, because the film is patently rooted in an authentically female perspective. Everywhere Powers goes, she is preyed on by creepy men; one police officer notes how common this conduct is.
Lupino’s chief focus is on the aftermath of the crime: the surreal nature of resuming everyday life, represented through the mundane yet unbearable noises of the office; the shame and silence of Powers’ family; the trauma, brilliantly realised through the trappings of noir.
Notwithstanding the confused tone of the music, both director and actress suggest troubling uncertainty in the ending. For an obscure little B-movie, this is a corker. Powerful, progressive work.",3.0

"Outrage is directed by the right person, a woman, and Ida Lupino at that! It clearly needs a female point-of-view as it very obviously exists in a Hollywood run by men. Ms. Lupino is one of the credited screenwriters along with two men, and her influence is immeasurable.
The story is centered around Ann (Mala Powers) a woman from a very middle class and conservative American family. She is on the verge of being married to a safe husband who has just been promoted with a raise at his job. Then tragedy strikes as Ann is sexually assaulted as she walks home from work at night. So traumatized, she can't remember what her assailant looks like except that he has a scar on his neck. That assailant is first seen selling her two pieces of cake that she is taking to her soon-to-be fiancé as he aggressively flirts with her making her extremely uncomfortable. Seeing her walk alone, he makes his move (in a very intense foot chase). In fact, Ms. Lupino starts off the picture by showing part of this chase in her opening credits (we are unaware of this until later when the event actually happens) then starts off the story proper to return to this key moment very soon.
Eventually Ann decides to return to work (much too soon according to everyone around her, and that much is clear) and as she talks herself into being confident about it, she overhears her Father obnoxiously comment how he was stared at by everyone. He clearly less concerned about the assault perpetrated on his daughter, and more about the reputation of the family. This theme will continue to play out over the rest of the short (75 minute) running time. Any longer though, and the message would have been lost.
Going to work is a bad idea, as Ann sees everyone tiptoeing and whispering around her. Whether real or imagined, she suffers a breakdown and boards a bus - one-way - to Los Angeles without telling anyone at all that she is leaving. She gets sidetracked during the journey, and thanks to a sprained ankle is picked up in a delirium at the side of the road by a reverend named Bruce (Tod Andrews). She gives him a false name, and nervously begins a new life in a small town, freaking out almost completely when she sees an officer of the law appear. Reports of her missing are reported on the radio, so she stays under the radar. Bruce sees that she is haunted by something, and takes her under his wing trying to reach her and THANKFULLY the picture avoids any hints of some sort of romantic relationship here (most films, they would probably end up in love and married in the end.)
It is at this point where Ms. Lupino's guiding hand becomes the most obvious and important (slightly spoilerly here- but not outright, but in any case, a heads up). At a town dance, Ann is hit upon by an exceptionally overly-aggressive male. She begs him to leave her alone, but he chases her clawing at her and trying to literally force her to kiss him. She has a flashback to her other fateful night, bad things happen and Ann finds herself in trouble. She goes to court for her actions and that is when Bruce figures out what her problem is - trauma from her other assault (they also finally discover who she really is). Surrounded by men, her mental state is discussed while officials in the town still want to hold her accountable even when the good-natured male ""victim"" is convinced to waive all charges. Here is where the picture gets complicated. The men - and script - all seem to focus on Ann's past trauma as a source of her problems (and don't get me wrong, they are) BUT seems to whitewash the fact that the man from the dance is very guilty, making her actions against him clearly self defense. Ms. Lupino seems to be the only one aware of this, and that is why I think that the incident at the dance are way more explicit than if it was just an innocent flirtation. Also for a picture released in 1950, it does not shy away from the fact that Ann was raped. The word is never spoken, but it doesn't have to be. The perpetrator walks right up to her as she lays helpless, and as the camera blacks out, it is very obvious to all watching what is happening to Ann in this moment. Ms. Lupino does not sugar coat the fact that Ann is very much lost in a world of men where as a victim, more guilt for what happened to her is placed on her and when she defends herself against a male who - innocently or not - comes on to her like this one does, the town still wants to find her guilty EVEN AFTER the charges are waived. Ann is too messed up to spell out what happened to her at the dance, but would it matter? I don't think so, and neither does Ms. Lupino. While it feels like the picture is letting itself down by the actions of the men in the end, even though one of them is protecting her, behind-the-scenes it is clear that Ms. Lupino has a layer of subtext threaded into the story. Ann is a victim of the patriarchy here on all levels. Her father puts pressure on her (but her fiancé at least is a decent fellow), she's become a town shame thanks to a crime against her and then later, when she defends herself against an uncomfortable situation, they still want to paint her guilty.
The picture is flawed overall, but thankfully the short running time helps it (again, thankfully, avoiding any sort of romantic subplot with the reverend that in most other cases, would have been added in). It will make you think, but it will also make you angry at what this woman has to go through in a situation where her greatest crime is that she is attractive, walked home alone and just wants to be left alone by over-zealous (and sexually entitled) men.",3.0

Es gab nur zwei Hollywoodfilme zu Zeiten des Hays Code die sich mit dem Thema Vergewaltigung auseinandersetzen: Schweigende Lippen aus dem Jahr 1948 und Outrage zwei Jahre später - und es ist absolut bemerkenswert was Ida Lupino als Regisseurin und Drehbuchautorin auf die Leinwand bringt. Mala Powers brilliert in ihrem Debüt als junge Frau die eines Abends vergewaltigt wird, an ihrer Seite gefällt Tod Andrews als Reverend und von Anfang bis Ende zeigt Lupino was für eine starke Filmemacherin sie doch war. Da geht einem eine laute Autohupe ebenso wie ein Stempel der immer wieder auf das Papier knallt durch Mark und Bein, berührt einem das Schicksal der von Mala Powers verkörprten Ann Walton zu jeder Sekunde, das fehlende Einfühlungsvermögen bei so einer grauenhaften Tat und dass die Opfer mit ihrem Trauma oft alleine gelassen werden und die Probleme die daraus resultieren. Schweigende Lippen ist überraschend für die Zeit sehr schonungslos ohne voyeuristisch zu sein, toll gefilmt, berührt mit dem Leidensweg seiner Protagonistin und mit welch stilsicheren Hand das alles von Ida Lupino zusammengeführt wird ist jede Anerkennung wert.
=========================================
There were only two Hollywood films during the Hays Code era that dealt with the topic of rape: Johnny Belinda from 1948 and Outrage two years later - and it is absolutely remarkable what Ida Lupino brings to the screen as director and screenwriter. Mala Powers shines in her debut as a young woman who is raped one evening, Tod Andrews is at her side as a reverend and from start to finish Lupino shows what a strong filmmaker she was. A loud car horn as well as a stamp that repeatedly hits the paper goes through your heart and soul, the fate of Ann Walton, played by Mala Powers, touches you every second, the lack of empathy in such a horrible act and the fact that the victims are involved are often left alone due to their trauma and the problems that result from it. Outrage is, surprisingly for its time, very ruthless without being voyeuristic, beautifully filmed, touching with the suffering of its protagonist and the stylish hand with which Ida Lupino brings it all together is worth every recognition.",3.5

"Enjoyed it quite a bit. I can definitely tell why it was shocking and controversial at the time of its release in the 50s but it’s still effective in my opinion and does it job. It almost gave me film noir vibes, very well made. Beyond that, the performances were really good and believable. The main actress does a great job and so do all the others. The plot is definitely sensitive subject matter, especially for the 50s but it does shed light on this issue. I feel like this film was really ahead of it’s time for being in the 50s. There are some cheesy writing moments however so that combined with the subject matter which could be sensitive, I can’t give it a higher rating but it was still quite good and enjoyable.",4.0

Ida Lupino, once again, approaches heavy topics so thoughtfully and sensitively. I felt dread the moment Ann walked out of her office the night she was attacked. Unfortunately, the knot in our stomachs is something we STILL feel today just walking to do everyday errands. The threat is always there.
The end kind of floundered a little for me, but it’s still absolutely a solid picture for the time it was made.
Also, note to filmmakers, this is how you can show some of the aftermath of SA without showing the assault. The audience still felt palpable fear without seeing the violence.",4.0
"A woman is viscously attacked and raped on her way home from work. She is in shock and can't remember the man who did it, she just saw a scar on his neck. Her parents and fiance try to help her but she can't cope and runs away. She finds work and a new friend, the local Reverend, in another town. When another man tries it on she hits him with a wrench and nearly kills him. The Rev. helps her avoid charges by pleading temporary insanity due to flashbacks of the attack. She learns the attacker has been captured and decides to return home but seems to have fallen in love with the Rev. Will she or won't she return home? She will, which I was disappointed at to be honest! But it was a good movie nonetheless.

"En Outrage se busca transmitir la subjetividad de la protagonista, Ann Walton, al espectador. Al tratarse de un personaje que está en ""el ojo de un huracán”, hay momentos en que los aspectos formales se vuelven más intensos que en una película convencional de la época. Por ejemplo, en la escena en que se le pide identificar sospechosos, la escena empieza convencionalmente, pero el detective se le va acercando y el sonido de su voz empieza a volverse más intenso. El detective termina siendo una figura imponente que llena el plano, semejando a los mismos sospechosos tras de él. El montaje se vuelve rítmico y acelerado, mientras que los sonidos empiezan a sobreponerse unos encima de los otros de una manera irreal y sugestiva. Todo esto apoyado por una música extradiegética; cuerdas agudas y ligeramente disonantes que realzan la tensión del momento.
Una versión más sutil de esto es en la escena previa, donde Ann asiste a su trabajo y el repetitivo sonido de la estampa se vuelve más y más fuerte, mientras el montaje se vuelve también más expresivo. Estos recursos también se repiten cerca del final de la película, cuando la protagonista asiste a un festival y un individuo se fuerza sobre ella, recordándole del incidente catalizador del film. Aquí entramos en primerísimos primeros planos de la boca del individuo, que se transforma, a través de un fundido en la del atacante inicial.
Por contraste, en la escena del ataque mismo, tenemos una especie de perspectiva que podría pensarse más objetiva. Planos generales y claros; sonido estrictamente diegético y objetivo. Pero nos parece que se sigue comunicando la subjetividad del personaje, aunque sea de una manera más sutil. A medida que va avanzando la secuencia, los planos se van volviendo más grandes y la cámara empieza a estar puesta mirando hacia abajo desde techos o a ras de suelo; esto empequeñece a Ann dentro de este espacio desolado. Es notable también la ausencia de sonidos. Se enfatiza el silencio del espacio; el sonido ambiente casi inaudible y una total ausencia de música extradiegética. Este silencio es interrumpido por pequeños sonidos específicos, que suenan gigantescos por contraste. La voz de la protagonista, los pasos del acosador, un bocinazo, etc. Todo esto sirve para comunicar cuán aislada, cuán indefensa se siente el personaje en la escena.
Es después, en las escenas en que Ann recuerda el incidente, y se vuelve a sentir abrumada, que entran los aspectos formales más intensos y llamativos, los primerísimos primeros planos, la música angustiante y los in crescendos de sonido. Es en estas escenas donde los aspectos formales llaman la atención a sí mismos para comunicar al espectador la severidad del tormento del personaje, mientras que el resto de la película utiliza un estilo más sutil e invisible.
Estos aspectos formales más expresivos invaden la cotidianidad del film así como el incidente invade la de su protagonista.",0.0

"“What kind of times are these that such things can happen…”
Astounding in its modernity — if you think that most girls, even later on in history (and today!), would be ashamed and fear their family reaction in the aftermath of a rape; here we see a loving family, an understanding almost-fiancé, warmth galore. 
I really loved the first half of the film, however I lost interest towards the end, as I could just feel a hefty masculine presence behind the making of it. I was so disappointed.

Ida Lupino directs the hell out of those opening 15 minutes leading up to the incident; some of the camera work is remarkable. The premise reminded me of Something Wild (1961) starring Carroll Baker that also deals with a rape victim early on in the film. But in some ways this is a very radical movie given that it was made during a time where the word rape couldn't even be mentioned in a movie. Mala Powers is really good in the role. There is a courtroom scene towards the end that really dates the film and is the only misstep in an otherwise well conceived film - think Psycho courtroom scene but with more mansplaining. But the fact that this movie even exists is incredible.,4.0

"Ida Lupino rueda con maestría la secuencia de una violación, empleando recursos propios del cine negro, para luego mostrarnos las secuelas, psicológicas y sociales, en la víctima, además de hablar de la necesidad de tratar clínicamente a cierto tipo de criminal. Una película al margen del cine de su época y moderna incluso hoy, 73 años después.",4.0
"Lo que cuenta Lupino aquí es terrible, situándose desde la perspectiva de una víctima de violación para mostrar no sólo los estragos psicológicos que ella sufre sino también el escarnio público al que está sometida por ser mujer.

"Outrage centers around a young woman who is raped one evening on the way home from work and how her life will never be the same moving forward. It’s eerie how everyone in town knows what happened the next day, something that relates strongly to todays world with social media. Hits all the expected mental issues that Ann suffers after such an attack from fear of being loved, touched, and seeing her rapist in the eyes of other men. A tough subject matter to focus a movie around for 1950.
Score 73/100",3.5
"So many people have this odd perception of the Old Hollywood system being this machine that churned out nothing but romanticised, nostalgic stories of American myth-making. But look behind the sweeping scores, sublimely lit beautiful faces and exceptional cinematography you will see a plethora of very real human stories, many of the very dark kind. ""Outrage"" is no exception, and tells the story of young Anne Walton, optimistic and hopeful for the future with her new fiancee who upon leaving work late one night is stalked and s*xually assaulted by none other than the man behind the lunch counter at her job whose advances she has routinely buffed. Unable to truly process the horror story she has survived, she runs away only to find herself finding her way back to herself (only after the wheel turns another violent turn) thanks to the patience and unrequited love experienced at the hands of the wonderful Rev. Ferguson.
Though Anne's hysteria before and after the attack can be a little irritating to behold for those of us with thicker skin and sharper street smarts, at the end of the day I understand not everyone has my personal lived experience and some souls really are that sheltered from life where they have no real survival tactics to navigate the world. Her impulse to run away to get the space required to manage the emotional maelstrom she's been thrown in is understandable. The films shows a plethora of the rich tapestry of male intentions: we see predatory men, well-meaning but over-bearing men, ""nice"" boys who are not always so nice and feel entitled to your kisses to boot as well as genuine, loving and mature-minded men like Anne's father, employer and the sublime Reverend. At the end of the day, for me the film hammers home the lesson that people are individuals and should be treated as such and that all of us - male and female - can be good, awful and traumatised. Though not an exceptionally brilliant film, the fact it had the cajones to touch on this topic in 1950 when a woman losing her ""virtue"" through r*pe would have been even more of a social taboo than it is now, it has not lost its effectiveness in a world where adult women and men, as well as young girls and boys, still experience s*xual assault at the hands of predatory people, male and female, and live with the very real consequences of such a disgusting violation. I think an important contribution to Hollywood storytelling that should be seen at least once. 3.5 stars.",3.5

"Directed by Ida Lupino -- who co-wrote the script, along with producer Malvin Wald and her husband at the time Collier Young -- this was the second post-Code Hollywood film to deal with the issue of rape. The other is after Johnny Belinda. 
Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is ready to marry Jim Owens (Robert Clark) when a man who works near her starts following her, finally attacking her. All she can remember of him is a scar. Everyone is supportive, but she feels that Jim will never see her the same way again, so she runs. 
She runs again when the bus she is on has a radio message play about her parents looking for her. That's when she's rescued by Rev. Bruce Ferguson (Tod Andrews). They start to grow close, but when another man kisses her at a carnival, she attacks him with a wrench. That's when the reverend learns of her past and helps her to not go to jail. 
Instead of giving in to her love, he sends her back home to Jim in an attempt to get back to her old life.
While the word rape could never be said in this movie, Lupino uses that to her advantage. The sad part of this is that a movie made seven decades ago still shows men to be the same as they are today, either wanting to control, own or foul any woman at any opportunity. ",2.5
"Le nom d’Ida Lupino est-il tombé dans l’oubli ? On pourrait presque le penser, tant ses réalisations peinent à trouver une place à l’écran, tant on la réduit encore bien trop souvent à n’être que la « Bette Davis du pauvre ». Pourtant, elle s’est vite distinguée derrière la caméra en abordant des thématiques délaissées par ses collègues masculins, comme la grossesse non désirée avec Not Wanted ou encore le handicap avec Never Fear. Mais c’est surtout avec Outrage qu’elle marque les esprits, en abordant explicitement le viol et ses conséquences, sujet éminemment tabou au sein d’un Hollywood encore censuré par le code Hays. La ressortie en version restaurée de ce film est donc l’occasion de (re)découvrir une réalisatrice, et de ne pas oublier l’engagement qui fut le sien, bien avant l’ère « Me too ».

Extérieur. Nuit. La caméra suit en plongée une jeune femme seule et éplorée dans les rues désertes d’une « cité sans voiles ». Le clair-obscur, le vibraphone menaçant et les cordes discrètes : le générique d’Outrage promet un grand film noir dans la veine des Dassin, Tourneur et consorts. Les 75 minutes suivantes déjoueront nos attentes. Le film d’Ida Lupino embrasse les codes de la série B policière le temps d’installer son sujet dans la classe moyenne blanche d’une « Capital City » bien tranquille où l’horizon professionnel des femmes se borne le plus souvent à un emploi peu qualifié. Plutôt que d’évoluer comme un film policier classique, où le viol ne serait qu’un prétexte justifiant un récit d’enquête, Outrage se concentre pleinement sur le traumatisme de son héroïne, sur ses failles intimes et psychologiques. La blessure d’Ann est si profonde qu’elle la pousse à disparaître, à s’effacer, à se rendre invisible. Le personnage principal, incarné par Mala Powers, est ainsi un être en fuite, pris dans un engrenage pernicieux. Pour éviter de se confronter à elle-même, l’héroïne passe son temps à fuir les autres – son assaillant, son foyer, son fiancé, ses amis, se condamnant ainsi à l’errance. Ici, la fuite n’est plus l’apanage du meurtrier en cavale, mais bien celui de la victime, dont l’exil devient synonyme d’expiation. On reconnaît là le retournement classique de la faute et la culpabilité illégitime ressentis par les victimes de viol.

Ida Lupino exhibe, dès la séquence d’ouverture, les prémices du viol, montrant comment le harcèlement verbal n’est bien souvent qu’une étape précédant l’agression physique. La réalisatrice met ainsi en évidence la continuité entre les propos déplacés et appuyés de l’agresseur, qui relèvent déjà d’une forme d’intrusion, et le viol à proprement parler. Elle révèle ainsi les deux visages du violeur. Le costume impeccable et le nœud papillon composent la face publique de l’assaillant, dont la noirceur apparaît une fois la nuit venue.

Dans Outrage, le viol, à proprement parler, fait l’objet d’une ellipse, mais la traque de l’héroïne par son agresseur, elle, est admirablement mise en scène. S’inspirant clairement du maudit M de Fritz Lang, Lupino filme, Code Hays oblige, dans un clair-obscur contrasté à glacer le sang : le rythme des plans larges et longs donnent à cette course-poursuite de plus de cinq minutes un suspense terrible jusqu’à sa conclusion abominable. Les axes de caméras sur ces rues poisseuses, les affiches déchirées représentant le visage terrifiant d’un clown, les effets d’échos dans la bande son – au sifflotement insouciant d’Ann répond le sifflement glaçant du chasseur qui veut localiser sa proie – rendent un mélange d’expressionnisme et de réalisme permettant à la réalisatrice de représenter l’indicible (le mot viol n’étant jamais prononcé tout au long du film).

Malgré son sujet et la résolution d’Ida Lupino de mettre des destins de femmes à l’écran, le film s’est attiré les foudres de certaines critiques féministes qui lui ont reproché, notamment, sa vision conformiste de la femme passive et une conclusion narrative conventionnelle ou conservatrice. Et il est vrai, reconnaissons-le, que des maladresses vont miner la bonne tenue de la dernière partie, comme cette vision un peu trop archétypale de l’agresseur (un pervers inconnu, alors que la plupart sont des proches) ou encore ce dénouement un peu trop sage avec un homme d’église providentiel. Mais tout cela ne remet pas en cause sa capacité à rendre justice à la douleur de son héroïne, et surtout pas le regard subversif qu’elle porte sur la société patriarcale.

Une vision qui enfle d’ailleurs dès la séquence inaugurale, où s’amorce l’enfermement d’Ann qui intériorise sa douleur à mesure que sa vie sociale se circonscrit à l’espace domestique. La maison familiale « moderne » – comprenez : « conçue pour le confort de la ménagère » – imaginée par le directeur artistique Harry Horner, reprend le motif de la cage, identique à l’austère bâtisse victorienne de L’Héritière de William Wyler. L’avenir d’Ann Walton s’écrira, dès lors, dans un monde frivole de chambre à coucher, cuisine, sexe et bébés... Loin du film à thèse ou du pamphlet féministe tendance marxiste radical, Outrage a le mérite de démystifier par le paradoxe la domesticité d’après-guerre, sans jamais flatter l’œil du spectateur masculin.",3.5

É uma dualidade do muito baixo astral para uma recuperação quase que completa da esperança, dois lados carregadíssimos na entrega da obra.

"While this suffers retrospectively from appearing a bit too sentimental and overacted throughout, it still manages to feel groundbreaking in its attempt to dramatize its then taboo subject. The word rape is never used in the film (it is referred to as a ""criminal assault""), and, of course, the film can't show the act itself, but that kind of works in its favor. There's a lot here that obviously benefits from having been directed by a woman, but it's also stifled by the culture of the time. The 'Doc' saviour figure is never quite believable as a person to me. The actor has some blatantly pontificating dialogue and a weird vibe (that doesn't seem to be intentional). Like her previous film, Never Fear, Lupino isn't able to give full agency to her lead role because, even in trying to regain control of their lives, young women like Ann were still bound by social constraints that decided who and where they were supposed be.
The journey here couldn't really be about regaining her autonomy after a trauma; it was about putting her back in her expected place of normalcy. I'd like to think Lupino understood this complexity when she has Ann tell Doc ""You understand everything. You understand me,"" but I wonder.
If you see this compromised viewpoint as intentional commentary, this can be argued to be a rough-around-the-edges masterpiece. If you see this as the understandably confused piece that it seems to me that it is, it is still a stepping stone to great filmmaking....",3.5

"Trigger warning: discussion of sexual assault/rape.

Rape is a topic that is still widely misunderstood today, especially when it comes to victims and what their experience was like; and the ways it changes them, and doesn’t change them. Ida Lupino’s 1950 film Outrage has several significant flaws but deserves credit for attempting to tackle the issue in such a year, and showing sensitivity, intelligence and empathy. 
The strengths of the film are in the depiction of the rape and it’s affects on the central character. The set up is simple: Ann (Mala Powers) is engaged to be married and a local concession stand operator flirts with her when she shops at his stand. She does not return the flirting gestures and exchanges, simply ignoring them. One night he sees her walking home alone, and starts to follow her. The sequence that follows is tense and emphasizes Ann’s attempts to escape that are undermined by mounting fear, and the result is a harrowing experience. Powers’ performance in the aftermath is similarly harrowing, conveying her inner emotional state outwardly in ways that others misunderstand or doubt. A later encounter with another man with somewhat nefarious intentions depicts her reaction from her perspective very effectively as well. 
The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Outrage is a post-code film, and one of the first to address rape, yet in some ways the second half of the film feels written to code standards. Ann meets a decent hearted minister nick named Doc, who helps her come back to herself and reconcile with what’s happened to her. The solution is just too simple, and skips over several admirably thorny scenes from the first half in favor of clean and easy resolution that doesn’t make much sense. Ann is basically the victim of extreme bad luck and then the recipient of extremely good luck, which is a cop out of sorts from addressing the real, tough fallout from an incident like rape. 
Still, the very existence of an American film from 1950 that addresses rape and its consequences head on is of value. It’s a shame that audiences then and now aren’t really able to make head or tail of what these issues mean for the women at their center.",0.0

"This was on the cusp of a 4-star but some of the character choices towards the end kind of keep it at a 3.5. Made by one of the pioneers of feminist coded cinema, Outrage follows its main character attempting to navigate life after being a victim of rape. She attempts to reclaim her narrative by moving as far away as possible from the town of her ordeal to a place where she’s a relative unknown and isn’t viewed as “damaged” or “Stained” because of the actions of a depraved man. While moving may have solved the issue of how she’s viewed by others, she’s still very much trying to adjust physically to life with newfound defense mechanisms as a result of such a predicament and these defense mechanisms even lead her to be put behind bars for a short while. While for the most part this seems to be heading towards a woman rising from the ashes of her lowest moments reborn, I feel like the film implying she will be going back to her old life to get back together with Jim at Ferguson’s wish kind of takes away some of the agency that made her a strong figure both now, and even moreso in the 50s when this sort of characterization I would imagine was less prevalent. Still pretty good all in all, although a bit of a lengthier runtime would’ve also allowed for more exploration of Ann as a character which would’ve been impressive also.",3.5

Moments of brilliance with the framing and editing - mostly around the assault scenes and their aftermath - are dragged down by a rather dull presentation of its compelling narrative.
As other people have noted, this is a bleak affair, and the 'take anything I want' mentality of masculinity is still a very relevant thing. But, if I would put one point on why I didn't love it as much would be in relation to the 'good' man, a man who is seemingly only good because he's religious.",2.5
"The lead up to the assault and it’s immediate aftermath are incredibly well done, especially when I’ve seen films from around this time period, hell, even films in recent memory have squandered such a subject.

"Shockingly forward thinking and empathetic towards victims of sexual assault.
Legendary lady director Ida Lupino’s film noir drama Outrage (1950) feels bold for its era and still distinctly feminist. Lupino lets audiences understand how helpless and frightened a woman can feel when around men, especially when creepy guys will just not take no for an answer. I really cannot understate how progressive and sensitive Outrage still comes across. I do wish the ending had a more resolute and understanding conclusion rather than sending Ann home, but I guess that was the best anyone could think to finish Outrage on a slightly positive note.
Writers Ida Lupino, Malvin Wald, and Collier Young write with a real understanding of the justified fears of sinister men’s advances. Outrage feels especially critical of the so called nice guys that pretend at being genuine only to get close to unsuspecting girls. Mala Powers is phenomenal as the sympathetic heroine Ann Walton. Her terrified faces and eyes are heartbreaking. I really felt for her.
Editor Harvey Manger keeps Outrage moving briskly with a tight 75 minute run-time that doesn’t drag. All the cuts between mens’ faces that Mala sees with fear are impressively spliced together. Even the slightest hand touch feels threatening. Cinematographer Archie Stout zooms into chilling close-up shots to show how each unwanted touch from a man is disgusting and frightening for a woman.
Composer Paul Sawtell’s sweeping orchestral film score is wonderful. It feels tense and suspenseful even in the brief encounters with men that scare Ann. Sound designers Clem Portman and John L. Cass makes men’s catcalls and whistles chilling with subtle echos. Makeup artist Bill Phillips does really pretty facial makeup on Mala Powers. Hairstyling from Josephine Sweeney is really neat as she can do prim and proper or disheveled for Mala’s hair depending on her mental status.
In short, Outrage is a killer film noir picture from the masterful director Ida Lupino. It is her distinctly empathetic direction that lets Mala Powers shine as a sympathetic girl, now afraid of men.",5.0
A female gaze that I would definitely recommend. I think that making a film about rape and its consequences is very avant-garde for its time. Ida Lupino has done an incredible job and the direction is accurate and poetic. But I think what moved me the most was the relationship between Ann and Bruce which remained friendly. We don't fall into the cliché of a romantic relationship and that too is innovative for the time. Well done.,4.0
"Outrage gets off to a fair start, has some nice camera set ups early on, and is undeniably thematically bold and ambitious, but this well-intentioned issue picture is burdened by clumsy, heavy-handed dialogue paired with a lot of awkward, unsubtle acting. It could have survived one or the other but the combination weighs heavily, dragging the movie toward the bottom of Ida Lupino's oeuvre. The creation of the feeling of a woman's unsafety in everyday circumstances and the forceful, predatory affection among even ""nice guys"" that's sanctioned as routine, normal, and socially unobjectionable is the movie's greatest strength.",2.5
"Ida Lupino's contribution to cinema is so very important.
This hard hitting film is way ahead of it's time and deals with victim blaming within a masculine society.
It doesn't hold back when depicting the way women were treated which sadly still has some relevance today.
The handsome Doctor is a little trite bit is handled well as to not detract from the serious elements of the film.",4.0

"영화사를 보면 대부분 스승과 제자의 관계에 있던 사람들은 대부분 연출 쪽에서 몸을 담았던 사람이다. 사실 이건 의미가 많이 퇴색되긴 했지만 현재도 몇몇 국가에서 남아있는 도제 시스템이 이를 잘 설명해주는 요인이다. 그 외에 스승과 제자의 관계가 많이 존재하는 것은 감독과 배우이다. 하지만 여기서 이러한 경우는 대부분 코미디에 한하는 경우가 많았다. 맥 세넷과 그 휘하의 수많은 코미디언들 채플린, 로스코 아버클, 찰리 체이스, 로렐과 하디, 해롤드 로이드 등등 이 계보는 끝을 모르듯이 넓혀진다. 사실 이는 이해가 쉽게 되는 것이 이들의 기술은 서로 쉽게 응용이 가능한 것들이기 때문이다. 그래서인지 현재도 코미디라는 장르에 한해서는 배우와 감독을 번갈아 오가며 활동하는 사람이 수없이 많이 존재한다. 하지만 다른 장르에서도 이것이 아예 존재하지 않는것은 아니다. 클린트 이스트우드만 하더라도 <용서받지 못한 자>에서 자신의 스승들인 돈 시겔과 세르지오 레오네를 추모하며 만들지 않았던가. 하지만 이스트우드가 그들을 추모하긴 했지만 그것은 그 둘의 연출과 사상을 직접적으로 이어받는다는 뜻이 아니다. 아마도 이 때문에 다른 장르에서 이러한 스승과 제자의 관계가 나오지 않는것일 듯도 한데 이들의 가치관이나 개성이 너무 판이하게 다르기 때문이다. 그리고 아마도 아이다 루피노와 라울 월시는 그런 스승과 제자로서의 가장 초기의 예 중 하나일 것이다. 하지만 아이러니한 점은 이들의 연출이나 감독으로서의 시선이 꽤 비슷해보인다는 사실이다.
<아웃레이지>에서 주로 사용되는 롱 숏을 통한 인물의 신체를 전부 보이는 방법은 월시의 방법과 거의 동일하다. 월시는 이것을 운명에 저항하는 인간의 유물론적 방식으로서 사용하였다. <하이 시에라>에서 험프리 보가트가 거대한 산으로 차를 끌고 가는 모습과 <포효하는 20년대>에서 제임스 캐그니가 마지막까지 총을 피해 질주하는 모습을 롱 숏으로 찍으며 결국 교회의 종 앞에서 쓰러져 죽었던 모습을 생각해보자. 이 때 월시는 그들의 모습을 마치 운명이라는 벽을 향해 돌진하는 인간의 모습으로서 롱 숏으로 사용했다. <아웃레이지>에서 이것은 아이다 루피노의 변형으로서 사용된다. 여기서 그녀는 주인공 앤 월터스의 모습을 계속해서 롱 숏으로 찍는다. 그녀가 밤 늦게 직장에서 나오는 모습을 그녀를 쫓아가는 범죄자의 시점에서부터 거리에서 도망치는 모습을 로우 앵글로 찍어 보여준다. 이 때, 앤의 모습은 마치 운명으로부터 도망가려 하지만 마치 도망가지 못하는 사람의 모습처럼 보여진다. 그녀가 아무리 외화면 밖으로 도망치려 해도 새롭게 나타난 사물이 그녀를 막아서며 화면으로 들어온 택시를 향해 멈추라고 소리지르지만 택시는 그녀의 소리를 듣지 못한것인지 무시하는것인지 그녀를 기다리지 않고 사라진다.
<아웃레이지>에서 강간을 다루면서 있어 훌륭한 점은 피해자의 PTSD를 다루는 점이 아니다. 물론 이것 또한 계속해서 커지는 소리와 그녀를 비웃는 듯이 속삭이는 사람들을 하나의 쇼트에서 표현함으로서 존재하기는 하나, 이러한 지점은 이 소재를 다루는 대부분의 영화에서 한 번 즘은 등장했던 것들이다. 반대로 <아웃레이지>에서 훌륭했던 점은 영화 속 피해자의 심리를 그대로 따라간다는 점이다. 자신의 지난 피해를 아무도 모르는 시골에 온 앤의 모습을 찍을 때 아이다 루피노는 마치 이전의 강간범에게서 도망치던 장면처럼 그녀가 사람들을 피하고 도망가는 장면을 롱 숏으로서 보여준다. 신기하게도 이 때의 사용방법과 표현은 아이다 루피노가 배우로서 영화를 찍고 스승이기도 한 라울 월시의 방법론과 일치하지만 동시에 그녀는 월시와는 정반대의 메세지를 보낸다는 것이다. 물론 영화의 엔딩 부분에서 계속해서 도망만 칠 순 없고 다시 고향으로 돌아가 그것과 마주해야된다고 신부이자 새로 사랑하게 되는 남자인 브루스의 입을 통해서 직접적으로 말해지긴 한다. 하지만 정작 버스 정류장에서 이들이 서로 헤어질 때에도, 루피노는 그들의 헤어짐을 직접적으로 찍는 것이 아니라, 버스 정류장의 화면을 버스가 가리게 하고 그녀가 탄 버스가 사라지자 남은 브루스만을 보여주면서 월시의 방법으로서의 표현을 확연하게 한다.
그리고 이 방법이 특이하다고 생각하는 점은, 마치 월시의 영화에서 그가 유물론성으로 드러내는 것이 오히려 구원의 방식이었던것과는 달리 아이다 루피노는 그 유물론적인 벽을 사라지게 함으로서 인물에게 구원을 준다는 점이다. 내가 그녀의 영화를 <아웃레이지>와 <히치하이커> 2편만을 봤기에 정확한 확답을 하지는 못하겠지만(니콜라스 레이와 공동 감독한 <어둠 속에서>는 둘의 역할의 구분을 거의 구분하지 못했었고 실제로도 구분이 어려울 정도로 촬영했다 한다.) 나는 이러한 방식이 마치 제리 루이스가 프랭크 태슐린의 방식을 자신의 것으로 끌어들이는 것과 비슷하다 생각한다. 이는 단순히 그 사람의 영화에 출연해서 배우로서 일했다는 뜻이 아니라 사상과 시선이 비슷함을 느낀다는 말이다. 물론 루피노의 영화에서 월시의 영화와 같이 파멸함으로서 오히려 구원을 바라는 사람이 존재하지는 않지만, 월시가 그것을 만들기 위해 사용한 벽을 루피노는 반대로 그 벽을 피해 도망가는 인물상과 동시에 도망치지 말고 맞서야 함을 표현한다. <아웃레이지>가 강간 피해자를 다룸에 있어 가장 도덕적이었던것은 바로 그녀의 내면 상태를 마치 그녀의 말처럼 '다 아는 것 처럼' 표현하지 않았던 것에 있을것이다.",4.5
"It's been a while since I've seen this film again. However, it's like watching a whole new movie. That's how long it's been. I don't think I truly understood the true impact of the film the first time around. Looking at it now, it's a sympathetic portrayal of the subject of rape that is really simple to understand and doesn't get distracted from the task at hand.
In this film though, we see a major difference between then and now. With revolutionary filmmakers like Ida Lupino back then, they wanted to advance and bring taboo topics to the forefront. Now, most of the people that want to progress, bang us over the head with the same damn topic over and over again. As a result, they set us back years that we are supposed to gain.
I believe that Mala Powers does a good job overall as Ann in this film along with the supporting players. You can see and feel the honest terror Ann is going through and you feel sympathetic towards her. Imagine being a victim of rape in 1950? We should be thankfully that it's easier now than it was back then.",3.5

Incluso el personaje de Tod se roba la película al final, al ser un ser tan compasivo y gentil, pero para ser una obra que trata un tema tan duro, a ratos se sintió algo superficial.

the packed theater I watched ""Outrage"" in was pindrop silent as Anne awaited her fate- as if we were watching a horror flick and anticipating a heart-racing jump scare. although not intended to be part of the horror genre, this film fits the bill by depicting the most terrifying fear of all: reality.
the title checks- it is quite literally ""outrageous"" that a movie depicting the soul-consuming, drastic, and traumatic effects of sexual assault in 1950 has such eery cultural relevance today, YET SO LITTLE HAS CHANGED. I was shocked by how transparently the experience was conveyed, seeing as the film was released nearly 75 years ago.
Anne's father begs questions that still echo in America today. ""why don’t you do something about preventing crimes like these? is this why you raise a daughter? is this what you love and sacrifice for? what kind of times are these that such things can happen?""

"Trigger Warning: sexual assault

The movie itself is a bit preachy and borderline melodramatic at times, but the performance by Mala Powers is so good and the film treats her with undeniable respect and honesty that it almost evens the whole thing out.
Director Ida Lupino guides all the events with such compassion and care, not diminishing any decision Ann makes from beginning to end. You feel bad for her family and her fiancee, loving her but truly unable to help. The fiancee has a scene where he yells at her in frustration that extends just slightly longer than expected that gives it and him a stronger human touch than one would expect.
Despite limits imposed by the Hollywood Production code, Lupino depicts Ann's sexual assault with finesse and undeniable directness it has considerable dramatic impact without ever feeling exploitative. It hurts watching her not be able to be the happy person she was in the films first scenes, and Powers depicts her tremendous hurt and frustration at being unable to speak out about the damage done very effectively.
I feel bad for saying the film is preachy at the very end where her case is finally discussed directly, but it's not meant as a criticism. I can't imagine this sort of thing was common public or even family conversation unless a person was involved directly, and some messages do need to be declared.
It's rare a film in this Era (1950) would make a case against society in favor of women, especially a Hollywood picture. Lupino is a darn fine director and I eagerly look forward to seeing the rest of her work.
Also another rarity in the 50s, a woman director.",3.0

"Lean & Mean: 2 Films by Ida Lupino, by Jack Miller
A few years ago, while living in Bloomington, I was able to attend theatrical screenings of a number of Lupino films when IU Cinema honored her work in its 5X Ida Lupino: Fearless, Extraordinary Trailblazer series. For years, the only way one could easily watch Lupino’s masterpiece Outrage (1950), the greatest of the five films by her that I’ve seen, was through a grainy YouTube upload; being able to see the clarity of the film’s spaces and textures on a 35mm print was a revelation. The film, which deals forthrightly with the rape of a young woman (played by Mala Powers) and with the aftereffects of this assault, conjures up not one, but several, visions of the world in its startlingly detailed mise-en-scène.
The first world, the one that Lupino carefully constructs at the beginning of the film, is one of comfort and security, tied to notions of American success: Powers’ character, Ann Walton, has a steady job and a steady boyfriend, whom she plans to marry. But Lupino soon undermines this reassuring vision through the brutal assault sequence, filmed on eerie, spartan streets with stark shafts of light jutting in between dense fields of black. Like some other great American filmmakers of the ‘50s (John Ford, Vincente Minnelli), Lupino seems entirely unconvinced here by the mythic notion of postwar America as a land of prosperity and familial stability; rather, what we see here is a despairing portrait of a society ruled by fear and self-centeredness. The third, and most powerful, act of the film deserves to be compared with On Dangerous Ground and Rossellini’s Stromboli (1950) in its graceful flowering of hope and its inauguration of a new way at looking at the world. Lupino grounds Walton’s reckoning with her own trauma in the experience of nature, shown to us in a series of flowing outdoor shots. As this character begins to take her first, tentative steps back into the world, one gets the sense that she uses the natural world as a means of self-reconstruction.

"This tackles a subject that’s difficult now, and was even more so in 1950, in a very thoughtful manner. Mala Powers was excellent in the lead. And I thought the “happy but sad” ending was perfect given the material. A really good film.",4.0
"Kind of crazy how ahead of the time this is. Sadly there’s still plenty of elements that would be called controversial. From rehabilitative justice, the power dynamics at work in the story, PTSD, a refreshing lack of victim blaming. Also contains one of the scariest scenes I’ve ever seen. No music, no relief, just real fear. Excellent film.",4.0

Terrific melodrama about rape. Lupino was a great director.,4.5
"A Lupino consegue trazer uma discussão social patológica muito importante, e que permeia o contemporâneo. Mesmo vivendo o horror do estupro nos anos 1950, ela traz a idéia da culpa coletivizada, que se ainda hoje o termo é polêmico, imagina na década de 50...
O jogo psicológico que ela monta, por meio dos sentidos da personagem- as imagens se alternando, a hipersensibilidade aos sons- cria esse ambiente tenso além de, situações que nos causam receio de olhar e ouvir.
Finalmente, no desenlace do longa ela lida com sua maior temática: todo homem é um possível abusador.

"I found a copy of this at JB HiFi and the blurb intrigued me, as well as seeing that Heller-Nicholas has provided some commentary for the Imprint release. My initial thoughts before watching were, ""holy shit! A proto rape revenge film from the 50s??"" And... Yeah. Kind of!
Surprisingly well handled. I wish more films actually took the time to examine the aftershock of sexual assault like this film does, rather than the spectacle of the incident itself as the emotional core of a movie. I loved seeing Ann regain her autonomy, and found her suffering as a PTSD victim... unfortunately very relatable.
A little on the nose towards the end, but y'know what, I think that's refreshing. I appreciate that in a film and I'm super keen to watch again with Heller-Nicholas' commentary on.",4.0

How Ida Lupino hasn’t been pulled from the depths of obscurity to be recognized as one of the most remarkable figures of golden age Hollywood is beyond me.,4.0
"Directed and co-written by Ida Lupino, Outrage was only the second post-Code Hollywood film to deal with rape (after Johnny Belinda), although the word is never spoken outright in the script. Instead, Lupino focuses on silence – the way silence is enforced and the way silence is endorsed by the Hollywood system she was working within. The film starts with a series of dramatic aerial perspectives, as a young woman, who turns out to be Ann Walton, played by Mala Power, flees an unknown assailant. Since we can see her pursuer, the camera takes on the role of antagonist, hounding her from street to street until the male gaze is drawn into pointed and predatory relief. From there, Lupino jumps back to the twenty-four hours before the chase, but retains this same propulsive sense of motion, starting with a glass that Mr. Denker, a concession stand employee, ricochets across the counter to one of his customers.
It turns out that Denker, played by Jerry Hausner, is working at the same factory as Ann, who quickly catches his eye. The same night, he stalks her after a late shift, taking his time to relish her fear as she tries to elude him through the empty night. Although this scene starts in the factory precinct, Lupino quickly expands it out to a more amorphous noir cityscape, while blurring its coordinates until it feels like we’re on a film set composed of leftovers from earlier noir productions. This noir bricolage tightens Ann in its grasp, until she has nowhere to go but into the arms of her assailant, whose face remains occluded by darkness in a final noir flourish. Whereas classical noir typically focused on the alienation of men in urban environments, Lupino flips the script to dwell on the even more profound alterity of women in the night city.
More specifically, Lupino draws upon the automobile as the emblem of masculine autonomy in film noir. As her assailant closes in, Ann passes a number of men in cars, but they’re either oblivious or indifferent to her plight, disappearing back into the silence without heeding her cries, and making her pedestrian passage seem especially vulnerable by comparison. When she can run no further, she hides amongst a lot of parked vehicles, and finally gets into a truck, whose latticed windows culminate the noir framing, and confuse her into accidentally activating the horn. Grating against the silence of the night, this becomes the soundtrack to her assault, and prevents one last bystander from hearing her anguish when it wakes him up.
This ballooning and contouring of space has a sequel in the twenty-four hours after the assault, which starts with Ann recounting the crime for the first time framed by the striated bars of her bed, before she looks tentatively out her window the next morning, faced with a world where public space has suddenly taken on a new precarity and vulnerability. Determined to return to work immediately, she pauses twice on the threshold of her parents’ house, first when she walks out the gate, and then when she crossed the property line with her neighbours, holding the fence post for support as she fumbles her way to the bus stop.
During the attack and the aftermath, space has become both more claustrophobic and agoraphobic, and this intensity continues when Ann arrives at work. On the one hand, she’s hyper-aware of the crushing gazes of her colleagues, and yet their inability or unwillingness to lend genuine support makes her seem tiny in the yawning judgement of her office. Since she didn’t see her attacker, anyone could be the assailant, so every encounter is tinged with risk, especially since she gets an ineffable sense of her being tainted, a tacit sense she’s complicit, even or especially from well-meaning men. While her fiancée, Jim Owens, played by Robert Clarke, doesn’t blame her for the assault, he does insist on getting married immediately, presumably to reclaim her body as soon as possible, even as he thinks it apposite to take her over state lines and maybe move there for good. Similarly, while Detective Sergeant Hendrix, played by Hal March, expresses his sympathy in very politically correct terms, he makes it clear Ann will be responsible for another attack if she doesn’t identify her assailant in a line-up the next night, despite the fact that she never saw his face.
Neither of these men, who should be protecting Ann, are able to process her trauma and pain in any other way except explaining what she should do and speaking for (and over) her. In fact, it’s hard to think of a sequence from this era in which speaking over, for and down to women is so painfully denaturalised as conventional Hollywood tropes as in this last period before Ann finally seeks out a line of flight from a public space that seems both too constrained and too amorphous to accommodate her. She does so by fleeing the Midwest and heading to Los Angeles, an inherently paradoxical journey, at least as Lupino frames it, since Ann is attempting to escape the noirish world that followed her assault, but she’s also heading straight to the birthplace of noir. That tensile trajectory suggests an inchoate desire to confront the cinematic apparatus head-on, to expose and challenge noir as the optic that has left her no plausible option in the wake of the crime that has been commited on her body.
The furthest that Ann, and Lupino, can get, are the orange groves of rural California. After running away from a bus driver who seems to have identified her from a radio broadcast, Ann ends up walking the last stretch of the journey, wandering through a sea of orchards until she can’t walk anymore, as she collapses by the side of the road. The brightness of the oranges (which we hear about later in the film) gives way to the darkest space of the film, until Ann is rescued by Reverend Bruce Ferguson, a local priest, played by Tod Andrews, and taken to the home of a local agricultural family. This ushers in the second half of the film, which some critics have taken issue with, but which works beautifully to evoke the horizon of what could be said about sexual assault at this point in time, even in a progressive film directed and co-written by Hollywood’s original female auteur. For a brief moment, Ann glimpses a professional rehabilitation, as she takes a job as an orange packer, and then a book-keeper, mingling with the Hispanic working women as the film longs to expand its horizons, in keeping with the news that plays on the bus radio just before she gets off. First, we hear about the dredging of the San Pedro Channel, and then about a United Nations convention, as Ann’s Midwest entrapment gives way, fleetingly, to a more bicoastal and cosmopolitan urbanism.
Yet professional rehabilitation quickly gives way to pastoral rehabilitation, as Ferguson takes Ann to his favourite spot on the property, the vista that recovered his faith after World War II. To the film’s credit, Ferguson initially offers a very sympathetic lens into Ann’s trauma, which he compares to his own crisis in faith after returning from the front: “We have to face ourselves and look at the world all over again.” Over time, they develop a genuine friendship, rather than a romance, as Ferguson becomes an emblem of good masculinity, collapsing Ann’s assault into a more general rehabilitation of patriarchy and the male order of things.
Nevertheless, there are sharp limits to this process. Ferguson’s state of nature culminates with a local dance, where couples dance in serene unison as Lupino uses her most elaborate tracking-shot to trace a way through their perambulations to position Ann at the centre of the action. Symbolically, this shot restores Ann to the world of healthy romance, only to bring in a second assailant, Frank Marini, played by Jerry Parris, who works on the property. Frank is less overtly aggressive than Denker, but that just makes him creepier, as he follows Ann away from the dance, confesses that he’s been watching her since she arrived at the orchard, tries repeatedly to kiss her, and then roughly forces her to ground when she resists, leaving her no option but to smash him over the head with a wrench to break away from his grasp.
At this moment, the film reaches its figurative limit. Clearly, there’s a continuity between these two assailants, but Lupino seems tacitly aware that a mainstream audience can’t or won’t accept it – that their threshold for “acceptable” assault is likely to be very low. The way she handles that bind is to turn this ostensibly “harmless” assailant into a trigger for the “real” assailant, who appears before Ann’s eyes now, propelling her into the most flamboyant line of flight in the film. Continuing her westward trajectory, she now eschews roads and paths, heading straight over the landscape, the memory of the wrench still fresh in her memory, in one final brief gimpse of a genuine working-class feminism. Yet that propulsion brings her back to the vista Ferguson elaborated for her, and the gender constructions of 50s Hollywood.
Despite the progressive opening, and despite Ann’s assault and subsequent lines of flight, the film must still end with the woman on trial, as the repressed noir substrate returns with a vengeance in the straited bars of the cell where Ann is housed once the orchard farmers catch up with her. Even her greatest advocate, Ferguson, cannot understand that the second assailant was as much a criminal as the first, asking her “Tell me, why’d you try to kill Frank? I’ve know him for a long time – he meant you no harm.” Appointing himself as her lawyer, he raises “temporary insanity,” “cognitive dissonance” and “an awful chain reaction” to explain why she defended herself against a man who crushed her to ground after she said no multiple times. Having dismissed the criminality of the second assailant, the priest now downplays the first, lamenting that Denker was never treated for his mental health issues: “Our generation has produced too many neuroses, too many displaced people here at home.” The long legacy of WWII, which the film initially used to broker sympathy with Ann, now drives a more structural sympathy for her original assailant, who we never see again, let alone standing trial.
Yet we never see Ann’s husband again either, since while the priest may be the reparative patriarchal figure, holding Ann’s heads in his hands during the penultimate scene, Lupino never shows the repair that he supposedly effects. Ann heads back to the Midwest, but the film closes at the bus stop where she first met Ferguson, the outermost point of her journey to Los Angeles. She gets on the bus, Ferguson drives away, and the credits roll over this final liminal space, the closest that Ann and Lupino could get to the City of Angels, and the furthest a film could go in taking on the male gaze at this point in time. It’s a remarkable ending to a remarkable film, precious precisely because of how soberly it understands what it’s up against – a hard enough story to tell in 2022, let alone in 1950, at the peak of Hollywood hegemony.

"Ida Lupino makes the simplest scenes the most striking ones somehow. I was left speechless.
A woman that would go on to create her own company after being one of the few to relish in the Hollywood system.",4.5
"Ida Lupino was a groundbreaking independent film maker who placed a very unique and personal stamp on the Hollywood film industry. Exploited early in her career when as a 14 year old child she played much older vamps in sexually precocious roles, she consistently advocated to be taken more seriously and be given better roles until she became Warner Brothers's favourite tough talking femme-fatale, appearing alongside A-list actors like George Raft and Humphrey Bogart in great films like They Drive By Night (1940) and High Sierra (1941). Growing tired of always running second to Bette Davis at Warners she struck out on her own and formed an independent film company. The only woman director working in Hollywood at the time this was made (Dorothy Arzner had retired in 1943), she tackled themes that were considered taboo, including unwanted pregnancies, bigamy, and in this film, rape (although the word is never used - instead we have terms like 'criminal assault'). 
After newly-engaged Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is raped she flees home from shame and boards a bus for Los Angeles. Along the way she strikes up a friendship with a kindly pastor (Tod Andrews) who helps her to overcome her trauma but not before she faces criminal charges for resisting the advances of another man who can't take 'no' for an answer. Way ahead of its time in dealing with PTSD and the experience of rape told from a woman's perspective, Lupino's direction is solid and at times quite masterful. In his 1998 documentary, Personal Journey through American Movies, Scorsese highlighted the technical and artistic accomplishment of the attack scene in Outrage. In a New York Times interview in 1995 he called Lupino, 'a woman of extraordinary talents, and one of those talents was directing. Her tough, glowing emotional work as an actress is well remembered, but her considerable accomplishments as a filmmaker are largely forgotten and they shouldn't be. The five films she directed between 1949 and 1953 are remarkable chamber pieces that deal with challenging subjects in a clear, almost documentary fashion, and they represent a singular achievement in American cinema.' 
In spite of Lupino's brilliant directing, the acting performances of the leads are not outstanding. One wonders what the film would have been like if Lupino had cast herself in the lead as she did in The Bigamist (1953). The way in which Ann relies entirely on a man (albeit one as altruistic as Doc Ferguson) for her recovery is more than a little annoying and reinforces the male saviour myth more than highlighting the resilience of women. Still it was 1950 and we should be grateful for women like Ida Lupino who told women's stories in such an effective way in an age when a woman director was both a novelty and a threat. Not her best film, Outrage remains a significant achievement for Lupino and a maturing of her film craft.",3.0
"Tw: violación, violencia de género.
Cuanto me gustaría que las generaciones futuras vean esta película y perciban que esta película no refleja con una terrorífica exactitud la sociedad que transita. Outrage es una película adelantada a su época y desafía el status quo del cine.
Ojalá hubieran más voces femeninas en el cine clásico y que se les de la posibilidad de trabajar temáticas femeninas.
En mi opinión, el cine, como cualquier forma de arte, evidencia aspectos de su contexto de realización y propias de su creador. Y esta película nos presenta con una delicadeza y sutileza conmovedoras temáticas como violación y sus secuelas en la sobreviviente. Ojalá hubieran más realidades presentadas por mujeres en el cine clásico.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Outrage no resulta una película demasiado controversial en términos de montaje. Es decir, sigue una estructura puramente lineal, donde la directora se apoya principalmente el recurso del sonido para demostrar los horribles recuerdos de esa noche.
En ese sentido, la película no parece entrar dentro de la cabeza de la mujer y sus verdaderos pensamientos, sino esa mirada externa testigo. Quizá, en la escena que lastima al hombre que quiso besarla sin su consentimiento vemos un trabajo más intimista con el montaje.
Esto no para nada una critica negativa, al contrario encuentro un gran reflejo de lo que sucedía en ese contexto social. Entre ellos, la insistencia con la culpabilidad de la victima, la condena y critica social, las leyes incapaces de proteger a las mujer y hasta el tabú mismo de la palabra violación (evidenciable hasta en el propio título).
Por lo cual, destaco una dicotomía entre esa presentación de una temporalidad lineal y lo que imaginamos que sucede dentro de la mente de la protagonista. Muchas veces, la propia sociedad exige o espera de las víctimas esa eventual recuperación, vuelvan a su vida rutinaria y que superen el trauma de esa evento horrible como un fenómeno lineal. En realidad, ese proceso es de años y tiene tanto momentos de subidas como bajadas, y esos pensamientos o recuerdos pueden estar junto a nosotros por varios años.
De esta manera, se evidencia que a pesar de las restricciones en el cine con el Hays Code, Ida Lupino es capaz de presentar con una sensibilidad increible esta obra que no sigue en pie con nuestra realidsd. Me pregunto si en algún momento se sintió limitada por estos codigos para armar su película, si tuviese la posibilidad de grabarla libremente que cambios efectuaría o si la pensó así desde el comienzo. A pesar de depender de la sugestión vemos como la obra presenta el estilo propio de esra directora y es realmente poderosa.
Lo que me destaco de la película es que sigue ese proceso emocional de la protagonista y no se enfoca en una prosecusión para atrapar al violador como se esperaría de una películas con características del género noir. Outrage resulta un cambio de perspectiva interesante para la época de realización y estreno de la misma.
La trama gira entorno a como afectan esas secuelas como; la culpa, el miedo a la sexualización, miedo al contacto físico, ptsd, despersonalización. Asimismo, enfatiza la falta de atención que pone la sociedad al cuidado de la salud mental, especialmente en esa época (aunque unos comentarios que realiza Doc cuando habla con el juez nos recuerdan que a pesar de sus intentos de ser abierto esta dentro de un contexto y todavía queda un recorrido por deconstruirse).
En relación con el final del film, la mujer no tiene decisión con lo que respecta su destino. A pesar de desistirse, sigue los deseos del Doc y vuelve con su familia y prometido. En ese sentido, la última conversación parece un retroseso del propósito de la película. Entonces, la película cuestiona aspectos del cine clásico pero termina por seguir convenciones, como un final que donde los eventos vulven un orden esperado.
Sometimes we have to face ourselves then look at the world all over again. You know, that second look after heartache shows up some wonderful things.
Espero que esa segunda mirada le permita a ella reconocer las microagresiones que recibe tanto en su hogar familiar (el padre controlador que intenta interferir con el futuro laboral de la hija) como con su prometido (le dice que deje de trabajar y luego cuando la sujeta fuerte del brazo) que están instalados en la norma de esa sociedad machista.",4.0

"Criminally unavailable for a long time in any disc format, this is a seriously bold and free-flowing film from one of the earliest independent and feminist film pioneers. Not every dramatic or character element works completely, but the tight yet non-schematic script, Powers' palpably traumatized performance, and the spare, sure-handed touch of the direction as it follows her near-fugue state drifting, all contribute to this film and Powers having a real, somewhat unpredictable life of their own. After the inciting incident, a masterfully edited and composed lead-up to the rape of Powers, we simply follow Powers wherever she runs to, unable to escape or process her trauma in a patriarchal society that doesn't talk about rape and owns none of the shared responsibility for why it happens. She nearly even goes to jail for defending herself from the typical, yet typically entitled advances of a well-meaning young man. His advances are not shown to be the same as rape, but they are convincingly shown to be uncomfortably close along the same blurry continuum of behaviors and attitudes towards women. While there's certainly a few punches pulled towards the end in the form of a few too many benevolent men in the criminal justice system, as well as one representing a generalized religious faith, and the nuclear family itself is only partially questioned, rightfully this does not have an exact storybook ending. Powers is still shaken, uprooted, unsure. She almost has to be placed onto the bus back to her conventional, middle-class family life which, as we're shown earlier, can require self-imposed limitation in exchange for security. It may not ultimately go far enough in locating the deep systemic root of rape, but, in broaching the subject at all, especially in 1950, and offering such a humane, nuanced portrait, it still has a lot to offer.",4.0

"For a 75-minute studio B-movie, Ida Lupino's 'Outrage' packs as much of an impact as one could possibly expect it to, with a harrowing study into trauma and mistreatment, quite unlike anything else from its era.
One of the first code era films to deal with the subject of rape, Lupino's film tells the minimalist and impactful tale of a woman who has her life completely shattered when she is attacked while on her way home from work.
Particularly thriving in the execution of its central tense and ominous based sequences, when describing this work, Martin Scorsese perhaps said it best when he described 'Outrage' as, ""A subdued behavioural study that captures the banality of evil in an ordinary small town”.",3.5
"Outrage (Ida Lupino, 1950) 6/10
Groundbreaking film - never before tackled by Hollywood due to censorshio - handles the subject of rape in a sensitive if rather bland manner. A girl (Mala Powers) with everything in her favour - youth, beauty, good job and a marriage just around the corner - is followed by a man after work and raped. The attack is not shown but its repercussions on the girl are hard as she tries to adjust to life but filled with shame and guilt (she keeps blaming herself) moves to another town. She is not harmed physically but psychologically she is maimed for life not helped by society's sexism. The plot then takes on a preachy mode as her isolation from family results in meeting new people who remain unaware of her trauma until one day she has a breakdown on the dance floor and attacks a man who comes on a bit too strong. Melodramatic film is now remembered as one of Lupino's many directorial forays into noir territory. This was starlet Mala Powers' first big film.",3.0

A film from Ida Lupino


""Ann, we all have to stop running sometime. We have to face ourselves, and look at the world all over again.""



Rape is a devastating crime; not only for the physical horrors perpetrated on the victim, but for the psychological and emotional toll it puts on them. But for many victims, the suffering doesn't stop there, since you have to also deal with the societal aspect in the aftermath, especially if you're a woman in the middle of the 20th Century. That is the situation that Ida Lupino presents in this 1950 thriller.

Outrage follows Ann Walton (Mala Powers), a young bookkeeper who's about to marry his boyfriend. But it all gets blown to hell when she is attacked and raped on her way home after working overtime. Not only does she have to deal with the physical and emotional toll, but with what seems to be the shame of her family, and the collective gossip of everyone around her.

Lupino is no stranger to taboo subjects. She dealt with it in The Hitch-Hiker and The Bigamist, but it is no wonder that this film seems to be buried and unavailable in most platforms. For the most part, her approach to the subject is direct but sober and thoughtful. She is helped by a solid performance from Powers, who conveys the rollercoaster of emotions that the character has to be going through.

Unfortunately, the story gets a bit muddied up in the last act, once Ann meets a caring reverend (Tod Andrews) with whom she develops a close friendship. Not only does that deviate the themes to an unnecessary romantic subplot, but it also trivializes her situation by reducing it to something that can be alleviated by a relationship.

Despite that, the film is most definitely worth a watch, if anything for the incredibly tense first act, a worthy performance from Powers, and a nice, subtle direction from Lupino. For better or worse, she makes us look at the world and its inhabitants all over again.",3.0

Ida Lupino…wow.,4.0
"Un año después de que Dieterle tratara el tema en ""The accused"", la directora Ida Lupino se atrevió a describir explícitamente la violación a una chica joven y las consecuencias que conlleva. A diferencia del primer film, este no esconde ni maquilla el tema y desafía el código Hays para contarnos el momento del ataque, la vergüenza de la chica y de sus parientes, los prejuicios sociales alrededor, el shock psicológico y las complicaciones que se producen para aceptar lo sufrido. La perspectiva femenina de Lupino es fundamental para tratar un tema como este de manera abierta y provocadora, haciendo natural el tabú y exponiendo a la luz aspectos de la masculinidad tóxica y de la indefensión de las mujeres en esta época.
Para ello, la directora disfraza su drama de cine negro empezando por el momento del ataque, una secuencia magistral en el uso del espacio, los planos cenitales que oprimen a la chica, el suspense o las luces y sombras que convierten su fábrica en un escenario noir. Desde ese momento dominará el drama de corte social, pero siempre enderezado por motivos negros como la investigación policial, la huida, la misteriosa casa a la que llega, la amnesia voluntaria, la pérdida de identidad, el estallido de violencia y la redención en el clímax.
Además, la película está llena de soluciones muy originales, como los ruidos de la oficina que le provocan un ataque de ansiedad, su bloqueo en la rueda de identificación, la huida nocturna al escuchar su nombre o la vuelta de los recuerdos durante el baile.
Por último, es interesante la manera en que Lupino libera a la chica a través de un hombre, pero no mediante una relación romántica, sino con un sacerdote sin fe que recupera, gracias a ella, su propósito en la vida al ayudarla en su trauma.

"a big plus for being a picture that dealt with the subject of rape in 1950. I really appreciate that, understand why its important as a result (its in the Library of Congress Film Registry). And I really love what Ida Lupino tried to do in her career as a director.
But I spent the entire yelling either leave her the fuck alone (at least 10 times) or are you fucking kidding me (at least 8). Not to spoil too much but the woman in the movie never, not once, is afforded any agency over herself or her body. Its really odd. This movie, which is recognized as ground breaking for its time, treats their central character as so helpless, its unnerving. It was a weird watch. Better title would be Manhandled.",3.5

"When viewed from the perspective of a 1950s audience, this is undoubtedly a groundbreaking film for its time, offering a progressive viewpoint on the victimisation of a young woman who suffers a brutal assault. The tense sequences in the build up to the attack are excellent, and Outrage explores the aftermath with an engaging insight into the psychological torment that befalls the protagonist.
At only 75 minutes, the film feels slight and only skims over some of the latter parts of the story, diminishing their impact and detracting from the powerful impact of the setup.

"Putting aside the prescient subject matter, which, I know, is hard to do, this really only blossoms as a b-film in the climatic scene at the church fair: when Ann’s PTSD allows us to see male behavior widely understood to be “ordinary,” or at least culturally accepted at the time, as invasive and potentially predatory. Lupino uses all the expressionist tricks to ensure intense, consistent identification—which renders the film, from our perspective, somewhat flat, except in those important moments. Doc’s final speech—about a generation that has “produced too many neuroses” and turning “human scrap back into useful human beings”—is sad and historically resonant for a postwar film.",2.5

"The word rape is never mentioned once in this movie, likely because the Code forbade even uttering the word, but this is a brave movie about a rape victim and her fight to recover from the trauma when she can’t get the support she needs from her family. Ann’s father loves her but he seems more concerned about how his students are looking at him. Her coworkers can barely look her in the eye. The detective working her case makes her face a lineup of would be attackers without appreciating how terrified she is. Her fiancée wants to rush into marriage. Ann finally breaks and leaves town.
Lupino quietly offers a withering critique of all the gazes and touches women are expected to put up with on a daily basis. One man tells Ann he’s not trying to hurt her, he just wants to kiss her, not caring if it’s against her will or not. It’s tied up a little too neatly in the end, but Lupino probably had to make this with one hand behind her back, which makes the movie more impressive.",3.5
"In watching a film like ""Outrage"", which deals with the topic of sexual assault in an era where it was even more difficult to discuss, this does well to address the topic in a frank and compassionate way. It is revealing for one thing, that the word rape is never used even once throughout the entirety of the runtime, and the assault itself isn't depicted either. This certainly isn't ""Irreversible"", but I was glad to see that while the lingering emotional trauma is well-communicated, but that ultimately people who have been through such experiences can get help and find relief. Another interesting aspect to the story is the fact that often times even people who do mean well in trying to comfort her, inadvertently end up making her feel ostracized and as if she is now lesser as a person. It is mainly in terms of that compassion, and the general feeling of authenticity in the characters and story onscreen. So, I know that this is often said already, but I will check out more films by Ida Lupino in the future.",3.5
"The comparison with On Dangerous Ground, the ascent from noir-hell to pastoral-purgatory, obviously stands — and what must Ida have felt going through her motions for Ray a year after this — but I found her version much more moving since Ann is a self-aware victim rather than Ray’s unreformed hunk, and the saving grace here is compassion, not pity.",0.0

I am. I've never hidden my disdain for the Hays Code. I despise the Code. The Code prevents this movie from fulfilling its true potential. Without the Code, they would be allowed to explore the repercussions of rape and sexual assault deeper; they would be allowed TO SAY the words. The last 10 minutes of this film would've gone differently. What Ida Lupino is able to accomplish here, despite her limitations of the code, is amazing.
Could you imagine what movies would be today, what SOCIETY would be today if it weren't for the Hays Code? Fuck the Hays Code.",4.0
"Out of all the issues Ida Lupino made films about, the one in Outrage has to be the most taboo and controversial, especially for it's time. Although the word is never used, Outrage is about a woman who is raped (or ""attacked as the movie says), and her running away, getting help, and eventual prevailing over her assault. It was nice to see such a taboo topic be put to screen, and it has aged quite well. It was crazy to think that this film came out in the 1950s.
Overall all, the movie was solid. It was suspenseful, well acted, and well paced. My only problem comes with the strange ending, and a few odd dramatic moments.",3.5

"Outraged was one of the first hollywood movies to address rape and the trauma surrounding it head on, and 71 years later, and it still treats the subject with more dignity, sensitivity, and nuance than many modern movies and tv shows could ever dream of. There are problems with certain parts of the story (mainly the latter half) that let it show it’s age. but considering how old this film is, and how little such topics like sexual assault, ptsd, and rape culture were talked about back then, it’s incredibly impressive.
this film never tries to remove rape from reality. it shows that it can happen in picture perfect all american suburbs. it shows that it can happen to even the most normal seeming women with good families and kind fiancé’s. the movie is mostly from Ann’s perspective qnd always empathizes with her experiences. it shows how difficult it is to speak about these experiences and the shame and torment women feel.  
i personally take issue with the films conclusion. it suggests that the proper way to “solve” sexual trauma is male intervention. the films conclusion is incredibly rosy, with ann going back to her family and fiancé, seemingly cured of her trauma. it feels incredibly rushed and abrupt, especially considering how carefully and realistically the story had treated ber trauma in the first half. it also seems to imply (not even imply it straight up says it basically) that actions like rape are tied to neuroses and mental illness and other such things. however, it also seems to say that sexual assault is a systematic issue and that men in power do not properly address and take care of these issues.",3.5

"Feels sorta like Hitchcock, the way bold techniques and floridly exaggerated performances express what the Hays code cuts from the script itself. Described aloud, bits of Outrage would seem sort of grotesque (the assault itself as the culmination of an extended suspense sequence, all the diagnostic language) but as cinema it's somehow much more nuanced and empathetic than just about anything else I've seen in this milieu from this period.
Maybe I've just not seen enough of these sorts of ""social problem pictures"", but it's also kind of fascinating structurally? The first third is almost a horror movie, with the bright horizon disrupted by trauma.
Ann's decision to flee for small town anonymity is the last gasp of its noir trappings. Then the movie slows to such a gentle pace, with her recovery almost totally backgrounded, until suddenly it isn't (backgrounded or a recovery after all). The moral grey area of Ann's attack, which Lupino frames less like an over-reaction (how the characters see it) than a justified defence against the cultural norm of men imposing themselves on women everywhere. Even the first time we meet Rev. Ferguson, he's pushy, and in the background, covered by shadow, a fearsome silhouette. And yet somehow it still ends up the same place as Fleabag season 2, right down to the bus stop.

"Uma história poderosa sobre temas tabus na Hollywood clássica (e até hoje), feita por uma das diretoras mais interessante de sua época
Deveria ser redescoberto",4.5
"Outrage, un thriller que cuenta la historia de una mujer que parece tener la vida perfecta, hasta que es victima de una violación por parte de un hombre que trabaja en una cafetería a la que ella frecuenta (aunque enrealidad, podria ser cualquiera). A partir de ese momento vemos el camino que recorre para superar ese trauma.
Muchas de las reviews de esta pelicula aseguran que esta misma es ""adelantada"" para su época, pero al responder el ¿Por qué? de este dicho se remite solo al tema que trata. No es sorpresa decir que la mujer como victima de violencia machista no es una novedad ahora, asi como no era una novedad en el 1950, ni siglos antes. Es una realidad que persistía en esa epoca, así como lamentablemente lo hace ahora, por lo que que esto no es un film visionario, sino una forma en la que la directora expresaba su miedo como mujer en su contexto historico. No solo por el ataque, sino la forma en la que la justicia actua en la pelicula misma (una mujer atacada, donde la policia no hace nada, huye puesto que nadie puede defenderla y cuando ella lo hace por mano propia la meten presa). Si admito que el final es un poco fantasioso, pero entendible debido a la epoca que se hizo, por lo que no me parece que le reste merito.
Creo que lo verdaderamente visionario de Outrage no es el tema que trata sino como lo trata, es decir, la mirada unica de Ida Lupino (directora lamentablemente olvidada al dia de hoy). Los thrillers de Ida se podrian catalogar incluso como hitchcockianos. La manera en la que utiliza el fuera de campo combinado con la increible forma en la que trabaja el suspenso (que tambien lo vemos en The Hitch-Hiker). Esto se demuestra perfecto en la escena misma del ataque, una persecusión donde sabemos del potencial del atacante antes que la victima y que, al darse cuenta ella, te pone en una situación en la que te agarras los pelos esperando que logre escapar de aquel inevitable destino. Toda la escena te deja con la piel de gallina sin necesidad de enfocar el punto y ser extremadamente gráfico en la violación, que no transmite suspenso sino que simplemente impresiona (como ocurre en peliculas actuales como Irreversible de Gaspar Noé). Aquí todo se basa en la puesta en escena.
Y retomando a la puesta en escena, lo más complicado (considero yo) de trabajar en este tipo de peliculas es: ¿Qué ocurre después del hecho?. Empezamos con la introducción a Ann, ocurre este hecho tragico y despues ¿qué?. Aca es donde considero otro punto en donde la pelicula podría considerarse visionaria para la época. La protagonista intenta retomar su vida como puede. No la vemos llorando y gritando todo el tiempo como ocurre en las peliculas de Ari Aster o en muchas otras. Ida no desprecia de esa forma a su protagonista, nos la muestra como una mujer que intenta seguir adelante, aunque su trauma no la deje. Tampoco la vemos expresando sus sentimientos de manera explicita en un monologo a cámara como hace Greta Gerwig, que lo unico que logra es subestimar al espectador de una manera patetica. El montaje esta tan bien pensado que no se necesita un primer plano de Ann diciendo a cámara lo empoderadas y fuertes que somos las mujeres y que no merecemos que nos violen. Un ejemplo de esto es la escena donde se le presentan los acusados en la comisaría, ella sentada sola entre un montón de sillas, cada vez que hay un plano de Ann es primer plano y el del policía es contrapicado (mostrando la presión a la que esta sometida), todo esto que continua con el montaje de los planos de los acusados, las cicatrices, ella, el policia y el sonido de fondo. Podemos sentir su incomodidad sin que sea expresada en palabras.
Quiero aclarar que mi objetivo de estas comparaciones con realizadores actuales no es con el fin de menospreciar su trabajo ni al cine de hoy en día en general. Sino dar a enteder mi punto cuando digo que Ida es una visionaria, ya que no necesitó caer en ninguna de estas zonas confort en las que caen muchos directores y directoras casi 70 años después de Outrage.

Otra cosa poco común para la epoca de Hollywood Clásico, es el incentivo a salir adelante mediante tratamiento psicologico y no unicamente gracias a un hombre (en este caso Bruce) del cual se enamora y le da razones para vivir la vida bien.
Concluyó diciendo que, en mi opinión, esta es la forma en la que deberían tratarse este tipo de temas en audiovisuales: no olvidando que el principal objetivo del cine es entretener, creando una buena historia, con personajes estructurados y una buena y pensada puesta en escena, pero tambien enseñando las idelogías de uno en el trasfondo, sin necesidad de caer en la alegoría. El cine como cine y no como propaganda política.",4.5

Ya en el segundo acto sobresale más Mala Powers, pues transmite perfecto ese estado de shock en qué permanece por largo tiempo. Al final queda una sensación agridulce, donde tal vez no sucede lo que como espectador esperas, pero si se siente más realista.",4.5

"Such an affecting film. Breaks my heart into bits and then puts it back together again. 
Always feel like it needs to be acknowledged how amazing it is that Ida Lupino made a film about rape without being allowed to even use the word. She roots us in the trauma of it, depicting a woman crying for help in a city that is literally shutting its doors to her. It’s a rightfully upsetting scene and Mala Powers portrayal of Ann and her ensuing trauma is so aching. Just stepping out of her home is the scariest thing in the world for a person who’s just been violated like that and she sells it. 
The back half has such a surprising love story, Bruce is someone we’re immediately skeptical of but Lupino is too tender hearted for anything cruel to happen and he just gets to be someone else who’s seen trauma and can help Ann where she is. Not only that but he gives a speech that Lupino might as well have had him look directly into the camera for to get people to listen to. Calling out the way in which a society as a whole is responsible for the injustices that occur in it and how they help the people involved. 
It’s easy to be a fan of her voice and her social justice oriented movies but I’m always surprised by how well she shoots things. The chase being an obvious example but she’s got some great imagery in this like Ann being framed behind the bars of her bed frame to reflect the prison she’s now in because of the assault or the way in which two women gossip about her as she sits directly behind them. I feel like it’s easy to give hoopla just because of the ground breaking nature of her directing at all but it’s important to just point out she was a damn good one too.",0.0

Peccato per la risoluzione che è proprio figlia dei suoi tempi e allo spettatore moderno lascia un po' di amaro i bocca ma senza nulla toglie alla bellezza del film o alla bravura di Lupino.",4.0

"Damn, Ida Lupino did not hold back in this movie.
She takes all of that experience gained from years of appearing in film noirs and applies it to her directing here. The result is a years-ahead-of-its-time film about the rape of a young woman and its toll on her psyche. It is unflinching in its frankness, and it's also damning of a culture in which rape was perceived to be largely the fault of the victim and something that branded her forever after as unworthy in some way.
The most striking thing about ""Outrage"" is that it anticipates the MeToo movement decades later by showing us how predatory the world looks to women. After she's raped, the woman in this film has something to fear from every man in her life, and the movie highlights how aggressive and menacing men can be, even when they're trying to help.
""Outrage"" is a watershed film that deserves to be better known.

"Ann Walton is madly in love with her boyfriend Jim. After Jim gets a raise, the pair get engaged. Ann's happiness is cut short when one night, after working late, she is followed by a man and ultimately raped. In the aftermath of her attack, the police have little success finding the man who sexually assaulted her. In spite of the support of her parents and fiancee, she cannot stand to stay in her hometown any longer and she flees to Los Angeles. Instead of making it all the way there, she gets stranded on a ranch an hour's drive away from the City of Angels, where a kindly rancher offers her a job. Deciding this is as good a place as any to hide out, she accepts. A friend of the rancher's, preacher to a nearby church, also takes an interest in her, feeling that the young woman is somehow troubled but not being able to figure out why.
This is a pretty unique film for several reasons. But primarily because it is a studio film shot in 1950 about the then very taboo subject of rape, with a woman director (the great Ida Lupino) helming it. This film doesn't quite give Lupino the opportunity to display her talent the way ""The Hitch-Hiker"" does, but there are still some impressive sequences in there, none more so than the way she shoots the cat-and-mouse game along darkened streets and alleys when Ann is trying to get away from her attacker.

Sus protagonistas, nunca demasiado preparados para la vida, deben descubrir una o varias verdades que los arropan. Esa línea de verdades frías puede ser bastante cruel (una imagen dramática de la crueldad en Lupino es la madre ""derrotada"" al final de Hard, Fast and Beautiful) y, aunque antediluviana, es novedosa y sorprendente, sorpresiva y sorprendente. La vida en Lupino puede ser apacible, pero esa cotidianidad inquieta siempre tiene malas noticias. La vida, en su mundo, se amortigua apenas por los lazos y la pertenencia a uno o varios colectivos (qué lindo es ese largo paréntesis de sanación cuando Ann, aquí en Outrage, termina en esa gran finca dedicada a la venta de naranjas. Algo parecido pasa con la pareja de hombres que intenta escapar hacia el sur en The Hitch-Hiker: el uno al lado del otro da algo de posible seguridad).

"Ida Lupino makes great use of noir and expressionist techniques in certain scenes while using the power of film to illustrate cracks in the facade of American society. However, the film can't totally overcome the restrictions of the time in trying to depict the aftermath of sexual assault for a 1950 audience. The low budget nature of the project hurts it too as Mala Powers and Tod Andrews are less than outstanding in their roles and a better score would have helped. The ambiguously sad ending is notable for this time. It's a fine film overall, but perhaps not as good as it could have been.",3.5
"The dramatic turning point of Ida Lupino’s bold third feature, which then becomes the focus of its storyline, is an interplay of dark passages amid industrial units that details the unforeseen development of what could happen to a woman who walks home alone at night. It provides the audience with a staggering transition of tones from gaiety driven by a woman’s possibility of getting engaged to hostility perpetuated by a rapist who tries to hunt her down. Hollywood’s censorship back then excised all mentions or descriptions of rape in the film, but Lupino’s shrewdness finds ways to incisively imply the brutal acts and PTSD imposed on the victim, Ann Walton (Mala Powers). Seeing the film in light of the cultural and industrial significance of the #MeToo movement may come off like a prophetic realization but the gaslighting Ann has to endure, the uphill fight for believability in her story, and the traumatic wounds she may never completely heal are all so ingrained in both society’s consciousness and subconsciousness that what Lupino achieves here, while ahead of its time, should’ve been a lot more prevalent. Mock the hackneyed psychology that concludes the film’s narrative all you want, but cinema, hell, civilization should be ashamed for not catching up to her sooner.",4.0

i'm sure in 1950 this movie was ahead of its time in talking about the aftermath of rape re: PTSD, victim blaming, and how victims are taken advantage of which is kind of interesting but also it just makes me think about how we're still having these conversations. How people don't understand how traumatic events imprint on us and how just because you don't think it would have that effect on you, does not mean that you can dismiss someone's feelings.

"Seems wild to see a description for a narrative like this from a movie from 1950, wtg ida.
Apparently the feminists of the 1970s compared ida to Dorothy arsner according liz Borden, whoever those latter two ppl are... Also supposedly some ppl have referred to this as lupino noir and melo-noir. Damn I wish I coulda just got the normal tcm intro with a bunch of production and cast facts instead of liz babbling.
This dudes attempts are so cringey, obv a virgin. “Hey beautiful!!” From like 150 feet behind and then just a “hey!” From the same distance. The whistling is wild it’s like he’s whistling for a pig. These angles during the chase are all rly amazing. Literally like security camera angles and low angles, they didn’t even have security cameras back then! Wild. ida invented the security cam angle. Honestly tho her attempts at escape are worse than the absolute worst horror movie victim I kinda wish the guy had to try like at all... but holy fuck the cut to her struggling to walk into her home. I’m The evil white male and I felt that, watching as a woman let alone an assault survivor, I couldnt comprehend.
Love how everything in the household is just mike curtiz run of the mill cinematography. And ofc we get the classic noir shot from Behind the jail cell bed frame. Lordy that wailing trailing cry was hard to listen to that was some performance..
I honestly hope this is a dramatization and people weren’t really that gossipy to such a disgusting level back then.
just have to make a lil reminder note to watch more movies with mala, what a huge shame she didn’t make tons more movies, plus she’s so insanely pretty. I’m also really liking tod. Who is not Dana, I just found out. Tod is so cool tho he’s got a cool voice and he’s like the perfect in between of rock hudson and rob Mitchum. he’s right between that classic perfect big hunk face mixed with robs fuckin weird ass features and misshaped head.
Aaaaand that’s what I call self defense! Too bad no one else in the story would.
“Victim of a criminal assault”
Learned nothing in the TCM outro thx again to liz for explaining what I just watched.
What a suuuuuuper shitty ending. Soo bad. I mean, at the VERY best u could say it’s bittersweet cause she like has the strength to face her past and loved ones but honestly that’s a stretch, shoulda been able to do what the hell she wants is this character not an adult? Did I miss something? Really unfortunate ending. Also I had a thought during this, if this movie is the exact same but it says directed by mike curtiz or raoul Walsh or sometning, 100% it’d be rated about a star lower on average, at least a half star no doubt. I’m with that tho lol, ida is way cooler than those two guys. I just think outside of the chase sequence and a couple other things it’s not too exciting style wise. Still tho content wise it’s pretty Much like nothing else from ever before this time and for a good deal after probably. Ida is the best. 79/100. I do really love tho that this doesn’t get into the obv plot point of tracking down the rapist, that’s where I think only ida is making this movie, any simpleton would just go the boring route, but it’s a lot more interesting in dealing with how to cope.",3.5

The times haven't changed much, it seems, since Lupino made this film. 3.5 stars mainly for its progressiveness.

After what he tried to do, Frank gets away with being called a ""decent fellow"", and a sympathetic one at that because he declined to press charges against Ann.

It was very far ahead of its time, so much so that they couldn't use the word ""rape"" in the movie, and it remains prescient decades later, particularly in how societal and institutional failings helped to worsen the situation, and how society's paternalistic attitudes toward women at the time possibly kept Mala Powers' character from getting the help she needed. And on a purely aesthetic level, director Ida Lupino has an impressive visual style, using techniques of film noir and expressionistic horror films to depict the terror of the stalking and rape of the main character.",3.5

"TCM FILM SERIES: Women Make Film.
Daring for its time but also careful of running afoul of the extant review board (note that neither rape nor sex are directly named), this is a darkly melodramatic depiction of sexual assault and its aftermath. The scene of the assault itself is strikingly shot, with high and low camera angles, strong use of spotlights and shadows, and an almost expressionistic street setting. Ann’s trauma and fragility are well staged (the rhythms of her office become almost a ritualistic drum beat of anxiety) and mostly well acted by Powers who pirouettes along a tightrope over hysteria, constantly threatening to fall in. Lupino shows a good mastery of the camera with several long tracking shots, one that cuts through an active dance floor, weaving in between dancers. Ultimately the story fails Ann with its mid-century conventions, denying her a voice in her own redemption and returning her to a family and fiancé that seldom seem to be working in her best interests - simply because any other solution is literally unthinkable.",3.5

"Would you believe that one of the most powerful works of art ever made about sexual assault was released not in the 2010s, not in the 2000s, not even in the 1990s but in 1950? At a time when the subject was incredibly taboo, director Ida Lupino wrestled with the social stigma surrounding rape and the ways in which the criminal justice system fails survivors of abuse, all while providing a portrait of trauma that is remarkable in its empathy, in her masterpiece ‘Outrage’.
Lupino’s film is the harrowing story of Ann Walton, played by a stunning Mala Powers, who ostensibly has everything a young woman in this era could hope for: a supportive family, a career as a bookkeeper and a fiancé who has recently proposed to her following the announcement of a pay rise at work. Ann’s happy life is shattered, however, when a man who runs the concession stand outside her office (and whose flirtations Ann has ignored, much to his anger) follows her home one night and rapes her.
Ann's family, friends and fiancé all rally around her to offer support. However, she feels overwhelmed by their pity, which provides a constant reminder of her assault. The trauma also puts a strain on her relationship as Ann struggles with both emotional and physical intimacy and fears that her fiancé will never look at her the same way again. She searches for closure, but despite the police's best efforts they simply don't have the resources to find her assailant. Their best hope is to provide a line-up of men with scars on their face—she remembers nothing else of the attacker but this distinguishing feature—yet it only triggers further distress for Ann.
'Outrage' may lose some of its momentum in the third act, in which Ann runs away and relocates to a small town where a Reverend's kindness helps her slowly overcome her anguish, but Ida Lupino's fearless look at the psyche of a women suffering post-traumatic stress never once loses its immense power. It was only the second film ever to deal with the subject of rape—the first being 'Johnny Belinda', starring a Best Actress winning Jane Wyman—and it remains arguably the best some seventy years later.",4.5
"→ 88th film in my Women Directors 2020 Challenge
I really appreciate this film's mere existence and how Ida Lupino was able to showcase such sympathy and understanding towards sexual-assault victims through her direction. The sensitivity with which she sets up this woman's life and particularly her attention to detail are fully on display – the first 15 minutes or so are especially well directed, utilizing space, sound and characterization intelligently. It is nothing but remarkable how a picture produced in 1950 deals so maturely with rape, PTSD and justice reform. These things really make Outrage an essential film in American movie history.
Nevertheless, several aspects set this back from the masterpiece it could have been. First and foremost, the acting feels forced, theatrical and wooden even considering the era. Given the subject matter, the way actors move through the fictional world is quite important, but here the direction leaves much to be desired. The assault segment is a clear example of what I mean: Ann runs from her assaulter unconvincingly and finally gives up seemingly out of nowhere (why didn't she get up? why didn't she scream?). This isn't to put any blame on her as a victim, but to say the plot is sometimes set up in unrealistic/unbelievable ways. The other major aspect I didn't enjoy was the emphasis given to the priest who basically ""saves"" Ann. The fact that (1) it is him who speaks for Ann in court, essentially giving the speech that summarizes the film's message, and that (2) the final image focuses on him as a sort of hero, leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
While Lupino's film seems to me to be of the utmost cultural importance, its execution is uneven, excelling in some ways but falling short in others. I wonder what she would have made without the thematic and financial restrictions of the time.",3.5

"First time I've seen a film directed by Ida Lupino. This is pretty effective at drawing the psychological damage at the center point of the film, and often tense, especially in the Kafka-esque chase that ends in the main character's rape near the beginning. The intense horror at men's forwardness is especially striking for a 50s film where in other films the forwardness that triggers Mala Powers's character is written as cute or attractive. The final moments end up feeling a little saccharine and patriarchal despite itself, but overall it's a pretty effective psychological drama, and more than that an important and interesting film.",4.0

"Is it just me or is Mala Powers the spitting image of Hayley Atwell?
A rare film, especially in the sanitized world of 1950s films, that can tell a difficult story without sensationalism or detachment. I noticed that certain times throughout the film, Ann, the main character, would clearly look distressed but the men around her either ignore it or fail to recognize her clear emotional trauma. And that's part of the reason why it takes her to begin the process of recovery. It's those kinds of scenes, where Mala Powers can express her character's numbness after surviving a brutal rape that Outrage is strongest. In the weaker moments, writer/director Ida Lupino plunges too much into melodrama.
Because of Hays Code censorship, the word ""rape"" is never uttered in the film. Instead everyone refers to it as a ""criminal attack."" Perhaps this restriction actually pushes the film further to show how everyone in the film is unable to fully confront what happened - they just can't bring themselves to say the word that describes what Ann survived.
Was not really a fan of the actor who plays ""Doc"", a helpful vicar and the other lead role. Thought that he was really stiff.

Auteur - Ida Lupino",4.0
"Ida Lupino was a groundbreaking independent film maker who placed a very unique and personal stamp on the Hollywood film industry. Exploited early in her career when as a 14 year old child she played much older vamps in sexually precocious roles, she consistently advocated to be taken more seriously and be given better roles until she became Warner Brothers's favourite tough talking femme-fatale, appearing alongside A-list actors like George Raft and Humphrey Bogart in great films like They Drive By Night (1940) and High Sierra (1941). Growing tired of always running second to Bette Davis at Warners she struck out on her own and formed an independent film company. The only woman director working in Hollywood at the time this was made (Dorothy Arzner had retired in 1943), she tackled themes that were considered taboo, including unwanted pregnancies, bigamy, and in this film, rape (although the word is never used - instead we have terms like 'criminal assault').
After newly-engaged Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is raped she flees home from shame and boards a bus for Los Angeles. Along the way she strikes up a friendship with a kindly pastor (Tod Andrews) who helps her to overcome her trauma but not before she faces criminal charges for resisting the advances of another man who can't take 'no' for an answer. Way ahead of its time in dealing with PTSD and the experience of rape told from a woman's perspective, Lupino's direction is solid and at times quite masterful. In his 1998 Personal Journey through American Movies documentary, Scorsese highlighted the technical and artistic accomplishment of the attack scene in Outrage. In a New York Times interview in 1995 he called Lupino, 'a woman of extraordinary talents, and one of those talents was directing. Her tough, glowing emotional work as an actress is well remembered, but her considerable accomplishments as a filmmaker are largely forgotten and they shouldn't be. The five films she directed between 1949 and 1953 are remarkable chamber pieces that deal with challenging subjects in a clear, almost documentary fashion, and they represent a singular achievement in American cinema.'
In spite of Lupino's brilliant directing, the acting performances of the leads are not outstanding. One wonders what the film would have been like if Lupino had cast herself in the lead as she did in The Bigamist (1953). The way in which Ann relies entirely on a man (albeit one as altruistic as Doc Ferguson) for her recovery is more than a little annoying and reinforces the male saviour myth more than highlighting the resilience of women. Still it was 1950 and we should be grateful for women like Ida Lupino who told women's stories in such an effective way in an age when a woman director was both a novelty and a threat. Not her best film, Outrage remains a significant achievement for Lupino and a maturing of her film craft.",3.0

"Twenty-second movie in 52 films by women 2019.
For a movie about rape that never says the word because of the Hays code, the first half of this feels like it has aged shockingly well for the most part, the second half has some more issues, but overall this is still pretty remarkable.
The movie opens with a scene in which someone aggressively hits on our heroine, Ann, and she’s clearly uncomfortable, setting up a spectrum on which this behavior and rape both exist instead of making rape something outside the bounds of comprehension and a stand-alone terrible act, especially as this man is then the rapist. It’s also surprisingly that the rapist is someone who knows Ann as opposed to a stranger thereby not perpetuating the ""stranger in the alley"" myth. The movie also addresses the stigma of being a survivor which is somewhat incredible considering that when this came out blaming the victim was the norm. And finally, and what seems to be the main goal of the movie, its treatment of her PTSD and placing us in her subjective experience.
On that note of Ann's subjective experience, the most remarkable sequence in the movie is the extended chase sequence. It goes on for almost five minutes, working to build our fear as an audience and to make us identify more with Ann and her fear as a man keeps calling out to her and chasing her.
There's also a very effective sequence later in the movie where a man starts by touching Ann’s hair and asking for a dance and gets progressively more aggressive as she tells him no, again setting up a spectrum of behavior like this and rape. The movie later plays this as acceptable behavior in its narrative, but I think the subjective experience of watching it, as we literally see him through Ann's eyes for some of this, is so emotionally powerful that it still hits home as a point on men's disregard for women's bodies and wishes.
There’s definitely still some cringey stuff here, like a character who is helping Ann saying “you’re so innocent” as a good and not all all patronizing thing. Though I guess when the movie is teaching its audience a lesson things like that make more sense. And oh boy does it get teachy/preachy at the end, and that preaching hasn’t aged too well on multiple fronts.
But overall this is a pretty incredible movie for the way it places the audience in Ann's experience.
It's not my favorite of Lupino’s that I've seen, but it definitely feels like the most important.

When things turn to the men debating Ann's fate? To put it nicely, it's a product of her time. I don't think it means to come off this way, but there's a lot of ""shh, the men are talking"" going on during the finale.
Maybe if that second half had a little more oomph to it, rather than being a light romantic thing with just a few of the taught elements left over from the first half, it'd be considerably more watchable. As it is, Outrage is more a interesting historic movie moment than a movie I'd want to revisit.",2.5

"After staying late one night alone at work, Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is followed and sexually assaulted by a leering coffee cart employee. Opting to empathize with the character’s trauma, isolation and residual fear instead of focusing on the “whodunnit” angle, Lupino follows Ann as she flees from her family and fiance as she grasps for anything that might aide in her healing. Lupino’s intense story of victimhood and the fallout triggered by a traumatic event never finds its characters uttering the word “rape,” instead opting for censor-friendly euphemisms such as “criminal attack” and “assault.” Recently remembered and heralded by Richard Brody in The New Yorker as “prescient” and “a special artistic achievement,” Outrage asserts itself in the moody visual language of noir, lodging us firmly inside Ann’s brainspace with its ominous sonic punctuations.",4.0

Then she climbs into a truck and, wouldn't ya know it, she pushes the darn horn and, of course it gets stuck and gives away where she is again!! And at one point she hits a guy on the head with a wrench and it is implied that he nearly dies. I was expecting something more nuanced and believable from a woman director. I really can't go easy on these old films which are so terribly made when Sunset Boulevard came out in 1950 and it's one of the best films ever

"After a gorgeously typeset title sequence and an alternately charming and haunting first act that doesn't fuck around, Outrage spends its denouement indulging in tedious moral lectures. Benevolent dudes end up shepherding Ann to her ultimate absolution; meanwhile, she has less and less agency as her recovery progresses.
Making her savior a reverend is also a bit on the nose, as it just feels like an unsubtle signifier of his fundamental decency. It's also unclear that Ann's final outcome is a positive one: why should she look forward to reuniting with a fiancée who, the last time we see him, seems unable to understand or help her though her recovery?",3.5
"Um dos filmes iniciais da Ida como diretora abordando um tema corajoso, o estupro.
A cena em si é ao mesmo tempo paranoica, angustiante e estranha. Parece que vai virando uma cena de estupro conforme as coisas se desenrolam e não que se inicia assim.
Aborda um lado da questão que é a da sociedade, mas não a de pessoas mais próximas. O noivo, por exemplo, é visto positivamente quando naquela época e naquelas circunstâncias poderia é querer se afastar.
A fuga acaba gerando outra história que é de redenção através de um jovem reverendo.
A segunda cena de ""quase estupro"" também parece ser um flerte que a protagonista não sabe se livrar o que acaba agravando as coisas.
Esse assédio dos homens em algumas partes do filme hoje é visto de outra forma, mas na época não tinha essa visão negativa pelo visto.
A protagonista é meio canastrona mas cai bem como traumatizada e Ida conduz tudo tão bem que não atrapalha em nada.",4.0
"σχεδόν γλυκούλι πώς οι αρχές την πιστεύουν, ένας άντρας τη βοηθάει να το ξεπεράσει, δικαστής κι εισαγγελέας συμφωνούν να μη δικαστεί λόγω του ψυχικού τραύματος που υπέστη. γενικά victim blaming δεν υπάρχει πουθενά. αχ και να 'ξερες, Ida μου.",3.5
The outrage is Ida Lupino was ahead of her time but still able to be a female director in the early years of Hollywood.,4.0
"The most disturbing and engaging moments of this film come courtesy of code-era restrictions. When the rapist's hands are shown in the foreground rubbing around the inside and outside of a coffee cup it's as nauseating as the most graphic of contemporary scenes depicting rape. Ann and her fiancee's kiss is interrupted several times, the way their marriage and consummation will be after the attack--because Ann's not wrong about his doubts when he tries to rush their wedding along.
For its time especially, this film handles Ann's trauma sensitively. It is not a story of vengeance; the focus is on Ann, the way she feels as if she's on a stage she must leave. But her trauma follows her even as she begins to heal away from home with the aid of a kind reverend; despite her objections, a man continues to insist on a kiss (this is later treated like an overreaction on Ann's part due to her trauma, but is in fact more evidence of rape culture--all he wants is a kiss...why won't she comply?). My only real objection is the way the story seems to become the reverend's in the last act, and it's one step away from Magical Healing Cock territory.",4.0
"It was remarkable how the assault scene played out like something from a slasher movie. Think Laurie being pursued by Michael Myers through the streets, knocking on a door and having the light turned off.
It's a real shame that more women like Ida Lupino didn't get the opportunity to direct back then.
That being said, I wish the movie had focused more on the experience of trauma and the titular ""Outrage"" rather than being a cliched pastoral, playing on obvious fears of the city.",0.0

"Lupino ahead of her time as usual. She's a boss. Taking on rape and its orbiting issues of toxic masculinity (both malicious and ""benign"" forms) and the pervasive inability of society to understand the victim/survivor or prevent future occurrences would (still) be a daring move now, and Lupino did it 67 years ago!
Initially, the movie seemed to be treading this urban/rural dichotomy that the country is a safe haven from the perniciousness that *only* infects The City, that is until Lupino expertly detonates that notion. The pairing of WW2 vet-turned-preacher, who is implicitly dealing with his own PTSD, as the only one who can understand Ann was an unexpected but effective move I think.
Outrage doesn't totally transcend the norms of the time, nor its budget, but its one hell of a sock in the jaw of the patriarchy.",3.5

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ann (Mala Powers) is a newly engaged young woman who is raped on the way home from work. Shattered and scared, her recovery isn't aided by the fact that everyone in her small town judges her. As a result of this alienation, she runs away from home for the fear that she may be attacked again.
Initially for this task I had down Kate Woods' Aussie coming-of-age classic Looking for Alibrandi but I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere for the life of me. However, I think Ida Lupino's 1950 melodrama Outrage is a perfectly adequate substitute.
At first I was sceptical of the film's taboo subject matter and feared that it may be handled chastely, but rather I was shocked by how ahead of its time the film was. The film never suggests Ann is to blame for her attack or responsible for her PTSD. The constant air of threat that follows Ann after the rape is perfectly depicted by Lupino through the use of vocal flashbacks to show how she starts to blame herself for what happened. Ann can't function psychologically or socially the way she did before, whilst everyone around her doesn't seem to comprehend the magnitude of the trauma she's been through.
I was a little surprised however with where the film went narratively. I assumed that Ann would remain in her small town community being judged by her parents, fiancé, co-workers and friends whilst she tried to recover and subsequently assist the police in finding her attacker. Instead the film veers off into a form of road movie, with Ann changing her identity and finding solace working at an Orange orchard. It was refreshing to see that the ""relationship"" between Ann and the Rev. Bruce Ferguson (Tod Andrews) wasn't one of attraction but rather mutual understanding and sympathy.
Lupino was an incredible gifted filmmaker who was plagued to only direct B-grade second-bill features because of her gender. Her melodramatic and sentimentally empathetic style was a perfect fit for Outrage. Looking back at her repertoire in 2016, her films still seem as fresh and forward-thinking as they would have been in the 50's. It's such a shame that she wasn't given the chances back then to direct more superior films.",3.5
"Absolutely amazing how Lupino leads a film whose theme is a subject so controversial without so as not sensationalist , without moralizing speeches we see so much today. And those travelings....",5.0
"A remarkably hard and honest account of a woman's rape and its aftermath, especially given the time when it was made. It manages to hew to the melodramatic template of its era while engaging with the subject in a way which doesn't downplay the trauma.",4.5
"Ida Lupino director
Psycholgical noir.
Good for Ida for addressing the subject or rape. Way ahead of its time in subjects.
From TCM

In the documentary A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies (1995) the influential director singles out the films that best define the dark and menacing genre of film noir. Among them is Ida Lupino's Outrage (1950), a film that has none of the usual noir trappings of murder, gunplay and bank heists. It is, instead, a personal tale of one woman's attempts to cope with the psychological effects of having been raped. In Scorsese's words, the film is ""a subdued behavioral study that captures the banality of evil in an ordinary small town,"" not exactly how one normally defines noir.
But film noir is not characterized strictly by armed robbery and spousal murder. Its essence lies more in the psychological fabric of the story, and the visual techniques with which the story is told. And few films captured the post-WWII zeitgeist of noir more effectively than Outrage.
Working late to earn extra money for her upcoming marriage, Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is stalked one night by the proprietor of a snack wagon (Albert Mellen), whose previous efforts to flirt with Ann had been unsuccessful. Unable to identify her attacker, Ann attempts to resume a life of normalcy, but is unable to endure the curious stares of her neighbors and co-workers. Utterly alone in her psychological pain, she flees Capital City and wanders to an orange grove community. Finding temporary work as a fruit-packer, she befriends Bruce Ferguson (Tod Andrews), a soft-spoken minister who has suffered his own crises of faith, and who recognizes the need to delicately heal Ann's emotional wounds.
In some ways, Outrage clearly bears the earmarks of noir. The stalking sequence is filled with the angular compositions and encroaching shadows that define the genre's visual form, yet Lupino avoids some of the typical methods of generating suspense. Instead of burying the scene under an overwrought orchestral score, the scene is largely silent, which only compounds the tension. At first we hear Ann whistling pleasantly, absent-mindedly... but this is countered by the wolf-like whistle of the rapist, who taunts her from the shadows. The sexual predator at last corners his prey, and the assault occurs amid the nerve-grating drone of a truck horn that Ann accidentally jams during her attempted escape. When the camera cranes skyward to reveal an annoyed neighbor closing his window to block out the truck horn (and any sound of the rape along with it), the steadily-mounting tension of Outrage reaches its zenith.
Once Ann is attempting to start her life anew, there is very little attention paid to the search for the culprit. In some ways this is another diversion from the conventions of noir, which tend to focus upon the machinations of crime and punishment. But equally important to the genre is the psychological torment and confusion that cloud its characters' perspectives. Ann's inner turmoil is just as engrossing as any criminal investigation would be, and Lupino clearly wants to show that capturing the rapist would do little to ease Ann's pain and confusion, which is likely to linger well after the closing credits have run.
Lupino's unwillingness to conclude the film with a trite happy ending that magically restores its characters to normalcy is one of Outrage's many special achievements. But escaping the conventionality of screen drama was one of Lupino's ongoing objectives as a writer/producer/director.
Beginning her career as an actress, British-born and educated Lupino made her American screen debut in 1934. In the 1940s she became a contract player at Warner Bros. and was (perhaps appropriately) typecast as a smart dame who could hold her own opposite such legendary tough guys as Humphrey Bogart (High Sierra, 1941), Edward G. Robinson (The Sea Wolf, 1941) or George Raft (They Drive by Night, 1940). She was once called ""the poor man's Bette Davis"" because the roles she often played were initially offered to the tart-tongued A-list actress. But Lupino was not content to accept roles cast off by the Warner Bros. star. Lupino's refusal to accept certain roles caused the studio to suspend her contract as punishment.
Rather than remain idle or accept ill-suited roles, Lupino took control of her own career and formed a production company with husband Collier Young, producing films outside the studio system.
Lupino named her production company Emerald Productions, after her mother, Connie Emerald. Her ambition was to produce films that broached subjects generally avoided by the Hollywood mainstream. In addition to Outrage's careful treatment of rape, Lupino's films addressed such unconventional topics as bigamy (The Bigamist, 1953), unwed motherhood (Not Wanted, 1949), polio (Never Fear, 1949) and even the corruption of sports (Hard, Fast and Beautiful, 1951).
Because these films were produced outside the system, they lack some of the technical polish of the typical studio film. Lupino was reliant upon actors who had not yet been signed by the studios, so her films are largely populated with unknowns. Likewise, the director of Emerald's first film was Elmer Clifton, a veteran of silent movies who was making a living as director-for-hire on low-grade westerns (The Whispering Skull, 1944). Clifton fell ill early in the shoot and Lupino, to keep the production alive, stepped behind the camera. The company was renamed The Filmakers Inc. and the twenty-year career of an influential woman director was begun.
The slightly ragtag feel of Lupino's films, coupled with their often sensational subject matter, has caused Lupino (the director) to be recently dubbed ""Queen of the B's.""
The nickname Lupino preferred was a throwback to her Warner Bros. moniker: ""the poor man's Don Siegel."" Siegel (Dirty Harry, 1971) was a director of hard-boiled dramas and was known for his strong work ethic and no-nonsense visual style. The parallel is perhaps nowhere more evident than in Lupino's noir classic The Hitch-Hiker (1953). As years passed, Lupino became recognized as a remarkably versatile and efficient director, working on a variety of television programs including Gilligan's Island (1964), Bewitched (1964) and the Boris Karloff series Thriller (1960).

"Really quite daring for its time, and all the more striking because a woman directed it - in 1950. (No, that decade was not all poodle skirts and Ozzie and Harriet). As is the case with many ""issue"" films of the time, it can't resist a little speechifying, but its powerful and moving nonetheless. I'd first heard of it courtesy of Martin Scorese's a Personal Journey Through American Movies, which has provided me with many a fascinating discovery.",4.0

"Ida Lupino, oltre ad essere un'apprezzata e brava attrice
che lavorò con tutti i migliori di hollywood, fu anche una
notevole regista.
In questo caso indaga sugli sconquassi che può provocare
una violenza sessuale nell'inconscio di una ragazza che sta
per sposarsi.
Da antologia la scena dello stupro, di notte, tra vicoli deserti,
con un uso magistrale dei suoni(il bidone della spazzatura,il clacson impazzito del camion) e della progressione drammatica( e non per niente Martin Scorsese l'ha inserita nel suo Viaggio nel Cinema Americano).",3.5
